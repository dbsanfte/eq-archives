  in Unrest: <br>
  <a href="http://users.net1inc.net/mr_boffo/eqimages/Unrest.jpg">MAP</a><br>
  <br>
  Let's start with some assumptions: <br>
  1) All spawns are 19 min 40 sec apart. <br>
  2) Try to take on no more then two creatures at a time. <br>
  3) You have to be able to kill hags quickly, these are by far the deadliest 
  mob in Unrest. <br>
  4) Your party consists of at least a Warrior, Cleric, Wizard and at least one 
  of extra, preferably a Cleric, a Caster, or a Druid. <br>
  <br>
  Attached is a bitmap that contains a map with all the spawn points, the green 
  dot is where the spirit in Unrest (has Dwarven Work Boots!) spawns the green 
  line is the line that the mobs walk on when coming to you or retreating. <br>
  <br>
  The first thing you have to do get to the spirit at point 11. Most people think 
  that training the entire mob out and having your party run in is the best way 
  to do this, I have a different way and it gives you a chance to set the time 
  between spawns. <br>
  <br>
  Setting up of the basement begins once you get to point A. Try to clear all 
  creatures up to that point. Remember always target Hags first followed by mortuary 
  fungus. Once you have cleared up to point A. have your party med up and get 
  all healed up (you will have 19 min to do this so take your time). <br>
  <br>
  Once everyone is ready attack the creature at point 5, normally a hag, a GDB, 
  or a Fungus. Right away run down to point 6 and attack the creature there. Now 
  wait 2 min at point 6 medding. At this point you'll see 2 mobs on either side 
  of a pool of blood, Do not walk around the pool there are traps with fungus 
  in them. <br>
  <b><br>
  </b>Attack the mobs at point 7. And again wait 2 min and have your casters med 
  up. Then move down to point 8 and attack the mob there, wait at point 8 for 
  2 min. Move on to point 9 and kill the mob there. Retreat to point 8 and med 
  to full health, this will normally take about 8 to 10 min, Now you are ready 
  to take on the spirit. Attack the spirit at point 10, sometimes a TT will be 
  at point 11, be sure to stand with your back against the wall if the TT throws 
  you into the pit at point 13 you WILL die. <br>
  <br>
  Once you have killed the spirit kill the TT but try to melee it, you'll need 
  this battle to last about 2 min. If your party is up in health and mana take 
  on the TT on the ledge in the pit, have a caster cast a spell or have a warrior 
  shoot an arrow. <br>
  <br>
  Do not try to take on the pit at this time, wait till after the next spirit 
  spawn. You tend to have about 2 min between battles, have your tank run all 
  the way back to point A pulling whatever is there to point 11. If you can keep 
  your battles staggered to 2 min you will get a gap of 6 to 8 min before the 
  spirit spawn, this is a good time to try to take the pit out. It is a good idea 
  to clear the pit before the spirit spawns so when the TT spawns afterwards and 
  you get thrown into the pit you won't get nailed by 4 mobs. <br>
  <br>
  NOTES: <br>
  1 ) Always keep the path clear all the way back to point A, it will normally 
  take you this much time to kill the spirit once he starts retrieting. <br>
  2) Always know how long you have to the spirit spawn down to the min. <br>
  3) Order to attack things: Hags, Sprirt, Fungus, TT, GDB, Barbes, Bats, Monks. 
  <br>
  4) Sometimes a hag will spawn in place take this as an opportunity to clear 
  even further back to the stairs out of the basement. <br>
  5) Casters: Don't cast unless it's needed, with 2 min intervals you will need 
  the mana. When a hag spawns &quot;Open the can of Woop ass.&quot; <br>
  6) Clerics: Your primary responsibility is to keep the warriors alive. <br>
  7) Warriors: KILL KILL KILL. =)<br>

  the Froglock King Room With 3 People*</strong></a></font><font face="Times New Roman"
size="2" color="#000000"><br>
  <br>
  The 3 man group that I referred to consists of this:<br>
  <br>
  50 shaman +35 pet <br>
  50 shaman +35 pet <br>
  50 Druid <br>
  <br>
  Druid pulls with Ensnare on the closest mob to him. The king will come 9 times 
  out of 10. You will only get 3 mobs is the puller is remotely used to doing 
  the pulling (which at 50th level I would imagine he would have to be). 3 Frogs 
  will come out one being the king. You drag them to the room you cleared before 
  the king room. Root the king (Get one shaman to Togor insects the king and then 
  have the other shaman root the king) and kill the other 2 frogs, the Guk or 
  bok like stated in a previous thread. Use thorns and the dogs to soak all the 
  damage up. You may have to move the king around a bit. The person that Togor'd 
  the king will be the one getting pounded so if the king comes loose, run him 
  off a bit, root then return to the fight. Once both frogs are dead. Sick the 
  dogs on the king, and use your remaining mana to nuke/dot/heal as necessary. 
  <br>
  <br>
  After the king and his 2 friends are dead, you have only 2 frogs, likely both 
  shaman on ledges up left of the door and up right of the door going into the 
  kings room. They will both have pets (but they are weak) and if the Druid is 
  good at pulling, he can pull them separate. This room has an odd spawn time 
  so once you are done, I suggest trying to get the first 2 frogs you killed out 
  quick and do the room in a 2 frogs, king spot, then the 2 shaman staggered effect.<br>
  <br>
  I hope this all makes since, if not I am sorry, but it does work. Don't get 
  me wrong. Sometimes we have to GG out due to a bad pull, even when you know 
  what to do, it doesn't work out. But 3/4 times it will work like a charm, and 
  once it is split, you are home free. You have to keep the king room clean and 
  the only fear you have is of the frogs wandering into the now populated room 
  before the king (assuming you are not clearing that also). <br>

  <b><font size="3"><a name="sola"></a>*Solusek A*</font></b></font></p>

<p><small><font size="2">Having found Ferrik Bloodforge&#146;s treatise on Solusek 
  A I decided to venture to that remote dungeon myself. What a wonderful surprise, 
  I have enjoyed my time there immeasurably. I put pen to parchment now in the 
  hopes that others can benefit from my experiences. I have written much of this 
  from a Paladin&#146;s prospective. For this I do not apologize, for I am, after 
  a Paladin.</font></small></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>Greyfin&#146;s rules for Solusek A <br>
  </small></b><small><br>
  1. Don&#146;t fall into the lava <br>
  2. Don&#146;t forget rule 1 <br>
  3. Don&#146;t pull on the stairs. If you do you will eventually fall into the 
  lava and break rules 1, 2 and 6. <br>
  4. Know where the nearest zone to Sol B is. As strange as it sounds it&#146;s 
  a good place to escape to. Sure sometimes you die when trains collide, but that 
  is very rare. <br>
  5. Once down the stairs and inside the &quot;window room&quot; don&#146;t run 
  back up to the stairs to zone. Use the Sol B zone near the &quot;safe spot.&quot; 
  <br>
  6. Don&#146;t swim in the lava <br>
  7. NO RUNNERS: ensnare or root everything. <br>
  8. IF there is a runner, RUN, gate or die. Don&#146;t wait for the dam to break. 
  It already has you just can&#146;t see the wall of water about to fall on your 
  head. If you let a goblin escape you will see the gates of hell open up. Shout 
  TRAIN! and scoot. </small><br>
  <small>9. If it moves, kill it. Many of the NPC&#146;s wander around Sol A. 
  All the NPC&#146;s have place holders. If you&#146;re looking for any of these 
  you have to kill the wanderers.</small><br>
  <small>10. Don&#146;t cast Area Effect spells unless you know EXACTLY where 
  you are. I&#146;ve seen many a caster die because the employees of the Solusek 
  Mining Company are so short they weren&#146;t seen... <br>
  11. Always have batwings (see rules 1, 2 and 6) make sure everyone in your party 
  has one or two (the worst feeling in the world is when the guy with all the 
  batwings is at the bottom of the lava stream). <br>
  12. No one dies. Go slow, follow the rules and Rule 11 will rarely be broken. 
  </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small><b>About Lava</b>: Just about everyone has heard that 
  the lava at Sol A is bad. Because of this, often people do not want to go to 
  there. Well, I&#146;m here to tell you it&#146;s not that bad at all. 95% of 
  the BAD lava is in the first 10% of the dungeon. Go slowly, pull whatever is 
  on the stairs back to the top and no one should fall in. Falling into the lava 
  is a pain because you have to retrieve your corpse and only you can do it (others 
  can&#146;t do it because they can&#146;t target your corpse when it&#146;s in 
  lava. Well, not unless they want to go swimming to find it). IF you do fall 
  in, get as close as you can to the corner near the window (keep reading you'll 
  understand soon). I&#146;ve seen people drag their body from the path/stairs 
  when they died in this area. If you don&#146;t get lucky you will have to levitate 
  and drag you corpse either back onto the path or further on you will eventually 
  find some stone where you can bring your body. I would suggest you just getting 
  back onto the path. <br>
  <br>
  Now sometimes Levitate doesn&#146;t float you high enough to get back on the 
  path. This can happen for 2 reasons: you follow the lava stream to a pathway 
  that leads down and the roof will force you down and sometimes levitate will 
  drop you below the path, but above the lava for no reason. DO NOT FOLLOW THE 
  LAVA WHERE IT ENTERS THE TUNNEL (the one that leads down). Nothing good will 
  come of it. If your body is in the lava and you can&#146;t find it, don&#146;t 
  go here to look. It&#146;s not down there, the only way bodies get there is 
  if you drag it there, whatever you do NEVER DRAG YOUR BODY DOWN THIS TUNNEL. 
  IF you end up floating above the lava but too low to get back on the path for 
  no reason you can try and climb back up the wall (it works sometimes) or contact 
  a GM/Guide. I have had great success with asking guides and GM&#146;s for help 
  with this bug (they usually teleport me out, so loot your corpse before you 
  ask for help <br>
  <br>
  ONE TIME I fell into the lava and was able to successfully CLIMB THE WALL and 
  get out of the lava. I was never able to do it again and no one I know has done 
  it, but it&#146;s worth trying. Find the corner near the window room and try 
  and climb up, like you would a ladder. </small></font></p>
<i>
<p><font size="2"><small>&quot;The best way to avoid the initial lava is to go 
  in through Sol B. Enter Sol B and make all lefts that you can until you zone 
  into Sol A... With Sol B as heavily camped as it is there should be no problem 
  doing this.&quot; </small></font></p>

  <b>GETTING THERE</b>: Solusek&#146;s Eye, (Sol A) can be found in Lavastorm 
  Mountains (LS). It is often mistaken for Nagafen&#146;s Lair (Sol B). This causes 
  some confusion and the misperception that it is a very high level dungeon: it&#146;s 
  not as hard as you think. Sol B is an extremely difficult dungeon, don&#146;t 
  expect to go to Sol B till you&#146;re well into your 30&#146;s (and from what 
  I&#146;ve heard, you don&#146;t need to leave before 50). Now don&#146;t get 
  me wrong, Sol A is not easy; I&#146;ve seen parties in there high 30&#146;s 
  have trouble there. I&#146;m just saying a lot of people come too late. I got 
  there around level 23 and had great fun. In fact, it&#146;s a much harder dungeon 
  after level 27; now you have to fight your way past annoying greens to get experience. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>THE LOOT: </b>I found the experience and the loot to be greater than many 
  of the other areas people of my level were fighting in (Mistmoore, Unrest, Cazic 
  Thule, Permafrost and High Hold Keep) and certainly the train makes less stops 
  in Sol A then in MM, Unrest and CZ. The experience is great here. I will finish 
  this guide with some ideas about where to go to get the most experience, you 
  can skip there now, but it won&#146;t mean as much to you until you&#146;ve 
  read the whole guide. I love this dungeon. With everyone complaining about overcrowding, 
  I am constantly amazed at how few people are at Solusek A. With the recent invasion 
  of Splitpaw Solusek don&#146;t expect anything to change either (which is a 
  good thing, IMHO). I have included a quick reference at the end of this guide.</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>ON BINDING</small></b><small>: Freeport is the typical 
  binding point for melee types who can&#146;t get bound in Neriak. I suggest 
  binding in High Hold Pass. It&#146;s a little farther to run than Freeport, 
  but you can always get a Spirit of the Wolf and that is nice in the low 20&#146;s 
  when you&#146;re running though Nektulos Forest. Around level 27 I started binding 
  in Freeport. There was a rumor you could bind in the Solusek Temple (that would 
  have been nice) it&#146;s not true. </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>*** With the changes made to Kithicor Forest you may 
  want to skip High Hold Pass and just bind in Freeport.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small><br>
  <b>OF INTEREST</b>: Dwarves and, I heard a rumor, Erudites, are not KOS to the 
  Goblins in Sol A unless you have done something to lose faction with them (it 
  took me about 1 whole level to become KOS)&#133; I spent 2 days walking around 
  Sol A, learning my way around. Except for 4 mobs (2 of which are NPC&#146;s 
  there is nothing in Sol A that will bother a sight-seeing dwarf (so pack a lunch 
  and bring the kids). </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>*** There is a rumor that the Gnomish Vendor in the Castle 
  sells Melatite. It&#146;s not true. Like all vendors he sells it if another 
  Player sold it to him. And before people knew how to do the Armor of Ro quests 
  I&#146;m sure players sold it to him, not anymore. So don&#146;t get your hopes 
  up.**</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Invis doesn&#146;t work very well in Sol A as all the 
  spell casters and the gnomes can see invis. </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Killing Kobolds in Sol B will raise your faction with 
  Solusek Mining Company (but not the Ak&#146;anon faction). A useful thing to 
  know if you&#146;re an evil race (since you&#146;re KOS to the Mining Company 
  otherwise) or anyone who plans to camp the employees of the Solusek Mining Company 
  and their mechanicals. This isn&#146;t really an option before level 30, although 
  I did venture down here and take swings at some kobolds when I was in my 20&#146;s, 
  but only when others were actually fighting them. I still haven&#146;t raised 
  my faction above indifferent.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>*** Paladins can solo here from lvl22 - 27 (after 27 
  you stop getting exp)... It's not great but since we rarely get to solo anything 
  it's fun for a change and this is better than running somewhere else to fight... 
  Pull to the Sol B room and root when the goblins get near 40%... Even if they 
  do run you should have time to catch them, if you don't they'll train, but you'll 
  have time to zone to Sol B. I&#146;ve solo&#146;d the Predator room and the 
  Foreman rooms at level 31, but I wouldn&#146;t recommend it until you learn 
  the zone very well (or after level 35)</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small><br>
  <b>THE SAFE AREA</b>: Ferrick identified 2 areas in Sol A, the Goblin Stronghold 
  and the Gnome Castle. The only thing I will do is add another area, I call it 
  the safe area. It&#146;s &quot;safe&quot; because because nothing spawns on 
  this side of Sol A. Unless someone pulls/trains something, you will not see 
  any Goblins here. There is also a relatively safe zone to Sol B here, for escape 
  purposes. The safe area is good place to rest, meditate and even camp. It&#146;s 
  also a useful reference point (&quot;meet you in the safe area&quot;). Getting 
  there is very easy. After zoning in you will see some stairs. At the midway 
  point you will find a window (some call it a crack). This room and the one that 
  adjoins it I call the window room. The window room has 2 exits: one leading 
  back to the stairs (I never bother with this exit, using the window instead) 
  and one that leads to a ledge (I will come back here a lot, when I say &quot;the 
  ledge&quot; I mean here). At the ledge, if you take a right, you will enter 
  a hallway that opens up to a path leading down and a bridge that dead-ends into 
  the wall. This is the safe area. Continuing down the ramp, you come to a room 
  and a short hall to the Sol B zone. I refer to this room simply as the Sol B 
  room (for obvious reasons). </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Back to the ledge, there is a door straight ahead of 
  you in a small pit-like area (jump or take the stairs). It leads to the Goblin 
  Stronghold. This is where you will find the Goblin King, the Goblin Bartender, 
  the Goblin Drunkard (who new they drank so much?) the Goblin High Shaman and 
  the Infernal Torturer. Solusek Goblins (the toughest kind there is in Solusek 
  &#150; go figure) can only be found in the stronghold. </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>The Castle area is where the employees of the Solusek 
  Mining Company live. This does not mean there are no Goblins in the &quot;Castle 
  area.&quot; They just don&#146;t live in the Castle-proper. In fact, there are 
  as many goblins living in this area as in the Stronghold. In the Castle area 
  you will find some very nice NPC&#146;s: Kindle, Singe, the Goblin Foreman, 
  the Kobold Predator, the Goblin Captain, The Clockwork EXG, Gabbie Mardoddle, 
  Reckless Efreeti (I&#146;ll include their drops when I talk about where to find 
  them), Captain Bipnipple and the Lava Elemental.</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>KOBOLD PREDATOR AND THE GOBLIN FOREMAN</small></b><small>: 
  From the ledge (you&#146;re facing the doorway to the Goblin Stronghold), turning 
  left you will see some Goblins (at least 2, but very often there is a wandering 
  goblin there as well). There is a hallway to the left. This is the &quot;hard 
  way&quot; to the<b> </b>Predator room as you will have to fight about 12-15 
  goblins to get here, but if you&#146;re with evil races you have to go this 
  way as they are KOS to the employees of the Solusek Mining Company. Take it, 
  continuing straight over the bridge (more lava). Eventually you will come to 
  a hallway leading to the left. At the end of this hall you come to a door. The 
  <b>Kobold Predator </b>is often behind this door (he wanders up and down the 
  hall). Like most of the spawns in Sol A the Predator is roughly a 20 minute 
  spawn. But he has place-holders, I&#146;ve seen him spawn twice in a 6 hour 
  stretch and 4 times in a row another time. The Predator drops Kobold-Hide Boots 
  (AC5 +3 AGI +10 HP) and the rare Obsidian Shard (6 dmg 25 dly Effect: Obsidian 
  Shatter &#150; 30 point Direct Damage AND reduces AC by about 30 points, a very 
  nice spell).</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>**Note: I&#146;ve been told that Obsidian Shatter is 
  a fire based spell and as such is not very useful in Sol A as the goblins there 
  have high fire resistance (go figure).** </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>You&#146;ll have to fight your way to hallway (unless 
  you get lucky with invis and there are no casters on the path.) Once you get 
  to hall you can rest (don&#146;t sit too close to the doorways). The nice thing 
  is the hall is safe as only 1 MOB will venture in here. The good news is that 
  mob is the Predator or his placeholder, a goblin. Either way kill anything you 
  see in this hall. Open the door and you will be on a landing at the top of some 
  stairs. The Predator spawns on this landing. Kill whatever is here. The nice 
  thing is you will not agro the 2 goblins in the room below. When you&#146;re 
  done go down and clear the other 2 goblins. There is one exit (other than the 
  one you came in) in this room. Through that door there are 3 goblins in here. 
  The one in the middle is the <b>Goblin Foreman</b> (behind the well-like structure). 
  He drops the Foreman Tunic (10AC 0 weight +3 STR +3 WIS) or the Obsidian Scimitar 
  (6 dmg 27 dly +6 AGI). Like most of the spawns in Sol A, his is roughly a 20 
  mins spawn. But he has place-holders, I&#146;ve seen him spawn twice in a 6 
  hour stretch and 4 times in a row another time.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>A full group of mid-20&#146;s can handle both these rooms. 
  Around level 27 I could handle both rooms with 2 other people. At 30 I could 
  handle the Predator room by myself. (it&#146;s very hard to break up the Foreman 
  room solo, but I&#146;ve done it. I wouldn&#146;t suggest it till you know what 
  you&#146;re doing. In the back of the Foreman room is a secret door. The hallway 
  behind here is very safe. Goblins don&#146;t wander through here unless pulled. 
  </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Now, the easy way into the Foreman/Predator rooms. Go 
  back to the ledge take a left again, but this time keep going. There&#146;s 
  a small alcove with 2 goblins fairly close, continue on. You will come to another 
  small alcove with your first Gnome Mechanical in it. Don&#146;t fight him unless 
  your in your 30&#146;s, have a good group and don&#146;t mind the faction hits. 
  From the alcove there is a sharp (very easy to miss) left that leads to an L-shaped 
  bridge (more lava). Go across. When you reach the end of the bridge, stop. There 
  is a hallway to your left (again, VERY easy to miss) take it. You will pass 
  a doorway and go up some small steps, when you come to a charred section of 
  the wall on your right (same wall the door was on) stop. This charred section 
  is actually a secret door, go through it. You are now in the secret hallway 
  that leads to the Foreman room. Go forward and take your first left, then right, 
  then left again and you should be looking at a another secret doorway (you can 
  tell by the small holes in the surface, if you see them &#150; they&#146;re 
  usually more visible from the back side). Well, we&#146;re back to the secret 
  door to the Goblin Foreman room.</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>SINGE AND KINDLE</small></b><small>: Two NPC&#146;s, 
  they fly around the Castle area (never venturing into the castle-proper). Like 
  all the other NPC&#146;s in Sol A they have place-holders. My best advice is 
  whack any wondering goblin you see (rule #9). They were blue to me at 27, but 
  hit hard (IMHO Singe hits harder). They wander all over the castle area. <b>Singe</b>, 
  a Fire Drake, sometimes goes as far as the ledge over by the Stronghold. Singe 
  commonly drops the Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 +3 AGI +3 INT &#150; I&#146;ve traded 
  them to spell-casters for some very nice items) and rarely the Drake Scale Belt 
  (AC5 +3 DEX +10 vs Fire &#150; spell-casters love em). Personally I&#146;ve 
  killed Singe a dozen times and I&#146;ve never seen the belt, so I&#146;m starting 
  to have my doubts. Maybe it&#146;s a myth. <b>Kindle</b>, a Fire Imp, I see 
  much less frequently. I don&#146;t know why maybe I&#146;m unlucky. Some other 
  possibilities: he makes less noise than Singe (who&#146;s screach can be heard 
  a good distance away) so people aren&#146;t, so apt to no he&#146;s around , 
  he roams less or people tend to kill his place-holder less often. Kindle&#146;s 
  drop is either the boring Obsidian Ring (AC3 +3 DEX +10 HP) or the Imp Skin 
  Gloves (AC2 +5 INT +10 Mana &#150; spell-casters love em).</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Back to the secret hall behind the Foreman room. If you&#146;re 
  facing the room, there is a hall that branches off to your right. Follow this 
  and you will come to another secret door, you will enter a room with 3 doors 
  and 2-3 goblins. These goblins are nastier (flame, fire and inferno) than the 
  ones you&#146;ve seen so fare, so be prepared for a fight. I&#146;m told that 
  Singe spawns in this room. I have never seen him in this room, but that&#146;s 
  the legend. The door to the left leads to a Sol B zone B (a very useful escape 
  route! &#150; see rule 5). The door straight ahead is the one we want. Open 
  the door and move forward. There are 3 (maybe 2?) goblins in this area, if you 
  follow the left wall you will find another zone to Sol B (a very useful escape 
  route! &#150; see rule 5). IF you go through the door, walk forward a bit and 
  turn around you will see an exit to your left (it&#146;s, very easy to miss). 
  You will see some stairs up and a tunnel entrance. There is one goblin in the 
  corner of this area and another on top of the stairs on the ledge. Most times, 
  if I was lucky enough to find him, I found Singe on this ledge.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>If you go into the tunnel you will sometimes run into 
  Kindle. It&#146;s a dangerous place as there are many goblins down here. Since 
  Kindle likes to wander, I really wouldn&#146;t recommend it going down here 
  to hunt him unless you really know what you&#146;re doing or have good faction 
  with the Goblins. Back to the ledge where we hopefully find Singe&#133; There&#146;s 
  a door on this ledge, go in. You&#146;re now in a short hallway go through the 
  next door. You will find yourself into a room with a table and a 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  door in the far wall. IF you go to the right hand corner you will find a secret 
  door. This leads down to a pit where the Reckless Efreeti Spawns</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>The Reckless Efreeti</small></b><small>: My favorite 
  Graphic in the game, to date (I love the laugh too). He drops two very nice 
  items: Platinum Armbands (0 AC +3 WIS +3 STR &#150; druids love em, as will 
  your occasional High Elf Cleric) and the rare Obsidian Flamberge (20 dmg 50 
  dly effect: Obsidian Shatter PAL WAR SK 2H Sword - No Drop/Lore). Not as good 
  as the Gigantic Zweihander, but it&#146;s a nice 2-handed weapon, especially 
  since practically no one has heard of it). He has company, 2 Blazings Elementals, 
  around their mid-20&#146;s they are aggro to everyone. This includes those lucky 
  Dwarves and Erudites who have been walking around Sol A without a care in the 
  world&#133; I haven&#146;t made up my mind if the Efreeti is aggro or not. Sometimes, 
  he just sits there, sometimes, he attacks. His spawn rate is not the typical 
  20 minutes. Ferrick stated that he missed a round, putting him on a 40 minute 
  spawn cycle, but whenever I timed his spawn, it seemed a little more random 
  (between 35 and 55 mins). Like all the other spawns in Sol A has a place-holder, 
  another Blazing elemental.</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>The Goblin Captain</small></b><small>: The Captain 
  is very close to the Efreeti. But be warned it&#146;s a very difficult pull. 
  Go back up the ramp out of the Efreeti pit and into the room with the table. 
  Take the door to your right (the one you haven&#146;t used yet). You&#146;ll 
  come into a room with 2 more Goblins and a fireplace in it. This is a pretty 
  good place to set up base camp. Kindle will wander right through this room and 
  you&#146;re close enough to pull from the Captain&#146;s room and the Efreeti 
  pit. There&#146;s another door on the other side of the fireplace. Take that 
  door, you&#146;re now in a short hall. Open the door at the end you will see 
  a room with 3 doors, there are 2 goblins guarding the middle door. This is the 
  Captain&#146;s room. Pulling is difficult because you can&#146;t pull only those 
  2. When you pull either of them, you will pull 2-4 more. 2 or 3 from the Captain&#146;s 
  room plus there&#146;s usually a lurker behind the left door who will come, 
  too. So now you have to fight 5 or 6 goblins. During the fight one of the of 
  the spawns in the fireplace rooms will pop up and sometimes kindle (or his placeholder) 
  will wander in. Compound that with the Goblins proclivity to run and you have 
  all the makings for a disaster. Think: ENCHANTER or BARD&#133; Once you&#146;ve 
  broken the spawn it&#146;s much easier of course. It&#146;s worth it because 
  the Captain drops two very nice items: Charred Boots are common (AC6 +3 AGI 
  +5 vs Fire and Poison) and Charred Gauntlets (AC7 +3 DEX +5 INT) rare. When 
  you consider how few good gloves and boots there are (I got my snakeskin gloves 
  at level 10) then you&#146;ll realize how truly special the Captain is.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>By my count, for gloves there are 4 choices after snakeskin: 
  plate (steel or bronze), Charred, Ro or Darkmail. Boots are worse, plate, Dwarven 
  workboots or Ro. Considering that he ALWAYS drops boots or gloves and that a 
  party in their high 20&#146;s to low 30&#146;s I don&#146;t understand why he 
  isn&#146;t camped far more often. I was offered 2000pp in trade for my gloves 
  (2 foreman tunic &#150;800, 2 kobold boots -400, 2 obsidian hoops -500 and chitin 
  greaves-300).</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>I have not met anyone who has seen charred leggings or 
  charred bracers. Ferrick reported that he had heard rumors that they were available. 
  It would be fairly sweet to find.</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>MINING MELATITE</small></b><small>:<i> </i>Now the 
  question all the Paladins (and Shadowknights and Rangers to a lesser degree) 
  will want answered: what drops Melatite? I have been told models MB, MC, and 
  XC, XB and the minors drop Melatite. No one seems to know. The best answer is 
  to kill as many employees and mechanicals of the Solusek Mining Company as possible 
  (verant really doesn&#146;t want us to roleplay do they?). It&#146;s very rare, 
  so don&#146;t expect to get much. Camping Gabbie, Captain and the EXG while 
  trying to get Melatite makes the most sense. A few things to note. I have heard 
  rumors that melatite drops more often outside the Castle proper (near the &quot;L-bridge&quot; 
  but I have my doubts. Also, killing the gnomish minors gives you a much bigger 
  faction hit than killing the mechanicals. I would avoid killing the minors and 
  conjurers if I could<i>.</i></small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>To get to the Gnome Castle and find Melatite. Backtracking 
  to the L-bridge, go over the bridge and continue on, you&#146;ll come to a swinging 
  pendulum (its only for looks, it won&#146;t actually hurt you). Keep going and 
  you will come to a larger room with a large pool of lava. Follow the path to 
  the left and you will see the Castle. You will have to jump into and swim (you&#146;re 
  given a waiver for rule # 6 this one time) a very small section of lava. If 
  you do this quickly you won&#146;t even take the usual 40 points of lava damage. 
  It&#146;s not really dangerous, but it&#146;s fun to watch people do for the 
  first time.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>After you negotiate the lava (the first time you&#146;ll 
  be breathing kinda hard, but it wasn&#146;t that bad, was it?) you will come 
  to two drawbridges. The one on the right is the one we want. The left leads 
  you to the doorway back by the secret door that leads to the Goblin Foreman 
  room. I have not met anyone who has found anything particularly noteworthy on 
  this side of the Castle. </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Inside the castle is essentially one long hallway. Follow 
  the hall until you come to a set of steps going down. Keep walking (well run 
  &#150; does anyone walk in Norrath?) we&#146;ll come back later. Eventually 
  the hall dead-ends at an opening with some lava. Across which you can see another 
  drawbridge. There is a secret room (closet more like) with a lever a little 
  bit behind you. It&#146;s hard to see, just turn around and run along the right 
  wall and you will run into it. Over the drawbridge are more Gnomes and their 
  mechanical friends. It&#146;s a hard place to describe and I&#146;m not going 
  to try. There are 4 secret doors in this area. They all lead to the same room. 
  Inside there are 6 Gnomes, one of them is a wanderer. The wandering Gnome is 
  the placeholder for <b>the Lava Elemental</b> (drops the Runed Lava Pendant, 
  5AC +5Str +5 Fire, I&#146;ve been told his common drop is a healing potion, 
  I have yet to confirm this). This room is tough. When you attack any of the 
  gnomes they will all attack you. I think they will attack you if you attack 
  the Lava Elemental (I think he&#146;s aggro). I&#146;ve been told level 50 players 
  get experience from the Elemental, so beware. The Runed Lava Pendant is pretty 
  darn nice.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Going back down the hall to the stairs, go down. At the 
  bottom you will find a button and a door. To open the door you push the button. 
  It locks behind you so don&#146;t go in unless you want to. You go through a 
  hall, a door and are in a small courtyard with a reddish tint. There is a secret 
  room in here with a button on the wall. It opens the door that locked behind 
  you&#133; When you leave the courtyard you now find yourself in a small hallway 
  with 2 doors and a portcullis. The first door has the Gnomish Vendor. He sells 
  the Bag of the Tinkerers. It sells for around between 5250 and 7000pp. Buy me 
  one, OK? I use him to sell FS and other goodies. People in Sol B use him too. 
  I have found some very nice items for sale here (like medium Bronze Tunics and 
  a Savant Cap.) Buying an item is a good way to get rid of excess copper silver 
  and gold. Or you can just leave monk droppings all over the place, but I hate 
  a messy dungeon. If only he sold food and drink (the gypsy camp in Lava Storm 
  is the closest place I know for that). When he stops selling to you it&#146;s 
  time to go back to Sol B and whack Kobolds.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>The next door is where <b>Gabbie Mardoddle</b> spawns. 
  Gabbie&#146;s rare drop is the uber-rare, Molten Cloak (4AC +4 WIS and INT &#150; 
  watch the spell-casters drool). Gabbie&#146;s common drop is the Mithril Quill, 
  a 4 dmg 19 dly +20 HP piercing weapon (wow! /em dripping sarcasm). She spawns 
  behind the desk. Gabbie is a caster and can do a TON of damage in a small amount 
  of time. There are 2 other Gnomes in the room with her. They will attack when 
  you start attacking Gabbie (or the place-holder) so be prepared for a fight. 
  If she has the quill you will see it. It looks like a dagger&#133; <b>Captain 
  Bipnipple</b>, or his place-holder, will wander in and stand next to Gabbie. 
  He&#146;ll join in the fray as well, so I advice you kill him first. You can 
  find a few spots to fight him while he&#146;s alone fairly easily (like the 
  courtyard with the reddish tint) if you follow him. Captain Bipnipple drops 
  the Gnomish Environmental suit (not sure what the other drop is). </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>There&#146;s one more NPC to camp while your mining for 
  Melatite: the <b>Clockwork Model EXG</b>. She drops the Charred Guardian Shield 
  (10AC +9 WIS &#150; druids and clerics love it) as her common drop and the Charred 
  Guardian Breastplate (16AC +3 STR +6 STA - LORE ITEM &#150; looks great too) 
  is the rare drop (which is fine since the shield is so much more valuable). 
  The EXG is a large female mechanical. You can see the shield if she has it. 
  To find her go through the portcullis outside Gabbie&#146;s room. You are in 
  a big courtyard at the front of the Castle, now. There&#146;s only one path, 
  follow it. Continue cross two bridges (more lava). After the second bridge you&#146;ll 
  come to a small room with 2 mechanicals. The EXG wanders between the portcullis 
  this room (she and her place-holders are the only employees that wander in this 
  area). She&#146;s very touch to kill, being 100% resistant to magic (you can 
  cast cancel magic on her). Nearby Gnomish Conjurer&#146;s will buff and heal 
  her, so find a nice secluded place to fight and tell your casters to med. I&#146;ve 
  killed her twice, a couple of healers and a couple of tanks can take her down 
  around level 30. Like most of the mobs in Sol A she has a 20 minute spawn cycle 
  and has place holders (the ones that wander along her path). </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>This is the end of the Gnome area. Continuing past that 
  room with 2 gnome mechanicals that the EXG wanders to and you&#146;ll go up 
  some stairs (it turns left) and eventually the hall will end. You have to take 
  a left or right here. (if you look to your right you will see some nasty looking 
  spikes (like the swinging pendulum it doesn&#146;t hurt, it&#146;s just for 
  looks) you will also see Goblins again. </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>If you take the right, towards the there is a doorway 
  to your left BEFORE you get to the spikes, TAKE IT. If you continue on there 
  are two traps past the spikes that drop you into the pit with the blazing elementals 
  and the Reckless Efreeti. I only had to do that once to learn, I never go past 
  the spikes now. You will find yourself on a ledge with a door and a single goblin. 
  This is the door/ledge that leads to the Reckless Efreeti (the one you find 
  Singe on a lot). </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Well that&#146;s a full circle. Time to go explore the 
  Goblin Stronghold.</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>THE STRONGHOLD</small></b><small>: OK, you&#146;ve 
  explored the rest of the Goblin areas around the castle. You&#146;ve gotten 
  a few good items (probably a Foreman&#146;s tunics at least) and you&#146;re 
  ready to go fight the Goblins on their home ground. Be warned the goblins in 
  the Stronghold are tougher. There are very few Youngs and Cinders. If you venture 
  in far enough you will see Solusek Goblins, and these guys are nasty, especially 
  the casters. So, go back to the ledge. In front of you is a small pit-like area. 
  Take the stairs or jump down. The door in front of you is the entrance to the 
  Stronghold. Enter and you will be in a short hall with a door at the end. Go 
  through and you will find yourself in a room with a portcullis there are 4 goblins 
  in here, 2 near the door and 2 behind the portcullis. You will usually have 
  to fight all 4 in the same pull. After the portcullis there are 2 doors, one 
  on the left and one on the right. Take the left one. (if you find a secret door 
  that leads back to the ledge, turn around, I didn&#146;t mean that one, you 
  have to go through the portcullis before you take the left).</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>Drunkedness in the Stronghold: </small></b><small>I 
  had never heard that Goblins were big drinkers&#133; The bar is very popular 
  with players, certainly. The <b>Goblin Bartender</b> drops Drakeskin arms (rare) 
  and Drakeskin leggings (Enchanters love the leggings: AC5 +5 DEX +5 CHA). Getting 
  there is a bit of risk. Go straight you will go up some stairs and eventually 
  come to a door. The bar is behind that door. There will be several goblins on 
  the stairs getting to the bar. I always pull them back to the portcullis room. 
  When you get to bar there are 3 goblins there. The bartender spawns behind the 
  bar (gasp!). There are two rooms off of the bar. The one to the left (when you 
  enter the bar) is a storeroom. There are 3 goblins here. To the right there 
  is another room with 2 small rooms adjoining it. These rooms have pallets and 
  appear to be where the goblins go to sleep it off. One of these side rooms is 
  where the <b>Goblin Drunkard </b>spawns. I think it&#146;s the room in the back. 
  I cannot confirm this, as I have never seen the Drunkard. Close by is the <b>High 
  Goblin Shaman. </b>I understand that he drops the (Glowing Stone Band: +2 AC. 
  Serpent Sight) as his common drop. Considering all the people who are up in 
  arms about the loss of DE vision with the loss of the Mask of the Deceiver I 
  am very surprised that this item in not more heavily camped. Being a Dwarf I 
  have no basis of comparison here. But if you want infravision here it is. His 
  other drop I have been told is a Platinum Totem. No idea what it does.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Finding the high shaman is not easy. Much of the Stronghold 
  is maze of confusing turns and corridors. I&#146;ll try and give directions, 
  but don&#146;t blame me if you get lost. Starting at the portcullis in the Goblin 
  Stronghold, go through and take the door on left (towards the bar). Halfway 
  up stairs, turn right and go through that door. There are 2 spawns in this room. 
  Take the door ahead of you (not the one on the right). Follow the hall, it turns 
  left. At the end of hall, past one door on right with one gob in, turn right. 
  Go all way to end of hall (there are two rooms in this hall with one spawn in 
  each), at the end of hall there should be a red devil head. The door on right 
  of head opens into a room with 1 goblin. There is 1 door leading out of this 
  room, to a corridor, there&#146;s 1 door directly opposite. Down and to the 
  left there's a door. This goes into a small room with lots of books around the 
  wall. There are 3 spawn points to the left of the door. This is the Shaman&#146;s 
  room. </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>*** QUEST INFO *** There is a new NPC in Sol A, <b>Lynada</b>, 
  a Dark Elf mage. She may, or may not, have replaced the Shaman. Apparently she 
  is part of some new quest (drops the sparkle-purse that <b>Kizdean<font FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"> 
  </font>Gix</b> in West Commons used to have). You can hear her casting when 
  you&#146;re at the bar. If you figure out what the sparkle purse is for let 
  us know, it appears to be part of a paladin quest (dare I say it&#133; No, won&#146;t 
  jinx it). Why do I think it is part of a paladin&#146;s quest? Because of the 
  appearance of the &quot;Sparkling Saphire&quot; &#150; NO DROP - LORE - PAL 
  ONLY All races &#150; at <b>Noresa Sparkle&#146;s</b>, a gem merchant in West 
  Commons&#133; Lynada is in the center of this room I have been told. She is 
  around level 28-32. <br>
  </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Back to the portcullis, if you take the right door the 
  hall turns left. There is a secret door here and you can continue forward. It 
  doesn&#146;t matter which way you go, straight or left, both eventually lead 
  you to the Goblin King. If you go through the secret door you take a left and 
  go down a long hall and come to a door. Open the door and you will be in a small 
  chamber with 2 others doors. The one on your left leads to a small bedroom, 
  the other leads to the throne room. Surprisingly the <b>Goblin King </b>spawns 
  in the bedroom. His majesty commonly drops the Ring of the Goblin Lords (AC4 
  +3 Int +3 Str). His rare drop is the Scepter of Flame (Damage 7, Delay 29, +15 
  Mana, +5 Fire and Magic), a nice weapon, but I was hoping for better. If you 
  don&#146;t use the secret door (meaning you took a left) you will go down a 
  shorter hall. There&#146;s a room on your left with the Goblin Merchant in it. 
  He doesn&#146;t drop anything memorable, but if you have good faction or can 
  sneak you can sell to him (he sells water and bandages as well). A little farther 
  the hall ends and you have 2 doors, left or right. The King is beyond the right 
  one. You will go through a small room with 2 goblins first and you&#146;ll be 
  back in the throne room.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Back out of the throne room and go to the hall with 2 
  doors (you took the right door). If you take the left door and then continue 
  to your right (there&#146;s a door there soon see some some jail cells. At the 
  end of the hall there&#146;s a door (not a cell), inside you will find the <b>Inferno 
  Goblin Torturer</b>. The few times I hunted him he dropped a Turquoise Eyepatch 
  (+2 Str +2 Int +2 Cha) which isn&#146;t that wonderful for melee types, but 
  enchanters seem to like them. Since I&#146;ve never seen him drop anything else, 
  I have to assume this is his common drops . I have yet to meet anyone who knows 
  what the rare drop is&#133; I plan to find out soon.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>There is a zone to Sol B in the stronghold, but it&#146;s 
  fairly deep and as I&#146;ve said navigating in the stronghold is pretty difficult, 
  so I&#146;m not going to try to lead you there.</small></font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b><small>STRATEGY</small></b><small>: Solusek A is a great 
  place for both loot and experience. If it is experience you crave, I would suggest 
  you head to the Stronghold as soon as possible. The loot is not as great, (you&#146;ll 
  still get mad amounts of Fine Steal, just not as many rare items). I have seen 
  some people get crazy experience there. Start in the portucullis room and pull 
  nearby goblins. Once you find you can handle that move on to the bar. After 
  that it&#146;s time to tackle the Solusek Goblins and the Goblin King. A small 
  well-organized group can utilize the secret hall and camp the Goblin king fairly 
  easily. Larger groups should camp the Throne room and pull there (IMHO). </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>There is less experience to be had on the other side 
  of the dungeon, but I think the great loot and fun is well worth it. I started 
  on the stairs (bad idea &#150; which I document &#150; see rules #3, #1, #2 
  and #6) and quickly moved to the goblins on the ledge (pulling them to the Sol 
  B room). When I could get good groups together we would move on to the Predator/Foreman 
  rooms. (I have made several camps of the bar, but I find those groups have to 
  be much more disciplined.) When that became easy we moved into the Reckless 
  Efreeti area. I found I was able to successfully solo the ledge goblins around 
  level 25 and the Predator room around level 30. I still have trouble with soloing 
  the Foreman room.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>A good group can camp the room above the Efreeti pit, 
  pulling the Efreeti, the Goblin Captain room and several surrounding rooms as 
  well. Be forewarned pulling the Captain&#146;s room usually results in 4 or 
  5 goblins (inferno&#146;s and fires).</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>At 31 I have several options. I can solo the Predator/Foreman 
  rooms. I can get a group to fight in the Captain/Kindle/Efreeti/Singe area. 
  With a good group I can mine for melatite among the gnomes. I do this by alternating 
  between Gabbie and the EXG. Or I can go after the Throne room and hunt Solusek 
  Goblins. The bar is another choice.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>Well, that pretty much covers the whole place. Good hunting 
  and if you find some charred leggings or bracers post something on the Paladin&#146;s 
  of Norrath and tell us how. Also, if you out anything more about <b>Lynada </b>let 
  us know.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>&quot;Another thing to note about the High shaman room, 
  is that the table blocks Line of Sight. So you can go into one corner (to the 
  left of the high shaman), and neither Lynada or the other spawn in the room 
  can see you&#133; You can do the same thing in the bar. If you fight the bartender 
  behind the bar, the other mobs will not assist (unless he moves past the end 
  of the bar).&quot; </small></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><small>I would like to thank Ferrik Bloodforge of Cazic Thule. 
  I found his guide to Solusek A, posted on the EQ Clerics (http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/). 
  Armed with his knowledge I ventured there and have never regretted one minute. 
  </small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>I would also like to thank all the Paladins of Norrath, 
  their insights, comments and experiences have helped me immeasurably in the 
  writing of this guide.</small></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><small>I have had many friends who have joined me in my journeys 
  through Solusek A. There are so many of you I couldn&#146;t possibly mention 
  you all. But I would like to single out Mordantyr, Mecbeth, Excaliber, Merrek 
  and all my brothers and sisters in the Vigilantes, thanks for the help. </small></font></p>
