the paladin's guild Kaladim and he will send you out to collect bone chips. Give him 4
bone chips (stacked will do). You will get experience, guild faction and some money. Note
that you must be given this quest to complete it. Players with low faction will not get
anything by giving him bone chips. you will increase faction with Clerics of Underfoot,
Kazon Stormhammer and Miners Guild 249. <br>
<br>
Healing: Nultal Malfoot in the cleric guild of Kaladim is willing to heal you for a price.
Tell him &quot;I need healing&quot; and he will demand 3gp If you pay, he casts healon you
and your faction goes up with ClericsOfUnderfoot, KazonStormhammer and MinersGuild249<br>
<br>
Aviak Chickens: It would appear that the aviaks have been defecating on the huge dwarf
statue over the entrance to Kaladim and the dwarf paladins are VERY upset about it. Bumle
Reminjar, in Underfoot Hall, will reward you for every 4 aviak chick talons you bring him.
You will increase faction with Clerics of Underfoot, Kazon Stormhammer, and Miners Guild
249.<br>

On the second floor of the Hogcaller Inn is a dwarf named Pandos Flintside, by feeding him
a single muffin you get a tiny bit of faction with the Clerics of Tunare (among others). I
fed him 120 muffins tonight, at 6cp each this is trivial cash. This brought my faction up
enough that the High Priest would deign to give me a low level quest, but not a high level
one. You can feed him 16 at a time (4 in each give slot).<br>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000000">1.) One easy way to raise 
  faction with all the 'bad groups' without losing faction to the good groups 
  is to do the inert potion quest in Erudin. <br>
  <br>
  In Erudin go to the top of the palace and look for an enchanter guildmaster 
  in the open area named Tereon (or something like that) hail him and he'll say 
  he is a scholor of enchantments and will ask what it is that you study. Reply 
  to his question with something like, &quot;I study enchantments&quot;. He'll 
  say excellent, please take this inert potion to salisan in the roots and herbs 
  shop. (Two floors down in the palace). Take the potion there, Salasin reveals 
  himself as a thief and says the real Salasin is outback. You'll gain faction 
  with corrupt qeynos guards, corrupt freeport guards, coalition of tradesfolk 
  and a few other groups. And you won't lose faction to any of the good groups.<br>
  <br>
  2.) Go under the bar at the docks to the underground tunnels*. Behind a door 
  there is a Dark Elf Rogue Guildmaster(GM) whose name is Nestral TGaza. Target 
  her and say &quot;Where is Janam and Rebby?&quot; or hail her to go thruogh 
  the entire quest. She will hand you a note(lore item). Take the note with you 
  and from the docks zone into West Freeport using the first zone(Should be on 
  your right). Once you zone into West Freeport, look for the Theater of the Tranquil 
  and The Ashen Order(Monk guildhouse) Rebby and Janam are right there sitting 
  under a tent next to a fire. Hand Rebby the note and you recieve &quot;experience&quot; 
  no factions and something called &quot;Rebby's whiskers&quot;. They are stackable 
  and NOT lore. Take this whisker to Nestral TGaza and you will recieve some cash 
  and most importantly better factions for the following: Coalition of Trade Folk, 
  Carson McCabe(Rogue), Corrupt Qeynos Guards, and the Freeport Militia. <br>

  <font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>*Neriak*<br>
  </b><br>
  </font><font SIZE="2" face="Times New Roman">Killing the halflings in nek forest 
  does *not* raise any neriak factions.&nbsp; The only faction it raises is the 
  orc faction in the commonlands. It also&nbsp; hurts numerous faction in Rivervale, 
  including the guards, merchants, and&nbsp; the mayor.<br>
  <br>
  So far, I have only found 3 ways to raise faction with neriak. One of those&nbsp; 
  ways is to give lightstones to a DE NPC in south ro, as part of the research&nbsp; 
  quest. This raises the guard factions for foreign quarter and commons, and&nbsp; 
  the merchant faction. She is part of the merchant faction in neriak,&nbsp; though, 
  so this probably isn't an option for good races. Second, you can&nbsp; give 
  red wine to the scribe in the library in 3rd gate (this is a small part&nbsp; 
  of the quest to find the tome of ages and get the oracle robe BTW) this&nbsp; 
  raises the same factions as above (dark bargainers, dread guard inner, dread&nbsp; 
  guard outer) but he is also part of the merchant faction, plus you have to&nbsp; 
  sneak through 2 zones in neriak to get to him.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, you can raise faction with the indigo brotherhood (the neriak&nbsp; 
  warrior guild) by killing elven slaves in crushbone. Only the elven slaves&nbsp; 
  give the faction, and the only faction that will get raised the the indigo&nbsp; 
  brotherhood, not any of the guards or merchants. <br>
  <br>
  You also take a BIG hit with all of the 'good' elven factions by killing&nbsp; 
  them, so do so at your own risk.<br>
  <br>
  Go to 3rd gate to the library. Find the Necro who is part of the Oracle quest. 
  Give him 4 red wines at a time. You will get faction with DreadGuardsOuter and 
  Inner as well as NeriakMerchants. <br>

  Residents*</strong></font></font><br>
  <br>
  As soon as you come out of Rivervale into Misty Thicket turn south and follow 
  the mountain.&nbsp; As you reach the corner of the zone there will be a house.&nbsp; 
  This is there Joogl Honeybugger is.&nbsp; He says his hand is [hurt] if you 
  hail him.&nbsp; If you ask him about hurt, he asks you to get him a bandage. 
  &nbsp; Give him bandagess in 4 stacks of 4. Your factions should skyrocket. 
  Faction with Merchants of Rivervale, Deep Pockets, Guardians of the Vale, and 
  Mayor Grubbin goes up. &nbsp; Faction with the Coalition of Tradefolk goes down.

  If you go by the dock in Toxx there is an NPC Necro there.&nbsp; Kill him.&nbsp; 
  He respawns every 6 minutes so kill him for a while and eventually you'll get

  <br>
  <font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Easiest place to 
  build steel warrior faction is in Freeport.&nbsp; You can giving the head of 
  the steel warriors Deathfist Legionare shoulder pads and Deathfist slashed belts(shoulderpads 
  come off Legionares in West commons and east comms and mistythicket, belts are 
  dropped by any deathfist except pawns and apprentices).&nbsp; Best place for 
  belts in West commons and East commons. Go to the west commons camp, follow 
  right wall from WC or left wall from kithkor(closer to kith) and you will find 
  a large camp of orcs. &nbsp; Plow threw it collecting belts as yougo.&nbsp; 
  Legionares con blue at level 18 so there usually easiest to get kills of and 
  newbies are thankful for it.&nbsp; The first camp in east commons spawns these 
  the most.&nbsp; When you turn in thebelts you gain steel warrior faction and 
  a few others whilelosing freeport militia faction.&nbsp; If you dont want to 
  drop below dubious you can turn the deathfist belts to a Captain in the freeport 
  militia hall, which raises militia faction but lowers paladins(priests of marr 
  are only ones that are even semi-difficult to raise and there not the guards).&nbsp; 
  You should hit amiable fairly quickly. Also you can kill D'Vinn in CrushBone.<br>

  </strong><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">1. Diseased 
  and rabid pelts - Turn in these pelts to one of the priestesses for some faction, 
  plat and for rabid grizzlies, an Endure Disease spell.<br>
  2. Putrid Skellies in South Karanas - Each Putrid skeleton killed gives some 
  faction. <br>
  3. Bone Chips - Hand Lashun Novashine two bone chips at a time for faction boost.<br>
  4. Blessed Oil quest - Deliver flask to Brother Estle. He sometimes gives a 
  return quest to one of the priestesses, which again can be turned into another 
  quest still (to Brother Hayle - have not finished that part yet)<br>
  5. Kizzie (Montop?) quest - Bring an ingredient back from Rivervale. I have 
  not done this yet, but delivery quests tend to be low increase/payoff.<br>
  <br>
  The gains from the above must be microscopic. I spent a goodly amount of time 
  on each of them yesterday and went from amiably<br>
  to amiably. <br>
  <br>
  6. Lord Grimrot - Ask Camlend Serbold about Lord Grimrot and he gets all excited. 
  But you need better faction than amiably to get the quest.<br>
  7. Bloodsabres - Ah, revenge. I spent a few levels in the Catacombs and managed 
  to anger quite a few of these jerks. Nobody I regularly adventure with even 
  knows about them. At 28 I made the mistake of trying to go there just to con 
  the first one you see. It diced me up good. I'm betting this would be some good 
  faction improvements if I can coerce a group to go with me. Killing Tomax and 
  Varsoon fall in this category but Tomax is so low and Varsoon is too rare to 
  find. Turning in their &quot;rat-shaped rings&quot; also will net some faction 
  (Tomax doesn't carry one).<br>
  8. Give lashon novastar 2 bonechips and he will cast minor healing on you and 
  also give you faction.He can usually be found in killing fields of qeynos telling 
  everyone to give up violence.<br>
  9.Go to Karanas and hunt bandits - I found a nice camp at -3500 -11000 or thereabouts 
  that had 5 in it. You collect these sashes (which are no drop) and take them 
  to the guy standing next to the shield merchant in front of the paladin guild. 
  I can't remember his name - but he is standing directly to the left of the shield 
  guy. Not only do you get a significant faction boost with BOTH the clerics of 
  Tunare and the Hall of Thunder, you get a random 1pp item and some cash. Took 
  me about 15 sashes or so to get from apprehensive to amiable - can't beat that 
  (you need about 30-35 to get from apprehenisve to kindly).<br>
