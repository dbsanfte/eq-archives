							Improvements to Calendar
							Friday, January 31, 2003 - 1:27:23 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I made a couple improvements to the calendar.&nbsp; I programmed it so when there is an item added to that date, it`s back color will be red and the date will be in yellow.&nbsp; This will allow you quickly see which dates have messages attached to it, reducing useless clicking to see if there is news or not.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also made the calendar control&nbsp; a bit bigger.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I didn`t get around to the Edit/Delete function for the calendar.&nbsp; I will get to that when i get time.. its not top priority right now to me.</P>
<P>I will continue to shrink my TODO list, and start working on a Roles based Security model.. this will allow different roles when logging in.. (GuildLeader, Officer, member) etc..&nbsp; It will also merge the admin account with a user account... </P>
<P>I haven`t seen that bug in about 15 hours now.. might be handled... hopefully it is.</P>
<P>Well... going to play some Shadowbane :)</P>

							Additions, fixes.. It`s 3:15AM I need sleep
							Thursday, January 30, 2003 - 3:05:42 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I made a few additions/fixes tonight..&nbsp;&nbsp; You can now manually add Alternates to a raid, make sure that you have the relevant check box `checked` when want to list alternates in the player listbox.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You can now manually add a player more than once (multiboxing or alternates on raids), if your guild allows that.&nbsp; Some guilds only give points once, no matter how many players the person is playing.. others allow points for each character.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I fixed a bug that allowed you to delete your root image directory.. well, it wasnt a bug, I forgot to set a check for it :)</P>
<P>You can again upload your profile pictues, I had it off to troubleshoot something else... It`s back on now.</P>
<P>I am a bit closer to finding the source of that bug that is locking up sites.&nbsp; You shouldn`t see any more error messages.. if the error happens you will still be sort of locked up.. just half the page will load..&nbsp; I will be emailed as soon as an error happens, so there is no need to email me.&nbsp; I am focusing all my time from tommorow on, on finding the source of this bug(s).. I honestly think its a few things that are causing it... </P>
<P>Well.. its 3:15am.... time to troll some message boards!</P>

							Filemanager ready for use
							Wednesday, January 29, 2003 - 2:08:29 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just deployed a file manager tool which will allow you to upload files to your guild`s directory.&nbsp; With this tool, you can upload pictures, delete pictures, create directories, delete directories, view pictures in your directory etc.&nbsp; After you log in as an administrator you will see the link in the top right corner of the screen "File Manager".&nbsp; When you click it, you will be taken to your guild`s directory.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is a help Icon that you can click to get more info on the tool.. it`s pretty straightforward to use but you might want to read the help before you use it.</P>
<P>BTW, use the Up link to navigate to the previous folder.. don`t use the back-forward buttons on your web-browser.&nbsp; If you do, you might have to click another page up, then go back to the File Manager.&nbsp; I know this will happen also if you keep hitting the Up button after you are at the main directory,&nbsp; I will look into fixing that when i get some time.&nbsp; Easy fix is to just click another page then back to the file manager... </P>
<P>For more info, read the help file..&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Tommorow, and probably the rest of the week, I will be working on getting to everything on my ToDo list.. fixing stuff you guys have reported/requested.&nbsp; I will also be working on my documentation, and also trying to fix that damn bug that I can`t seem to find.</P>

							Short Server downtime today
							Monday, January 27, 2003 - 10:37:15 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I will be bringing down the server today for an update.&nbsp; It will be sometime in the afternoon, and should last only 15 minutes max.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sorry for any inconvienience this might cause</P>

						<h2>
							Upload function added for player images + News Feed Plugin
							Sunday, January 26, 2003 - 5:19:54 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I enabled an image upload feature to the profile editor...&nbsp; Are you tired of my cheesy generic pictures that show up when you click on your profile?&nbsp; Well, upload your own then!&nbsp; I was hoping when I originally programmed that component that people would put their links to their character images, but I soon found out that people didnt have any resources to host their images.&nbsp; Whats more, they had trouble creating links even if they did have the space.</P>
<P>Now, if you want to have a personalized picture (recommended) you simply upload the image (in jpeg or gif format only) using the profile editor page.&nbsp; The utility will automatically upload the file after you select it, and it will create the link for you!&nbsp; Doesn`t get much easier than that.</P>
<P>I am going to start working on a console for administrators to delete/modify/add images.. players are allowed to upload 1 picture but the administrator will be able to batch upload, and link as many as they want (as long as they dont go over their limit, to be determined). </P>
<P>11:27 pm - Update:</P>
<P>There is a new plug-in available.&nbsp; You can plug in a newsfeed from Sony`s EQLive website.&nbsp; It`s a nice way to keep your members updated with the current happenings in Norath.&nbsp; The feed will update itself automatically as new news is released from Sony.</P>

						<h2>
							Auto add player done, auto update roster done!
							Sunday, January 26, 2003 - 2:57:36 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>&nbsp; I finished the auto add player based on /who list utility and figured I might as well go ahead and start on the update roster utility.&nbsp; So now you will be able to update your member`s&nbsp; Level, Race and Class based on a /who list that you paste into a text field.</P>
<P>To add new players from a who list, you log in as an administrator and click on the Add Player button.&nbsp; To access the update roster function, you log in as an administrator and go to the Player Roster page.. you will see a link "Auto Update Roster", when you click the link, a pop-up console will come up.. </P>
<P>I am going to start working on a file manager console next..&nbsp; I am going to allow you to have 5-10 megs for screenshots/player pics etc.&nbsp; I`ve been getting a lot of requests for that and I figure it would be a nice feature.</P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Automatic Roster Entry! 98.66% done
							Saturday, January 25, 2003 - 1:06:53 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Yep, I am exactly 1.44% away from finishing a new utility that will allow guildleaders to enter a /who list, and based on it, it will fill in new members Name, Class, Race, Level, Username, and Password...&nbsp; This is going to be a huge time saver for the new guilds joining (I can already hear the guildleaders who did it all by typing swearing at me) :)</P>
<P>Coupled with this, I am going to explor the feasbility of developing automatic roster updates when you enter raids..&nbsp; So there will be a check box to `update your roster` while you enter a raid.&nbsp; For the non-DKP guilds, I will provide a pop-up console probably for you to just plug in a /who list, since you don`t enter Raids.</P>
<P>After I deploy the add new player utility, I will have to immediatly update the player profile editor page to allow for the new class Titles..&nbsp; </P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							New plug-in, Change to raid entry and other stuff
							Friday, January 24, 2003 - 1:49:22 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I added a `Visitor Counter" plug in.. you add it like you add any other plug in.&nbsp; It will allow you to track how many unique visitors have visited your site.&nbsp; I am going to make it look nicer, it`s pretty barebones right now, but it works (I hope) hehe.</P>
<P>You now have an option to enable/disable the ability for players to get multiple point awards for raids, if their maincharacter and an alternate is detected in the attendance taker.&nbsp; For example lets say the main character "Sharbel" is at the raid and gets 1 point, if the alternate character "Sharb" is found in the list, and the check box is set to allow multiple points, Sharbel will be awarded 2 points (1 for Sharbel and 1 for Sharb).&nbsp; This check was added because some guilds allow multiple points to be awarded and others don`t.</P>
<P>I added a field in the player profile for the player`s email address.</P>
<P>Fixed the item edit, it should be ok now.</P>
<P>Optimized a few more database calls, you should see the attendance utility go a lot faster, especially for big lists.</P>

						<h2>
							Delete Encounter - Remove Player From Attendance and more
							Thursday, January 23, 2003 - 2:06:39 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I added the function to remove Encounter types from the encounter list grid.. same deal as the other grids, log in as admin and you will see a delete column.&nbsp; This is meant for Encounters that were added in error, or maybe duplicate.&nbsp; If you have raids or purchases attached to it, you will have to delete them before you can delete the encounter.&nbsp; I *MIGHT* enable a function so that you can `hide` the encounter from the encounter list but the raids + items would still be attached to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also added the function to remove a player from a specific raid.&nbsp; You can use this function by clicking on any raid which brings you to the participant list.&nbsp; When you are logged in as an administrator, you will see a delete icon to the the left of each name (It`s sissors).. click the button, confirm the delete, and the player will be removed from the raid list, and the app will take away the points given to him/her for that raid.&nbsp; If the player has a purchase attached to to that raid, you will have to remove the purchase first.</P>
<P>Fixed a couple links on the Item List and Purchases List that were not taking the correct colors for a hyper-link</P>
<P>I optimized the participation list for raids.. the database calls are MUCH more effecient.... not like it matters really, its usually only working with 30-60 rows of data, but it`s the principle of things :)</P>
<P>Well, going to troll some boards .. /wave</P>

						<h2>
							Gender, Delete Purchases, Profile loggin changes
							Wednesday, January 22, 2003 - 2:05:09 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I`ve added the much asked for ability to specify your character`s gender.&nbsp; It was always intended to be implemented, I`ve just been putting it off too long.&nbsp; You can now specify your character`s gender in the player profile editor.&nbsp; If you select `Male` your auto picture will be a Male character of the same race you specify.&nbsp; Same thing if you are a Female, it picks a female picture of the same race.&nbsp; You can, of course specify your own picture to display in your profile.</P>
<P>I also added the ability to delete purchases from the purchase list.&nbsp; When you log in as admin, there will be a delete column, similar to other grids that serve the same function.&nbsp; After you confirm the delete, it will delete the raid and reimburse the player for the points listed in the item purchase.</P>
<P>When you use the profile editor, you don`t have to login multiple times.. it will save the login info until you close your browser window.&nbsp; It was actually like that all along, but i had it turned off for the last week to test something else, and forgot to turn it back on :)</P>
<P>I added a title for the biography on the profile page of the character.</P>
