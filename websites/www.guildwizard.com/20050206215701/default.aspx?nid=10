							Small patch and new guild application feature
							Wednesday, October 13, 2004 - 9:59:37 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just sent a small patch for an issue with the guild application page.&nbsp; I basically increased the maximum size of the description field.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also fixed a small bug with the Guild Gallery editor.&nbsp; Descriptions added to images uploaded were not being accepted if it had a space in it, which was not intended.&nbsp; I fixed it.</P>
<P>I also made a small feature addition to the Guild Application component.&nbsp; You many now send the application to multiple recipients if you want.&nbsp; To configure the application to be sent to multiple recipients (such as other officers of the guild), you simply have to seperate the addresses with a semi-colon (;) .&nbsp; </P>

							Profile editor fix for WoW guilds
							Tuesday, October 12, 2004 - 10:18:34 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P><STRONG>World of Warcraft (WoW) guild</STRONG> members should be able to update their profiles now.&nbsp; I`ve been noticing an error in the logs every so often regarding the profile editor, but could never reproduce it.&nbsp; Turns out it only affected <STRONG>WoW guilds</STRONG> because of a guild setting I had in place only for World of Warcraft guilds.&nbsp; Anyway, it was a 2 second fix and it seems to work.</P>
<P>Speaking of the profile editor, that is *really* due for a re-write.&nbsp; I was looking at it today when I was fixing that problem, and my goodness there is some old code there.&nbsp; It doesnt even use a lot of the nice configuration settings I had developed when the engine was re-written last year.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Needless to say that the guild member profile editor is the next patch.&nbsp; I am going to have really spend some time on this one, and I think the admins/members are going to like what I come up with.&nbsp; If not, Lord knows the admins will let me know :)</P>

							Payment processing
							Friday, October 08, 2004 - 11:23:35 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well I guess our payment processor is the latest target of a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.&nbsp; I`ve been hearing about it all week from various clients of mine that there is a huge campaign against a lot of the payment processors, and I guess it`s my processor`s turn..&nbsp;&nbsp; I *think* it`s fixed now, as they sent their customers a work-around + alternate servers to use.&nbsp; I have updated the payment code to use the new servers and it seems to be working now.</P>
<P>I apologize if anyone was inconvenienced by this.&nbsp; If anyone continues to have trouble with the payment page, PLEASE email me.&nbsp; I will, of course, extend any trial memberships that are expire, and having trouble paying subscriptions.</P>

							Guild gallery upgraded
							Wednesday, September 29, 2004 - 11:50:09 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just got finished deploying a complete re-make of the guild photo gallery page.&nbsp; The old guild gallery was, very simplistic with next to no features.&nbsp; The new guild photo gallery has some very nice features to make organizing and viewing screenshots/photo`s very nice.</P>
<P>Some key features of the new guild photo gallery:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Albums allow you to group images into logical sections.&nbsp; If you want to organize all your raid images in one album, another gallery for guild member images, and another for guild events, you can do it all in the new <STRONG>Guild Gallery Manager </STRONG>(login with your admin account to see the link) 
<LI>You have a LOT more control over the various settings and display of your gallery with the new guild gallery.&nbsp; You can customize how many thumbnail images are displayed per page, how many columns, as well as specifying images for the Next &amp; Previous image viewer.&nbsp; Moreover, the various structural elements of the new gallery are fully CSS ready for the Guild Style Editor for even more customization!&nbsp; I fooled around with the gallery you can make 10 galleries look VERY different from eachother with the various settings!&nbsp;&nbsp; No cookie cutter look here, thx :) 
<LI>You can enable or disable Paging on the thumbnail listing of an Album.&nbsp; Of course, you can also specify the page size (how many thumbnails per page) if you have paging enabled. 
<LI>THANK GOD ALMIGHTY (whoever your God might be) that the thumbnails DO NOT reload on every page load anymore.&nbsp; A major hurdle with dynamically generated images like thumbnails is that most browsers wont cache them locally.&nbsp; I developed a custom HTTP Handler to handle it, some real cool stuff for those geeks who have the slightest clue about what I am talking about.&nbsp; I developed a component that dynamically generates the images for thumbnails etc, and properly complies with the browsers to cache the images locally.&nbsp; 
<LI>When you are browsing pictures by clicking the Previous &amp; Next buttons to cycle through images, you will notice that the images are changed without the page refreshing.&nbsp; Anyone who has ever used Coopermine gallery knows how slow and annoying it is to cycle through images. 
<LI>You can set Permissions on each album.&nbsp; You can set albums to be viewed by Everyone, Guildmembers or just Admins/Officers.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P>One thing that isnt a feature, but kind of a side effect, is that you will have to create an Album to put your existing images into.&nbsp; Don`t flip when you go to your Guild Gallery page and see the message "No Albums Configured".&nbsp; You just have to go into the Gallery Admin page and create an Album.&nbsp; Then go into the Image section and assign the images in the Uncatagorized Group to your newly created Album.&nbsp; </P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Guild News Items paging enabled
							Thursday, September 23, 2004 - 4:27:07 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I enabled paging for the guild news page (default page).&nbsp; You will see the pager on the top and bottom, if you have more than 5 news items in your guild news page.&nbsp; Some guilds have a lot of news items, with a lot of images and screenshots from guild raids, resulting in some pretty pathetic page load times.&nbsp; (Oh, before I forget, COMPRESS YOUR IMAGES!!!).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, those guilds with a lot of news items should see a pretty big speed increase when loading the guild news page.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Next up is the gallery page.&nbsp; I know this is coming out of nowhere, but I developed a gallery component for another website of mine, and it`s going to fit nicely into guildwizard.&nbsp; The new gallery will support Albums, which basically allows you to categorize your images.&nbsp; Also, you will be able to define and customize the gallery quite a bit more, such as being able to specify thumbnail sizes, how many thumbnails per page, number of columns.&nbsp; Moreover, you will be able to browse images by clicking Previous &amp; Next navigation buttons after you click into an image and are in the "Detail View".&nbsp; </P>
<P>The current gallery is pretty Mickey Mouse.. the new gallery will be a hell of a lot more powerful.&nbsp; Yay for developing re-usable, compiled server controls that can be re-used in multiple projects :)</P>

						<h2>
							Guild Forums Polls
							Wednesday, September 22, 2004 - 11:12:11 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I deployed the new guild forum poll function.&nbsp; You will see the button for a New Poll in each forum page that lists the threads.&nbsp; The button, like all the other forum buttons, are configurable to any image you want in the Forum Editor.&nbsp; I have it set that only logged in people can Vote on the Polls.&nbsp; So, if the user has access to the forum that the Poll lives in, they can vote.&nbsp; Once they vote, it`s recorded, and the results thus far is displayed.&nbsp; I also added a "Show Vote Results" link, so people don`t have to vote, to see how the poll is going so far.</P>
<P>I will further enhance the polls by allowing color configuration for the result percent bars.&nbsp; Currently, they are white on green.. I intend on allowing admins to configure the colors.&nbsp; I will also allow admins to set forums to allow Polls or not.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Oh, I also fixed a bug that would delete an entire thread if you tried to delete the first reply of a thread on a page other than 1.&nbsp; </P>

							Guild forum smiley update
							Thursday, September 16, 2004 - 11:39:08 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Small patch today. I changed the guild forums so that the smiley emotes load in a different window when you click the button.&nbsp; I was getting some complaints from people who said the images were being loaded everytime you went to a post screen in the guild forums, which was tedious for dialup users.&nbsp; Now, when you go to a post screen in the guild forums, you will see an icon/link for the emotes.&nbsp; Click it, and a window comes up with all the guild forum emotes.</P>
<P>I was going to do the guild forum voting component next, but might do the guild member profile editor first.&nbsp; The profile editor is about 2 years old now, and hasnt gotten much attention over the last while.&nbsp; I think an update to that is necessary.</P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Forum Buttons and Icons configurable
							Tuesday, September 07, 2004 - 4:31:21 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Today`s patch enables guilds to change their guild forum icons and buttons.&nbsp; Previously, guild forums buttons where setup to as text type links where you could change their appearance in the style editors.&nbsp; I now have them setup as Image Buttons, which allows greater design possibilities for guilds.</P>
<P>If you don`t customize your guild forums buttons/icons, the system will just use some default gray buttons.&nbsp; To customize your guild forum buttons and icons, login with your admin/officer account and go to the guild Forum Editor.&nbsp; If you click the Change Forum Icons link, you will be brought to the panel that allows you to change the various icons/buttons.</P>
<P>To change the icons, click the (change) link which brings up the File Manager.&nbsp; Upload/Select the image you want to use and click the save button.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I think for the next patch, I will focus on the guild forums voting component.&nbsp; </P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Small forums update
							Thursday, September 02, 2004 - 12:38:40 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I changed the smiley icons access in the forums to show up on the right side of the text box instead of having to click a button for the window.&nbsp; When I created the filemanager a couple weeks ago, I pretty much broke the smiley window which was dependant on the old filemanager page.&nbsp; I will be adding more smileys soon too.. the way I developed the component now, I can add smileys very easily.</P>
<P>I also reworked the way the system complains if you try to post a message in the forums while logged in with the Administrator account.&nbsp; Before, it would just send you to the login page, was very cryptic as to what the problem was.&nbsp; So, to avoid confusing new admins, I created an entry in the error page to display a message explaining that you cant post&nbsp;with the Administrator account.</P>
<P>I think next, I am going to create some configuration settings to allow admins to change the post buttons to graphic buttons.&nbsp; I think the buttons right now in the forums (the buttons you push to make a post/reply etc) look incredibly cheesy.&nbsp; Some guilds have done some pretty cool things with their stylesheet to cover up the cheesyness, but not everyone is that skilled with CSS so I figure if I change them to Image Buttons, it will be a lot easier.</P>
<P>You may have noticed that the updates have been not as frequent the last few weeks.&nbsp; I am involved with a new web-service project that is taking up a lot of time at work and even after hours.&nbsp; I will chip away at my guildwizard TODO list when I get a few hours here and there, like today.</P>

						<h2>
							File Manager - Reloaded
							Tuesday, August 17, 2004 - 11:07:28 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just got finished deploying the new File Manager.&nbsp; This new file manager that I created will allow you to organize uploaded images in directories, copy/paste, move files etc.&nbsp; I think it`s a lot more intuitive than the other one (for the record, I didnt program the other one!!).&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is a help file to explain the various new features, but honestly if you are a Windows user, you should feel right at home as the file manager is very similar to the Windows file manager.&nbsp; I had actually created a pretty neat drag/drop component to allow you to multi-select files/directories and drag them into new directories, but it was only working in Internet Explorer, so I opted for a more tradition `web-application` model.&nbsp; So, instead of drag/drop, you can multi-select, but you have to click the copy/cut icon then paste into the directory you want to copy/move files to.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Next on my list is to start focusing on the forums again.&nbsp; There is a lot of little things that need to get done on the forums, and I have gotten some great feedback (and some whining too!) on new features.&nbsp; Hopefully after the next patch, most of the forum`s unfinished features will be done.</P>
