<P>As for the future of GuildWizard.com&nbsp;... I have decided to start working on the application again.&nbsp; Effective immediatly, I will be working on the long list of suggestion/bug fixes .&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also start working on the application to be scalable to other online games.&nbsp; I play EQ, but there are a lot of other games out there that players have emailed me asking for support on.&nbsp; It shouldn`t be that tough to alter the code to allow for the various other class/races of other games.&nbsp; </P>

<P>What it comes down to is this.&nbsp; I am going to be evaluating what I will be doing with the service, in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; Don`t worry, I will not be pulling the plug.&nbsp; I am simply going to be evaluting if I will basically leave the app the way it is, and let it be used... or I might go ahead and start working on it full time again.&nbsp; If I do go full time again, I might go with a subscription based service to recover the development costs (my time).&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, nothing is definate.&nbsp; I might just let Guild Wizard run as it is without any changes at all.&nbsp; If you have any input on the matter, feel free to email me!</P>

																			</TABLE>
																			<span id="DataList1__ctl4_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Off the top: The Filemanager should be back to normal now.</P>
<P>I have created a page for admins/officers to manage security/password issues.&nbsp; For now it has two tools to use, however I will probably add more as the need arises.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First of all, you will see the link in the top right corner of any page, as long as you are logged in as an Admin or Officer... think link is called Manage Members.&nbsp; From this page you can (the admin only) promote members to Officers, which in essense gives them Admin rights to your site.&nbsp; Be very careful who you allow this priveledge!&nbsp; The only thing, at this time, that an Officer cannot do, is add/remove other officers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second tool on the page, is a password resetter.&nbsp; This tool will allow an Admin/Officer to reset the password of a guildmember who lost their password.&nbsp; I was going to implement an email the new password type tool but not everyone lists their email so this was the easiest way.&nbsp; After you reset the password for them, they are free to change it to what they want, via the link on the login box.</P>
<P>Now that the Roles based security is in place, I am going to re-visit the grid columns.&nbsp; I will likely be adding the option to only show Guildmates certain columns (points, loot, raids etc).</P>
<P>Moreover, I am going to look into implementing the ability for administrators to `lock` certain pages.&nbsp; What i mean by this, is allow the admin to set, say, the Calandar page as "Guildmembers Only" permissions.&nbsp; That way, only guildmembers would be able to see that Calendar page.&nbsp; Some guilds are on very competative servers, and they don`t necessarily want to show other guilds what they are going to be up to. No promises on this, but like I said I am going to look into it.</P></font></span>

																			</TABLE>
																			<span id="DataList1__ctl5_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I am about 50 percent done the Role based security update.&nbsp; Role based means that when you log in, the database will check to see what Role you belong to... if you are an Administrator or Officer, you will have different options than if you were a Member.</P>
<P>Don`t get me wrong, Roles security was already there, just I am reworking it so it uses the .NET security model.&nbsp; I really should have done that from the beginning, but this project started out as a casual project to be used by 2 co-guildleaders.&nbsp; I didn`t design the login-in for what its being used for today.&nbsp; Regardless, most won`t even notice a difference... it really is mostly boring server side stuff that is behind the scenes.</P>
<P>One thing that guildleaders will notice, is they will be allowed to give Officer permissions to certain users which is pretty much giving them the same powers as an Administrator.&nbsp; The difference is, an Officer will not be able to add/revoke officer status.&nbsp; Only the Administrator Role can do that.&nbsp; I am not going to go much deeper in the permissions than that.&nbsp; As some of you know I could program it that each feature could be a configurable permission, but quite frankly I don`t think it will be used, so I will only do a broad permission setting.&nbsp; If I get a lot of requests, I will revisit that decision though.</P>
<P>Members will notice very little, except they will log in at the same login as the administrator now.. you can log in, and it will know what you should be seeing or not based on your Role.&nbsp; Also, there will be an option to Remember your login, so you don`t have to log in everytime you come to the site... </P>
<P>I have atleast 1-2 more days of reworking the permissions, then I will begin working on the documentation, and adding some more plug-ins.</P></font></span>

<P>I also added the ability to delete purchases from the purchase list.&nbsp; When you log in as admin, there will be a delete column, similar to other grids that serve the same function.&nbsp; After you confirm the delete, it will delete the raid and reimburse the player for the points listed in the item purchase.</P>
<P>When you use the profile editor, you don`t have to login multiple times.. it will save the login info until you close your browser window.&nbsp; It was actually like that all along, but i had it turned off for the last week to test something else, and forgot to turn it back on :)</P>
<P>I added a title for the biography on the profile page of the character.</P></font></span>

<P>&nbsp;Some of you have emailed me asking why the alternate character listing has been getting wiped...&nbsp; I really had no answer as there was no problems with the database, and nobody was reporting crashes.&nbsp; Well I think i found the problem.. I was getting paranoid that someone might have been using malicous code to try to wipe the database, and in doing that I found a very silly mistake in one of my database calls.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it is the problem.</P>
<P>Going to ask everyone to re-add their alternates and see if everything is ok.&nbsp; Thank god it was just the alts, and not the player list :) That would have been a mess!</P>

																			<span id="DataList1__ctl28_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Well instead of doing the configurations to the pages with grids like I thought, I instead coded an excellent suggestion that I received from Fligtar of Twisted Fates. Basically, he suggested to add a search to the raid attendance tracker for any alternate characters that might have attended the raid.&nbsp; The way it was before, you would have to manually add people who were on alts since the application searches the roster list to see who on the roster attended, and filters out any others.</P>
<P>I thought this was a neat idea so I coded it up.&nbsp; So basically, if the Raid Attendance Tracker doesn`t find a person in the /who list to be part of the roster, it will then look at the Alternate list to see if the person is an alternate of anyone.&nbsp; If found in the alternate list, it will add the MAIN character of the player to the raid attendance list, and give any points etc.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thanks for the suggestion Fligtar!</P></font></span>

<P>Also, new guilds who wish to join will have to wait a day or so until the signup page is complete.  Thanks to the guilds who have emailed me in the last few days to help out with the beta test, but I am going to ask them to hang tight till the signup process is complete.  I will email those people when it`s set for them.</P></font></span>

<P>Those using the service will be getting an email from me with my new email address.&nbsp; I finished setting up a new&nbsp;email server today, and would like anyone sending email to me, to use my new email address -&nbsp; <A href="mailto:sharbel@guildwizard.com">sharbel@guildwizard.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently upgraded my bandwidth and with that, I have to get rid of my old email address, they are allowing me to use it for a little while so I can give new addresses out.&nbsp; So please use <A href="mailto:sharbel@guildwizard.com">sharbel@guildwizard.com</A> !</P>
<P>On the subject of emails, I am tossing around the idea of allowing guilds to have *real* email service as part of the GuildWizard service.&nbsp; We can do <A href="mailto:yourname@guildwizard.com">yourname@guildwizard.com</A> or <A href="mailto:yourname.yourguildname@guildwizard.com">yourname.yourguildname@guildwizard.com</A>&nbsp; or something like that.&nbsp; Just tossing it around.. send me an email if you are interested.</P>
<P>With the holiday season coming to an end, I am going to get back to more regular fixes/additions to the service.&nbsp; I will make a few more high-priority changes, then will focus 100% on making the signup automated.&nbsp; The set up of each new guild is getting longer and longer, and quite frankly i hate doing it :)&nbsp; I have the framework in place to create the sites on the fly, just have to sort out the domain creations on the fly, which I have already accomplished.. just need to put it in code.</P></font></span>
