							Guild Member last login
							Tuesday, July 27, 2004 - 1:43:06 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I added some logic that records the last time a member was online, to be displayed on the roster.&nbsp; I created a new roster column type (custom rosters only) that will allow you to plug this information into your roster.&nbsp;</P>
<P>It doesn`t record the login time, because you dont really login everytime you visit.&nbsp; Instead, it records the last request of the user.&nbsp; The information *is* delayed (up to 10 minutes on the roster page) with server caching, so dont expect instant reporting on the roster.&nbsp; On other pages that this field will become available on such as the profile page, it will be&nbsp;real-time info.&nbsp;</P>

							So I decided to just change the thing.. 
							Monday, July 26, 2004 - 8:38:20 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>A little late in posting this, but it was a hectic weekend!&nbsp; Instead of upgrading the web-server that hosts Guild Wizard, I decided to just change it over to another server.&nbsp; The new server has a much better processor, more RAM, and a faster hard-drive.&nbsp; I`d be suprised if anyone sees the service running any faster though, as everything was running tip top anyway :)</P>
<P>I`ve been experiencing a very steady increase in new guilds signing up and using the site, so I did this as a proactive measure.&nbsp; In the fall/winter (or who knows when), when Everquest 2 (EQ2) and Worlds Of Warcraft (WOW) come out, I am anticipating a sharp increase in new guilds.&nbsp; This new system is much more versed to sit in a small web-server farm (group of servers) incase server load gets high.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Guilds who have custom domains had a about 5 hours of downtime on their domain name while I was switching everything over.&nbsp; Some domains are really taking their time to update their DNS info, so I went ahead and rigged something up so they can continue using the domain with the old DNS info.</P>
<P><STRONG>Whats Coming in The Next Patch:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Going to add a new column to the Roster fields available "Last Login" to record the last time a member was actually at the site.&nbsp; 
<LI>Something might be up with the the raid list column roles checker.. its probably something very minor but it will be fixed 
<LI>I *might* be able to finish the new payment processing system.&nbsp; PayPal will still be available, but it wont be the default payment method for subscription creation.&nbsp; I really dont like this recurring subscription nonsense, but moreover I need a little more control on integration of my scripts which is very limited with PayPal.</LI></UL>

							Server coming down tonight for upgrade
							Saturday, July 24, 2004 - 9:15:30 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>There will be some server downtime tonight for a server upgrade.&nbsp; I will try to keep it as short as possible, likely under 1 hour (if everything goes smooth).&nbsp; I will probably put up a temp status page while the server is down on one of our other servers that I will redirect traffic to.&nbsp; </P>

							New Control : Fading Slide Show
							Thursday, July 22, 2004 - 5:18:47 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I created a new Control that will allow you to create a fading slide show.&nbsp; I got the idea from&nbsp; <A href="http://www.shadowedstrife.net">http://www.shadowedstrife.net</A>&nbsp; who has it on their guild wizard site (it`s on the right side).&nbsp; Like any other control, you create it in the Control Editor and select Slide Show Control from the Control Type List.</P>
<P>A few things you should be aware of:&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>When you Add images to the slide show, the list is NOT SAVED until you click the Save button.&nbsp; Just because it`s in the grid, doesnt mean it will be saved, so please remember that.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>You really should have all the images the same size.&nbsp; You can resize images in pretty much any image editor.</LI>
<LI>The fade effect doesnt work in Mozilla browsers, but the control itself should (images should change on time etc)</LI>
<LI>You can select the duration of each image being shown by selecting the desired duration from the list.&nbsp; Default is 3 seconds.</LI></OL>

							Fixed login cookie, Submit template function
							Friday, July 16, 2004 - 11:29:06 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I fixed the login cookie issue from before.&nbsp; You dont have to login everytime you visit now, which was pretty annoying.</P>
<P>I added a <STRONG>Submit Your Template</STRONG> function to allow people who like making templates, to be able to share them with other guilds.&nbsp; It doesn`t just submit the stylesheet, it submits all your control positions, the images attached to them, it basically clones your look/feel.&nbsp; After you submit a template, and after its approved, other guilds can use your template.&nbsp; So, if you have design skills, use em, and share em :)</P>

							Todays Guild Wizard Patch
							Thursday, July 15, 2004 - 11:22:25 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Today`s patch added a new Control type, and added edit support for existing controls.. as well as a few bug fixes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>New control: <STRONG>Embeded Page - </STRONG>This control creates a Custom Page that embeds another web-sites content in it.&nbsp; For example, lets say that you want to have a page that has a live video feed from another service you can simply specify the URL (address) of the page, give it an ID, and the guild wizard system will create a custom page for you.&nbsp; Create a button for it (it automatically adds the custom page to your links list in the Control Editor too), and you are all set.</LI>
<LI>You can now Edit all Custom Controls that you create.&nbsp; Pretty self explainatory in the Control Editor.&nbsp; Click the edit icon for the item you want to edit, and away you go.</LI>
<LI>There is a new style element for the forum message page.&nbsp; The column that holds the avatar is now able to be styled in the Style Editor.&nbsp; You can give it a different background color, border etc.</LI>
<LI>I fixed a problem with the Delete Private Message button.. it was only deleting the first message.&nbsp; Its working correctly now.</LI></UL>

							Dude, two upgrades in one day??
							Monday, July 12, 2004 - 11:58:09 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well, you can tell that I am not playing any MMORPGs at the present time :)&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent tonight doing some nice tweaks on the new style editor, based on a couple peoples suggestions (and a few peoples whining/death threats) hehe</P>
<OL>
<LI>When you adjust the width of the Left or Right panel, the Center panel`s margin will automatically adjust accordingly.&nbsp; So, if you make the left panel width 400pixels, the Center panel will automatically have a 400pixel margin.&nbsp; Good suggestion whoever sent it to me. 
<LI>I fixed a little bug when you type in a URL for the background image of stylesheet item.&nbsp; Before it was always assuming the image was in your guilds image directory, which is fine for most cases but I can see it would irritate an advanced user wanting to use an image on their own webserver.. so the system will check if a valid URL is entered, if not it defaults to look for that image in your guilds directory. 
<LI>Ok those who styled their guild site entirely with the visual editor is going to hate me when they read this.&nbsp; You can now copy style settings between elements to ensure a consistent look/feel throughout your elements.&nbsp; For advanced users, its still easier to just hop into the stylesheet and cut/paste the style settings, but for normal users this is going to save a LOT of time.<BR><BR>Example:&nbsp; Lets say you want all your grid headers to look the same as your Roster header.. no problem now.&nbsp; Just select Roster Header from the new dropdownlist to Copy From, and then select the Raid List Header, for example.&nbsp; Click the Copy To button and the Raid List Header automatically inherits the style settings for the Roster Header.&nbsp; Rinse and Repeat for the various other elements that build the grids, and you have a consistent look/feel without having to remember colors, borders, font-sizes, padding, margins etc.&nbsp; Just remember, you can *still* customize it after you inherit a style, its just a base to work with.<BR><BR>This is going to save a lot of time for button styling too.. design your first buttons style, and then copy the style to all your other buttons.. </LI></OL>
<P>Thanks for all the suggestions from the various guild leaders / web masters out there.&nbsp; I really appreciate the help to make Guild Wizard better.&nbsp; Believe me guys/gals, I am on your side.. if you want something added, changed, altered, or removed.. let me know!&nbsp; </P>

							Forum categories implemented
							Monday, July 12, 2004 - 4:35:17 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just deployed a patch that allows you to group forums into Categories.&nbsp; So, if you have 5 public forums, 2 for Members and 2 for Officers, you can group them together and even set visibility settings to the category.</P>
<P>For example, the lets say you have 2 Officer forums, and you create an Officer Only category... it gets seperated from the other categories, and if you set it that only Officers/Admins can see it, the whole category gets hidden to non-Officer/Admins.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You create Categories in the forum admin section (same place you do all your forum administration).&nbsp; You create the Category first, then go to the Forum Manager and either create new forums in the Category, or edit existing forums to be moved into the newly created Category.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the Category Manager, you can also set the display order of the categories much the same as you set forum order in the Forum Manager.</P>
<P>You can set the Category Header style in the Style Editor under the Forum List Page section..&nbsp; Remember, when you set styles for things like this, it doesnt just have to be the font color and background color.. get creative with the background images, border size/color etc!</P>

							Style & Layout backup/restore 
							Friday, July 09, 2004 - 5:49:57 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well at the suggestion of Tilithien of&nbsp; <A href="http://ilmr.guildwizard.com/">Inverse Logic</A>&nbsp;, I created a back-up/restore function for the style sheet and layout editor.&nbsp; The reason for this is, if you use a template, your layout positions get overwritten, as well as your style sheet.&nbsp; Not to mention if you dont like how you ended up editing your styles, it can be a pain in the buttocks to get it back the way it was.</P>
<P>So, before you start fooling around with your nice layout/colors, hit the Save Look/Feel icon in the Style Editor.&nbsp; This will save your stylesheet, control layouts, and all other look/feel options.&nbsp; If you do something that you don`t like, simple restore your website`s look/feel to the last save point!</P>
<P>Keep the suggestions coming in guys/gals, it really helps me out to make the service better when people make suggestion.</P>

							Todays patch
							Friday, July 09, 2004 - 2:05:48 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well another day, another patch :</P>
<UL>
<LI>Forum admins can now edit/delete Registered User accounts .&nbsp; These are accounts that are not roster accounts.&nbsp; These accounts are from users who sign up, usually recruits.&nbsp; The link for this panel is the the Forum Manager, under the Registered Users link</LI>
<LI>I fixed the width problem with the item stats viewer</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem with the roster, raid, and purchase list permission.&nbsp; It wasnt letting anyone in that shouldnt see it, it was locking out everyone but the admin when certain conditions were met.&nbsp; This must have been like that for a long time because I didn`t touch this in the last patch.. nobody must have noticed :)</LI>
<LI>Added some validation for non everquest guilds on the custom roster</LI>
<LI>I moved the subscribe button to go on the top right, instead of the left.&nbsp; It was interfering with the Admin pages link in some cases</LI>
<LI>Guilds who have a custom domain, and registered it before last year, their guild domain and DNS server has been moved to another server.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Caught a nice performance hit on a very important method .. I recoded it, and instead of taking .01 seconds to execute, it takes .005!! yay! :)&nbsp; Seriously though, under heavy load it will make a big difference, so I spent the time on it.</LI></UL>
<P>I will probably start fooling around with the raids attendance now.&nbsp; I just want to add a manual way to create a raid, without the log file.. so non-EQ guilds can do their attendance.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I do have some other stuff planned, but its 2:30am and I am too tired to type</P>
