<P>This week you will start seeing a lot of the changes that people have been emailing me with.&nbsp; This is the order of priorities based on peoples emails:</P>
<OL>
<LI>&nbsp;Re-do the forums to give more control to moderators</LI>
<LI>Add more options to the Roster (keys,epic,magelo)..</LI>
<LI>Add more options for customization - will rework the color/layout configurations</LI></OL>
<P>I list those 3 only because they will require the most coding, which really isn`t a lot - relatively speaking.&nbsp; The other suggestions by people will also be done, just they are minor changes that can be done very quickly.&nbsp;</P></font></span>

<P>As for the future of GuildWizard.com&nbsp;... I have decided to start working on the application again.&nbsp; Effective immediatly, I will be working on the long list of suggestion/bug fixes .&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also start working on the application to be scalable to other online games.&nbsp; I play EQ, but there are a lot of other games out there that players have emailed me asking for support on.&nbsp; It shouldn`t be that tough to alter the code to allow for the various other class/races of other games.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will worry about other games, mind you, when I get done with taking care of the existing application.&nbsp; I have a lot of programming ahead of me to implement some of the features that I have had on the back burner.</P></font></span>

<P>What it comes down to is this.&nbsp; I am going to be evaluating what I will be doing with the service, in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; Don`t worry, I will not be pulling the plug.&nbsp; I am simply going to be evaluting if I will basically leave the app the way it is, and let it be used... or I might go ahead and start working on it full time again.&nbsp; If I do go full time again, I might go with a subscription based service to recover the development costs (my time).&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, nothing is definate.&nbsp; I might just let Guild Wizard run as it is without any changes at all.&nbsp; If you have any input on the matter, feel free to email me!</P>

<P>I have created a page for admins/officers to manage security/password issues.&nbsp; For now it has two tools to use, however I will probably add more as the need arises.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First of all, you will see the link in the top right corner of any page, as long as you are logged in as an Admin or Officer... think link is called Manage Members.&nbsp; From this page you can (the admin only) promote members to Officers, which in essense gives them Admin rights to your site.&nbsp; Be very careful who you allow this priveledge!&nbsp; The only thing, at this time, that an Officer cannot do, is add/remove other officers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second tool on the page, is a password resetter.&nbsp; This tool will allow an Admin/Officer to reset the password of a guildmember who lost their password.&nbsp; I was going to implement an email the new password type tool but not everyone lists their email so this was the easiest way.&nbsp; After you reset the password for them, they are free to change it to what they want, via the link on the login box.</P>
<P>Now that the Roles based security is in place, I am going to re-visit the grid columns.&nbsp; I will likely be adding the option to only show Guildmates certain columns (points, loot, raids etc).</P>
<P>Moreover, I am going to look into implementing the ability for administrators to `lock` certain pages.&nbsp; What i mean by this, is allow the admin to set, say, the Calandar page as "Guildmembers Only" permissions.&nbsp; That way, only guildmembers would be able to see that Calendar page.&nbsp; Some guilds are on very competative servers, and they don`t necessarily want to show other guilds what they are going to be up to. No promises on this, but like I said I am going to look into it.</P></font></span>

<span id="DataList1__ctl6_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I am about 50 percent done the Role based security update.&nbsp; Role based means that when you log in, the database will check to see what Role you belong to... if you are an Administrator or Officer, you will have different options than if you were a Member.</P>
<P>Don`t get me wrong, Roles security was already there, just I am reworking it so it uses the .NET security model.&nbsp; I really should have done that from the beginning, but this project started out as a casual project to be used by 2 co-guildleaders.&nbsp; I didn`t design the login-in for what its being used for today.&nbsp; Regardless, most won`t even notice a difference... it really is mostly boring server side stuff that is behind the scenes.</P>
<P>One thing that guildleaders will notice, is they will be allowed to give Officer permissions to certain users which is pretty much giving them the same powers as an Administrator.&nbsp; The difference is, an Officer will not be able to add/revoke officer status.&nbsp; Only the Administrator Role can do that.&nbsp; I am not going to go much deeper in the permissions than that.&nbsp; As some of you know I could program it that each feature could be a configurable permission, but quite frankly I don`t think it will be used, so I will only do a broad permission setting.&nbsp; If I get a lot of requests, I will revisit that decision though.</P>
<P>Members will notice very little, except they will log in at the same login as the administrator now.. you can log in, and it will know what you should be seeing or not based on your Role.&nbsp; Also, there will be an option to Remember your login, so you don`t have to log in everytime you come to the site... </P>
<P>I have atleast 1-2 more days of reworking the permissions, then I will begin working on the documentation, and adding some more plug-ins.</P></font></span>

<P>The application will automatically create thumbnails (small versions) of the original images, and display them in a table-like format (as seen in the link above).&nbsp;&nbsp; The image formats must be in either jpeg or gif, and under 250k, although I recommend that all the pics be in jpeg and under 100k.&nbsp;&nbsp; The image description is optional, enter a description for each image if you want.</P>
<P>The bug thats plagued me for the last while is handled.. I haven`t seen it lock up a site in a few days, which means it should be ok from now on.&nbsp; I will start on the roles based security model, and also I am going to start on the documentation pages.&nbsp; I will of course continue fixing any issues that pop up.</P></font></span>

<span id="DataList1__ctl8_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I made a couple improvements to the calendar.&nbsp; I programmed it so when there is an item added to that date, it`s back color will be red and the date will be in yellow.&nbsp; This will allow you quickly see which dates have messages attached to it, reducing useless clicking to see if there is news or not.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also made the calendar control&nbsp; a bit bigger.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I didn`t get around to the Edit/Delete function for the calendar.&nbsp; I will get to that when i get time.. its not top priority right now to me.</P>
<P>I will continue to shrink my TODO list, and start working on a Roles based Security model.. this will allow different roles when logging in.. (GuildLeader, Officer, member) etc..&nbsp; It will also merge the admin account with a user account... </P>
<P>I haven`t seen that bug in about 15 hours now.. might be handled... hopefully it is.</P>
<P>Well... going to play some Shadowbane :)</P></font></span>

<span id="DataList1__ctl9_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I made a few additions/fixes tonight..&nbsp;&nbsp; You can now manually add Alternates to a raid, make sure that you have the relevant check box `checked` when want to list alternates in the player listbox.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You can now manually add a player more than once (multiboxing or alternates on raids), if your guild allows that.&nbsp; Some guilds only give points once, no matter how many players the person is playing.. others allow points for each character.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I fixed a bug that allowed you to delete your root image directory.. well, it wasnt a bug, I forgot to set a check for it :)</P>
<P>You can again upload your profile pictues, I had it off to troubleshoot something else... It`s back on now.</P>
<P>I am a bit closer to finding the source of that bug that is locking up sites.&nbsp; You shouldn`t see any more error messages.. if the error happens you will still be sort of locked up.. just half the page will load..&nbsp; I will be emailed as soon as an error happens, so there is no need to email me.&nbsp; I am focusing all my time from tommorow on, on finding the source of this bug(s).. I honestly think its a few things that are causing it... </P>
<P>Well.. its 3:15am.... time to troll some message boards!</P></font></span>
