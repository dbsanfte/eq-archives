							Forums...
							Tuesday, December 23, 2003 - 1:13:53 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Ok, I am probably going to have something ready to test with the forums tommorow or day after.&nbsp; I am not sure how I will do it, because I really don`t want to deploy it on the live server.. I might create a subdomain or something to test it out and run&nbsp;another instance of guildwizard just to test.</P>
<P>Regarding existing forum transfers..&nbsp; I am not sure how it will work.&nbsp; The database structure is very different from the current forums, due to the multi-guild use.. if I can figure out a good way to transfer messages, I will.&nbsp; If you are going to commit suicide over loosing message forums, I might keep the current forums active.&nbsp; No offense, but some people get pretty violent and whiney when you mess with their forums :)</P>
<P>The new forums are pretty much usable right now, but very untested.. private messages still have to be coded though.&nbsp; I am only sneaking in a little coding here and there, as I am very busy with work, not to mention holiday stuff with the familiy..&nbsp;&nbsp; I will need a few (or 100) of you to give the new forums a workout with test posts and screwign around on it, trying to break it, when I post it for testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I sure hope it performs better than the existing forum, my head is shaved atm, and I wish I had hair so I could pull my hair out waiting for that damn forum to load .. hehe</P>

							New Forum progress.. 
							Saturday, December 13, 2003 - 4:28:22 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I have a skeleton outline of the new forums programmed up.&nbsp; It`s workable, and is shaping up.. Right now there is thread listings, message viewing, new post page, reply page, forum list..&nbsp; There is still a ton of work mind you, but it`s going well.&nbsp; I am sneaking in some programming for the forums mostly at night, and with the holidays coming up I should have a bit of time too.</P>
<P>I am going to pick the features that I think are really usefull and implement them.. I am also going to scrap a lot of the features that I think are total fluff features (features that are worthless, just programmed in so the feature list looks good).&nbsp; From my conversations with people, most people want a lightweight, fast, organized and easy to use forum system that <STRONG>integrates seamlessly</STRONG> with their existing site.</P>
<P>If you want to to voice your opinions &amp; concerns regarding the new forums, post on <A href="http://forums.guildwizard.com/?f=21&amp;m=43108">this thread</A></P>

							Turn off paging on Roster
							Thursday, December 11, 2003 - 3:55:39 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Custom Rosters now have a configuration setting in their configuration panels to turn off paging for the roster grid.&nbsp; When you turn off paging, your roster will be one long list of everyone in the guild, as opposed to the 35 names per page.&nbsp; This is useful for when you are doing editing on the grid, looking to compare values etc.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Again, this is only on the Custom Roster. To change over to the custom roster, log in as an Admin/Officer account and click the custom roster button that is above the grid.&nbsp; You can switch back and forth between standard and custom roster btw.&nbsp; That was patched a few weeks ago, I dont think I reported it though :)</P>
<P>Still really busy with work, but sneaking in little patches like this here and there.</P>

							Horizons + FFXI compatible - kinda 
							Wednesday, December 10, 2003 - 12:09:07 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I programmed up the Horizons and FFXI components last month before I went to Jacksonville, but never did enable it on the signup.&nbsp; LoL, I won`t lie, I forgot about it until I went to check if Horizons was released yet :)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, Horizons and FFXI guilds can sign up and use GuildWizard.&nbsp; Now, let me be clear, I need help from guilds of these games to help me develop tools that will be usefull to these games.&nbsp; I intend on playing Horizons, it looks like a game that I can really get into (I can see my wife and clients cringing already !! :)&nbsp;&nbsp; However, no matter if I play or not, I can`t think of everything..&nbsp; I suspect a lot of people playing, also play EQ, and I know EQ people aren`t shy to give suggestions :)</P>
<P>Anyway, Horizons + FFXI guilds, signup for a free trial.. see what you like and what you don`t and maybe shoot me an email suggesting some things.&nbsp; </P>

							Downtime today
							Tuesday, December 09, 2003 - 5:55:06 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Today I brought down the main guildwizard server to transfer some database files to one of my new servers... I couldn`t have the service up while the files were transferring, because if someone made changes to their site that required database storage, it would have been lost when the database came online.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Those with Custom domains (<A href="http://www.yourguildname.com">www.yourguildname.com</A>) might have experienced about half an hour of downtime, because of my dumb Linux box which is my DNS server decided to not accept my DNS changes :)&nbsp; I checked everyones domains, and it should be ok.</P>

							Forums moved to other server
							Sunday, December 07, 2003 - 12:55:49 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I moved the forums to a new server... this new server is pretty much the same, hardware wise, as the other one.. just the bandwidth pipe is A LOT bigger.&nbsp; It`s connected to multiple OC3 connections.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Honestly, I don`t think the problem really is bandwidth as much as the forums are just not working the way they are implemented.&nbsp; I am swamped with work (5 web-applications on the go, and have about 1 month to get them all done!), so my guildwizard programming time is kind of slim right now... but I am going to write my own forums for sure.</P>
<P>Everyone is going to have to re-log into the forums to reset their cookie I think.</P>

							Ninja patch .. re-order your buttons
							Sunday, November 30, 2003 - 10:28:02 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>After finding that error in the stored-procedure to re-order custom columns in the new Roster, I suspected that it was the same problem with the button re-order stored-procedure..&nbsp; I was right.&nbsp; I fixed it, and reset everyone`s button orders to default.</P>
<P>Everyone should reorder their buttons if they wanted them in different orders than the default.</P>

							Custom Roster - Edit function fixed + sort order
							Saturday, November 29, 2003 - 11:11:33 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P><STRONG>Small patch today to fix a couple bugs:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The Edit/Update function of the Custom&nbsp;Roster should be fixed now... well I am hoping anyway.&nbsp; The problem appears to have been a stored-procedure that was incorrectly adjusting the column index.&nbsp; I am pretty sure its fixed right now, but will check the logs for errors pertaining to this.&nbsp; I tested it for about 10 minutes and it seemed fine.. i don`t have time to test it longer, I have a ton of work to finish this weekend for work :( 
<LI>The column order tools should be working 
<LI>Fixed the column insert to not allow duplicate column types (not allow 2 Player Name columns etc) 
<LI>Fixed column insert to validate that a column Header Text was added 
<LI>Fixed column edit to require a valid Header Text 
<LI>I fixed something else too... i just cant remember!</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Upcoming features.. : (which might not be for a while... i have a lot of projects on the go for work)</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>I will probably start on a guild-bank type utility.. I`ve had a&nbsp;lot of requests for this lately.&nbsp; It`s not going to be EQ specific though, I want it to be like the custom roster where you can add your own columns/fields.. 
<LI>I am going to add support for the custom roster to have a View by Class view, similar to the standard roster.</LI></UL>
<P>When the above two are done.. I am probably going to start writing a new forum.&nbsp; I don`t like the existing forum setup at all.&nbsp; I don`t like the how its seperated and how you need 2 accounts (which I could fix, but it doesn`t address the other issues).&nbsp; I wan`t the guild-leader/officer to have TOTAL control.. right now it`s half-assed how you can edit/delete/sticky stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The forums were not written by me..&nbsp; and they are not written in my preferred programming language (C#).&nbsp; So instead of hacking around the existing code like I have been doing, I think it`s time for me to buckle down and make my own forum.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me say that the existing forum if it were used by 1 guild is a great forum.. it has a lot of features, and its well written.. I am not putting down the creator`s work.. he did a great job.&nbsp;&nbsp; It`s just not working out for how Guild Wizard is set up.</P>
<P>The new forums will be a large project that will take weeks just to get it in a workable state.&nbsp; At first I will only allow a few guilds to use it, so they can test it and report issues.&nbsp; When I feel it`s usable, I will disable the old forums and everyone will move over to the new ones...&nbsp; I am pretty sure I will be able to copy over all the posts, so nobody looses anything, btw.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

							Custom Roster deployed
							Tuesday, November 25, 2003 - 11:29:10 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well&nbsp;I finally got some time to test the custom roster out.&nbsp; To change over to the new custom roster, login as an admin/officer account and click the Custom Roster button.. confirm that you want to do it, and you will then start out with a Roster with only the Delete and Edit&nbsp; rows (they are fixed columns).&nbsp; From there, click on the Configure View link and add the columns you want.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, here is my patch blurb:</P>
<P>Custom Roster Info/Features:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You are able to add the columns you want to the roster</LI>
<LI>You can put your own heading description at the top of each column</LI>
<LI>You can change the left-to-right order of the columns that you add</LI>
<LI>You can fully sort data, ascending and descending, any columns - even custom columns</LI>
<LI>New Base columns can be added anytime by me, as I get suggestions for them</LI>
<LI>The grid is only binding the columns added, which is very efficient</LI>
<LI>Your columns are cached, which means the software isn`t calling the database each time your grid is shown, bigtime performance increase.</LI>
<LI>You can set security permissions on each column, even custom columns</LI>
<LI>Column headers can have images instead of just the text (broken, will fix next patch)</LI>
<LI>Support for other games will be done with this Roster.&nbsp; Infact, I will likely make it the default Roster for any new guilds joining, once I see there are no bugs.</LI></UL>
<P>As for the FFXI support.. it`s there.&nbsp; Currently I have 2 guilds set as FFXI guilds, and they can start fooling around.&nbsp; Honestly the only difference is the Races, Classes, and Secondary Classes.. </P>
						</p>
					
						<p class="newsHeader">
							Erm.. Dude? WTF are you?
							Sunday, November 23, 2003 - 11:55:59 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Whoa!&nbsp; Back in town finally..&nbsp; I flew in from Jacksonville tonight, and finally am just getting settled back in.&nbsp; I intended on deploying this next patch before I left, but it wasn`t fully tested by the time I had to leave, and I didn`t want to leave the service screwed up, especially since I couldnt fix it remotely.</P>
<P>I have the next patch pretty much finsished.&nbsp; I have to test it and resolve some minor quirks, but am 99% sure it will be ready tommorow.&nbsp; The patch will be the new custom roster, as well as support for FFXI, and Horizons guilds.</P>
<P>I will post a full patch description when I deploy it.. </P>
