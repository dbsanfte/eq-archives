<P>As I`ve mentioned in the past I will be implementing a subscription model for Guild Wizard very soon.&nbsp; The price has not been determined, but I am definatly going to allow those who do not want to pay, to still be able to use the service.&nbsp; Guilds who do not want to pay will have some banners (no popups), and probably limited use of the service.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What will be limited?&nbsp; I don`t know yet, I was thinking to allow the roster, news, and gallery(without filemanager access).&nbsp; File-manager (the ability to upload your pictures) will definatly be a subscription item, as will the DKP tools and the forums.&nbsp; Those items are the biggest resource hogs on my server.&nbsp; </P>
<P>BTW, guilds who just signed in the last 30 days will not be affected... The model will allow a free 100% use of the service for the first 30 days, so you can decide if you like it or not.</P>
<P>More on this in the next day or so...&nbsp; </P></font></span>

<P>On the topic of forums, I am probably also going to create a service to delete forums that havent been used in 30 days or so.. Some people ask for forums for the guild then never use.. so i want to create a service which will weed out those forums and delete them... thats down the road, after i create the automated forum setup, and the figure out how to give moderators the permissions discussed before.</P></font></span>

<P>The new color configuration page has about 50 different options to configure!&nbsp; It`s much more involved than my previous configuration page, you have a lot more control over the different elements of the page.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On a different subject, I neglected to mention that if you want a custom URL (<A href="http://www.yourguildname.com">www.yourguildname.com</A>), I will be offerring that service as well.&nbsp; More details on that in a future update, if you want more info you can email me.&nbsp; I can register domains at a lot less than what the regular domain registry companys (Network solutions etc) offer.</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl9_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I am about 80% finished coding the new color configuration page changes.&nbsp; I`ve decided to change it to a Cascading Style Sheet model, which is dynamically loaded based on the preferences you set.&nbsp; So in non-geek terms, you will have more control over the colors, borders, buttons, links colors etc.&nbsp; A lot of the changes are transparent, meaning the changes are behind the scenes on the server mostly.&nbsp; One thing this allows me to provide is the ability to have premade skins for guilds to choose from, and work with.</P>
<P>One thing though, when I deploy the new code, you will have to spend a couple minutes configuring your colors again.&nbsp; Your site will default to a black skin color scheme... I will send an email to all the admins letting them know to change the colors, when I deploy the code (possibly today, most likely Monday though)</P></font></span>
