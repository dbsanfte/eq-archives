						<h2>
							Guild Raid Encounter Manager deployed
							Monday, November 22, 2004 - 10:03:28 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Late last night I deployed the new <STRONG>Guild Raid Encounter Manager</STRONG>.&nbsp; Features of the new <STRONG>guild raid encounter manager</STRONG>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You can do all aspects of <STRONG>guild raid </STRONG>encounter management right on the one manager 
<LI>Deleting encounters is back in. BE CAREFUL and make sure you read the confirmation box before you start deleting stuff.&nbsp; When you delete an encounter, you are going to be deleting <STRONG>guild raids </STRONG>attached to the encounter.&nbsp; Moreover, you will delete any purchases tied to the deleted encounters.&nbsp; If you dont want that, you can use the new feature to disable an encounter (described next) 
<LI>You can now set an encounter as "Inactive".&nbsp; By doing this, it will be removed from your Active <STRONG>Guild Raid Encounter </STRONG>List.&nbsp; So&nbsp;when entering raids/purchases, that encounter will not show up.&nbsp; Setting to inactive will allow you to maintain old raids/purchases attached to the encounter. 
<LI>I added an optional field to allow you to tie a picture to an encounter.&nbsp; This will be tied into the new encounter "Front end" which will be a lot more robust that whats there now, which is merely a boring list of encounters.&nbsp; You basically choose the image from the file manager and it gets tied to the encounter.&nbsp; Then, when I redevelop the <STRONG>encounter/raid </STRONG>front-end , you will be able to flag if you want to display the "Encounter Icon/Picture" on the display screen.... i think its going to spice up the reporting a bit.</LI></UL>
<P>Oh, I also created a side navigation bar for quick access to the other (new) admin panels as I create them.&nbsp; I was getting annoyed myself when adding an encounter, and then wanting to tie a raid to it, I had to open the raid manager from the parent page..&nbsp;&nbsp; I will add the new Purchase &amp; Item manager when I create them.</P>
<P>On the weekend I did a few ninja patches on some bugs.. also added support for the /who list raid entry for EQ1 guilds.&nbsp; I didnt realize guilds still used it to manager their raids :)</P>
<P>Next up on the hit list is the Purchase &amp; Item managers.. then I will get going on the front-end pages like the <STRONG>Roster, Raid List, Profiles </STRONG>etc.&nbsp; </P>

							New DKP Guild Raid Manager
							Friday, November 19, 2004 - 2:50:42 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I deployed the new <STRONG>Guild DKP Raid Manager </STRONG>a little while ago.&nbsp; The new manager fixes a lot of things that was wrong with the old panels, and brings together a lot of the functions that were spread out among the various pages that displayed guild raid information.&nbsp; Here is some of the highlights of the guild raid manager:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You can select <STRONG>multiple raids</STRONG> at once and delete them 
<LI>When you delete a raid, you no longer have to remove purchases attached to it, the new raid manager will take care of everything.&nbsp; When you remove a <STRONG>raid</STRONG>, the guild <STRONG>raid manager</STRONG> will now take away the points given to members listed as attending the raid, as well as remove purchases for the raid and reimburse the points spent on the pruchase 
<LI>You can now re-assign the encounter tied to a raid by clicking the Edit icon on the raid list in the <STRONG>Raid Manager</STRONG> 
<LI>You can now change the point value of a raid and have the change update all members points automatically.&nbsp; So if you entered a raid at a DKP value of 2 but later decide it should have been a value of 5 instead, all people in the raid will be awarded 3 extra points automatically. 
<LI>I added a <STRONG>Raid Note field</STRONG> (optional) so that you can add notes to a raid.&nbsp; Currently the raid display page doesnt use this field, but it will when I re-do that page, so I put it in there for that time 
<LI>A super-fly-TNT high-tech calendar will popup when you click the icon to select the date.&nbsp; Seriously though, you have to manually specify the date now because I was getting way too much bad data in from parsing the log files.. its just a lot simplier this way. 
<LI>You can Add and Remove players from a <STRONG>raid</STRONG> on the same page now in the <STRONG>Raid Manager</STRONG>.&nbsp; Click the Edit icon for the raid and you will see the options to remove/add members to/from the raid 
<LI>You can select multiple users to be removed from a raid now 
<LI>When you upload a <STRONG>Raid Dump file</STRONG>, the checkboxes on the attendance grid are checked by default 
<LI>I removed support for the old /who list batch entry.&nbsp; <STRONG>Raid dump file</STRONG> support has been in a long time so i see no need to support this anymore.&nbsp; 
<LI>The batch file upload is 100% setup now for any other file formats that might surface from <STRONG>EQ2</STRONG> or <STRONG>World Of Warcraft</STRONG>.&nbsp; 
<LI>The layout of the screens are a lot more logical
<LI>I removed editing functions on the <STRONG>Raid List</STRONG> pages.&nbsp; I want to contain everything to the <STRONG>Raid Manager</STRONG> page(s).&nbsp; The <STRONG>Raid List</STRONG> pages are going to be re-developed next week or so, but wanted to get those functions out of there until then.</LI></UL>
<P>I will continue re-developing these dinosaur admin panels.&nbsp; The Encounter panel will be next just to get it out of the way (simple panel compared to the others) and then will get to the item panel.&nbsp; The item panel is going to take a while.. i want to spend some time on that to possibly integrate with some of the data sites like <STRONG>Magelo, Allakhazam</STRONG>, etc.&nbsp; I also want to make the item listing screen configurable so you can put your guild logo`s on the item view.</P>

							Small patch last night - New Guild Raid Manager Coming
							Thursday, November 18, 2004 - 11:05:03 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I did a small patch last night to the new <STRONG>Guild Member Manager</STRONG>.&nbsp; I added paging to the guild member listing grid due to performance issues.&nbsp; Guilds with more than 75 members or so were experiencing very poor performance with all the info being thrown at the browser.&nbsp; Honestly I shouldn`t have even attempted that, I kind of figured that paging would be inevitable. I am working on a new <STRONG>Guild Raid Manager</STRONG> now.&nbsp; I have declared war on the cheesy admin panels that are there now (hey they are two years old, cut me some slack! :)&nbsp; Seriously though, time to address those guild raid management panels, encounter management and most importantly the Item/Loot listings.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I figure the new guild raid manager will take a couple days, just wanted to give a heads up.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>WOW Guilds who do raiding</STRONG>, if you have any suggestions of some things you would like to see, let me know please.&nbsp; As far as I understand,<STRONG> World Of Warcraft</STRONG> doesnt have any type of raid file dump for attendance?&nbsp; If any of the WOW gurus (/nudge Vularm) want to let me know if anything has changed, it would be appreciated.</P>

							New Guild Member Manager
							Wednesday, November 17, 2004 - 4:36:26 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just deployed a very significant patch to the administration section for all guilds.&nbsp; The new <STRONG>Guild Member Manager</STRONG> is management console that replaces the Add Player, Restore Player, Add Officer, Change Member Password pages, as well as all the edit functions of the <STRONG>Guild&nbsp;Roster</STRONG>(s).</P>
<P>Features of this new management console:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allows manual entry of new members 
<LI>Allows batch entry of members from an <STRONG>EQ dump file or CSV/TDF file </STRONG>
<LI>You can multi-delete users from the guild on the new Member Listing 
<LI>You can edit ALL data regarding a user on the Member Listing 
<LI>You can permenantly delete a user from the guild now (ahem bout time) 
<LI>You can set users to be shown on the Guild Roster or not 
<LI>You can now add users to be listed as Allys or Recruits.. these users are not members but can still be awarded <STRONG>DKP points </STRONG>etc. 
<LI>You can add Alternate Characters and tie them to a main character 
<LI>Officer management can be done through the officer manager or you can use the Edit Member button on the Member Listing to set the users "role" 
<LI>The Rosters are not longer editable.. all editing will be done in the Guild Member manager from now on.&nbsp; The Rosters are going to get their arses kicked into shape soon with a very significant update. 
<LI>You can reset user`s passwords in the <STRONG>Guild Member manager</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>I will probably post some FAQ + How To`s on the forums later to do some common tasks with the new admin panels.</P>

							World of Warcraft (WoW and Everquest2 (Eq2) coming soon!
							Tuesday, November 02, 2004 - 8:34:57 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well, we are pretty close to WoW and EQ2 being released and a lot of people are getting excited (me included!).&nbsp; WoW guilds are starting to sign up in droves the last few days, and there are some nice WoW guild websites coming up.&nbsp; I am not partial to WoW, as I havent even played it yet, but the WoW screen shots look really cool!&nbsp; I was in the Everquest 2 beta, so I am pretty familiar how it looks.&nbsp; EQ2 is a great game, it`s going to be tough for me to choose which one to play.</P>
<P>Anyway.&nbsp; Now that WoW and EQ2 are so close, and my current projects should be wrapping up by next week, I expect to release some pretty solid patching the next few weeks.&nbsp; Specifically, the Player Profile pages need their butts whipped into shape.&nbsp; They are not really friendly to WoW or EQ2 guilds, which needs to be addressed.&nbsp; WoW guilds have no use for fields like AA points, or Magelo Link (yet?), so I need to create an interface similar to the Custom Roster admin panel which allows you to name your columns to what makes sense to your game/guild.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Speaking of Guild Rosters...&nbsp; I need to create some alternate views for the custom guild Roster page.&nbsp; I have some ideas based on some excellent user feedback, and expect to be able to implement pretty much everything suggested.</P>
<P>The Item viewer is also going to get some work.&nbsp; It`s going to be fully skinable just like the rest of the service, with a much easier interface to create and import item statistics from the various data feeds around.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyhow, I just wanted to give everyone an update on what`s coming up in the next patch(s).&nbsp; As I said, I just have to clear my current workload of projects and then Guild Wizard is going to get some programming time alotted.</P>

							PayPal option for payments
							Thursday, October 14, 2004 - 12:46:35 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Our credit card processor continues to have problems with connectivity, so I enabled PayPal payments for those having trouble paying.&nbsp; The payment isn`t recurring or anything like that, it`s the same as paying with our payment form.&nbsp; The only thing is, you have to put your guild address and what you are paying for in the Note field, as we have to manually process the payments.&nbsp; If we see a lot of people using the PayPal option, I will program everything to go automatically.</P>
<P>If you can, do use the payment form instead of the PayPal as it costs us less.&nbsp; Also, the payments are applied to the account instantly.</P>

							Small patch and new guild application feature
							Wednesday, October 13, 2004 - 9:59:37 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just sent a small patch for an issue with the guild application page.&nbsp; I basically increased the maximum size of the description field.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also fixed a small bug with the Guild Gallery editor.&nbsp; Descriptions added to images uploaded were not being accepted if it had a space in it, which was not intended.&nbsp; I fixed it.</P>
<P>I also made a small feature addition to the Guild Application component.&nbsp; You many now send the application to multiple recipients if you want.&nbsp; To configure the application to be sent to multiple recipients (such as other officers of the guild), you simply have to seperate the addresses with a semi-colon (;) .&nbsp; </P>

							Profile editor fix for WoW guilds
							Tuesday, October 12, 2004 - 10:18:34 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P><STRONG>World of Warcraft (WoW) guild</STRONG> members should be able to update their profiles now.&nbsp; I`ve been noticing an error in the logs every so often regarding the profile editor, but could never reproduce it.&nbsp; Turns out it only affected <STRONG>WoW guilds</STRONG> because of a guild setting I had in place only for World of Warcraft guilds.&nbsp; Anyway, it was a 2 second fix and it seems to work.</P>
<P>Speaking of the profile editor, that is *really* due for a re-write.&nbsp; I was looking at it today when I was fixing that problem, and my goodness there is some old code there.&nbsp; It doesnt even use a lot of the nice configuration settings I had developed when the engine was re-written last year.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Needless to say that the guild member profile editor is the next patch.&nbsp; I am going to have really spend some time on this one, and I think the admins/members are going to like what I come up with.&nbsp; If not, Lord knows the admins will let me know :)</P>

							Payment processing
							Friday, October 08, 2004 - 11:23:35 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well I guess our payment processor is the latest target of a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.&nbsp; I`ve been hearing about it all week from various clients of mine that there is a huge campaign against a lot of the payment processors, and I guess it`s my processor`s turn..&nbsp;&nbsp; I *think* it`s fixed now, as they sent their customers a work-around + alternate servers to use.&nbsp; I have updated the payment code to use the new servers and it seems to be working now.</P>
<P>I apologize if anyone was inconvenienced by this.&nbsp; If anyone continues to have trouble with the payment page, PLEASE email me.&nbsp; I will, of course, extend any trial memberships that are expire, and having trouble paying subscriptions.</P>

							Guild gallery upgraded
							Wednesday, September 29, 2004 - 11:50:09 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just got finished deploying a complete re-make of the guild photo gallery page.&nbsp; The old guild gallery was, very simplistic with next to no features.&nbsp; The new guild photo gallery has some very nice features to make organizing and viewing screenshots/photo`s very nice.</P>
<P>Some key features of the new guild photo gallery:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Albums allow you to group images into logical sections.&nbsp; If you want to organize all your raid images in one album, another gallery for guild member images, and another for guild events, you can do it all in the new <STRONG>Guild Gallery Manager </STRONG>(login with your admin account to see the link) 
<LI>You have a LOT more control over the various settings and display of your gallery with the new guild gallery.&nbsp; You can customize how many thumbnail images are displayed per page, how many columns, as well as specifying images for the Next &amp; Previous image viewer.&nbsp; Moreover, the various structural elements of the new gallery are fully CSS ready for the Guild Style Editor for even more customization!&nbsp; I fooled around with the gallery you can make 10 galleries look VERY different from eachother with the various settings!&nbsp;&nbsp; No cookie cutter look here, thx :) 
<LI>You can enable or disable Paging on the thumbnail listing of an Album.&nbsp; Of course, you can also specify the page size (how many thumbnails per page) if you have paging enabled. 
<LI>THANK GOD ALMIGHTY (whoever your God might be) that the thumbnails DO NOT reload on every page load anymore.&nbsp; A major hurdle with dynamically generated images like thumbnails is that most browsers wont cache them locally.&nbsp; I developed a custom HTTP Handler to handle it, some real cool stuff for those geeks who have the slightest clue about what I am talking about.&nbsp; I developed a component that dynamically generates the images for thumbnails etc, and properly complies with the browsers to cache the images locally.&nbsp; 
<LI>When you are browsing pictures by clicking the Previous &amp; Next buttons to cycle through images, you will notice that the images are changed without the page refreshing.&nbsp; Anyone who has ever used Coopermine gallery knows how slow and annoying it is to cycle through images. 
<LI>You can set Permissions on each album.&nbsp; You can set albums to be viewed by Everyone, Guildmembers or just Admins/Officers.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P>One thing that isnt a feature, but kind of a side effect, is that you will have to create an Album to put your existing images into.&nbsp; Don`t flip when you go to your Guild Gallery page and see the message "No Albums Configured".&nbsp; You just have to go into the Gallery Admin page and create an Album.&nbsp; Then go into the Image section and assign the images in the Uncatagorized Group to your newly created Album.&nbsp; </P>
