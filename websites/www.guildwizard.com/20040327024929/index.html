<P>I know I said that I might allow the old forums to continue to run, but with both running, it`s a big waste of server resources.&nbsp;Now that guilds are really starting to use the new forums, I am seeing that it`s just not going to workout with both forums running.&nbsp; Also, the old forums are starting to act up again with that dumb connection warning.... </P>
<P>I figure I would mention it now, to give those using the old forums a few weeks to let it sink in.... some of the guilds have already started using the new forums.&nbsp; Some are continuing to use them until I turn them off... which is fine.&nbsp; Like I said, I won`t force anyone until the new forums have all the features I want, and they are working 100%.</P></font></span>

<P>Here is some of the stuff I added on the new forums today:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed the Member Role, so pages secured by the Members Only permission will work 
<LI>Thread list page will now show unread messages, by popular demand 
<LI>Fixed Sticky and Lock Threads so Officers can do it.. i had it set to Admin account only 
<LI>I fixed a validation problem that was preventing some posts from going through 
<LI>The member list in the Private Message page is now sorted by name to find the recipient name easier 
<LI>Admin/Officer action log is working (this was done yesterday) 
<LI>Fixed a bug which didnt allow Display names if someone in another guild had same Display Name, it now only checks display names in your own guild, the way it`s supposed to. 
<LI>Tuned some indexes on the database.&nbsp; Probably in vein, as I really cant get a good representation of what I should be tuning until more guilds start using the new forums. 
<LI>Locked threads now properly show the locked icon in the thread list (still have to put locked button on message view though) 
<LI>The forum order tool (to re-order your forums in the list) works now 
<LI>The admin grid in the Manage Forums area that shows the forum list with the current security level will now show the description instead of just a number (Will show “Members Only“ instead of &nbsp;“2“)</LI></UL>
<P>The forums are starting to come together.. there is only about 5-6 guilds using them since I deployed them yesterday.. i need about 50 of you guilds to start using them so I can start performance tuning though..&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will continue trying to add the core features of the forums and kill any bugs that I get reported.&nbsp; After the weekend, I anticipate having very little time to do any work on the forums.. I am likely starting on a very large project, which is about a 2 month programming job.&nbsp; That doesn`t mean I wont do anything for two months, it just means I won`t have as much time, as my client is kind of anxious to get this application done (aren`t they all? :)</P></font></span>

<P>Admins/officers should really like the amount of control you have over the forums now..&nbsp; it`s a lot better.</P>
<P>You can&nbsp;fool get to the forums by going to the /forum/ directory in your site.. so it would be <A href="http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/forums/">http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/forums/</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .. Make sure you are logged in as an admin or officer so you can add forums and use the Admin panels</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl9_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Wow, finally got a night where I could spend a little while programming the forums.&nbsp; I actually got a lot done.. i pretty much did all the Private Messsages part of the forums.. i designed all the objects, and created all the stored procedures for the database, and got the presentation pages done too.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also changed the colors on the beta forums, from the funky red to black..&nbsp; I was getting teased too much so I figured it was time to change it.&nbsp; BTW, the forums follow the same color scheme as your base site.. i shouldn`t say `base site`, as it`s 100% part of the site now, so it inherits the stylesheet like any&nbsp;other page.</P>
<P>I also spent a little time on the User objects..&nbsp; here is low down so far.&nbsp; Your guild members will NOT have forum access, until you give it to them.&nbsp; Giving them access is as easy as clicking a check box next to the people`s names you want to give access to, and clicking the button.&nbsp; I don`t want to give people access without the guildleader/officer giving to them.&nbsp; Now, people will be able to sign up to your forums (non-guildmembers/visitors etc).. they will fill out a form requesting a username/password etc.. and they have to validate their email like the other forums.&nbsp; I am probably going to not allow them to post until you (the guildleader) approves the account... maybe I will set that as an option.</P>
<P>Anyway... a few people have emailed me asking me to make the forums available for use before they are 100% done.. they don`t want to keep using the old forums if the posts are going to not carry over, which is understandable.&nbsp; The only thing I can say, is I will do my best to get it to that point soon.&nbsp; It`s really not that far off, so hopefully I can find a few more hours to do it.</P></font></span>
