							New Control : Fading Slide Show
							Thursday, July 22, 2004 - 5:18:47 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I created a new Control that will allow you to create a fading slide show.&nbsp; I got the idea from&nbsp; <A href="http://www.shadowedstrife.net">http://www.shadowedstrife.net</A>&nbsp; who has it on their guild wizard site (it`s on the right side).&nbsp; Like any other control, you create it in the Control Editor and select Slide Show Control from the Control Type List.</P>
<P>A few things you should be aware of:&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>When you Add images to the slide show, the list is NOT SAVED until you click the Save button.&nbsp; Just because it`s in the grid, doesnt mean it will be saved, so please remember that.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>You really should have all the images the same size.&nbsp; You can resize images in pretty much any image editor.</LI>
<LI>The fade effect doesnt work in Mozilla browsers, but the control itself should (images should change on time etc)</LI>
<LI>You can select the duration of each image being shown by selecting the desired duration from the list.&nbsp; Default is 3 seconds.</LI></OL>

							Fixed login cookie, Submit template function
							Friday, July 16, 2004 - 11:29:06 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I fixed the login cookie issue from before.&nbsp; You dont have to login everytime you visit now, which was pretty annoying.</P>
<P>I added a <STRONG>Submit Your Template</STRONG> function to allow people who like making templates, to be able to share them with other guilds.&nbsp; It doesn`t just submit the stylesheet, it submits all your control positions, the images attached to them, it basically clones your look/feel.&nbsp; After you submit a template, and after its approved, other guilds can use your template.&nbsp; So, if you have design skills, use em, and share em :)</P>

							Todays Guild Wizard Patch
							Thursday, July 15, 2004 - 11:22:25 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Today`s patch added a new Control type, and added edit support for existing controls.. as well as a few bug fixes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>New control: <STRONG>Embeded Page - </STRONG>This control creates a Custom Page that embeds another web-sites content in it.&nbsp; For example, lets say that you want to have a page that has a live video feed from another service you can simply specify the URL (address) of the page, give it an ID, and the guild wizard system will create a custom page for you.&nbsp; Create a button for it (it automatically adds the custom page to your links list in the Control Editor too), and you are all set.</LI>
<LI>You can now Edit all Custom Controls that you create.&nbsp; Pretty self explainatory in the Control Editor.&nbsp; Click the edit icon for the item you want to edit, and away you go.</LI>
<LI>There is a new style element for the forum message page.&nbsp; The column that holds the avatar is now able to be styled in the Style Editor.&nbsp; You can give it a different background color, border etc.</LI>
<LI>I fixed a problem with the Delete Private Message button.. it was only deleting the first message.&nbsp; Its working correctly now.</LI></UL>

							Dude, two upgrades in one day??
							Monday, July 12, 2004 - 11:58:09 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well, you can tell that I am not playing any MMORPGs at the present time :)&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent tonight doing some nice tweaks on the new style editor, based on a couple peoples suggestions (and a few peoples whining/death threats) hehe</P>
<OL>
<LI>When you adjust the width of the Left or Right panel, the Center panel`s margin will automatically adjust accordingly.&nbsp; So, if you make the left panel width 400pixels, the Center panel will automatically have a 400pixel margin.&nbsp; Good suggestion whoever sent it to me. 
<LI>I fixed a little bug when you type in a URL for the background image of stylesheet item.&nbsp; Before it was always assuming the image was in your guilds image directory, which is fine for most cases but I can see it would irritate an advanced user wanting to use an image on their own webserver.. so the system will check if a valid URL is entered, if not it defaults to look for that image in your guilds directory. 
<LI>Ok those who styled their guild site entirely with the visual editor is going to hate me when they read this.&nbsp; You can now copy style settings between elements to ensure a consistent look/feel throughout your elements.&nbsp; For advanced users, its still easier to just hop into the stylesheet and cut/paste the style settings, but for normal users this is going to save a LOT of time.<BR><BR>Example:&nbsp; Lets say you want all your grid headers to look the same as your Roster header.. no problem now.&nbsp; Just select Roster Header from the new dropdownlist to Copy From, and then select the Raid List Header, for example.&nbsp; Click the Copy To button and the Raid List Header automatically inherits the style settings for the Roster Header.&nbsp; Rinse and Repeat for the various other elements that build the grids, and you have a consistent look/feel without having to remember colors, borders, font-sizes, padding, margins etc.&nbsp; Just remember, you can *still* customize it after you inherit a style, its just a base to work with.<BR><BR>This is going to save a lot of time for button styling too.. design your first buttons style, and then copy the style to all your other buttons.. </LI></OL>
<P>Thanks for all the suggestions from the various guild leaders / web masters out there.&nbsp; I really appreciate the help to make Guild Wizard better.&nbsp; Believe me guys/gals, I am on your side.. if you want something added, changed, altered, or removed.. let me know!&nbsp; </P>

							Forum categories implemented
							Monday, July 12, 2004 - 4:35:17 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just deployed a patch that allows you to group forums into Categories.&nbsp; So, if you have 5 public forums, 2 for Members and 2 for Officers, you can group them together and even set visibility settings to the category.</P>
<P>For example, the lets say you have 2 Officer forums, and you create an Officer Only category... it gets seperated from the other categories, and if you set it that only Officers/Admins can see it, the whole category gets hidden to non-Officer/Admins.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You create Categories in the forum admin section (same place you do all your forum administration).&nbsp; You create the Category first, then go to the Forum Manager and either create new forums in the Category, or edit existing forums to be moved into the newly created Category.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the Category Manager, you can also set the display order of the categories much the same as you set forum order in the Forum Manager.</P>
<P>You can set the Category Header style in the Style Editor under the Forum List Page section..&nbsp; Remember, when you set styles for things like this, it doesnt just have to be the font color and background color.. get creative with the background images, border size/color etc!</P>

							Style & Layout backup/restore 
							Friday, July 09, 2004 - 5:49:57 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well at the suggestion of Tilithien of&nbsp; <A href="http://ilmr.guildwizard.com/">Inverse Logic</A>&nbsp;, I created a back-up/restore function for the style sheet and layout editor.&nbsp; The reason for this is, if you use a template, your layout positions get overwritten, as well as your style sheet.&nbsp; Not to mention if you dont like how you ended up editing your styles, it can be a pain in the buttocks to get it back the way it was.</P>
<P>So, before you start fooling around with your nice layout/colors, hit the Save Look/Feel icon in the Style Editor.&nbsp; This will save your stylesheet, control layouts, and all other look/feel options.&nbsp; If you do something that you don`t like, simple restore your website`s look/feel to the last save point!</P>
<P>Keep the suggestions coming in guys/gals, it really helps me out to make the service better when people make suggestion.</P>

							Todays patch
							Friday, July 09, 2004 - 2:05:48 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well another day, another patch :</P>
<UL>
<LI>Forum admins can now edit/delete Registered User accounts .&nbsp; These are accounts that are not roster accounts.&nbsp; These accounts are from users who sign up, usually recruits.&nbsp; The link for this panel is the the Forum Manager, under the Registered Users link</LI>
<LI>I fixed the width problem with the item stats viewer</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem with the roster, raid, and purchase list permission.&nbsp; It wasnt letting anyone in that shouldnt see it, it was locking out everyone but the admin when certain conditions were met.&nbsp; This must have been like that for a long time because I didn`t touch this in the last patch.. nobody must have noticed :)</LI>
<LI>Added some validation for non everquest guilds on the custom roster</LI>
<LI>I moved the subscribe button to go on the top right, instead of the left.&nbsp; It was interfering with the Admin pages link in some cases</LI>
<LI>Guilds who have a custom domain, and registered it before last year, their guild domain and DNS server has been moved to another server.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Caught a nice performance hit on a very important method .. I recoded it, and instead of taking .01 seconds to execute, it takes .005!! yay! :)&nbsp; Seriously though, under heavy load it will make a big difference, so I spent the time on it.</LI></UL>
<P>I will probably start fooling around with the raids attendance now.&nbsp; I just want to add a manual way to create a raid, without the log file.. so non-EQ guilds can do their attendance.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I do have some other stuff planned, but its 2:30am and I am too tired to type</P>

							<H2 align=center>Style And Layout Patch In Progress</H2>
<P>The Guild Wizard service is being patched for the new style and layout editor upgrade. This is a VERY significant upgrade in the amount of control you will have over the look and feel of your site. There are help files on the 3 new style/layout pages to help you along, but here is a quick overview of what you will have to do when the server comes back up:</P>
<OL>
<LI>You will notice that your site look very different because everyone is using a base template to start.&nbsp; The starting template has horizontal navigation (along the top header) instead of the usual vertical navigation along the left side.&nbsp; 
<LI>Click the login button and login with your administrator/officer account 
<LI>You will notice an Admin Pages link on the top left or right side of your screen, depending on your screen resolution. 
<LI>This new Admin navigation panel contains all the Admin pages that are not linked from containing pages. 
<LI>The links to the new Style Editors are at the top of the list.&nbsp; Each page has a help file explaining what they do. The icon for the help file is right beside the page title for each page.</LI></OL>
<P>The new system is VERY different from the old one.&nbsp; It`s MUCH MUCH MUCH more powerful in what you can do to control the look and feel of your site... BUT, it can also be a little overwhelming with all the choices now.&nbsp; Take some time to fool around with the new options, and remember that if you screw up, you can always just reload a template and start over.. its no big deal.</P>
<P>Advanced users who know how to use CSS will be pleased to know they can work directly with their CSS file.&nbsp; Make sure you read the help file about the structure and the importance of maintaining the format of it.&nbsp; If you choose to use the Advanced editor, and you screw up, you can load a template to start over (or be smart and cut/paste the text before you start working on it :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep in mind that I do not have time to train anyone on CSS.. please use Google if you want to learn the CSS.</P>
<P><STRONG>Changes To Expired Trials/Subscriptions</STRONG></P>
<P>I am scrapping the banners for expired trials/subscriptions. If your account expires, you are brought to a subscription page. If want an extension, there is a link to email me.. the banners are dumb, and I dont believe they serve any purpose.</P>
<P><STRONG>Changes To PayPal Subscriptions and Payments</STRONG></P>
<P>In the next few weeks I am going to stop using PayPal for subscriptions.&nbsp; I don`t like the recurring subscription model, because I *know* people forget to cancel their subscription, and people get charged for something they arent even using, which I dont like.&nbsp; I will change the system over to my company`s credit card processing system which will be a one time charge... when it runs out, you simply pay again when you want.&nbsp; If you arent using the site when the subscription expires, you are NOT charged for anything.&nbsp; I think its a much fairer model.. </P>

							Still working !
							Monday, July 05, 2004 - 4:58:45 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>The layout/style update is still being worked on.&nbsp; I really wanted to deploy it on the weekend, but I didnt feel right deploying it when there was still some quirks with some browsers.&nbsp; Basically, Internet Explorer 6 has this dumb bug that doesnt interpret Table Cell widths properly when set as a percentage....&nbsp; in Mozilla based browsers things liked great, in IE6 browsers it looked odd on some pages.&nbsp; I wasnt about to send the update with this issue, it would have irritated me.</P>
<P>Anyway, what I did was change the whole system to a pure CSS layout.&nbsp; So, no tables for the layout, its all done in the cascading stylesheet.&nbsp; Now, it looks good in Mozilla AND IE6.&nbsp; </P>
<P>With that out of the way, I can now continue working on the 4-5 templates I want to setup to get yall started.. then update the core Guild Wizard server component that handles new subscriptions (I have to convert it to setup new guilds with the new stylesheets/templates etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have to make some basic documentation for everyone, so they will know how to restyle their site.</P>
<P>I`ve been getting some emails from City of Hero guilds asking me to include support for CoH.&nbsp; I will do that after the style patch.&nbsp; To implement City of Heroes wont take long, but I want to get the patch done first before I worry about CoH.</P>
