<P>Anyway, I also found a bug on the profile editor.. some guild who were in their trial period were not able to submit or upload changes on the profile editor.&nbsp; This should be fixed now... also found a bug which was not updating the roster/item/purchase config settings in the cache until it was reset (which defeats the purpose of caching).. thats fixed now.</P>
<P>Tommorow night I think I am going to start the Admin`s FAQ page.. it will be a FAQ (go figure) list of common questions on setting up/configuring your site.. as well as some neat tricks and suggestions for your site.&nbsp; This is LONG overdue..&nbsp; </P></font></span>

<P>Thanks to the emails/reports I got from guildleaders, i was able to fix these problems:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Filemanager now properly creates a directory the first time its accessed.&nbsp; I forgot to enable this when I was finished testing. 
<LI>Gallery uploads will work properly now, for newly created guildsites 
<LI>Changes made to visible items on the Roster, Item View, Raid View, and encounter view will show up immediatly after changing them.&nbsp; I forgot to refresh the cache when I did the update. 
<LI>Deleted players will be uncached from the roster when deleted/restored 
<LI>Fixed bug with logo/banner not uploading properly for newly created guild sites</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp; I am sure there are other things I have to tweak/fix I will fix them as I get the reports, or as I catch them.&nbsp; Thanks for the reports/help so far!</P></font></span>

I received a few reports that file manager isnt working properly which I will look into right now.</P>
<P>If you emailed me in the last 2 days, please allow me till tonight to early tommorow to get back to you.&nbsp; I have about 30 guildwizard emails, and about 30 other emails to answer tonight .. so it might have to wait till the morning.</P>
<P>As for the update, its running great!&nbsp; Memory usage is literally cut 5 fold!&nbsp; Its incredible how much less resources I am using now which really is great news.. I can really start implementing some new features now, whithout fear of taxing the server`s resources too much (BTW, Guildwizard is running on a dedicated server now.. There was 3-4 other sites running on the same server, they are on a different server now).</P>
<P>Will post another update late tonight or tommorow when I catch up.</P></font></span>

<P>Anyway, `nothing` is going to change on the front-end by doing this.&nbsp; However, unless I figure something out, you might have to repoint your images for your news items.&nbsp; This is not for sure, but I figured I would mention it in advance.&nbsp; Instead of referring to your images as <A href="http://yoursite.guildwizard/pics/image.jpg">http://yoursite.guildwizard/pics/image.jpg</A> after the /pics will be your guild id.&nbsp; <A href="http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/pics/728/image.jpg">http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/pics/728/image.jpg</A>&nbsp; will be the new format (or simply /pics/728/image.jpg) will work fine.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Again, you MIGHT have to repoint some images.. this isnt for sure yet.&nbsp; I have already written some scripts to copy over some stuff.. if I can do it for images, i will. </P>
<P>I already have some sites running on this new engine for test.&nbsp; Its running very well.&nbsp; I expect everyone to be switched over sometime next week, as I don`t want to do it without testing sufficiently.</P></font></span>

<P>The re-write above was a necessary step towards my rewrite of the raid-manager.&nbsp; I am going to make the management more intuitive.. when I say management i mean the ability to add/delete raids, items, purchases, and assign DKP points manually.&nbsp; You can do all this now, ofcourse, but I want to make it a bit easier.</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl7_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I did a complete overhaul on the calendar system last night.&nbsp;The colors for the calendar are fixed at Royal Blue for now. This is temporary, as I am going to add an entry in the style-sheets for the calendars.&nbsp; </P>
<P>One of the biggest improvements, is now you will see a short description of the event for that day right on the calendar.. you can fit upto 70 characters on each day..&nbsp; and the user can click the day for more details on it.&nbsp; Also, days with events are in red to show there is something up that day.</P>
<P>I *might* put some configuration options to allow the calendar to be only for guildmembers to see.&nbsp; Sometimes guilds dont want others to see what they have planned, so I might make the calendar configurable so you can set permissions as to who can see it.&nbsp; Would like some input from guildleaders if thats something they would like to see.</P>
<P>Raid/Item deleting is my next overhaul.&nbsp; I am not happy with the current system, so I am going to re-write how it works... I want it to be more intuitive.</P></font></span>

<P>I am sure there will be a bug or two, so I only deployed it for the News editor.. after i get the bugs out, I will deploy it to replace all the other editors too.&nbsp; News is the most used anyway, so I figured it would be a good test there first.</P></font></span>
