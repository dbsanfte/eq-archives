							Upload issues fixed
							Saturday, August 30, 2003 - 10:31:08 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Some people were experiencing odd problems with uploading images.&nbsp; It turned out to be server directory permission problems that was denying the uploads.&nbsp; I am looking into how/why it was caused, but it should be fixed.&nbsp; I made some configuration (global configuration) changes yesterday, which might have taken away some permissions to the account that runs guildwizard.&nbsp; Actually, I am pretty sure thats what the issue was.&nbsp; Anyway, it should be ok now.. Upload away ! :)</P>

							Sometimes it`s better to be smaller!

							<P>Sometimes it`s better to be smaller ... well when it comes to image file&nbsp;size anyway :)</P>
<P>This is a note, ok a plea to people posting pictures for news items, profiles, gallery items etc.. OPTIMIZE YOUR IMAGES!&nbsp; Now as you know I have been really tightening up Guildwizard...&nbsp;and I am running a lot of analysis on how much bandwith is being used etc.&nbsp; I am noticing that images are being posted in excess of 125kb per image, which is quite large.&nbsp; I, for fun, optimized the same image and got it down to 35k.&nbsp; Thats a huge difference..&nbsp; </P>
<P>So..&nbsp; this is where its at.&nbsp; I am going to politely ask everyone to optimize their JPEGS a little better...&nbsp; you dont have to have the settings at Maximum for general web-browsing, for the most part.&nbsp; You can easily get an image to be a third of the file size by setting down to Medium or Medium Low, instead of Maximum.</P>
<P>In the next few weeks I will see if people are doing it themselves.. if not, I am going to write an automated service on the server which will `Do it for you`..&nbsp;I will probably enforce smaller uploads too, if need be.&nbsp; I don`t want to do it, as its about 5-6 hours of work that I could spend on other guildwizard features, instead of playing bandwith cop :)</P>

							Filter for hotlinking and Profile change
							Thursday, August 28, 2003 - 2:10:40 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I wrote a filter to prevent hotlinking of images for all guildsites.&nbsp; If you hotlink an image that resides in your guildsite, it will not show that image, it will show a default Guild Wizard icon.&nbsp; The reason for this can be viewed below in the yesterday`s news entry..&nbsp; I let it go until I found out that people were abusing it.. especially the dolt(s) who were ebaying their items and linking images to my server /bonk</P>
<P>Anyway, I also found a bug on the profile editor.. some guild who were in their trial period were not able to submit or upload changes on the profile editor.&nbsp; This should be fixed now... also found a bug which was not updating the roster/item/purchase config settings in the cache until it was reset (which defeats the purpose of caching).. thats fixed now.</P>
<P>Tommorow night I think I am going to start the Admin`s FAQ page.. it will be a FAQ (go figure) list of common questions on setting up/configuring your site.. as well as some neat tricks and suggestions for your site.&nbsp; This is LONG overdue..&nbsp; </P>

							Fixed stuff
							Wednesday, August 27, 2003 - 1:24:25 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>EDIT: Forgot to mention I enabled an ISAPI filter to prevent hotlinking images to my server... sorry,&nbsp;2 gigs in one day is just ridiculous.&nbsp; I am going to keep this on to see how much is hotlinked .. btw, I really don`t want hotlinking anyway, the file space provided is for your GUILDWIZARD SITE.. not for sigs on other sites etc.. heck someone is hotlinking stat pics&nbsp;for their Player Auction auctions! </P>
<P>Thanks to the emails/reports I got from guildleaders, i was able to fix these problems:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Filemanager now properly creates a directory the first time its accessed.&nbsp; I forgot to enable this when I was finished testing. 
<LI>Gallery uploads will work properly now, for newly created guildsites 
<LI>Changes made to visible items on the Roster, Item View, Raid View, and encounter view will show up immediatly after changing them.&nbsp; I forgot to refresh the cache when I did the update. 
<LI>Deleted players will be uncached from the roster when deleted/restored 
<LI>Fixed bug with logo/banner not uploading properly for newly created guild sites</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp; I am sure there are other things I have to tweak/fix I will fix them as I get the reports, or as I catch them.&nbsp; Thanks for the reports/help so far!</P>

							Back in town!
							Tuesday, August 26, 2003 - 8:44:24 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well..&nbsp;&nbsp; bad me for deploying such a big update and leaving town!! :)&nbsp; It was actually unplanned, I woke up at 8am, and my wife told me we were leaving at 8:30am!&nbsp; Anyway, I guess it could have been worse.. I received a few reports that file manager isnt working properly which I will look into right now.</P>
<P>If you emailed me in the last 2 days, please allow me till tonight to early tommorow to get back to you.&nbsp; I have about 30 guildwizard emails, and about 30 other emails to answer tonight .. so it might have to wait till the morning.</P>
<P>As for the update, its running great!&nbsp; Memory usage is literally cut 5 fold!&nbsp; Its incredible how much less resources I am using now which really is great news.. I can really start implementing some new features now, whithout fear of taxing the server`s resources too much (BTW, Guildwizard is running on a dedicated server now.. There was 3-4 other sites running on the same server, they are on a different server now).</P>
<P>Will post another update late tonight or tommorow when I catch up.</P>

							New engine deployed
							Sunday, August 24, 2003 - 4:20:47 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just deployed the new engine for guildwizard.&nbsp; Everyone`s site is running it, and I hope it performs well!&nbsp; One thing that I really made use of is the Cache object in .NET.&nbsp; What this means is that there will be less database calls when working with the grids (roster, raid lists etc).&nbsp; .NET has some great features with Caching to allow developers to really improve perfomance with respect to pulling large amounts of data.</P>
<P>I did my best to avoid problems with broken image links.&nbsp; The odd guild might have to repoint a few pics, but for the most part, they should have propogated properly.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If anyone notices any problems with their site, please email me with the problem so I can fix it.</P>

							Engine change soon
							Saturday, August 23, 2003 - 9:00:02 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>The last few nights I have been re-writting the Guildwizard engine.&nbsp;Guildwizards current engine is performing well, I am not having any issues but I forsee problems in the future with scalability (the ability to upgrade and move the application around).&nbsp; To my delite, the new `engine` was pretty easy to convert to.&nbsp; I wrote the original engine with an eventual re-write in mind.&nbsp; Remember, this application was originally meant for ONE guild on Prexus... it was a neat idea to develop something to track DKP points so I offered it to the.&nbsp; Well, 9 months later, we have Guildwizard and all its members!</P>
<P>Anyway, `nothing` is going to change on the front-end by doing this.&nbsp; However, unless I figure something out, you might have to repoint your images for your news items.&nbsp; This is not for sure, but I figured I would mention it in advance.&nbsp; Instead of referring to your images as <A href="http://yoursite.guildwizard/pics/image.jpg">http://yoursite.guildwizard/pics/image.jpg</A> after the /pics will be your guild id.&nbsp; <A href="http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/pics/728/image.jpg">http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/pics/728/image.jpg</A>&nbsp; will be the new format (or simply /pics/728/image.jpg) will work fine.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Again, you MIGHT have to repoint some images.. this isnt for sure yet.&nbsp; I have already written some scripts to copy over some stuff.. if I can do it for images, i will. </P>
<P>I already have some sites running on this new engine for test.&nbsp; Its running very well.&nbsp; I expect everyone to be switched over sometime next week, as I don`t want to do it without testing sufficiently.</P>

							Forum admin - feature added
							Thursday, August 21, 2003 - 11:19:34 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I have added a feature to the forum admin to copy access permissions from one forum to another.&nbsp; So if you create a new forum for guild-members only, you dont have to re-add everyone to that forum, you can just copy the same permissions from a previously added forum.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also added confirmations to the delete buttons for forum deleting and moderator removal.</P>

							Raid parse optimized / forums downtime (oops)
							Sunday, August 17, 2003 - 5:22:27 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Forums were down for a few hours.. i accidently set the transaction log too small and it was giving errors :(&nbsp; Sorry about that.</P>
<P>Now for some good news.&nbsp; I completely re-wrote the raid parse, for DKP guilds.&nbsp; To the user, there is no difference on the front-end (yet), but man on the back-end I optimized that puppy!&nbsp; I am convinced that the raid entry was the memory leak source that I was searching for before..&nbsp; Anyway, it should improve server performance greatly.. i also re-wrote the stored procedures.&nbsp; Lets hope EQ doesn`t change their logging format :)</P>
<P>The re-write above was a necessary step towards my rewrite of the raid-manager.&nbsp; I am going to make the management more intuitive.. when I say management i mean the ability to add/delete raids, items, purchases, and assign DKP points manually.&nbsp; You can do all this now, ofcourse, but I want to make it a bit easier.</P>

							Calendar System Overhaul
							Saturday, August 16, 2003 - 9:16:03 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I did a complete overhaul on the calendar system last night.&nbsp;The colors for the calendar are fixed at Royal Blue for now. This is temporary, as I am going to add an entry in the style-sheets for the calendars.&nbsp; </P>
<P>One of the biggest improvements, is now you will see a short description of the event for that day right on the calendar.. you can fit upto 70 characters on each day..&nbsp; and the user can click the day for more details on it.&nbsp; Also, days with events are in red to show there is something up that day.</P>
<P>I *might* put some configuration options to allow the calendar to be only for guildmembers to see.&nbsp; Sometimes guilds dont want others to see what they have planned, so I might make the calendar configurable so you can set permissions as to who can see it.&nbsp; Would like some input from guildleaders if thats something they would like to see.</P>
<P>Raid/Item deleting is my next overhaul.&nbsp; I am not happy with the current system, so I am going to re-write how it works... I want it to be more intuitive.</P>
