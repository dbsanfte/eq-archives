							Forums: Move threads
							Monday, February 16, 2004 - 11:13:54 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>You can now move threads in the new forums by going to the forum manager, and clicking on Move Threads (original eh?).&nbsp; When you select the source forum, a table with all the threads in that forum will populate.. select the thread(s) you want to move, the destination forum and then click the button and it will move&nbsp; them to the new forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>The forums are getting some good use.&nbsp; Any new guild that signs up is using the new forum, as well as quite a few guilds who have been using guildwizard for a long time.&nbsp; I realize they aren`t polished just yet, but the core functionality is pretty solid so far.&nbsp;</P>

							Forum improvements, login should stick now
							Sunday, February 15, 2004 - 11:40:42 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>When you login, it should keep you logged in until you click the logout button, instead of having to login each time.</P>
<P>Forum Features Added:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You can now sort the thread list for a forum by choosing the desired sort in the drop-down-list above the thread list table.&nbsp; The background color of the list is the same background color as your buttons.&nbsp; So if you have a texture for buttons, and didnt set your background color, you should :)</LI>
<LI>You can mark a forum as read by clicking &nbsp;the Mark Forum Read link next to the sort dropdownlist.</LI>
<LI>You can mark all forums read by clicking the Mark All Forums Read link on the forum list</LI>
<LI>The quick reply text-box background color is now transparent (instead of white), and the forecolor (text color) is the same as your Page Text Color that you defined in the color configuration page.</LI></UL>
<P>I think thats it..&nbsp; I might have missed a thing or two.&nbsp; I probably won`t get to the new skins that I wanted to make, I rented Project Gotham Racer II for my Xbox :) Going to be a little busy :)</P>

							Added new posts icons for forum list
							Saturday, February 14, 2004 - 7:43:45 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>When you are logged in and are viewing the forum list, for the new forums, you will now see an icon showing if there are new posts in each forum since your last visit.&nbsp; I will probably add a couple more features over the weekend to the forums..&nbsp; Sorting the threadlist is probably next on the list.</P>
<P>I am also going to try to make up some more skins this weekend, fix some DKP issues, and possibly program a way to add raids without&nbsp;a log file.</P>
<P>Thats my goal anyway :)</P>

							Cleaned those annoying borders
							Thursday, February 12, 2004 - 12:53:31 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I cleaned up a lot of the multiple borders that were occuring on the side-panels and some content pages.&nbsp; This is a temporary fix for a much bigger project I have planned (when work slows down).&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to add&nbsp;some more side-panel plug-ins, as well as add for more layout options such as horizonal navigation and one big center content panel (no side panels) .&nbsp;</P>
<P>It honestly wont be hard to implement at all.. i just need the time to do it.&nbsp; Of course the forums have to get done before anything.&nbsp; Lots of guilds are&nbsp;using them, as I am adding features and I am getting some good ideas from the various suggestions!&nbsp; I&nbsp;expect to spend some time today on adding some&nbsp;features .. probably a&nbsp;New messages icon on the forum list to show forums with new messages..&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

						<p class="newsHeader">
							Forum features added
							Sunday, February 01, 2004 - 10:43:28 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I did a little work on the forums:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed problem with sigs that would cause a dumb border for every line, if DIV tags were used</LI>
<LI>If you have any unread private messages, the number of private messages will be displayed in the private messages button up top</LI>
<LI>When viewing a message thread, you can now click on a PM button to send a private message the user</LI>
<LI>Private messages are now sorted by Date in descending order</LI>
<LI>I increased the height of the post editor</LI></UL>
<P>The old forums seem to have some issue with attachements being added to posts..&nbsp; i have no clue what thats all about.&nbsp; The old forums are really getting on my nerves with this, as well as the damn confirmation emails getting filtered by a lot of ISPs..&nbsp; I cant wait to shut that damn forum off (its a memory hog too!)</P>

							Purchase grid sort - forum features added
							Wednesday, January 28, 2004 - 11:05:52 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I have been mostly working on the new forums with the little time I have had to work on guildwizard.&nbsp; I did however sneak in a little feature add on the Purchase View page for DKP guilds.. you can now fully sort the grid...</P>
<P>Here is some of the stuff I added on the new forums today:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed the Member Role, so pages secured by the Members Only permission will work 
<LI>Thread list page will now show unread messages, by popular demand 
<LI>Fixed Sticky and Lock Threads so Officers can do it.. i had it set to Admin account only 
<LI>I fixed a validation problem that was preventing some posts from going through 
<LI>The member list in the Private Message page is now sorted by name to find the recipient name easier 
<LI>Admin/Officer action log is working (this was done yesterday) 
<LI>Fixed a bug which didnt allow Display names if someone in another guild had same Display Name, it now only checks display names in your own guild, the way it`s supposed to. 
<LI>Tuned some indexes on the database.&nbsp; Probably in vein, as I really cant get a good representation of what I should be tuning until more guilds start using the new forums. 
<LI>Locked threads now properly show the locked icon in the thread list (still have to put locked button on message view though) 
<LI>The forum order tool (to re-order your forums in the list) works now 
<LI>The admin grid in the Manage Forums area that shows the forum list with the current security level will now show the description instead of just a number (Will show “Members Only“ instead of &nbsp;“2“)</LI></UL>
<P>The forums are starting to come together.. there is only about 5-6 guilds using them since I deployed them yesterday.. i need about 50 of you guilds to start using them so I can start performance tuning though..&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will continue trying to add the core features of the forums and kill any bugs that I get reported.&nbsp; After the weekend, I anticipate having very little time to do any work on the forums.. I am likely starting on a very large project, which is about a 2 month programming job.&nbsp; That doesn`t mean I wont do anything for two months, it just means I won`t have as much time, as my client is kind of anxious to get this application done (aren`t they all? :)</P>

							Posted new forums for your testing
							Tuesday, January 27, 2004 - 1:18:13 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I deployed the new forums to the live site so guilds that want to, can start using them.&nbsp; They are NOT finished.. but they are usuable.&nbsp; They are about 75% done, I would say.&nbsp; The base framework is done, and the base usability is done..&nbsp; I just need to add features that are above and beyond the basics.</P>
<P>Admins/officers should really like the amount of control you have over the forums now..&nbsp; it`s a lot better.</P>
<P>You can&nbsp;fool get to the forums by going to the /forum/ directory in your site.. so it would be <A href="http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/forums/">http://yoursite.guildwizard.com/forums/</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .. Make sure you are logged in as an admin or officer so you can add forums and use the Admin panels</P>

							Forums progress
							Wednesday, January 21, 2004 - 12:15:00 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Wow, finally got a night where I could spend a little while programming the forums.&nbsp; I actually got a lot done.. i pretty much did all the Private Messsages part of the forums.. i designed all the objects, and created all the stored procedures for the database, and got the presentation pages done too.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also changed the colors on the beta forums, from the funky red to black..&nbsp; I was getting teased too much so I figured it was time to change it.&nbsp; BTW, the forums follow the same color scheme as your base site.. i shouldn`t say `base site`, as it`s 100% part of the site now, so it inherits the stylesheet like any&nbsp;other page.</P>
<P>I also spent a little time on the User objects..&nbsp; here is low down so far.&nbsp; Your guild members will NOT have forum access, until you give it to them.&nbsp; Giving them access is as easy as clicking a check box next to the people`s names you want to give access to, and clicking the button.&nbsp; I don`t want to give people access without the guildleader/officer giving to them.&nbsp; Now, people will be able to sign up to your forums (non-guildmembers/visitors etc).. they will fill out a form requesting a username/password etc.. and they have to validate their email like the other forums.&nbsp; I am probably going to not allow them to post until you (the guildleader) approves the account... maybe I will set that as an option.</P>
<P>Anyway... a few people have emailed me asking me to make the forums available for use before they are 100% done.. they don`t want to keep using the old forums if the posts are going to not carry over, which is understandable.&nbsp; The only thing I can say, is I will do my best to get it to that point soon.&nbsp; It`s really not that far off, so hopefully I can find a few more hours to do it.</P>

							Still around... 
							Tuesday, January 06, 2004 - 11:31:41 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Yes, I am still around!&nbsp; Man, I am busy with work.. I thought I would be able to finish the forums over the holidays, but I got 2 projects thrown at me that came right out the blue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have 3 very large development projects (2 for sure) that I will be starting soon.&nbsp; Things are really picking up with my development company, which is a good thing.</P>
<P>Anyway, with regards to GuildWizard and the forums etc.. I am going to do my best to get the forums finished as soon as I can.&nbsp; I want to implement them, make sure they are working, and then guildwizard is going to run as is, with bug fixes my only work.&nbsp; Then, when things slow down with work, I will start on new features.</P>
<P>The feedback I`ve gotten thus far on the new forums have been good.&nbsp; Looks like I am on the right track based on user input. I am hoping to have a usable forum that people can start using for their own guild sites soon.&nbsp; </P>

							First Build of forums for testing
							Wednesday, December 24, 2003 - 9:48:53 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I posted the first build of the new forums.&nbsp; They are working pretty well so far, and seem to be performing well.&nbsp; Of course this can`t be determined 100% until I get a 30,000 or so messages on the forum :)&nbsp; However, no matter what because they are being written by myself, I can find any bottlenecks and fix it easily.&nbsp; I already have 2 seperate ideas how to improve performance, which I will add in on the next build.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are still things that need to be coded, namely private messages and the emote icons.. plus I need to code the paging for the message and thread list (to only show 30 messages per page etc).</P>
<P>The link to this first build is <A href="http://newforums.guildwizard.com/forums/forumlist.aspx">http://newforums.guildwizard.com/forums/forumlist.aspx</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... this is a dummy guildwizard site running on a seperate server.&nbsp; It would help me out if people go there and create an account and post some.&nbsp; I need people to post and let me know if any errors creep up.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will post another build in a couple days when I get the private messages going etc.</P>
