<P>I wrote the function because I am kind shifting direction on my upcoming feature.&nbsp; I`ve decided to work on the Roster columns instead of the other things.&nbsp; Basically, this is going to allow you to add custom columns to the Roster.&nbsp; You will be able to add a column called "Date Joined", for example.&nbsp; So you will have the choice to use the standard Roster, or create your own custom Roster.&nbsp; When you create a custom Roster, you will have access to all the columns of the Standard Roster, just you can pick and choose your columns and add your own.</P>
<P>This might take a while to implement, so there might not be a patch for a week or so, depending how difficult this is going to be.</P></font></span>

											</TABLE>
											<span id="DataList1__ctl2_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Whoa!&nbsp; Large patch was just deployed.&nbsp; First let me get the bug fixes out of the way:</P>
<P><STRONG>Bug fixes:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed domain look-up tool.&nbsp; You can now look up domains to register on the domains page again.
<LI>Fixed stored-procedure that wasn`t listing items purchased in raid detail 
<LI>Fixed bug that allowed deleted members to still login to their guildwizard account.&nbsp; If you delete a player, they will no longer be able to use their login/password. 
<LI>Fixed problem with Loot List that wasn`t sorting the items with the most recent item at the top. 
<LI>Fixed up Admin links that didn`t have style attributes added to them to change the mouse pointer to a `pointing finger` (which made it hard to realize it was a link).</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>New Features:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Each page now has a permission setting which allows you to allow Everyone, Logged In Members, or Admins to view the page.&nbsp; So if you only want Guildmates to see your raid-list, you can set it so only after they login will they be able to go to the page.&nbsp; If a user tries to go to a page with insufficient rights, they are redirected to the login page.&nbsp; After they sucessfully login, they are brought back to the page originally requested. 
<LI>In addition to Page Level Permissions, most pages have Item Level Permissions as well.&nbsp; What this means, is you are able to set who can see particular items on various pages.&nbsp; For example, you can set the whole Calendar Page to allow only Guildmates or you can allow Everyone to see the page, but certain items in the calendar would only be viewable by Members or Admins.&nbsp; Items in the calendar that a user doesn`t have sufficient privledges to will show a message telling them they don`t have rights to see the message, and redirects them to a login page.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<LI>All grids that were able to hide columns, have the ability to have the column visable to Everyone, Members, Admins, or Nobody(hide).&nbsp; So on your Roster, you might only have the Name,Class, Race and AA points viewable by Everyone, but the DKP earned only visable to Guildmates, or Admins.&nbsp; It`s the same configuration panels as before, just with the new options added to them.&nbsp; Again, this functionality is extended to all pages that were able to configure grids (Roster, Purchases, Raids, Encounters etc). 
<LI>Custom pages now have a field to set permissions to them.&nbsp; When you create a custom page, you will be able to set who can see the page. 
<LI>In the Rank column of the Roster, you can now set the rank to "A" for alternate players.&nbsp; This is a quick-bandaid for now.. I want to spend some time on how alts are being handled in the Roster, now that the Guild Dump feature includes everyone in the guild.. there needs to be a better distinction.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Upcoming Features:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The Roster will have a mouse-over effect when you roll the mouse over a person`s name.&nbsp; A semi-transperant box will appear with quick info about the player.&nbsp; It can have tradeskill info, Keys/Flags.. whatever they/you want.&nbsp; It will be editable by the member and the Administrator. 
<LI>Administrators will be able to edit member`s profiles without having to login as their accounts.&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<P>I just want to note that every single change or upcoming feature was a result of people sending me suggestions or posting suggestions on the forums.&nbsp; Thanks for the input guys/gals, keep it coming!</P></font></span>

<P>After the next patch, each page will have a global permission, which will either allow Everyone, Members Only, or Officers only to view.&nbsp; From there, certain pages will also have "micro permissions" that can be mananged as well.&nbsp; For example, you can set the Roster to let everyone view the Page, but only logged-in Members can see DKP information, and only Officers can see DKP totals.</P>
<P>Every page that has a configuration column will have a new field added to include logged in Members.</P>
<P>These features will be present in custom pages as well.&nbsp; You will be able to set permissions on the pages you make.&nbsp; This way if you have a strategy, or maybe a long-term plan you want only Guildmembers to see, you can lock it up.</P>
<P>I should have it done in a couple days..&nbsp;&nbsp; Post on the forums if you have an input or suggestions for this!</P></font></span>

<P>As it stands, all changes are client-side.&nbsp; When you make changes, you will see the preview panel items change instantly.&nbsp; Even the textures that you choose will instantly show up in the element that is going to inherit the texture.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also wrote a script for the Skins list..&nbsp; when you choose a skin, the screen instantly changes to that skin, giving you a preview.&nbsp; A popup box then asks you if you want to keep this skin, or go back to your other style.&nbsp; This is nice for the times you just want to look, without commiting.</P>

<P>&nbsp;I am working on the reprogram of the color configuration page, its going to be a lot more usable when I am done.&nbsp; If you have used it, you know that everytime you change a color it submits the change and redraws the page.. which is incredibly dumb.&nbsp; Now, it redraws clientside, so its instant and much much much much faster (yes, I said much 4 times because its that much faster! hehe).&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are done editing your style sheet, you can then click the Save button that will then submit the changes to the server, uploading any textures at that time etc.&nbsp; Besides the preview on the screen itself, I will probably have a Preview button which will change the current page (all its elements) to the new stylesheet before you save it.. just incase you dont like it.</P>
<P>I will also be including parameters for the calendar`s style editing.&nbsp; If you remember I never did add in the css Classes for the calendar when I redid the calendar last month.&nbsp; You will again have full control over calendar colors when the update is done.</P>
<P>Back to the raid page.. the reason I can`t fix it right now is because the source code for that component exists in the same component that I am working on right now (the main guildwizard engine).&nbsp; I can`t recompile it until I get the color changes done, so look for the fix finished with the next patch, in a day or so.&nbsp; Purchases are working fine, its just the display on the raid detail that isnt coming up.</P></font></span>

<P>If anyone notices an error or problem with this patch, please email me right away.&nbsp;I usually spend a few hours testing and watching for errors, but I am dead tired :)</P>
<P>I am going to fix some small problems with user-interface, and then start working on the Color Configuration page.&nbsp; I want to have it so when you are picking your colors, you dont have to post back to the server with ever choice.. it gets tedious.</P>
<P>Oh almost forgot, I will be also adding the stat image generator for you to use in news posts etc..&nbsp; I was going to do it with this patch, but I didnt have time.&nbsp; </P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl7_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I`ve been working on the items component and have the new code about 70% done.&nbsp; When it`s deployed, you will be able to do raid loot purchases/awardings via a search button which querys an item database, sending back the item name and stats.&nbsp; This will be a big time saver for you since you wont have to maintain your own `Item List`.&nbsp; I will leave the feature in, for custom things likes like plat awardings etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most part though, you should use the new item database instead of going through the trouble of adding all your own items.&nbsp;&nbsp; The database should be current up to and including LDoN.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You will also be able to use this new database to show stats on items that dropped on your raid.&nbsp; I am going to program up a component that will create the images of the stats `on the fly` so you can search the item, get the link and use that link on your news page, for example, to show the item(s).&nbsp; As with all other images, you will not be able to hotlink it to another server though.</P>
<P>I will probably be done everything in the next couple days, depending on work.</P></font></span>

<P>I left in support for the /who list cut/paste.. you just have to click the checkbox to enable it.. when the Dump thingy works in EQ though, use that.. its better and more reliable.</P>
<P>I also changed the cache to update immediatly after you enter a raid.. It was causing too much confusion with it adding later, people were thinking the raid wasn`t added at all.. which is understandable.&nbsp; So now when you add a raid, it will show up right away in your Raid List page. </P></font></span>

<P>Up until the dump feature was added in EQ, the who list (or raid channel dumps etc) was the only way to parse who was on the raid.&nbsp; This new feature will create a text file of everyone on the raid, their group #, and the group leaders.&nbsp; Only the name will be parsed.</P>
