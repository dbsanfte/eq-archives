							FORUMS TESTING
							Sunday, August 10, 2003 - 9:55:46 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Forums are down for a little while.&nbsp; I am tracing a memory leak, and suspect its the forums that is the problem, so I want to leave them off a while to see if the memory leak happens.&nbsp; If the leak happens quick, i will start up the forums as soon as it happens (because I will know its not the issue)... if it doesnt happen i will have to keep it off for while to make sure it really is the problem.</P>

							HTML editor upgrade
							Wednesday, August 06, 2003 - 10:51:51 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>The News editor is upgraded to the new HTML editor.&nbsp; It features an image upload tool, and a spell checker that I haven`t really tested well.&nbsp; It`s nice because you can upload your images directly to the page instead of having to use the File Manager tool like before.&nbsp; You click the image tool and it will bring up a window with the contents of your image directory.. if you need to upload an image, click the Browse button, upload it, then double click the image to insert it into the page (after it uploads and you can see it in the list).</P>
<P>I am sure there will be a bug or two, so I only deployed it for the News editor.. after i get the bugs out, I will deploy it to replace all the other editors too.&nbsp; News is the most used anyway, so I figured it would be a good test there first.</P>

							Forum admin fix - Small server upgrade
							Tuesday, August 05, 2003 - 11:51:05 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I fixed a problem with the forum administration page.&nbsp; The grid that lists the members who have access to private forums did not switch pages when you clicked the different page numbers.&nbsp; It should be all set now.</P>
<P>There was a 20 minute downtime for the server tonight.&nbsp; I added some RAM to the server, I doubt anyone will notice but I had some extra laying around and figured it would help.&nbsp; Oh I blew my keyboard port on the server, hehe, so now I have to get a USB keyboard for it :)&nbsp; </P>

							Connectivity issues 
							Sunday, August 03, 2003 - 10:35:55 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I was fooling around a lot with my router, updating firmware etc which is why guildwizard was up and down.&nbsp; I know people on the forums were getting booted a lot, and I apologize for it.&nbsp; There might be 1 more hicup but I am pretty much finished fooling around.</P>

							Forum Login Issues kinda fixed
							Thursday, July 24, 2003 - 4:46:23 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just got finished putting a bandaid on the forums login.&nbsp; It wont kick you back to the login after you login, which was pretty annoying :)&nbsp; Now it will send you back to where ever you clicked the login button.&nbsp; Don`t get me wrong, the board did that before but I broke it by making my changes a few days ago.</P>
<P>As much as I didn`t want to, it looks like I am going to have to make my own forum.&nbsp; The one I am using now is great, I really like it.. its just not meant to do what I need for guildwizard.&nbsp; I own the source for it, but its in Visual Basic, a language that I *can* program in, but my god I hate programming in vb.&nbsp; Also, I am thinking by the time I get it the way I like , i could have just did it from scratch.. well not really, but you get the picture.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This wont happen anytime soon, and I am still not sure I will do it at all..&nbsp; Just kicking it around.</P>

							Roster changes!
							Monday, July 21, 2003 - 10:44:22 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well I intended on doing the forum changes that I was talking about over the weekend but instead ended up doing a huge back-end overhaul on the roster.&nbsp; Guilds who have a large roster will see a huge speed improvement on the roster loading time. I changed the stored procedures and man what a difference it makes on large roster lists!&nbsp; A lot of the roster was coded `the old way` because I just learning .NET back when I coded it..&nbsp;so now the data-access is a lot quicker.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guilds with less than 80 members probably wont notice a difference, but the larger guilds will notice a huge difference.</P>
<P>When View By Name roster is selected, the sorting is now a little more robust.&nbsp; First, all the columns are fully sortable by clicking the column header (Click Level if you want to sort the roster by level).. if you click the column again thats sorted, it will toggle the sort between Ascending and Descending.&nbsp; For example, if you sort by Class by clicking the Class column header it will list the roster by class.&nbsp; If you click the Class column header again after the page loads, it will sort the roster by class Descending.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Also, you can now set the roster default view, by name or by class.&nbsp; You can still toggle between the two views, but now you can go into the Roster Configurator (the panel that you can hide columns etc) and set the default view.&nbsp; This was suggested by a guildleader last week, and I figured while I was working on the page I might as well spend a few minutes to implement it.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestions!</P>
<P>You will also notice that the style-sheet properties of your main roster is now passed on to the Roster By Class.&nbsp; I must have forgot to code that.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that if you want to edit members from the Roster, you will have to toggle over to the Roster by Name view (if you are in Roster By Class view).&nbsp; </P>

							Forums changed - some locked
							Wednesday, July 09, 2003 - 2:00:22 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I did some work to the forums today (yesh, i had to work in VB)&nbsp;.. anyway...&nbsp; When you go to your forum, you will no longer have connection to the main Guild Wizard forum.&nbsp; That`s something that has been confusing, to say the least for some guilds.&nbsp; Now, when you go to your forum by clicking the button, you are taken to your forum with no links to the Main Forum List on Guild Wizard`s forum.&nbsp; Anyone who used the forums should know what I am talking about, it was annoying as hell :)</P>
<P>Another change, I finally got around to locking forums of non-subscribing guilds.&nbsp; Prior to this patch, guilds were able to setup a forum during the trial period, add all their members and continue to use the forum even though their trial was finished.&nbsp; This was due to the fact that I didnt have time to sift through the forum code to find where I can disable.&nbsp; Anyway, the forums are still `there` , just disabled till you subscribe.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If I have more time today, I will continue playing with the forum code.&nbsp; I am going to put a link-back to your main guild wizard site so its not such a pain in the butt to get back.&nbsp; Then I will look into the sticky posts and deleting issues!</P>

							Player profile issue fixed
							Sunday, June 29, 2003 - 12:31:46 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>New guilds who are still in their trial period were having problems updating player profiles.&nbsp; Of all things it was the dumb paypal button in the top left corner of the screen.&nbsp; Paypal snuck in a client side &lt;form&gt; tag which got embeded in my server form.... (I can see a bunch of people thinking "Does he honestly think we care?").&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, its fixed :)</P>

							Forum changes soon
							Monday, June 23, 2003 - 9:40:27 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I am going to work with the forums a bit as my next project for Guild Wizard.&nbsp; Man it`s getting confusing how each guild is kind of a sub forum of the main forum.&nbsp; I have gotten a few complaints about this, and I agree..&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, I am going to try to make it&nbsp;a LOT more private for each guild.&nbsp; As you might know, I didnt write the forums.. Andrew at <A href="http://www.dotnetbb.com">www.dotnetbb.com</A> did a fantastic job on the forums, but they are not meant for what I have implemented.&nbsp; They can, however, be customized to do what we want them to do at Guild Wizard..atleast I am hoping anyway.</P>
<P>From the start, I didnt want to write my own forum software.&nbsp; I simply don`t have time to do it, and I hate to re-invent the wheel.&nbsp; However, if I can`t get the forums the right way, I will have to do it.&nbsp; I am very confident, though, that I can customize the existing boards the way they should be.</P>

							Batch additions - TAB delimited now supported
							Thursday, June 19, 2003 - 2:30:04 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well, well, well.. it seems that Verant has some Guild Manager player lists coming out in TAB delimited and others in Comma Delimited.&nbsp; What this means is the seperator between the values in each column is either a TAB (5 spaces) or a Comma (,)&nbsp; .. makes a big difference when guys like me are trying to write software to read it :)&nbsp; hehe</P>
<P>Anyway, most people were using Comma from what I can see, but a few people have emailed me with log files in TAB format.&nbsp; Guild Wizard will now read either format.&nbsp; Hell, you can even have a file with half and half if you want ! (why anyone would, is beyond me).</P>
<P>Subscriptions seem to be integrating smoothly... i have had only 1 minor problem with a guilds status not changing.&nbsp; I re-wrote my paypal web-service a bit and there definatly shouldnt be any problems.&nbsp; Your status is updated within 2 minutes of PayPal notifying my webservice.</P>
