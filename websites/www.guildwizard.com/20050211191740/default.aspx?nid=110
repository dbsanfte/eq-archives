							Today`s update
							Friday, June 06, 2003 - 12:37:43 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just deployed todays update.&nbsp; The update roster page now accepts the text file from the Guild Management System in EQ as does the Add Player page.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Also, as you probably noticed, I deployed the advertisements for unsubscribed guilds who have been using the system for more than 30 days.&nbsp; To subscribe, click the PayPal button at the top left of your screen in your guildwizard site.&nbsp; This will take you to Pay Pal.&nbsp; I have a web-service in place that will track which guild is paying, and it will automatically update the status.&nbsp;</P>
<P>If anyone has problems or encounters errors with this new update, please email me <A href="mailto:sharbel@guildwizard.com">sharbel@guildwizard.com</A></P>

							Tommorows update
							Thursday, June 05, 2003 - 5:03:39 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I spent today working on the things discussed yesterday.&nbsp; The ability to add/edit players based on EQs Guild Management text file of your guild members.&nbsp; I have to do a little more coding for this, but will be ready for tommorow.</P>
<P>I also coded the Paypal subscription component.&nbsp; Everything is in place right now for Guild Wizard to move to a subscription model.&nbsp; The only thing that I didnt code yet, is the limiting of abilities for non-subscribers (after the trial period).&nbsp; This will be done after I roll out the update tommorow.&nbsp; I still need to sit down and figure out what will be limited, so there is no need to rush it.</P>
<P>After tommorow, those who have been using Guild Wizard for over 30 days, will see some banners/buttons on their pages.&nbsp; If you want to remove them, your guild will have to subscribe via PayPal which accepts all credit cards etc.&nbsp; I will make a page regarding subscriptions tommorow before I roll out the update.</P>
<P>Subscription cost will be $25 for 6 months, which is less a lot less than other comparable services.&nbsp; Figure if you had to pay hosting alone for your site with a hosting company (without popups), you would be paying atleast $60 for 6 months.&nbsp; Atleast with guildwizard you get all the tools to go with it.</P>
<P>Anyway the update will be in the afternoon (EST) around 1pm if everything goes ok.&nbsp; Downtime should be about 15 minutes in total.</P>

							Subscriptions - EQ`s guild manager file support inc
							Wednesday, June 04, 2003 - 9:46:52 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to code up support for eq`s guild manager file dump that you can generate.&nbsp;&nbsp; This file is better than the /who list because it gets everyone in the guild, even if they are offline.&nbsp; You will be able to use this file to update your roster, as well as use it to add players not in the roster.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this file does not have Race information for the character, so it will default to Human.&nbsp;&nbsp; The player can log-in later and update the race to their true race though.</P>
<P>As I`ve mentioned in the past I will be implementing a subscription model for Guild Wizard very soon.&nbsp; The price has not been determined, but I am definatly going to allow those who do not want to pay, to still be able to use the service.&nbsp; Guilds who do not want to pay will have some banners (no popups), and probably limited use of the service.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What will be limited?&nbsp; I don`t know yet, I was thinking to allow the roster, news, and gallery(without filemanager access).&nbsp; File-manager (the ability to upload your pictures) will definatly be a subscription item, as will the DKP tools and the forums.&nbsp; Those items are the biggest resource hogs on my server.&nbsp; </P>
<P>BTW, guilds who just signed in the last 30 days will not be affected... The model will allow a free 100% use of the service for the first 30 days, so you can decide if you like it or not.</P>
<P>More on this in the next day or so...&nbsp; </P>

							Changes to program
							Monday, June 02, 2003 - 4:54:42 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Today I made a major change to the way guildwizard is constructed.&nbsp; All the changes are code changes, and how each guild accesses the guildwizard program.&nbsp; It`s nothing to be concerned about with regards to using your site, however I am mentioning this as a heads up if you see me taking down the server because of problems.&nbsp; </P>
<P>From what I can see, its running normally but you never know!&nbsp; </P>

							Creating message boards
							Wednesday, May 28, 2003 - 5:58:04 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Those who have been waiting&nbsp; to be able to set up a message board may do so now.&nbsp; You simply log in on your admin account and there will be a link at the top right corner to take you to the page.&nbsp; Once you create your forum, there is a help icon that you should click to read about how to add forums etc.</P>
<P>With this aspect out of the way, I will now begin working on giving moderators the ability to sticky posts as well as delete them.</P>
						</p>
					
						<hr />
					
						<h2>
							Forums upgraded
							Tuesday, May 27, 2003 - 11:48:09 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just completed the upgrade to the forums.&nbsp; If anyone has problems with the upgraded forums, please email me at <A href="mailto:sharbel@guildwizard.com">sharbel@guildwizard.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now begin working on the forum changes I talked about before... I first of all will create a way for guilds to create their own forum, because quite frankly I hate having to do it manually :)&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>On the topic of forums, I am probably also going to create a service to delete forums that havent been used in 30 days or so.. Some people ask for forums for the guild then never use.. so i want to create a service which will weed out those forums and delete them... thats down the road, after i create the automated forum setup, and the figure out how to give moderators the permissions discussed before.</P>

							Add news/Edit pages fixed
							Wednesday, May 21, 2003 - 10:58:38 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							It seems that a new `feature` of the .NET framework is to perform validation on any HTML input, which was blocking any news items to be added... actually any page that uses the HTML editor was affected.&nbsp; The problem should be fixed, if anyone notices anything odd with those pages, please email me !

						<h2>
							You there?
							Tuesday, May 20, 2003 - 8:28:52 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Yep, still here!&nbsp; Man, I have been busy with work the last little while.. not complaining, just I have little time for my fun sites Some of you may have noticed a little downtime this morning because I was upgrading the server, so your guildwizard site might have been down in the morning if you tried to access it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Once my projects for work get under control, I am going to code up the features I have been talking about for the last little while (Better forums control, roster updates from the new Guild-Manager in EQ etc). Hopefully they won`t be a big suprise like the Color Configuration 2.0 was (took triple the time I thought!)</P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Ads and subscriptions
							Saturday, May 03, 2003 - 8:47:35 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I am going to start coding up some subscription packages, like I was talking about before.&nbsp; GuildWizard.com will remain free for those who want to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those guilds that want to use the service without ads (just banners/buttons, no popups), will have to pay a subscription.&nbsp; I`ve gotten some great feedback from you all, and I think the majority of those who responded said they are fine with this method.</P>
<P>Let`s face it, I know some people cannot pay.&nbsp; Some people just don`t want to pay, and I respect that.&nbsp; Just keep in mind I am not beginning to charge for the programming I did (I LOVE programming, its my pleasure)... quite honestly, there are costs to running this service and I can`t absorb the costs anymore.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I did exactly 2 advertising rounds on the message boards and I got this many guilds now.&nbsp; I could imagine if I `really` advertised.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, more on this later.&nbsp; I am only starting to sign up for ad servers and things like that... it will be a few days.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am going to also look into the feasibility of throwing in a custom URL (<A href="http://www.yourguildname.com">www.yourguildname.com</A>) as part of the subscription.&nbsp; Don`t hold me to that yet though :)</P>

							Color Configurator 2.0 Now Live
							Tuesday, April 29, 2003 - 11:24:59 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well I finally deployed the new color/texture configuration page.&nbsp; It took a lot longer than I thought but I am pretty happy with the changes so far.&nbsp; I say "so far" because I will probably tinker with a bit more, but nothing major.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My next area to tackle will be the forums.&nbsp; I will start working on the source code of the forum to enable the features that people have asked for.&nbsp; One problem is that the forum is programed in yucky VB.NET :(&nbsp; ... I am a C# kinda guy, but I am sure I can remember VB to get around the code.</P>
