I have decided to start working on the application again.&nbsp; Effective immediatly, I will be working on the long list of suggestion/bug fixes .&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also start working on the application to be scalable to other online games.&nbsp; I play EQ, but there are a lot of other games out there that players have emailed me asking for support on.&nbsp; It shouldn`t be that tough to alter the code to allow for the various other class/races of other games.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will worry about other games, mind you, when I get done with taking care of the existing application.&nbsp; I have a lot of programming ahead of me to implement some of the features that I have had on the back burner.</P></font></span>

<P>What it comes down to is this.&nbsp; I am going to be evaluating what I will be doing with the service, in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; Don`t worry, I will not be pulling the plug.&nbsp; I am simply going to be evaluting if I will basically leave the app the way it is, and let it be used... or I might go ahead and start working on it full time again.&nbsp; If I do go full time again, I might go with a subscription based service to recover the development costs (my time).&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, nothing is definate.&nbsp; I might just let Guild Wizard run as it is without any changes at all.&nbsp; If you have any input on the matter, feel free to email me!</P>
<P>For those who have emailed me in the last week, I have tried to answer all the emails I`ve gotten.&nbsp; If I missed yours, email me again.&nbsp; I had a 1-2 day period where my DNS was propogating it`s changes, and I might have lost an email or two.&nbsp; </P></font></span>

																			</TABLE>
																			<span id="DataList1__ctl7_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Off the top: The Filemanager should be back to normal now.</P>
<P>I have created a page for admins/officers to manage security/password issues.&nbsp; For now it has two tools to use, however I will probably add more as the need arises.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First of all, you will see the link in the top right corner of any page, as long as you are logged in as an Admin or Officer... think link is called Manage Members.&nbsp; From this page you can (the admin only) promote members to Officers, which in essense gives them Admin rights to your site.&nbsp; Be very careful who you allow this priveledge!&nbsp; The only thing, at this time, that an Officer cannot do, is add/remove other officers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second tool on the page, is a password resetter.&nbsp; This tool will allow an Admin/Officer to reset the password of a guildmember who lost their password.&nbsp; I was going to implement an email the new password type tool but not everyone lists their email so this was the easiest way.&nbsp; After you reset the password for them, they are free to change it to what they want, via the link on the login box.</P>
<P>Now that the Roles based security is in place, I am going to re-visit the grid columns.&nbsp; I will likely be adding the option to only show Guildmates certain columns (points, loot, raids etc).</P>
<P>Moreover, I am going to look into implementing the ability for administrators to `lock` certain pages.&nbsp; What i mean by this, is allow the admin to set, say, the Calandar page as "Guildmembers Only" permissions.&nbsp; That way, only guildmembers would be able to see that Calendar page.&nbsp; Some guilds are on very competative servers, and they don`t necessarily want to show other guilds what they are going to be up to. No promises on this, but like I said I am going to look into it.</P></font></span>

																			</TABLE>
																			<span id="DataList1__ctl8_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I am about 50 percent done the Role based security update.&nbsp; Role based means that when you log in, the database will check to see what Role you belong to... if you are an Administrator or Officer, you will have different options than if you were a Member.</P>
<P>Don`t get me wrong, Roles security was already there, just I am reworking it so it uses the .NET security model.&nbsp; I really should have done that from the beginning, but this project started out as a casual project to be used by 2 co-guildleaders.&nbsp; I didn`t design the login-in for what its being used for today.&nbsp; Regardless, most won`t even notice a difference... it really is mostly boring server side stuff that is behind the scenes.</P>
<P>One thing that guildleaders will notice, is they will be allowed to give Officer permissions to certain users which is pretty much giving them the same powers as an Administrator.&nbsp; The difference is, an Officer will not be able to add/revoke officer status.&nbsp; Only the Administrator Role can do that.&nbsp; I am not going to go much deeper in the permissions than that.&nbsp; As some of you know I could program it that each feature could be a configurable permission, but quite frankly I don`t think it will be used, so I will only do a broad permission setting.&nbsp; If I get a lot of requests, I will revisit that decision though.</P>
<P>Members will notice very little, except they will log in at the same login as the administrator now.. you can log in, and it will know what you should be seeing or not based on your Role.&nbsp; Also, there will be an option to Remember your login, so you don`t have to log in everytime you come to the site... </P>
<P>I have atleast 1-2 more days of reworking the permissions, then I will begin working on the documentation, and adding some more plug-ins.</P></font></span>

<P>Coupled with this, I am going to explor the feasbility of developing automatic roster updates when you enter raids..&nbsp; So there will be a check box to `update your roster` while you enter a raid.&nbsp; For the non-DKP guilds, I will provide a pop-up console probably for you to just plug in a /who list, since you don`t enter Raids.</P>
<P>After I deploy the add new player utility, I will have to immediatly update the player profile editor page to allow for the new class Titles..&nbsp; </P></font></span>

<P>You now have an option to enable/disable the ability for players to get multiple point awards for raids, if their maincharacter and an alternate is detected in the attendance taker.&nbsp; For example lets say the main character "Sharbel" is at the raid and gets 1 point, if the alternate character "Sharb" is found in the list, and the check box is set to allow multiple points, Sharbel will be awarded 2 points (1 for Sharbel and 1 for Sharb).&nbsp; This check was added because some guilds allow multiple points to be awarded and others don`t.</P>
<P>I added a field in the player profile for the player`s email address.</P>
<P>Fixed the item edit, it should be ok now.</P>
<P>Optimized a few more database calls, you should see the attendance utility go a lot faster, especially for big lists.</P></font></span>

<P>I also added the function to remove a player from a specific raid.&nbsp; You can use this function by clicking on any raid which brings you to the participant list.&nbsp; When you are logged in as an administrator, you will see a delete icon to the the left of each name (It`s sissors).. click the button, confirm the delete, and the player will be removed from the raid list, and the app will take away the points given to him/her for that raid.&nbsp; If the player has a purchase attached to to that raid, you will have to remove the purchase first.</P>
<P>Fixed a couple links on the Item List and Purchases List that were not taking the correct colors for a hyper-link</P>
<P>I optimized the participation list for raids.. the database calls are MUCH more effecient.... not like it matters really, its usually only working with 30-60 rows of data, but it`s the principle of things :)</P>
<P>Well, going to troll some boards .. /wave</P></font></span>

<P>I also added the ability to delete purchases from the purchase list.&nbsp; When you log in as admin, there will be a delete column, similar to other grids that serve the same function.&nbsp; After you confirm the delete, it will delete the raid and reimburse the player for the points listed in the item purchase.</P>
<P>When you use the profile editor, you don`t have to login multiple times.. it will save the login info until you close your browser window.&nbsp; It was actually like that all along, but i had it turned off for the last week to test something else, and forgot to turn it back on :)</P>

<P>&nbsp;Some of you have emailed me asking why the alternate character listing has been getting wiped...&nbsp; I really had no answer as there was no problems with the database, and nobody was reporting crashes.&nbsp; Well I think i found the problem.. I was getting paranoid that someone might have been using malicous code to try to wipe the database, and in doing that I found a very silly mistake in one of my database calls.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it is the problem.</P>
<P>Going to ask everyone to re-add their alternates and see if everything is ok.&nbsp; Thank god it was just the alts, and not the player list :) That would have been a mess!</P>
<P>Tonight I am going to be working at some of the excellent suggestions I have been getting.. look for another update later tonight!</P></font></span>
