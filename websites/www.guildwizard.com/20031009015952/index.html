<P>Next patch will take care of the issues that have been reported in the last couple weeks.&nbsp; Raid, Encounter, Item grid sorting is up first.. I am also going to do some searching in certain areas where the cache isn`t updating immediatly, namely after raids are entered.</P></font></span>

<P>&nbsp;I will admit, I wasn`t sure how well it would work... to my knowlege, GuildWizard.com is the only site of it`s kind that can handle custom domains like this.&nbsp; Most services just can`t offer it, because of software/programming limitations.&nbsp; I had implement 3 different methods in order to accomplish it, but it was worth it in the end.&nbsp; I really think it will add a lot more to a guild`s site if the name is personalized.</P>
<P>I will keep the cost for registering custom domains very competitive.&nbsp; Roughly half the cost of what Network Solutions charges, but I have to make sure.</P></font></span>

<P>Keep one thing in mind, if you enter an invalid date/time it will substitute it with the current date/time.&nbsp; Follow the same format as the default date/time format that is inserted when you enter a new item (I programmed it to pre-fill the date/time in the text box when you are creating a new news item).</P></font></span>

I have to get back to my `real` work, so I probably wont be fiddling much with guildwizard till tommorow.</P>
<P>There was a problem with deleting raids for some guilds.&nbsp; It depended on certain conditions that arent really important, but it would cause the function to lock up and not delete the raid properly (or at all).&nbsp; So to temporarily fix it, I put a bandaid on it yesterday to fix it until I could fix it the right way later that night.. well I did end up fixing it, but I fell asleep at the keyboard while testing it!</P>
<P>Anyway, its fixed :)&nbsp; I am going to code in a checkbox to select to automatically roll-back any purchases associated with the raid being deleted too.&nbsp; Right now, it just stops you from deleting it and you have to manually do it..&nbsp; I will change that once I see the new code is working well for a couple days.&nbsp; I added and deleted about 10 raids on my test site and it looks fine.</P></font></span>

<LI>I changed the way you add members to the private forums.&nbsp; Prior to this patch you had to get the username exactly or it wouldnt work.&nbsp; Instead of this, I have created a search function which will search the database for the username which most closely matches your entered username.&nbsp; It then presents a grid of possible matches, and you simply click the "Add User" button for the username you want to add.</LI>
<LI>You can now sort the order in which your forums appear.&nbsp; On the forum list grid, there is now a column with an up arrow and down arrow for each forum name on the list.&nbsp; You can move the forums arround by clicking these arrows to change their position in the list.</LI>
<LI>I changed the layout of a couple sections.. I will probably tweak it more so that its more intuitive (easy to use).</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp; Thanks to <FONT face=Arial size=2>Velyanae </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>Guild Leader</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2> of&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Contagion (Terris Thule), I was able to find the bug that caused your admin buttons to disappear, and give you a second copy of the non-admin bugs.&nbsp; Velyanae told me when it was happening, and from there I was able to isolate the problem.&nbsp; Turns out it was just a cache problem.. I was recaching two button sections when you editted or deleted buttons, instead of caching one admin and one non-admin section..&nbsp; thanks Velyanae!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I added a validator to the links entry page to complain if you dont have a full URL (<A href="http://www.guildwizard.com">http://www.guildwizard.com</A>) and not just <A href="http://www.guildwizard.com">www.guildwizard.com</A>&nbsp; .&nbsp; The linking system requires a full URL (needs the http://), without it you get your guild URL tacked infront of the real URL , which is dumb :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, this way it will prevent that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I will be adding this validator on the buttons, screenshots and other pages that the problem could occur.</FONT></P></font></span>

<P>This is a note, ok a plea to people posting pictures for news items, profiles, gallery items etc.. OPTIMIZE YOUR IMAGES!&nbsp; Now as you know I have been really tightening up Guildwizard...&nbsp;and I am running a lot of analysis on how much bandwith is being used etc.&nbsp; I am noticing that images are being posted in excess of 125kb per image, which is quite large.&nbsp; I, for fun, optimized the same image and got it down to 35k.&nbsp; Thats a huge difference..&nbsp; </P>
<P>So..&nbsp; this is where its at.&nbsp; I am going to politely ask everyone to optimize their JPEGS a little better...&nbsp; you dont have to have the settings at Maximum for general web-browsing, for the most part.&nbsp; You can easily get an image to be a third of the file size by setting down to Medium or Medium Low, instead of Maximum.</P>
<P>In the next few weeks I will see if people are doing it themselves.. if not, I am going to write an automated service on the server which will `Do it for you`..&nbsp;I will probably enforce smaller uploads too, if need be.&nbsp; I don`t want to do it, as its about 5-6 hours of work that I could spend on other guildwizard features, instead of playing bandwith cop :)</P></font></span>

<span id="DataList1__ctl8_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I wrote a filter to prevent hotlinking of images for all guildsites.&nbsp; If you hotlink an image that resides in your guildsite, it will not show that image, it will show a default Guild Wizard icon.&nbsp; The reason for this can be viewed below in the yesterday`s news entry..&nbsp; I let it go until I found out that people were abusing it.. especially the dolt(s) who were ebaying their items and linking images to my server /bonk</P>
<P>Anyway, I also found a bug on the profile editor.. some guild who were in their trial period were not able to submit or upload changes on the profile editor.&nbsp; This should be fixed now... also found a bug which was not updating the roster/item/purchase config settings in the cache until it was reset (which defeats the purpose of caching).. thats fixed now.</P>
<P>Tommorow night I think I am going to start the Admin`s FAQ page.. it will be a FAQ (go figure) list of common questions on setting up/configuring your site.. as well as some neat tricks and suggestions for your site.&nbsp; This is LONG overdue..&nbsp; </P></font></span>

<span id="DataList1__ctl9_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>EDIT: Forgot to mention I enabled an ISAPI filter to prevent hotlinking images to my server... sorry,&nbsp;2 gigs in one day is just ridiculous.&nbsp; I am going to keep this on to see how much is hotlinked .. btw, I really don`t want hotlinking anyway, the file space provided is for your GUILDWIZARD SITE.. not for sigs on other sites etc.. heck someone is hotlinking stat pics&nbsp;for their Player Auction auctions! </P>
<P>Thanks to the emails/reports I got from guildleaders, i was able to fix these problems:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Filemanager now properly creates a directory the first time its accessed.&nbsp; I forgot to enable this when I was finished testing. 
<LI>Gallery uploads will work properly now, for newly created guildsites 
<LI>Changes made to visible items on the Roster, Item View, Raid View, and encounter view will show up immediatly after changing them.&nbsp; I forgot to refresh the cache when I did the update. 
<LI>Deleted players will be uncached from the roster when deleted/restored 
<LI>Fixed bug with logo/banner not uploading properly for newly created guild sites</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp; I am sure there are other things I have to tweak/fix I will fix them as I get the reports, or as I catch them.&nbsp; Thanks for the reports/help so far!</P></font></span>
