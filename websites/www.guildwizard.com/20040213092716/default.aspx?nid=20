<P>After the next patch, each page will have a global permission, which will either allow Everyone, Members Only, or Officers only to view.&nbsp; From there, certain pages will also have "micro permissions" that can be mananged as well.&nbsp; For example, you can set the Roster to let everyone view the Page, but only logged-in Members can see DKP information, and only Officers can see DKP totals.</P>
<P>Every page that has a configuration column will have a new field added to include logged in Members.</P>
<P>These features will be present in custom pages as well.&nbsp; You will be able to set permissions on the pages you make.&nbsp; This way if you have a strategy, or maybe a long-term plan you want only Guildmembers to see, you can lock it up.</P>
<P>I should have it done in a couple days..&nbsp;&nbsp; Post on the forums if you have an input or suggestions for this!</P></font></span>

<P>As it stands, all changes are client-side.&nbsp; When you make changes, you will see the preview panel items change instantly.&nbsp; Even the textures that you choose will instantly show up in the element that is going to inherit the texture.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also wrote a script for the Skins list..&nbsp; when you choose a skin, the screen instantly changes to that skin, giving you a preview.&nbsp; A popup box then asks you if you want to keep this skin, or go back to your other style.&nbsp; This is nice for the times you just want to look, without commiting.</P>

<P>&nbsp;I am working on the reprogram of the color configuration page, its going to be a lot more usable when I am done.&nbsp; If you have used it, you know that everytime you change a color it submits the change and redraws the page.. which is incredibly dumb.&nbsp; Now, it redraws clientside, so its instant and much much much much faster (yes, I said much 4 times because its that much faster! hehe).&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are done editing your style sheet, you can then click the Save button that will then submit the changes to the server, uploading any textures at that time etc.&nbsp; Besides the preview on the screen itself, I will probably have a Preview button which will change the current page (all its elements) to the new stylesheet before you save it.. just incase you dont like it.</P>
<P>I will also be including parameters for the calendar`s style editing.&nbsp; If you remember I never did add in the css Classes for the calendar when I redid the calendar last month.&nbsp; You will again have full control over calendar colors when the update is done.</P>
<P>Back to the raid page.. the reason I can`t fix it right now is because the source code for that component exists in the same component that I am working on right now (the main guildwizard engine).&nbsp; I can`t recompile it until I get the color changes done, so look for the fix finished with the next patch, in a day or so.&nbsp; Purchases are working fine, its just the display on the raid detail that isnt coming up.</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl6_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>The raid dump feature that was recently added to the Raid Management console, which right now is broken, will be added to the Raid insertion page.&nbsp; I am going to continue support for the present method of insertion (the fugly /who list), but I encourage everyone to use the raid dump feature instead.</P>
<P>Up until the dump feature was added in EQ, the who list (or raid channel dumps etc) was the only way to parse who was on the raid.&nbsp; This new feature will create a text file of everyone on the raid, their group #, and the group leaders.&nbsp; Only the name will be parsed.</P>
<P>I have the component finished, I just have to write the database parameters to handle the new component.&nbsp; So look for another message later today, tommorow at the latest.</P></font></span>

<P>There was a bug in the roster edit that prevented you from editing it if you had columns hidden to everyone, including Admins.&nbsp; Prior to the fix you had to have the visibility to be set to atleast Admins to see it, so that you could edit.&nbsp; This has been fixed.</P>
<P>I looked around at methods that I might have forgotten to re-fill the cache after updates.&nbsp; This caused the roster, for example, to not show the correct number of raids or points when an admin would update it.&nbsp; I found a few, and fixed it.. there are probably more, I will find the rest and fix em.</P></font></span>

<P>There was a bug in my graphics handling engine, which caused Gif images to get converted to jpeg images.&nbsp; It wasn`t a big deal, unless the gif was animated, or had transparent backgrounds.&nbsp; This is now fixed, and my engine will output gifs as gifs.&nbsp; This engine is the one that checks to make sure nobody is hot-linking pictures to the server.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also increased the timeout timer for logins.&nbsp; So if you are logged in and editing your news or whever, it won`t make you login if you spend more than 30minutes of inactivity (typing etc).&nbsp; It now gives you 60 minutes.</P>
<P>I am probably going to implement an items database in the next patch.&nbsp; This will allow you to pick items from a centralized list with proper stats/graphics and simply assign your value to the item upon purchase.&nbsp; I have to implement it so its backwards compatible with the existing system, hopefully it won`t be&nbsp;a big deal :)</P>
<P>Also, the new raid dump feature of the Guild Manager in EQ will be coded in.. i just need someone to email me a sample of the dump so I can code up my parser to accept it.&nbsp; Ironically, I am not in a guild, and don`t have access to a sample file right now.&nbsp; So if someone can email me with a sample file, that would be great!</P></font></span>
