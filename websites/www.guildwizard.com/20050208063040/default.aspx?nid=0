							Guild forum registration button 
							Wednesday, January 26, 2005 - 4:03:31 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I did a small patch today to allow admins the ability to flag the Register button to be hidden for the guild forums.&nbsp; This is a small measure because some admins are having trouble conveying to their members that they should be using their guild account to use the forums, instead of registering for one.</P>
<P>I will expand on this to allow admins the ability to restrict registration accounts until they are approved by the admin to avoid anon posting.&nbsp; </P>

						<h2>
							Small patch today
							Sunday, January 23, 2005 - 8:11:01 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Today I did a couple bug fixes as well as some feature additions to the private message section of the forums.&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
<LI>I disabled the EQ News feed.&nbsp; It was causing a javascript error because it looks like Sony cut our feed.&nbsp; I am thinking they did it, not knowing it was legit traffic.. they might have thought it was a flood attack if a lot of busy sites were getting the feed, and Sony saw it all coming out of a handfull of IP ranges.. </LI>
<LI>I created a Sent Messages section to the private messages, so you can see messages that you sent.</LI>
<LI>I fixed a bug that was preventing private messages to be deleted when you are viewing a single message.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Admins can now mass delete threads in the forum admin section.&nbsp; Click the "Manage Threads" link, which will allow you to move/delete threads. </LI></UL>

						<h2>
							DKP Item Manager
							Wednesday, December 29, 2004 - 8:55:13 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Last night I deployed the new DKP Item Manager.&nbsp; The new manager allows a few more options with regards to dkp item management:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You can specify a link to the stats for an item, instead of entering them in yourself.&nbsp; So instead of entering in the item stats, you can put a link to Thotbot (or whatever site you use for stats), and when someone clicks the item it will open a new window to stat site. </LI>
<LI>You can flag items as active/in-active now.&nbsp; Sometimes you have items in your list that you know you will never award again, but don`t want to delete the item since it will erase any purchases attached to it.&nbsp; Simply flag the item as inactive and it will not show up in the list anymore, but *will* still show up for purchases.</LI>
<LI>When you delete an item, it will automatically roll back any purchases attached to the dkp item.&nbsp; So if 10 people used dkp points for that item, and you delete it, they will get their dkp points back and the purchases will be erased.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>The stats entry box for the items is now a multi-line box.&nbsp; Don`t ask me why it wasn`t before...&nbsp; If you are going to paste HTML into the box, you can, just be aware that the system will automatically convert New Lines (when you hit Enter key) to a &lt;br /&gt; tag (line-break).&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P>I will now start re-doing the `front-end` pages for the various DKP pages that I re-did the back-end for.&nbsp; I think I will do the DKP Item list first, the DKP Purchase page next as they are fairly straight forward.&nbsp; The guild raid list, and the guild roster is going to be a little more involving.</P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Guild DKP Purchase Manager
							Monday, December 13, 2004 - 6:49:23 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I deployed another <STRONG>DKP </STRONG>administration panel today.&nbsp; The <STRONG>DKP Purchase manager </STRONG>is fairly similar to the old DKP Purchase manager, but also integrates the delete function that was on the <STRONG>DKP Purchase View</STRONG>.&nbsp; I also made the <STRONG>DKP Purchase </STRONG>manager a little friendier to <STRONG>World Of Warcraft (WoW) guilds</STRONG>.&nbsp; The old system had some issues regarding <STRONG>World of Warcraft Guilds</STRONG>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will be chiseling away at the <STRONG>DKP Item </STRONG>back-end now.&nbsp; I saved this panel till last on purpose.&nbsp; I am hoping to get this done properly so it will integrate with other data services.&nbsp; I have to see how receptive the webmasters will be to idea though.</P>
<P>When the <STRONG>DKP Item manager </STRONG>is finished, I am going to start with a re-write on the <STRONG>Guild Roster, Guild Raid, Guild DKP Purchases, and Guild DKP Items </STRONG>front end pages.&nbsp; Since I have moved all admin functions for these front end pages, to the new management panels, I want to recode the front end pages to a much lighter weight page model.&nbsp; Right now, there is a LOT of stuff going on in those pages because of the admin functions built into it.&nbsp; With just presentation needed now, I can really focus on performance and features to just the presentation and not worry about how it affects admin functions.</P>
<P>World Of Warcraft guilds are really using the service now!&nbsp; I do play <STRONG>WoW</STRONG>, but only about once or twice a week (too much work :(&nbsp; ..&nbsp; I really like <STRONG>WoW</STRONG> though, great game!&nbsp; When I get done the above mentioned features, I want to brainstorm a bit with some <STRONG>World of Warcraft guilds</STRONG> to see if we can think of some <STRONG>WoW</STRONG> specific features for <STRONG>Guild Wizard</STRONG>.&nbsp; </P>

						<h2>
							Guild Raid Encounter Manager deployed
							Monday, November 22, 2004 - 10:03:28 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Late last night I deployed the new <STRONG>Guild Raid Encounter Manager</STRONG>.&nbsp; Features of the new <STRONG>guild raid encounter manager</STRONG>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You can do all aspects of <STRONG>guild raid </STRONG>encounter management right on the one manager 
<LI>Deleting encounters is back in. BE CAREFUL and make sure you read the confirmation box before you start deleting stuff.&nbsp; When you delete an encounter, you are going to be deleting <STRONG>guild raids </STRONG>attached to the encounter.&nbsp; Moreover, you will delete any purchases tied to the deleted encounters.&nbsp; If you dont want that, you can use the new feature to disable an encounter (described next) 
<LI>You can now set an encounter as "Inactive".&nbsp; By doing this, it will be removed from your Active <STRONG>Guild Raid Encounter </STRONG>List.&nbsp; So&nbsp;when entering raids/purchases, that encounter will not show up.&nbsp; Setting to inactive will allow you to maintain old raids/purchases attached to the encounter. 
<LI>I added an optional field to allow you to tie a picture to an encounter.&nbsp; This will be tied into the new encounter "Front end" which will be a lot more robust that whats there now, which is merely a boring list of encounters.&nbsp; You basically choose the image from the file manager and it gets tied to the encounter.&nbsp; Then, when I redevelop the <STRONG>encounter/raid </STRONG>front-end , you will be able to flag if you want to display the "Encounter Icon/Picture" on the display screen.... i think its going to spice up the reporting a bit.</LI></UL>
<P>Oh, I also created a side navigation bar for quick access to the other (new) admin panels as I create them.&nbsp; I was getting annoyed myself when adding an encounter, and then wanting to tie a raid to it, I had to open the raid manager from the parent page..&nbsp;&nbsp; I will add the new Purchase &amp; Item manager when I create them.</P>
<P>On the weekend I did a few ninja patches on some bugs.. also added support for the /who list raid entry for EQ1 guilds.&nbsp; I didnt realize guilds still used it to manager their raids :)</P>
<P>Next up on the hit list is the Purchase &amp; Item managers.. then I will get going on the front-end pages like the <STRONG>Roster, Raid List, Profiles </STRONG>etc.&nbsp; </P>

							New DKP Guild Raid Manager
							Friday, November 19, 2004 - 2:50:42 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I deployed the new <STRONG>Guild DKP Raid Manager </STRONG>a little while ago.&nbsp; The new manager fixes a lot of things that was wrong with the old panels, and brings together a lot of the functions that were spread out among the various pages that displayed guild raid information.&nbsp; Here is some of the highlights of the guild raid manager:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You can select <STRONG>multiple raids</STRONG> at once and delete them 
<LI>When you delete a raid, you no longer have to remove purchases attached to it, the new raid manager will take care of everything.&nbsp; When you remove a <STRONG>raid</STRONG>, the guild <STRONG>raid manager</STRONG> will now take away the points given to members listed as attending the raid, as well as remove purchases for the raid and reimburse the points spent on the pruchase 
<LI>You can now re-assign the encounter tied to a raid by clicking the Edit icon on the raid list in the <STRONG>Raid Manager</STRONG> 
<LI>You can now change the point value of a raid and have the change update all members points automatically.&nbsp; So if you entered a raid at a DKP value of 2 but later decide it should have been a value of 5 instead, all people in the raid will be awarded 3 extra points automatically. 
<LI>I added a <STRONG>Raid Note field</STRONG> (optional) so that you can add notes to a raid.&nbsp; Currently the raid display page doesnt use this field, but it will when I re-do that page, so I put it in there for that time 
<LI>A super-fly-TNT high-tech calendar will popup when you click the icon to select the date.&nbsp; Seriously though, you have to manually specify the date now because I was getting way too much bad data in from parsing the log files.. its just a lot simplier this way. 
<LI>You can Add and Remove players from a <STRONG>raid</STRONG> on the same page now in the <STRONG>Raid Manager</STRONG>.&nbsp; Click the Edit icon for the raid and you will see the options to remove/add members to/from the raid 
<LI>You can select multiple users to be removed from a raid now 
<LI>When you upload a <STRONG>Raid Dump file</STRONG>, the checkboxes on the attendance grid are checked by default 
<LI>I removed support for the old /who list batch entry.&nbsp; <STRONG>Raid dump file</STRONG> support has been in a long time so i see no need to support this anymore.&nbsp; 
<LI>The batch file upload is 100% setup now for any other file formats that might surface from <STRONG>EQ2</STRONG> or <STRONG>World Of Warcraft</STRONG>.&nbsp; 
<LI>The layout of the screens are a lot more logical
<LI>I removed editing functions on the <STRONG>Raid List</STRONG> pages.&nbsp; I want to contain everything to the <STRONG>Raid Manager</STRONG> page(s).&nbsp; The <STRONG>Raid List</STRONG> pages are going to be re-developed next week or so, but wanted to get those functions out of there until then.</LI></UL>
<P>I will continue re-developing these dinosaur admin panels.&nbsp; The Encounter panel will be next just to get it out of the way (simple panel compared to the others) and then will get to the item panel.&nbsp; The item panel is going to take a while.. i want to spend some time on that to possibly integrate with some of the data sites like <STRONG>Magelo, Allakhazam</STRONG>, etc.&nbsp; I also want to make the item listing screen configurable so you can put your guild logo`s on the item view.</P>

							Small patch last night - New Guild Raid Manager Coming
							Thursday, November 18, 2004 - 11:05:03 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I did a small patch last night to the new <STRONG>Guild Member Manager</STRONG>.&nbsp; I added paging to the guild member listing grid due to performance issues.&nbsp; Guilds with more than 75 members or so were experiencing very poor performance with all the info being thrown at the browser.&nbsp; Honestly I shouldn`t have even attempted that, I kind of figured that paging would be inevitable. I am working on a new <STRONG>Guild Raid Manager</STRONG> now.&nbsp; I have declared war on the cheesy admin panels that are there now (hey they are two years old, cut me some slack! :)&nbsp; Seriously though, time to address those guild raid management panels, encounter management and most importantly the Item/Loot listings.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I figure the new guild raid manager will take a couple days, just wanted to give a heads up.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>WOW Guilds who do raiding</STRONG>, if you have any suggestions of some things you would like to see, let me know please.&nbsp; As far as I understand,<STRONG> World Of Warcraft</STRONG> doesnt have any type of raid file dump for attendance?&nbsp; If any of the WOW gurus (/nudge Vularm) want to let me know if anything has changed, it would be appreciated.</P>

							New Guild Member Manager
							Wednesday, November 17, 2004 - 4:36:26 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just deployed a very significant patch to the administration section for all guilds.&nbsp; The new <STRONG>Guild Member Manager</STRONG> is management console that replaces the Add Player, Restore Player, Add Officer, Change Member Password pages, as well as all the edit functions of the <STRONG>Guild&nbsp;Roster</STRONG>(s).</P>
<P>Features of this new management console:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allows manual entry of new members 
<LI>Allows batch entry of members from an <STRONG>EQ dump file or CSV/TDF file </STRONG>
<LI>You can multi-delete users from the guild on the new Member Listing 
<LI>You can edit ALL data regarding a user on the Member Listing 
<LI>You can permenantly delete a user from the guild now (ahem bout time) 
<LI>You can set users to be shown on the Guild Roster or not 
<LI>You can now add users to be listed as Allys or Recruits.. these users are not members but can still be awarded <STRONG>DKP points </STRONG>etc. 
<LI>You can add Alternate Characters and tie them to a main character 
<LI>Officer management can be done through the officer manager or you can use the Edit Member button on the Member Listing to set the users "role" 
<LI>The Rosters are not longer editable.. all editing will be done in the Guild Member manager from now on.&nbsp; The Rosters are going to get their arses kicked into shape soon with a very significant update. 
<LI>You can reset user`s passwords in the <STRONG>Guild Member manager</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>I will probably post some FAQ + How To`s on the forums later to do some common tasks with the new admin panels.</P>

							World of Warcraft (WoW and Everquest2 (Eq2) coming soon!
							Tuesday, November 02, 2004 - 8:34:57 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well, we are pretty close to WoW and EQ2 being released and a lot of people are getting excited (me included!).&nbsp; WoW guilds are starting to sign up in droves the last few days, and there are some nice WoW guild websites coming up.&nbsp; I am not partial to WoW, as I havent even played it yet, but the WoW screen shots look really cool!&nbsp; I was in the Everquest 2 beta, so I am pretty familiar how it looks.&nbsp; EQ2 is a great game, it`s going to be tough for me to choose which one to play.</P>
<P>Anyway.&nbsp; Now that WoW and EQ2 are so close, and my current projects should be wrapping up by next week, I expect to release some pretty solid patching the next few weeks.&nbsp; Specifically, the Player Profile pages need their butts whipped into shape.&nbsp; They are not really friendly to WoW or EQ2 guilds, which needs to be addressed.&nbsp; WoW guilds have no use for fields like AA points, or Magelo Link (yet?), so I need to create an interface similar to the Custom Roster admin panel which allows you to name your columns to what makes sense to your game/guild.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Speaking of Guild Rosters...&nbsp; I need to create some alternate views for the custom guild Roster page.&nbsp; I have some ideas based on some excellent user feedback, and expect to be able to implement pretty much everything suggested.</P>
<P>The Item viewer is also going to get some work.&nbsp; It`s going to be fully skinable just like the rest of the service, with a much easier interface to create and import item statistics from the various data feeds around.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyhow, I just wanted to give everyone an update on what`s coming up in the next patch(s).&nbsp; As I said, I just have to clear my current workload of projects and then Guild Wizard is going to get some programming time alotted.</P>

							PayPal option for payments
							Thursday, October 14, 2004 - 12:46:35 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Our credit card processor continues to have problems with connectivity, so I enabled PayPal payments for those having trouble paying.&nbsp; The payment isn`t recurring or anything like that, it`s the same as paying with our payment form.&nbsp; The only thing is, you have to put your guild address and what you are paying for in the Note field, as we have to manually process the payments.&nbsp; If we see a lot of people using the PayPal option, I will program everything to go automatically.</P>
<P>If you can, do use the payment form instead of the PayPal as it costs us less.&nbsp; Also, the payments are applied to the account instantly.</P>
