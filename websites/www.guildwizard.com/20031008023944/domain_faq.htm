      <P><FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG>What if I already own my own domain?<BR></STRONG></FONT>
      If you already own a domain, and have DNS set up, you simply have to email me for instructions.  I will
       need to know the domain name, and your guild's name.  You will also need to point the DNS to the guildwizard server.</P>

			<td style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">
      <P><FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG>Q: If we didn't register through you, is there an additional charge to use our domain?</STRONG><BR></FONT>
      A: No, not at this time.  The only requirement, is that you are a paid GuildWizard subscribing guild.</P>

			<td style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">
      <P><FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG>Q: Is DNS hosting included in the registration fee?</STRONG><BR></FONT>
      If you are registering the domain through GuildWizard.com, I will host the DNS at no charge.  This is subject
       to change.  If you registered your domain elsewhere and need DNS hosting, the cost is $10US.  Email us if you need this set up.</P>

      <P><FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG>Q: Who 'owns' the domain when I register 
      it?</STRONG><BR></FONT>A: You own the domain, I am simply registering it 
      for you.&nbsp; You have full rights to the name, and full control over the 
      domain account.</P>

      <P><FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG>Q:What if we stop using GuildWizard? Can the domain be used still??</STRONG><BR></FONT>A: 
       Yes, since you have control over the domain, you can point it to another service very easily.</P>
