<P>It honestly wont be hard to implement at all.. i just need the time to do it.&nbsp; Of course the forums have to get done before anything.&nbsp; Lots of guilds are&nbsp;using them, as I am adding features and I am getting some good ideas from the various suggestions!&nbsp; I&nbsp;expect to spend some time today on adding some&nbsp;features .. probably a&nbsp;New messages icon on the forum list to show forums with new messages..&nbsp; </P>

<P>Here is some of the stuff I added on the new forums today:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed the Member Role, so pages secured by the Members Only permission will work 
<LI>Thread list page will now show unread messages, by popular demand 
<LI>Fixed Sticky and Lock Threads so Officers can do it.. i had it set to Admin account only 
<LI>I fixed a validation problem that was preventing some posts from going through 
<LI>The member list in the Private Message page is now sorted by name to find the recipient name easier 
<LI>Admin/Officer action log is working (this was done yesterday) 
<LI>Fixed a bug which didnt allow Display names if someone in another guild had same Display Name, it now only checks display names in your own guild, the way it`s supposed to. 
<LI>Tuned some indexes on the database.&nbsp; Probably in vein, as I really cant get a good representation of what I should be tuning until more guilds start using the new forums. 
<LI>Locked threads now properly show the locked icon in the thread list (still have to put locked button on message view though) 
<LI>The forum order tool (to re-order your forums in the list) works now 
<LI>The admin grid in the Manage Forums area that shows the forum list with the current security level will now show the description instead of just a number (Will show “Members Only“ instead of &nbsp;“2“)</LI></UL>
<P>The forums are starting to come together.. there is only about 5-6 guilds using them since I deployed them yesterday.. i need about 50 of you guilds to start using them so I can start performance tuning though..&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will continue trying to add the core features of the forums and kill any bugs that I get reported.&nbsp; After the weekend, I anticipate having very little time to do any work on the forums.. I am likely starting on a very large project, which is about a 2 month programming job.&nbsp; That doesn`t mean I wont do anything for two months, it just means I won`t have as much time, as my client is kind of anxious to get this application done (aren`t they all? :)</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl4_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Wow, finally got a night where I could spend a little while programming the forums.&nbsp; I actually got a lot done.. i pretty much did all the Private Messsages part of the forums.. i designed all the objects, and created all the stored procedures for the database, and got the presentation pages done too.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also changed the colors on the beta forums, from the funky red to black..&nbsp; I was getting teased too much so I figured it was time to change it.&nbsp; BTW, the forums follow the same color scheme as your base site.. i shouldn`t say `base site`, as it`s 100% part of the site now, so it inherits the stylesheet like any&nbsp;other page.</P>
<P>I also spent a little time on the User objects..&nbsp; here is low down so far.&nbsp; Your guild members will NOT have forum access, until you give it to them.&nbsp; Giving them access is as easy as clicking a check box next to the people`s names you want to give access to, and clicking the button.&nbsp; I don`t want to give people access without the guildleader/officer giving to them.&nbsp; Now, people will be able to sign up to your forums (non-guildmembers/visitors etc).. they will fill out a form requesting a username/password etc.. and they have to validate their email like the other forums.&nbsp; I am probably going to not allow them to post until you (the guildleader) approves the account... maybe I will set that as an option.</P>
<P>Anyway... a few people have emailed me asking me to make the forums available for use before they are 100% done.. they don`t want to keep using the old forums if the posts are going to not carry over, which is understandable.&nbsp; The only thing I can say, is I will do my best to get it to that point soon.&nbsp; It`s really not that far off, so hopefully I can find a few more hours to do it.</P></font></span>

<P>There are still things that need to be coded, namely private messages and the emote icons.. plus I need to code the paging for the message and thread list (to only show 30 messages per page etc).</P>
<P>The link to this first build is <A href="http://newforums.guildwizard.com/forums/forumlist.aspx">http://newforums.guildwizard.com/forums/forumlist.aspx</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... this is a dummy guildwizard site running on a seperate server.&nbsp; It would help me out if people go there and create an account and post some.&nbsp; I need people to post and let me know if any errors creep up.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will post another build in a couple days when I get the private messages going etc.</P></font></span>

I might create a subdomain or something to test it out and run&nbsp;another instance of guildwizard just to test.</P>
<P>Regarding existing forum transfers..&nbsp; I am not sure how it will work.&nbsp; The database structure is very different from the current forums, due to the multi-guild use.. if I can figure out a good way to transfer messages, I will.&nbsp; If you are going to commit suicide over loosing message forums, I might keep the current forums active.&nbsp; No offense, but some people get pretty violent and whiney when you mess with their forums :)</P>
<P>The new forums are pretty much usable right now, but very untested.. private messages still have to be coded though.&nbsp; I am only sneaking in a little coding here and there, as I am very busy with work, not to mention holiday stuff with the familiy..&nbsp;&nbsp; I will need a few (or 100) of you to give the new forums a workout with test posts and screwign around on it, trying to break it, when I post it for testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I sure hope it performs better than the existing forum, my head is shaved atm, and I wish I had hair so I could pull my hair out waiting for that damn forum to load .. hehe</P></font></span>

<P>I am going to pick the features that I think are really usefull and implement them.. I am also going to scrap a lot of the features that I think are total fluff features (features that are worthless, just programmed in so the feature list looks good).&nbsp; From my conversations with people, most people want a lightweight, fast, organized and easy to use forum system that <STRONG>integrates seamlessly</STRONG> with their existing site.</P>
<P>If you want to to voice your opinions &amp; concerns regarding the new forums, post on <A href="http://forums.guildwizard.com/?f=21&amp;m=43108">this thread</A></P></font></span>

<P>Again, this is only on the Custom Roster. To change over to the custom roster, log in as an Admin/Officer account and click the custom roster button that is above the grid.&nbsp; You can switch back and forth between standard and custom roster btw.&nbsp; That was patched a few weeks ago, I dont think I reported it though :)</P>
