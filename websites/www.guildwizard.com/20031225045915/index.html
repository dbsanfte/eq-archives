<P>There are still things that need to be coded, namely private messages and the emote icons.. plus I need to code the paging for the message and thread list (to only show 30 messages per page etc).</P>
<P>The link to this first build is <A href="http://newforums.guildwizard.com/forums/forumlist.aspx">http://newforums.guildwizard.com/forums/forumlist.aspx</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... this is a dummy guildwizard site running on a seperate server.&nbsp; It would help me out if people go there and create an account and post some.&nbsp; I need people to post and let me know if any errors creep up.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will post another build in a couple days when I get the private messages going etc.</P></font></span>

I might create a subdomain or something to test it out and run&nbsp;another instance of guildwizard just to test.</P>
<P>Regarding existing forum transfers..&nbsp; I am not sure how it will work.&nbsp; The database structure is very different from the current forums, due to the multi-guild use.. if I can figure out a good way to transfer messages, I will.&nbsp; If you are going to commit suicide over loosing message forums, I might keep the current forums active.&nbsp; No offense, but some people get pretty violent and whiney when you mess with their forums :)</P>
<P>The new forums are pretty much usable right now, but very untested.. private messages still have to be coded though.&nbsp; I am only sneaking in a little coding here and there, as I am very busy with work, not to mention holiday stuff with the familiy..&nbsp;&nbsp; I will need a few (or 100) of you to give the new forums a workout with test posts and screwign around on it, trying to break it, when I post it for testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I sure hope it performs better than the existing forum, my head is shaved atm, and I wish I had hair so I could pull my hair out waiting for that damn forum to load .. hehe</P></font></span>

<P>I am going to pick the features that I think are really usefull and implement them..

											<span id="DataList1__ctl8_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P><STRONG>Small patch today to fix a couple bugs:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The Edit/Update function of the Custom&nbsp;Roster should be fixed now... well I am hoping anyway.&nbsp; The problem appears to have been a stored-procedure that was incorrectly adjusting the column index.&nbsp; I am pretty sure its fixed right now, but will check the logs for errors pertaining to this.&nbsp; I tested it for about 10 minutes and it seemed fine.. i don`t have time to test it longer, I have a ton of work to finish this weekend for work :( 
<LI>The column order tools should be working 
<LI>Fixed the column insert to not allow duplicate column types (not allow 2 Player Name columns etc) 
<LI>Fixed column insert to validate that a column Header Text was added 
<LI>Fixed column edit to require a valid Header Text 
<LI>I fixed something else too... i just cant remember!</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Upcoming features.. : (which might not be for a while... i have a lot of projects on the go for work)</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>I will probably start on a guild-bank type utility.. I`ve had a&nbsp;lot of requests for this lately.&nbsp; It`s not going to be EQ specific though, I want it to be like the custom roster where you can add your own columns/fields.. 
<LI>I am going to add support for the custom roster to have a View by Class view, similar to the standard roster.</LI></UL>
<P>When the above two are done.. I am probably going to start writing a new forum.&nbsp; I don`t like the existing forum setup at all.&nbsp; I don`t like the how its seperated and how you need 2 accounts (which I could fix, but it doesn`t address the other issues).&nbsp; I wan`t the guild-leader/officer to have TOTAL control.. right now it`s half-assed how you can edit/delete/sticky stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The forums were not written by me..&nbsp; and they are not written in my preferred programming language (C#).&nbsp; So instead of hacking around the existing code like I have been doing, I think it`s time for me to buckle down and make my own forum.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me say that the existing forum if it were used by 1 guild is a great forum.. it has a lot of features, and its well written.. I am not putting down the creator`s work.. he did a great job.&nbsp;&nbsp; It`s just not working out for how Guild Wizard is set up.</P>
<P>The new forums will be a large project that will take weeks just to get it in a workable state.&nbsp; At first I will only allow a few guilds to use it, so they can test it and report issues.&nbsp; When I feel it`s usable, I will disable the old forums and everyone will move over to the new ones...&nbsp; I am pretty sure I will be able to copy over all the posts, so nobody looses anything, btw.</P>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl9_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Well&nbsp;I finally got some time to test the custom roster out.&nbsp; To change over to the new custom roster, login as an admin/officer account and click the Custom Roster button.. confirm that you want to do it, and you will then start out with a Roster with only the Delete and Edit&nbsp; rows (they are fixed columns).&nbsp; From there, click on the Configure View link and add the columns you want.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, here is my patch blurb:</P>
<P>Custom Roster Info/Features:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You are able to add the columns you want to the roster</LI>
<LI>You can put your own heading description at the top of each column</LI>
<LI>You can change the left-to-right order of the columns that you add</LI>
<LI>You can fully sort data, ascending and descending, any columns - even custom columns</LI>
<LI>New Base columns can be added anytime by me, as I get suggestions for them</LI>
<LI>The grid is only binding the columns added, which is very efficient</LI>
<LI>Your columns are cached, which means the software isn`t calling the database each time your grid is shown, bigtime performance increase.</LI>
<LI>You can set security permissions on each column, even custom columns</LI>
<LI>Column headers can have images instead of just the text (broken, will fix next patch)</LI>
<LI>Support for other games will be done with this Roster.&nbsp; Infact, I will likely make it the default Roster for any new guilds joining, once I see there are no bugs.</LI></UL>
<P>As for the FFXI support.. it`s there.&nbsp; Currently I have 2 guilds set as FFXI guilds, and they can start fooling around.&nbsp; Honestly the only difference is the Races, Classes, and Secondary Classes.. </P></font></span>
