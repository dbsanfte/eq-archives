							Alternate characters bug found
							Tuesday, January 21, 2003 - 4:16:58 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Update 8:00PM -&nbsp;Really, it`s fixed now :) LoL I fixed one thing before and broke 2 other things, all fixed though (gesh i hope) :)&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;Some of you have emailed me asking why the alternate character listing has been getting wiped...&nbsp; I really had no answer as there was no problems with the database, and nobody was reporting crashes.&nbsp; Well I think i found the problem.. I was getting paranoid that someone might have been using malicous code to try to wipe the database, and in doing that I found a very silly mistake in one of my database calls.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it is the problem.</P>
<P>Going to ask everyone to re-add their alternates and see if everything is ok.&nbsp; Thank god it was just the alts, and not the player list :) That would have been a mess!</P>
<P>Tonight I am going to be working at some of the excellent suggestions I have been getting.. look for another update later tonight!</P>

							Delete Raid - Points Rollback
							Monday, January 20, 2003 - 10:52:39 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							This is long over-due IMHO.. i added function for you to delete a raid that you added.&nbsp; This tool is accesible from the raid list grid, after you log in as an administrator a delete column appears.&nbsp; If you delete a raid, the points that were originally awarded to each participant will be removed, as will the raid itself and any participation data.&nbsp; This function is meant to delete raids that you mistakenly added.. it won`t let you delete a raid that has purchases attached to it.&nbsp; 
						</p>

						<h2>
							Setup done
							Sunday, January 19, 2003 - 8:11:41 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Ok I set up all the guilds that requested a message board, with one.&nbsp; You will now have a button on your navigation bar that says "Message Board".. also when you log in as an admin, you will see the configuration link for the forum admin console.</P>
<P>Everyone who requested a forum should have gotten an email from me.&nbsp; If you didnt receive an email, or if you would like to get a message board set up and didnt request it before,&nbsp; you can email me at <A href="mailto:sharbel@guildwizard.com">sharbel@guildwizard.com</A> and I will set you up.</P>

						<h2>
							Forums In!
							Sunday, January 19, 2003 - 12:48:41 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I finished the forums very late last night and they are functional.&nbsp; I set up 2-3 guilds with their message board, so i can make sure everything is working good before I set everyone up.&nbsp; If you got an email from me telling you that your forum is set up, please tell your guildmates to sign up and use the board.. i really want to get some feedback to see if they are working well or not.</P>
<P>I will be away for the afternoon but when i come back I will add some more guilds that need a forum.&nbsp; It takes a bit longer than I had hoped to set up each guild`s forum.. might have to write a script to automate it (k, i am lazy :) </P>
<P>You can visit GuildWizard.com`s forums by clicking <A href="http://forums.guildwizard.com/?c=4">here</A></P>

							Error watch + Message Board On the way
							Saturday, January 18, 2003 - 5:41:03 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I have been on bug stomping watch all day, and man you guys own for reporting them!&nbsp; Thanks, it really is helpful to a programmer when the users report the bugs, and help me in determining the source of the bug.</P>
<P>There is one bug that I am still getting... If anyone gets an error "Object Not Set To An Instance Of An Object" please try to remember what you were doing when you got the errror, and email me the details.</P>
<P>Message board!&nbsp; Yes, it should be ready tonight for use.&nbsp; Guys, this message board is going to be nice..&nbsp; It`s a very nice alternative to EZ Board (which I happen to really like, but the fees are pretty steep to avoid popups etc).&nbsp; Anyone who check "Yes" for a message board will get an email from with with their forum ID etc and some details on how to add your members . </P>

							Message board on hold & Random Player Update + Text Sizes
							Friday, January 17, 2003 - 7:52:54 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>&nbsp; Up until now the message board I have has been used for other projects but not for anything like this.&nbsp; I am having a small problem with getting the moderation roles set up the way i want.&nbsp; If you signed up and requested a message board, you will get an email from me when I have this settled.&nbsp; I am hoping to have it settled by tommorow!</P>
<P>With all the new signups today it was brought to my attention that even after you delete a player from the roster they still show up in the random player profile display.&nbsp; This has been corrected.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip guys!</P>
<P>I have changed the text sizes from reletive to absolute.&nbsp; Simply what this means is that you shouldn`t have problems anymore if you crank your text size to Large in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; IMHO it`s bad design to do this, since people who are visually impaired could have problems, but I have had too many emails asking why the text was overlapping controls :)&nbsp; </P>
