							Payment processing
							Friday, October 08, 2004 - 11:23:35 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Well I guess our payment processor is the latest target of a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.&nbsp; I`ve been hearing about it all week from various clients of mine that there is a huge campaign against a lot of the payment processors, and I guess it`s my processor`s turn..&nbsp;&nbsp; I *think* it`s fixed now, as they sent their customers a work-around + alternate servers to use.&nbsp; I have updated the payment code to use the new servers and it seems to be working now.</P>
<P>I apologize if anyone was inconvenienced by this.&nbsp; If anyone continues to have trouble with the payment page, PLEASE email me.&nbsp; I will, of course, extend any trial memberships that are expire, and having trouble paying subscriptions.</P>

							Guild gallery upgraded
							Wednesday, September 29, 2004 - 11:50:09 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just got finished deploying a complete re-make of the guild photo gallery page.&nbsp; The old guild gallery was, very simplistic with next to no features.&nbsp; The new guild photo gallery has some very nice features to make organizing and viewing screenshots/photo`s very nice.</P>
<P>Some key features of the new guild photo gallery:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Albums allow you to group images into logical sections.&nbsp; If you want to organize all your raid images in one album, another gallery for guild member images, and another for guild events, you can do it all in the new Guild Gallery Manager (login with your admin account to see the link) 
<LI>You have a LOT more control over the various settings and display of your gallery with the new guild gallery.&nbsp; You can customize how many thumbnail images are displayed per page, how many columns, as well as specifying images for the Next &amp; Previous image viewer.&nbsp; Moreover, the various structural elements of the new gallery are fully CSS ready for the Guild Style Editor for even more customization!&nbsp; I fooled around with the gallery you can make 10 galleries look VERY different from eachother with the various settings!&nbsp;&nbsp; No cookie cutter look here, thx :) 
<LI>You can enable or disable Paging on the thumbnail listing of an Album.&nbsp; Of course, you can also specify the page size (how many thumbnails per page) if you have paging enabled. 
<LI>THANK GOD ALMIGHTY (whoever your God might be) that the thumbnails DO NOT reload on every page load anymore.&nbsp; A major hurdle with dynamically generated images like thumbnails is that most browsers wont cache them locally.&nbsp; I developed a custom HTTP Handler to handle it, some real cool stuff for those geeks who have the slightest clue about what I am talking about.&nbsp; I developed a component that dynamically generates the images for thumbnails etc, and properly complies with the browsers to cache the images locally.&nbsp; 
<LI>When you are browsing pictures by clicking the Previous &amp; Next buttons to cycle through images, you will notice that the images are changed without the page refreshing.&nbsp; Anyone who has ever used Coopermine gallery knows how slow and annoying it is to cycle through images.
<LI>You can set Permissions on each album.&nbsp; You can set albums to be viewed by Everyone, Guildmembers or just Admins/Officers.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P>One thing that isnt a feature, but kind of a side effect, is that you will have to create an Album to put your existing images into.&nbsp; Don`t flip when you go to your Guild Gallery page and see the message "No Albums Configured".&nbsp; You just have to go into the Gallery Admin page and create an Album.&nbsp; Then go into the Image section and assign the images in the Uncatagorized Group to your newly created Album.&nbsp; </P>

							Guild News Items paging enabled
							Thursday, September 23, 2004 - 4:27:07 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I enabled paging for the guild news page (default page).&nbsp; You will see the pager on the top and bottom, if you have more than 5 news items in your guild news page.&nbsp; Some guilds have a lot of news items, with a lot of images and screenshots from guild raids, resulting in some pretty pathetic page load times.&nbsp; (Oh, before I forget, COMPRESS YOUR IMAGES!!!).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, those guilds with a lot of news items should see a pretty big speed increase when loading the guild news page.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Next up is the gallery page.&nbsp; I know this is coming out of nowhere, but I developed a gallery component for another website of mine, and it`s going to fit nicely into guildwizard.&nbsp; The new gallery will support Albums, which basically allows you to categorize your images.&nbsp; Also, you will be able to define and customize the gallery quite a bit more, such as being able to specify thumbnail sizes, how many thumbnails per page, number of columns.&nbsp; Moreover, you will be able to browse images by clicking Previous &amp; Next navigation buttons after you click into an image and are in the "Detail View".&nbsp; </P>
<P>The current gallery is pretty Mickey Mouse.. the new gallery will be a hell of a lot more powerful.&nbsp; Yay for developing re-usable, compiled server controls that can be re-used in multiple projects :)</P>

							Guild Forums Polls
							Wednesday, September 22, 2004 - 11:12:11 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I deployed the new guild forum poll function.&nbsp; You will see the button for a New Poll in each forum page that lists the threads.&nbsp; The button, like all the other forum buttons, are configurable to any image you want in the Forum Editor.&nbsp; I have it set that only logged in people can Vote on the Polls.&nbsp; So, if the user has access to the forum that the Poll lives in, they can vote.&nbsp; Once they vote, it`s recorded, and the results thus far is displayed.&nbsp; I also added a "Show Vote Results" link, so people don`t have to vote, to see how the poll is going so far.</P>
<P>I will further enhance the polls by allowing color configuration for the result percent bars.&nbsp; Currently, they are white on green.. I intend on allowing admins to configure the colors.&nbsp; I will also allow admins to set forums to allow Polls or not.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Oh, I also fixed a bug that would delete an entire thread if you tried to delete the first reply of a thread on a page other than 1.&nbsp; </P>

							Guild forum smiley update
							Thursday, September 16, 2004 - 11:39:08 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Small patch today. I changed the guild forums so that the smiley emotes load in a different window when you click the button.&nbsp; I was getting some complaints from people who said the images were being loaded everytime you went to a post screen in the guild forums, which was tedious for dialup users.&nbsp; Now, when you go to a post screen in the guild forums, you will see an icon/link for the emotes.&nbsp; Click it, and a window comes up with all the guild forum emotes.</P>
<P>I was going to do the guild forum voting component next, but might do the guild member profile editor first.&nbsp; The profile editor is about 2 years old now, and hasnt gotten much attention over the last while.&nbsp; I think an update to that is necessary.</P>

							Forum Buttons and Icons configurable
							Tuesday, September 07, 2004 - 4:31:21 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Today`s patch enables guilds to change their guild forum icons and buttons.&nbsp; Previously, guild forums buttons where setup to as text type links where you could change their appearance in the style editors.&nbsp; I now have them setup as Image Buttons, which allows greater design possibilities for guilds.</P>
<P>If you don`t customize your guild forums buttons/icons, the system will just use some default gray buttons.&nbsp; To customize your guild forum buttons and icons, login with your admin/officer account and go to the guild Forum Editor.&nbsp; If you click the Change Forum Icons link, you will be brought to the panel that allows you to change the various icons/buttons.</P>
<P>To change the icons, click the (change) link which brings up the File Manager.&nbsp; Upload/Select the image you want to use and click the save button.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I think for the next patch, I will focus on the guild forums voting component.&nbsp; </P>

							Small forums update
							Thursday, September 02, 2004 - 12:38:40 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I changed the smiley icons access in the forums to show up on the right side of the text box instead of having to click a button for the window.&nbsp; When I created the filemanager a couple weeks ago, I pretty much broke the smiley window which was dependant on the old filemanager page.&nbsp; I will be adding more smileys soon too.. the way I developed the component now, I can add smileys very easily.</P>
<P>I also reworked the way the system complains if you try to post a message in the forums while logged in with the Administrator account.&nbsp; Before, it would just send you to the login page, was very cryptic as to what the problem was.&nbsp; So, to avoid confusing new admins, I created an entry in the error page to display a message explaining that you cant post&nbsp;with the Administrator account.</P>
<P>I think next, I am going to create some configuration settings to allow admins to change the post buttons to graphic buttons.&nbsp; I think the buttons right now in the forums (the buttons you push to make a post/reply etc) look incredibly cheesy.&nbsp; Some guilds have done some pretty cool things with their stylesheet to cover up the cheesyness, but not everyone is that skilled with CSS so I figure if I change them to Image Buttons, it will be a lot easier.</P>
<P>You may have noticed that the updates have been not as frequent the last few weeks.&nbsp; I am involved with a new web-service project that is taking up a lot of time at work and even after hours.&nbsp; I will chip away at my guildwizard TODO list when I get a few hours here and there, like today.</P>

							File Manager - Reloaded
							Tuesday, August 17, 2004 - 11:07:28 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just got finished deploying the new File Manager.&nbsp; This new file manager that I created will allow you to organize uploaded images in directories, copy/paste, move files etc.&nbsp; I think it`s a lot more intuitive than the other one (for the record, I didnt program the other one!!).&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is a help file to explain the various new features, but honestly if you are a Windows user, you should feel right at home as the file manager is very similar to the Windows file manager.&nbsp; I had actually created a pretty neat drag/drop component to allow you to multi-select files/directories and drag them into new directories, but it was only working in Internet Explorer, so I opted for a more tradition `web-application` model.&nbsp; So, instead of drag/drop, you can multi-select, but you have to click the copy/cut icon then paste into the directory you want to copy/move files to.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Next on my list is to start focusing on the forums again.&nbsp; There is a lot of little things that need to get done on the forums, and I have gotten some great feedback (and some whining too!) on new features.&nbsp; Hopefully after the next patch, most of the forum`s unfinished features will be done.</P>

							Image Button Generator
							Thursday, August 12, 2004 - 11:30:48 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I created an Image Button Generator in the Control Editor.&nbsp; Basically, this allows you to select a blank button and add some text to it.&nbsp; The when you select Image Button as they Control Type in the Control Editor, you can now generate a button as well as just uploading a premade image button.</P>
<P>Right now, there is about 75 button styles that you can choose from.&nbsp; When you are in the editor, you can choose the button style by clicking the icon which brings up a new window with a picture list of all the available button types.&nbsp; Double click the button you want to work with, add the text for the button, and click the Generate button which will generate the button and display it on the screen.&nbsp; The image is saved, but the Control is NOT saved untill you click the Save button.</P>
<P>You can create some pretty good buttons with this tool.&nbsp; Keep in mind, it is very basic compared to any half-decent image editor.&nbsp; If you can use an image maniplution program like PhotoShop, you should create your own buttons.&nbsp; This tool is for the people who dont know how to use these programs, and want a simple way to create some buttons.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am going to reprogram the file-manager next.. </P>

							Button Generator, and new domain extensions (TLDs)
							Wednesday, August 11, 2004 - 1:19:17 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I added a few more domain extensions (Top Level Domains) for guilds who want to register a custom domain name.&nbsp; You can now register .com, .net, .org, .info.&nbsp; I can actually register all the TLDs but some of them have restrictions such as .biz can be only for business, .us can only be for Americans, and .name can only be for a personal name etc.&nbsp; I might add them in anyway if people ask for them (can do .de, .co.uk too)</P>
<P>I also fooled around with making&nbsp;a button generator (image button) for the control editor.&nbsp; A *lot* of people are asking me for blank buttons from the templates, and when I give them to them, they ask "Ok what do I do with it?".&nbsp;&nbsp; So..&nbsp; I think i might make a dynamic image button generator.&nbsp; So, you can pick (or upload) a blank button, type in the text, set the width/height and let the system generate the button.&nbsp; The system will actually create&nbsp;an image on the fly and save it to your directory.&nbsp; I actually have it working with hard-coded values.. i just have to make a data-entry form and integrate it with the Control Editor.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Depending how busy work is, I will probably have the button generator done in the next couple days.</P>
