<P>As much as I didn`t want to, it looks like I am going to have to make my own forum.&nbsp; The one I am using now is great, I really like it.. its just not meant to do what I need for guildwizard.&nbsp; I own the source for it, but its in Visual Basic, a language that I *can* program in, but my god I hate programming in vb.&nbsp; Also, I am thinking by the time I get it the way I like , i could have just did it from scratch.. well not really, but you get the picture.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This wont happen anytime soon, and I am still not sure I will do it at all..&nbsp; Just kicking it around.</P></font></span>

											</TABLE>
											<span id="DataList1__ctl1_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Well I intended on doing the forum changes that I was talking about over the weekend but instead ended up doing a huge back-end overhaul on the roster.&nbsp; Guilds who have a large roster will see a huge speed improvement on the roster loading time. I changed the stored procedures and man what a difference it makes on large roster lists!&nbsp; A lot of the roster was coded `the old way` because I just learning .NET back when I coded it..&nbsp;so now the data-access is a lot quicker.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guilds with less than 80 members probably wont notice a difference, but the larger guilds will notice a huge difference.</P>
<P>When View By Name roster is selected, the sorting is now a little more robust.&nbsp; First, all the columns are fully sortable by clicking the column header (Click Level if you want to sort the roster by level).. if you click the column again thats sorted, it will toggle the sort between Ascending and Descending.&nbsp; For example, if you sort by Class by clicking the Class column header it will list the roster by class.&nbsp; If you click the Class column header again after the page loads, it will sort the roster by class Descending.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Also, you can now set the roster default view, by name or by class.&nbsp; You can still toggle between the two views, but now you can go into the Roster Configurator (the panel that you can hide columns etc) and set the default view.&nbsp; This was suggested by a guildleader last week, and I figured while I was working on the page I might as well spend a few minutes to implement it.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestions!</P>
<P>You will also notice that the style-sheet properties of your main roster is now passed on to the Roster By Class.&nbsp; I must have forgot to code that.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that if you want to edit members from the Roster, you will have to toggle over to the Roster by Name view (if you are in Roster By Class view).&nbsp; </P></font></span>

<P>Another change, I finally got around to locking forums of non-subscribing guilds.&nbsp; Prior to this patch, guilds were able to setup a forum during the trial period, add all their members and continue to use the forum even though their trial was finished.&nbsp; This was due to the fact that I didnt have time to sift through the forum code to find where I can disable.&nbsp; Anyway, the forums are still `there` , just disabled till you subscribe.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If I have more time today, I will continue playing with the forum code.&nbsp; I am going to put a link-back to your main guild wizard site so its not such a pain in the butt to get back.&nbsp; Then I will look into the sticky posts and deleting issues!</P></font></span>

<P>So, I am going to try to make it&nbsp;a LOT more private for each guild.&nbsp; As you might know, I didnt write the forums..

<P>From the start, I didnt want to write my own forum software.&nbsp; I simply don`t have time to do it, and I hate to re-invent the wheel.&nbsp; However, if I can`t get the forums the right way, I will have to do it.&nbsp; I am very confident, though, that I can customize the existing boards the way they should be.</P></font></span>

<P>Well after spending all day yesterday trying to figure out why there was bottlenecks to certain sites (not guildwizard sites), I finally narrowed it down to a router at my office.&nbsp; Guildwizard didnt seem to be affected for some reason by this POS (no I dont mean Parents Over Shoulder) router..&nbsp; I think because Guild Wizard`s DNS is managed offsite, it somehow helped, but other sites who`s DNS was fully hosted here were having a heck of a time connecting sometimes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway...&nbsp; now that the router has been replaced, I see a pretty good performance boost on the sites.&nbsp; I linked up via my test proxy and it seems quicker.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Things that are coming in the next few days to guildwizard.&nbsp; Account limitations will start to happen on un-subscribed accounts.&nbsp; I am going to work on a flow chart right now on what exactly will be limited.. maybe I will post a description later on if I have time.&nbsp;</P></font></span>

<P>Also, as you probably noticed, I deployed the advertisements for unsubscribed guilds who have been using the system for more than 30 days.&nbsp; To subscribe, click the PayPal button at the top left of your screen in your guildwizard site.&nbsp; This will take you to Pay Pal.&nbsp; I have a web-service in place that will track which guild is paying, and it will automatically update the status.&nbsp;</P>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl9_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I spent today working on the things discussed yesterday.&nbsp; The ability to add/edit players based on EQs Guild Management text file of your guild members.&nbsp; I have to do a little more coding for this, but will be ready for tommorow.</P>
<P>I also coded the Paypal subscription component.&nbsp; Everything is in place right now for Guild Wizard to move to a subscription model.&nbsp; The only thing that I didnt code yet, is the limiting of abilities for non-subscribers (after the trial period).&nbsp; This will be done after I roll out the update tommorow.&nbsp; I still need to sit down and figure out what will be limited, so there is no need to rush it.</P>
<P>After tommorow, those who have been using Guild Wizard for over 30 days, will see some banners/buttons on their pages.&nbsp; If you want to remove them, your guild will have to subscribe via PayPal which accepts all credit cards etc.&nbsp; I will make a page regarding subscriptions tommorow before I roll out the update.</P>
<P>Subscription cost will be $25 for 6 months, which is less a lot less than other comparable services.&nbsp; Figure if you had to pay hosting alone for your site with a hosting company (without popups), you would be paying atleast $60 for 6 months.&nbsp; Atleast with guildwizard you get all the tools to go with it.</P>
<P>Anyway the update will be in the afternoon (EST) around 1pm if everything goes ok.&nbsp; Downtime should be about 15 minutes in total.</P></font></span>
