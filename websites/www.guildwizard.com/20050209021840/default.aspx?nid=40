							New style editor and layout Progress
							Friday, June 25, 2004 - 9:20:23 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Last night I got a lot of work done on the new style editor, layout editor, and control editor.&nbsp; Controls are a new thingy that I am adding into the admin functions.&nbsp; It`s very similar to the plugins that exist on the system right now, but they are going to be MUCH more advanced and customizable.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On the side panels, you will be able to add controls such as a Picture Control, Linked Picture Control (when clicked it goes to the link you specify), an HTML control for adding custom content, as well as all the propietory guild wizard controls such as Top 10 Raiders, mini-calendar, voting topics etc.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What`s going to be nice, is that if you want to change the look of the Top 10 Raiders grid, for example, you go into the style editor, choose it in the dropdownlist, and start setting all the attributes.&nbsp; The new color selector is a hell of lot better than the cheesy one that`s on there right now.. not to mention you will have a lot more style control elements (font, font-size, text alignment, control over individual borders, background-image etc).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Right now, I have all the base functions complete..&nbsp; I have to made some more administration pages for the new Control system, as well as convert all the pages to the new style system.&nbsp; My best guess is that maybe by the end of next week, I will have the system ready for everyone to start using.</P>

							Changed gears a little
							Tuesday, June 22, 2004 - 4:41:46 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I kind of changed gears on the order of new features.&nbsp; I reported that I was going to start working on the raid manager to make it a little more generic, and less dependant on EQ.&nbsp; Well, I realized that I would be doing some things over if I didn`t do the style and layout editor first.&nbsp; So, I started a couple nights ago on a totally new style editor.</P>
<P>I think everyone is going to like what I have planned for the style editor.&nbsp;I am going to do a General Style page which will control the look and feel of the site.. such as background image, logo, layout of columns, font size, font type, font color etc.&nbsp; Then, each page will have it`s own style editor for the unique elements of that page.&nbsp; So the Roster page will have an editor to control the grid width, header image, colors, font size, link color etc. </P>
<P>Also, I am going to have an Advanced Edit function which will allow leet CSS familiar people the opportunity to work with their guilds stylesheet directly.&nbsp; This is going to be nice for people who know CSS, and want to really customize their site.&nbsp; You can do some pretty amazing things with CSS if you know what you are doing.</P>
<P>I have a basic framework in place, and it`s working very nice.&nbsp; I now how to integrate it with the whole system, and re-markup all the pages in the service.&nbsp; It`s going to take a bit before I can actually launch it because I am only doing it when I have spare programming time at work, and at night.&nbsp; It`s going to be worth the wait.. you are going to have 100 times the control over how your site looks when I am done.</P>

							Everquest2 & World Of Warcraft signups and little facelift
							Friday, June 18, 2004 - 4:47:19 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I enabled EQ2 and WoW guilds, so they can signup (or pre-signup I guess) their guilds for Guild Wizard.&nbsp; Anyone excited for these games?&nbsp; I am :) ..&nbsp; I am still trying to decide which I like better.. WoW seems like it is going to appeal to me more than EQ2, but who knows.&nbsp; I know I wont have a lot of play-time, so I guess I will play the game that is the friendliest to the casual gamer.&nbsp; Unless a guild or two wants to PL me :) </P>
<P>I also spent some time cleaning up around here.&nbsp; I changed the layout a bit, and changed the navigation, colors and few other cosmetic things.&nbsp;I also created the support page which has links to email and the forums.&nbsp; I also put a Coming Soon for the knowlege base.. i figure if I put that up there, it will give me some motivation to actually make one! </P>

							Patch
							Thursday, June 17, 2004 - 9:36:11 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just finished uploading a patch to the forums, and the main system.&nbsp; Here is what I did:</P>
<OL>
<LI>I enabled paging for message views in the forums.&nbsp; When you view a thread that`s longer than 25 messages, it automatically gets put into pages.&nbsp; You can set the page to 25, 50, or 100 posts per page (I will set a default page size in the profile editor in the next patch)</LI>
<LI>The HTML editor will now work in Mozila based browsers as well as IE 5+ browsers</LI>
<LI>The HTML editors will now do a Line Break when you hit Enter, instead of the dumb paragraph tag which causes a double space.&nbsp; Before you had to hit Shift-Enter to get a line break which was pretty dumb..</LI>
<LI>The HTML editor allows you to hit tab and actually get a tab, instead of setting focus to the next available control</LI>
<LI>The Icon for the emotes is now a smiley face in the top left of the toolbar</LI>
<LI>The Quick Reply box will now degrade into a regular text box for non-Internet Explorer users, so it doesnt look retarded in Mozilla.</LI>
<LI>The HTML editor for your News Page and Custom Page Editor will work in Mozilla based browsers as well.&nbsp; It also has an updated image uploader which is a little better than the other one I had in there.. nothing ground breaking but it is a little better</LI>
<LI>I setup the backend Class, Race, and Game classes to scale better for EQ2 and World Of Warcraft.&nbsp; Everquest 2 and WoW will be my main focuses in the next few months, as far as compatibility of features goes.. </LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I will probably work some more tonight on the Raid system.&nbsp; I am going to, as long ago promised, allow you now to add raids without having a file.&nbsp; Of course I will still support the raid dumps etc, just I am going to really make the service less dependant on EQ, but keeping all the same EQ specific features.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Voting is next for the forums.. </P>
<P>I will then start on the layout/style overhaul.&nbsp; Thats going to be a big job..&nbsp;</P>

							Forum display names fixed + validators fix
							Tuesday, May 04, 2004 - 10:39:25 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I fixed the issue that was creating some display names in the forum to have a random number appended to the Display Name.&nbsp; Basically, when a user registers, they wont be able to use a Roster account name as a display name.. </P>
<P>I also fixed the validators on the forum registration page, as well as the one on the password change page.&nbsp; The validators in question are the ones that make sure the password and the password confirmation match.. i was checking too soon, which made the validators complain.. and in turn it would confuse the heck out of a lot people.</P>

						<h2>
							Moderators function added to forum
							Thursday, April 29, 2004 - 7:58:57 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Hot dog! &nbsp;I finally got a few hours to add in the moderator function that I`ve been meaning to code up for the last little while.&nbsp; I am finally getting caught up with work, and have a little time to spare at night to work on guildwizard.&nbsp;Of course this could change just like that if I get busy again.</P>
<P>To add moderators, go into your Manage Forums tab and you will see the Manage Moderators link in the list now.&nbsp; Choose the user and the forum and click the button.&nbsp; To remove the user from the moderator list, click the delete button on the grid underneath which shows all the moderators.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Moderators are NOT admins.&nbsp; They can Delete, Edit, Sticky, Lock threads in the forum(s) they are set to be moderators for.&nbsp; They do not have access to the Manage Forums tab, and may not ban users.</P>
<P>I am really hoping to add in little things here and there over the next few weeks, just the stuff that everyone has been suggesting.&nbsp; Then, after that, I am going to start on a VERY aggressive re-work of the style and layout editor.&nbsp; We are talking a total redevelopment.&nbsp; The whole service + forums will go full XHTML compliant, and allow FULL CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) support.&nbsp; So those users who know css will literally be able to work with their own CSS file.&nbsp; The other 95% of the users are going to work with a much more robust editor than whats there now for style/layout.</P>
<P>I am going to be honest, the above project is really for another project, but heck guildwizard might as well use the same tools :)&nbsp; I wish I could spend quality development time on GuildWizard, but I would have to charge much more to justify it.&nbsp; Keep in mind, with my `real` development projects, I have a dedicated graphic designer, HTML coder, text writer (author) and me as the lead developer for programming.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyone playing City of Heros?&nbsp; Send Sharbel on Justice a hello if you are :)</P>

							Hey, they aren`t finished dude.. 
							Saturday, March 27, 2004 - 11:42:26 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Later today I will put a notice on the new forums.. the notice will just be a short message that the forums are in BETA, and are not finished.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I failed to convey this point to a lot of guilds, and I am getting emails asking for this feature and that feature..plus emails complaining that the forums do not have enough features.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Of course they don`t :) they are like 60% done..&nbsp; If the old forums werent having so much trouble, I wouldn`t have even let people use them yet.&nbsp; The plan was to let some people use them, and work on it to get them done in the meantime..&nbsp; Well, the plan didnt exactly work because I have been very busy with my `real` programming work.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Not to worry, I do see me getting some time soon to work on the forums.&nbsp; I just wanted to assure everyone that they aren`t finished..&nbsp; lol they would suck pretty bad if they were :)</P>

							Old forums down for restore...
							Tuesday, March 23, 2004 - 5:00:21 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I am rolling back the old forums to yesterday at around 2pm to try to recover some posts for a few guilds.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am not sure if its going to be far enough for them, but I figure I will try.&nbsp; This is going to inconvienience a few, and I am sorry for that.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Everyone should switch over to the new beta forums anyway...&nbsp; </P>

						<h2>
							Old forums days numbered
							Thursday, February 19, 2004 - 1:04:06 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>The old forums are on the way out....&nbsp; I don`t have a specific date in mind yet, its basically going to depend on when I get the new forums to a point where I consider the features to be equal, which really isnt that far off.&nbsp; Maybe another couple weeks, as I will probably only get work on the forums on the weekends when i have some spare time.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I know I said that I might allow the old forums to continue to run, but with both running, it`s a big waste of server resources.&nbsp;Now that guilds are really starting to use the new forums, I am seeing that it`s just not going to workout with both forums running.&nbsp; Also, the old forums are starting to act up again with that dumb connection warning.... </P>
<P>I figure I would mention it now, to give those using the old forums a few weeks to let it sink in.... some of the guilds have already started using the new forums.&nbsp; Some are continuing to use them until I turn them off... which is fine.&nbsp; Like I said, I won`t force anyone until the new forums have all the features I want, and they are working 100%.</P>

						<h2>
							Forums: Move threads
							Monday, February 16, 2004 - 11:13:54 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>You can now move threads in the new forums by going to the forum manager, and clicking on Move Threads (original eh?).&nbsp; When you select the source forum, a table with all the threads in that forum will populate.. select the thread(s) you want to move, the destination forum and then click the button and it will move&nbsp; them to the new forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>The forums are getting some good use.&nbsp; Any new guild that signs up is using the new forum, as well as quite a few guilds who have been using guildwizard for a long time.&nbsp; I realize they aren`t polished just yet, but the core functionality is pretty solid so far.&nbsp;</P>
