											</TABLE>
											<span id="DataList1__ctl0_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Off the top: The Filemanager should be back to normal now.</P>
<P>I have created a page for admins/officers to manage security/password issues.&nbsp; For now it has two tools to use, however I will probably add more as the need arises.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First of all, you will see the link in the top right corner of any page, as long as you are logged in as an Admin or Officer... think link is called Manage Members.&nbsp; From this page you can (the admin only) promote members to Officers, which in essense gives them Admin rights to your site.&nbsp; Be very careful who you allow this priveledge!&nbsp; The only thing, at this time, that an Officer cannot do, is add/remove other officers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second tool on the page, is a password resetter.&nbsp; This tool will allow an Admin/Officer to reset the password of a guildmember who lost their password.&nbsp; I was going to implement an email the new password type tool but not everyone lists their email so this was the easiest way.&nbsp; After you reset the password for them, they are free to change it to what they want, via the link on the login box.</P>
<P>Now that the Roles based security is in place, I am going to re-visit the grid columns.&nbsp; I will likely be adding the option to only show Guildmates certain columns (points, loot, raids etc).</P>
<P>Moreover, I am going to look into implementing the ability for administrators to `lock` certain pages.&nbsp; What i mean by this, is allow the admin to set, say, the Calandar page as "Guildmembers Only" permissions.&nbsp; That way, only guildmembers would be able to see that Calendar page.&nbsp; Some guilds are on very competative servers, and they don`t necessarily want to show other guilds what they are going to be up to. No promises on this, but like I said I am going to look into it.</P></font></span>

											</TABLE>
											<span id="DataList1__ctl1_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I am about 50 percent done the Role based security update.&nbsp; Role based means that when you log in, the database will check to see what Role you belong to... if you are an Administrator or Officer, you will have different options than if you were a Member.</P>
<P>Don`t get me wrong, Roles security was already there, just I am reworking it so it uses the .NET security model.&nbsp; I really should have done that from the beginning, but this project started out as a casual project to be used by 2 co-guildleaders.&nbsp; I didn`t design the login-in for what its being used for today.&nbsp; Regardless, most won`t even notice a difference... it really is mostly boring server side stuff that is behind the scenes.</P>
<P>One thing that guildleaders will notice, is they will be allowed to give Officer permissions to certain users which is pretty much giving them the same powers as an Administrator.&nbsp; The difference is, an Officer will not be able to add/revoke officer status.&nbsp; Only the Administrator Role can do that.&nbsp; I am not going to go much deeper in the permissions than that.&nbsp; As some of you know I could program it that each feature could be a configurable permission, but quite frankly I don`t think it will be used, so I will only do a broad permission setting.&nbsp; If I get a lot of requests, I will revisit that decision though.</P>
<P>Members will notice very little, except they will log in at the same login as the administrator now.. you can log in, and it will know what you should be seeing or not based on your Role.&nbsp; Also, there will be an option to Remember your login, so you don`t have to log in everytime you come to the site... </P>
<P>I have atleast 1-2 more days of reworking the permissions, then I will begin working on the documentation, and adding some more plug-ins.</P></font></span>

<P>The application will automatically create thumbnails (small versions) of the original images, and display them in a table-like format (as seen in the link above).&nbsp;&nbsp; The image formats must be in either jpeg or gif, and under 250k, although I recommend that all the pics be in jpeg and under 100k.&nbsp;&nbsp; The image description is optional, enter a description for each image if you want.</P>
<P>The bug thats plagued me for the last while is handled.. I haven`t seen it lock up a site in a few days, which means it should be ok from now on.&nbsp; I will start on the roles based security model, and also I am going to start on the documentation pages.&nbsp; I will of course continue fixing any issues that pop up.</P></font></span>

<P>Now, if you want to have a personalized picture (recommended) you simply upload the image (in jpeg or gif format only) using the profile editor page.&nbsp; The utility will automatically upload the file after you select it, and it will create the link for you!&nbsp; Doesn`t get much easier than that.</P>
<P>I am going to start working on a console for administrators to delete/modify/add images.. players are allowed to upload 1 picture but the administrator will be able to batch upload, and link as many as they want (as long as they dont go over their limit, to be determined). </P>
<P>11:27 pm - Update:</P>
<P>There is a new plug-in available.&nbsp; You can plug in a newsfeed from Sony`s EQLive website.&nbsp; It`s a nice way to keep your members updated with the current happenings in Norath.&nbsp; The feed will update itself automatically as new news is released from Sony.</P></font></span>

<P>To add new players from a who list, you log in as an administrator and click on the Add Player button.&nbsp; To access the update roster function, you log in as an administrator and go to the Player Roster page.. you will see a link "Auto Update Roster", when you click the link, a pop-up console will come up.. </P>

<P>Coupled with this, I am going to explor the feasbility of developing automatic roster updates when you enter raids..&nbsp; So there will be a check box to `update your roster` while you enter a raid.&nbsp; For the non-DKP guilds, I will provide a pop-up console probably for you to just plug in a /who list, since you don`t enter Raids.</P>
<P>After I deploy the add new player utility, I will have to immediatly update the player profile editor page to allow for the new class Titles..&nbsp; </P></font></span>
