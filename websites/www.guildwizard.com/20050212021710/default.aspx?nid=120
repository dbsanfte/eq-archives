							Color Changes - Private Domains
							Wednesday, April 23, 2003 - 8:14:19 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>The color changes took a little longer than I expected, I didnt realize there was a 4 day weekend and I underestimated the coding.&nbsp; The code is finished, I am going to test it today on my test account and see if there are any bugs.&nbsp; If there is no bugs, I will deploy the new color configuration page late this afternoon.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The new color configuration page has about 50 different options to configure!&nbsp; It`s much more involved than my previous configuration page, you have a lot more control over the different elements of the page.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On a different subject, I neglected to mention that if you want a custom URL (<A href="http://www.yourguildname.com">www.yourguildname.com</A>), I will be offerring that service as well.&nbsp; More details on that in a future update, if you want more info you can email me.&nbsp; I can register domains at a lot less than what the regular domain registry companys (Network solutions etc) offer.</P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Color configuration changes
							Saturday, April 19, 2003 - 8:30:27 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I am about 80% finished coding the new color configuration page changes.&nbsp; I`ve decided to change it to a Cascading Style Sheet model, which is dynamically loaded based on the preferences you set.&nbsp; So in non-geek terms, you will have more control over the colors, borders, buttons, links colors etc.&nbsp; A lot of the changes are transparent, meaning the changes are behind the scenes on the server mostly.&nbsp; One thing this allows me to provide is the ability to have premade skins for guilds to choose from, and work with.</P>
<P>One thing though, when I deploy the new code, you will have to spend a couple minutes configuring your colors again.&nbsp; Your site will default to a black skin color scheme... I will send an email to all the admins letting them know to change the colors, when I deploy the code (possibly today, most likely Monday though)</P>

							Status Update
							Sunday, April 13, 2003 - 8:32:36 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I wanted to give a status update on whats up at GuildWizard.com&nbsp; ...&nbsp; We are in the process of a design overhaul for the main site, which should be done this week.&nbsp; Nothing more than eye-candy to make the site look better.&nbsp; I am a decent programmer, IMHO, but I am not that great of a designer :) </P>
<P>This week you will start seeing a lot of the changes that people have been emailing me with.&nbsp; This is the order of priorities based on peoples emails:</P>
<OL>
<LI>&nbsp;Re-do the forums to give more control to moderators</LI>
<LI>Add more options to the Roster (keys,epic,magelo)..</LI>
<LI>Add more options for customization - will rework the color/layout configurations</LI></OL>
<P>I list those 3 only because they will require the most coding, which really isn`t a lot - relatively speaking.&nbsp; The other suggestions by people will also be done, just they are minor changes that can be done very quickly.&nbsp;</P>

							Downtime yesterday - Future of Guildwizard
							Tuesday, April 08, 2003 - 9:16:38 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>As some of you have noticed there was some downtime last night.&nbsp; We had an ice storm, yeah in April... whats up with that?&nbsp;&nbsp; So it caused connectivity problems in the area, thus the trouble with guildwizard sites not being able to connect.</P>
<P>As for the future of GuildWizard.com&nbsp;... I have decided to start working on the application again.&nbsp; Effective immediatly, I will be working on the long list of suggestion/bug fixes .&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also start working on the application to be scalable to other online games.&nbsp; I play EQ, but there are a lot of other games out there that players have emailed me asking for support on.&nbsp; It shouldn`t be that tough to alter the code to allow for the various other class/races of other games.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I will worry about other games, mind you, when I get done with taking care of the existing application.&nbsp; I have a lot of programming ahead of me to implement some of the features that I have had on the back burner.</P>

							Guildwizard, fixes, updates etc
							Sunday, March 09, 2003 - 1:26:06 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>As most of you can see I haven`t been doing the constant updates that I did before.&nbsp; I`ve been working a lot lately, and havent had the time that I used to, to get the fixes and feature additions to Guild Wizard like before.&nbsp; There are hundreds of guilds using Guild Wizard now.&nbsp; Some are VERY active with their use, some are very light in their use.&nbsp; The application is running pretty well for the amount of use it gets, IMHO... but there ARE things that need to be fixed/added.</P>
<P>What it comes down to is this.&nbsp; I am going to be evaluating what I will be doing with the service, in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; Don`t worry, I will not be pulling the plug.&nbsp; I am simply going to be evaluting if I will basically leave the app the way it is, and let it be used... or I might go ahead and start working on it full time again.&nbsp; If I do go full time again, I might go with a subscription based service to recover the development costs (my time).&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, nothing is definate.&nbsp; I might just let Guild Wizard run as it is without any changes at all.&nbsp; If you have any input on the matter, feel free to email me!</P>
<P>For those who have emailed me in the last week, I have tried to answer all the emails I`ve gotten.&nbsp; If I missed yours, email me again.&nbsp; I had a 1-2 day period where my DNS was propogating it`s changes, and I might have lost an email or two.&nbsp; </P>

							Fixed icons in news_add  And Downtime tommorow

						<p>
							<P>Some guilds news page adder might not have been getting their icons on the tool bar to show up, since I changed the directory structure when I redid the security.&nbsp; This issue should be fixed now.</P>
<P>Tommorow, Tuesday Feb 25, I will be moving the server that the sites run on.&nbsp; When I say move, I mean physically move it, to our new office.&nbsp; I will be lugging the box over in the morning (EST), and should turn it back on shortly after.&nbsp; Keep in mind DNS will change a bit so it might take a bit before all the DNS servers get updated.</P>

						<p>
							<P>I fixed an issue with a validator giving false warnings when you entered a level of your alternate character of 3-8.&nbsp; It must be a bug in .NET framework as I have it set to complain if you enter a number not between 1-65.&nbsp; </P>
<P>As you can see I have only been taking care of error issues that have been emailed to me lately.&nbsp; I am slowing down development of new features for now as I am terribly busy with work.&nbsp; If you encounter an error, or something isn`t working email me at <A href="mailto:sharbel@guildwizard.com">sharbel@guildwizard.com</A> and I will fix it up for you.</P>
<P>When work slows down I will be adding some of the features I have been getting in emails.</P>

							Add officers - Reset passwords for members
							Friday, February 07, 2003 - 2:20:04 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Off the top: The Filemanager should be back to normal now.</P>
<P>I have created a page for admins/officers to manage security/password issues.&nbsp; For now it has two tools to use, however I will probably add more as the need arises.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First of all, you will see the link in the top right corner of any page, as long as you are logged in as an Admin or Officer... think link is called Manage Members.&nbsp; From this page you can (the admin only) promote members to Officers, which in essense gives them Admin rights to your site.&nbsp; Be very careful who you allow this priveledge!&nbsp; The only thing, at this time, that an Officer cannot do, is add/remove other officers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second tool on the page, is a password resetter.&nbsp; This tool will allow an Admin/Officer to reset the password of a guildmember who lost their password.&nbsp; I was going to implement an email the new password type tool but not everyone lists their email so this was the easiest way.&nbsp; After you reset the password for them, they are free to change it to what they want, via the link on the login box.</P>
<P>Now that the Roles based security is in place, I am going to re-visit the grid columns.&nbsp; I will likely be adding the option to only show Guildmates certain columns (points, loot, raids etc).</P>
<P>Moreover, I am going to look into implementing the ability for administrators to `lock` certain pages.&nbsp; What i mean by this, is allow the admin to set, say, the Calandar page as "Guildmembers Only" permissions.&nbsp; That way, only guildmembers would be able to see that Calendar page.&nbsp; Some guilds are on very competative servers, and they don`t necessarily want to show other guilds what they are going to be up to. No promises on this, but like I said I am going to look into it.</P>

							Security rework 50% done
							Wednesday, February 05, 2003 - 1:43:21 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I am about 50 percent done the Role based security update.&nbsp; Role based means that when you log in, the database will check to see what Role you belong to... if you are an Administrator or Officer, you will have different options than if you were a Member.</P>
<P>Don`t get me wrong, Roles security was already there, just I am reworking it so it uses the .NET security model.&nbsp; I really should have done that from the beginning, but this project started out as a casual project to be used by 2 co-guildleaders.&nbsp; I didn`t design the login-in for what its being used for today.&nbsp; Regardless, most won`t even notice a difference... it really is mostly boring server side stuff that is behind the scenes.</P>
<P>One thing that guildleaders will notice, is they will be allowed to give Officer permissions to certain users which is pretty much giving them the same powers as an Administrator.&nbsp; The difference is, an Officer will not be able to add/revoke officer status.&nbsp; Only the Administrator Role can do that.&nbsp; I am not going to go much deeper in the permissions than that.&nbsp; As some of you know I could program it that each feature could be a configurable permission, but quite frankly I don`t think it will be used, so I will only do a broad permission setting.&nbsp; If I get a lot of requests, I will revisit that decision though.</P>
<P>Members will notice very little, except they will log in at the same login as the administrator now.. you can log in, and it will know what you should be seeing or not based on your Role.&nbsp; Also, there will be an option to Remember your login, so you don`t have to log in everytime you come to the site... </P>
<P>I have atleast 1-2 more days of reworking the permissions, then I will begin working on the documentation, and adding some more plug-ins.</P>

						<h2>
							Image Gallery now available
							Saturday, February 01, 2003 - 11:56:48 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I created an Image Gallery which will allow you to show off your guild`s screenshots etc. You can see an example if you <A href="http://serendipitousexistence.guildwizard.com/gallery.aspx" target=_blank>click here</A>&nbsp; ..&nbsp; You access the admin panel by clicking on the link at the top right corner of gallery page, after you log in as an administrator.&nbsp; From that console, you can upload your gallery pictures, add descriptions to them and also remove the old ones.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The application will automatically create thumbnails (small versions) of the original images, and display them in a table-like format (as seen in the link above).&nbsp;&nbsp; The image formats must be in either jpeg or gif, and under 250k, although I recommend that all the pics be in jpeg and under 100k.&nbsp;&nbsp; The image description is optional, enter a description for each image if you want.</P>
<P>The bug thats plagued me for the last while is handled.. I haven`t seen it lock up a site in a few days, which means it should be ok from now on.&nbsp; I will start on the roles based security model, and also I am going to start on the documentation pages.&nbsp; I will of course continue fixing any issues that pop up.</P>
