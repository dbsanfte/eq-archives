											</TABLE>
											<span id="DataList1__ctl1_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P><STRONG>Small patch today to fix a couple bugs:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The Edit/Update function of the Custom&nbsp;Roster should be fixed now... well I am hoping anyway.&nbsp; The problem appears to have been a stored-procedure that was incorrectly adjusting the column index.&nbsp; I am pretty sure its fixed right now, but will check the logs for errors pertaining to this.&nbsp; I tested it for about 10 minutes and it seemed fine.. i don`t have time to test it longer, I have a ton of work to finish this weekend for work :( 
<LI>The column order tools should be working 
<LI>Fixed the column insert to not allow duplicate column types (not allow 2 Player Name columns etc) 
<LI>Fixed column insert to validate that a column Header Text was added 
<LI>Fixed column edit to require a valid Header Text 
<LI>I fixed something else too... i just cant remember!</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Upcoming features.. : (which might not be for a while... i have a lot of projects on the go for work)</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>I will probably start on a guild-bank type utility.. I`ve had a&nbsp;lot of requests for this lately.&nbsp; It`s not going to be EQ specific though, I want it to be like the custom roster where you can add your own columns/fields.. 
<LI>I am going to add support for the custom roster to have a View by Class view, similar to the standard roster.</LI></UL>
<P>When the above two are done.. I am probably going to start writing a new forum.&nbsp; I don`t like the existing forum setup at all.&nbsp; I don`t like the how its seperated and how you need 2 accounts (which I could fix, but it doesn`t address the other issues).&nbsp; I wan`t the guild-leader/officer to have TOTAL control.. right now it`s half-assed how you can edit/delete/sticky stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The forums were not written by me..&nbsp; and they are not written in my preferred programming language (C#).&nbsp; So instead of hacking around the existing code like I have been doing, I think it`s time for me to buckle down and make my own forum.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me say that the existing forum if it were used by 1 guild is a great forum.. it has a lot of features, and its well written.. I am not putting down the creator`s work.. he did a great job.&nbsp;&nbsp; It`s just not working out for how Guild Wizard is set up.</P>
<P>The new forums will be a large project that will take weeks just to get it in a workable state.&nbsp; At first I will only allow a few guilds to use it, so they can test it and report issues.&nbsp; When I feel it`s usable, I will disable the old forums and everyone will move over to the new ones...&nbsp; I am pretty sure I will be able to copy over all the posts, so nobody looses anything, btw.</P>

<P>Custom Roster Info/Features:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You are able to add the columns you want to the roster</LI>
<LI>You can put your own heading description at the top of each column</LI>
<LI>You can change the left-to-right order of the columns that you add</LI>
<LI>You can fully sort data, ascending and descending, any columns - even custom columns</LI>
<LI>New Base columns can be added anytime by me, as I get suggestions for them</LI>
<LI>The grid is only binding the columns added, which is very efficient</LI>
<LI>Your columns are cached, which means the software isn`t calling the database each time your grid is shown, bigtime performance increase.</LI>
<LI>You can set security permissions on each column, even custom columns</LI>
<LI>Column headers can have images instead of just the text (broken, will fix next patch)</LI>
<LI>Support for other games will be done with this Roster.&nbsp; Infact, I will likely make it the default Roster for any new guilds joining, once I see there are no bugs.</LI></UL>
<P>As for the FFXI support.. it`s there.&nbsp; Currently I have 2 guilds set as FFXI guilds, and they can start fooling around.&nbsp; Honestly the only difference is the Races, Classes, and Secondary Classes.. </P></font></span>

											</TABLE>
											<span id="DataList1__ctl6_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Whoa!&nbsp; Large patch was just deployed.&nbsp; First let me get the bug fixes out of the way:</P>
<P><STRONG>Bug fixes:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed domain look-up tool.&nbsp; You can now look up domains to register on the domains page again.
<LI>Fixed stored-procedure that wasn`t listing items purchased in raid detail 
<LI>Fixed bug that allowed deleted members to still login to their guildwizard account.&nbsp; If you delete a player, they will no longer be able to use their login/password. 
<LI>Fixed problem with Loot List that wasn`t sorting the items with the most recent item at the top. 
<LI>Fixed up Admin links that didn`t have style attributes added to them to change the mouse pointer to a `pointing finger` (which made it hard to realize it was a link).</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>New Features:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Each page now has a permission setting which allows you to allow Everyone, Logged In Members, or Admins to view the page.&nbsp; So if you only want Guildmates to see your raid-list, you can set it so only after they login will they be able to go to the page.&nbsp; If a user tries to go to a page with insufficient rights, they are redirected to the login page.&nbsp; After they sucessfully login, they are brought back to the page originally requested. 
<LI>In addition to Page Level Permissions, most pages have Item Level Permissions as well.&nbsp; What this means, is you are able to set who can see particular items on various pages.&nbsp; For example, you can set the whole Calendar Page to allow only Guildmates or you can allow Everyone to see the page, but certain items in the calendar would only be viewable by Members or Admins.&nbsp; Items in the calendar that a user doesn`t have sufficient privledges to will show a message telling them they don`t have rights to see the message, and redirects them to a login page.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<LI>All grids that were able to hide columns, have the ability to have the column visable to Everyone, Members, Admins, or Nobody(hide).&nbsp; So on your Roster, you might only have the Name,Class, Race and AA points viewable by Everyone, but the DKP earned only visable to Guildmates, or Admins.&nbsp; It`s the same configuration panels as before, just with the new options added to them.&nbsp; Again, this functionality is extended to all pages that were able to configure grids (Roster, Purchases, Raids, Encounters etc). 
<LI>Custom pages now have a field to set permissions to them.&nbsp; When you create a custom page, you will be able to set who can see the page. 
<LI>In the Rank column of the Roster, you can now set the rank to "A" for alternate players.&nbsp; This is a quick-bandaid for now.. I want to spend some time on how alts are being handled in the Roster, now that the Guild Dump feature includes everyone in the guild.. there needs to be a better distinction.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Upcoming Features:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The Roster will have a mouse-over effect when you roll the mouse over a person`s name.&nbsp; A semi-transperant box will appear with quick info about the player.&nbsp; It can have tradeskill info, Keys/Flags.. whatever they/you want.&nbsp; It will be editable by the member and the Administrator. 
<LI>Administrators will be able to edit member`s profiles without having to login as their accounts.&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<P>I just want to note that every single change or upcoming feature was a result of people sending me suggestions or posting suggestions on the forums.&nbsp; Thanks for the input guys/gals, keep it coming!</P></font></span>

<P>After the next patch, each page will have a global permission, which will either allow Everyone, Members Only, or Officers only to view.&nbsp; From there, certain pages will also have "micro permissions" that can be mananged as well.&nbsp; For example, you can set the Roster to let everyone view the Page, but only logged-in Members can see DKP information, and only Officers can see DKP totals.</P>
<P>Every page that has a configuration column will have a new field added to include logged in Members.</P>
<P>These features will be present in custom pages as well.&nbsp; You will be able to set permissions on the pages you make.&nbsp; This way if you have a strategy, or maybe a long-term plan you want only Guildmembers to see, you can lock it up.</P>
<P>I should have it done in a couple days..&nbsp;&nbsp; Post on the forums if you have an input or suggestions for this!</P></font></span>

<P>As it stands, all changes are client-side.&nbsp; When you make changes, you will see the preview panel items change instantly.&nbsp; Even the textures that you choose will instantly show up in the element that is going to inherit the texture.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also wrote a script for the Skins list..&nbsp; when you choose a skin, the screen instantly changes to that skin, giving you a preview.&nbsp; A popup box then asks you if you want to keep this skin, or go back to your other style.&nbsp; This is nice for the times you just want to look, without commiting.</P>
<P>Speaking of styles, I am going to add a bunch more in the next week or so.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Upcomming features..&nbsp;&nbsp; bah will post tommorow or something, its 4AM and I am too tired :)</P></font></span>

<P>&nbsp;I am working on the reprogram of the color configuration page, its going to be a lot more usable when I am done.&nbsp; If you have used it, you know that everytime you change a color it submits the change and redraws the page.. which is incredibly dumb.&nbsp; Now, it redraws clientside, so its instant and much much much much faster (yes, I said much 4 times because its that much faster! hehe).&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are done editing your style sheet, you can then click the Save button that will then submit the changes to the server, uploading any textures at that time etc.&nbsp; Besides the preview on the screen itself, I will probably have a Preview button which will change the current page (all its elements) to the new stylesheet before you save it.. just incase you dont like it.</P>
<P>I will also be including parameters for the calendar`s style editing.&nbsp; If you remember I never did add in the css Classes for the calendar when I redid the calendar last month.&nbsp; You will again have full control over calendar colors when the update is done.</P>
<P>Back to the raid page.. the reason I can`t fix it right now is because the source code for that component exists in the same component that I am working on right now (the main guildwizard engine).&nbsp; I can`t recompile it until I get the color changes done, so look for the fix finished with the next patch, in a day or so.&nbsp; Purchases are working fine, its just the display on the raid detail that isnt coming up.</P></font></span>
