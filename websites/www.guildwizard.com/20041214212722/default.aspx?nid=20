							Guild Application Page
							Tuesday, August 03, 2004 - 10:54:46 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just deployed the new guild application/recruitment request page.&nbsp; This page allows you to create a form for guild prostects to fill out to join your guild.&nbsp; The questions are totally configurable by you, as well as the order in which they appear.&nbsp; You can also mark questions as mandatory/required, which will display an asterix next to the fields that are required if they are not filled in.&nbsp; </P>
<P>How to setup your guild application page:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Login with your admin/officer account</LI>
<LI>Click the admin menu link and click Guild Application Setup</LI>
<LI>The first page sets all the non-question items such as Page Header Title, Description paragraph (this is the paragraph before the questions, maybe to explain your recruitment policy etc), and an email address to send the guild applications to.&nbsp; Fill in all this information, and click the Submit button to save it</LI>
<LI>Click the Manage Questions selector to change to this panel</LI>
<LI>Add your questions that you want to ask in the New Question section, select if its mandatory, and click the Button to save each question.</LI>
<LI>You can change the order of the questions&nbsp; in the grid below, as well as delete any questions </LI></UL>
<P>I might add some more features to the application depending on the feedback/usage it gets.&nbsp; I know that most guilds are going to want to have a thread about the applicant, and thats where the voting usually happens.&nbsp; Will play it by ear to see what people want and make some feature additions from there.</P>

						<h2>
							Guild Application Form
							Tuesday, August 03, 2004 - 7:59:22 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I am about 60% done a new component that I will be deploying probably today or tommorow.&nbsp; The Guild Application page will allow recruits to post an application to join your guild, with questions that you create in the administration panel.&nbsp; Of course, you will have complete control over the questions, the order of them, and all the content on the page.&nbsp; I also have a spot for a paragraph above the questions for you to have some preface/intructional text for people to read before they fill out the app.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The administration panel for this page will have a field for an email address that the application should be sent to.&nbsp; If you leave it empty, it will just send it to the admin accounts email address.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To start, the application will be emailed and thats it.&nbsp; I might&nbsp;expand it to store the answers in a database etc but honestly I am not sure if its worth it.&nbsp; I am thinking most guilds, after the app is submitted, will make a post regarding the recruit and members have their say.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other side of me says to have this functionality right in the application page.&nbsp; I just don`t want to have to make a forum system for the guild application page because it would be a little redundant.&nbsp; </P>

							Your Subscription To GuildWizard.com Has Been Cancelled
							Thursday, July 29, 2004 - 9:30:01 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>EDIT : Please read this before emailing me, my mailbox is getting flooded by PayPal.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyone who has an active subscription with PayPal for Guild Wizard has, or will shortly, be receiving an email from PayPal saying their subscription is cancelled.&nbsp; No, I am not closing :)&nbsp; As I reported a couple weeks ago, I am not going to continue to use PayPal for subscription payments as I don`t like the recurring billing.&nbsp; I for one get irritated when I subscribe to something and get billed a year later because I forgot to unsubscribe, its kind of seedy in my humble opinion.</P>
<P>In their last effort to irritate me, PayPal is seeing fit to send me an individual email for each subscription that I mass cancelled.&nbsp; WHY IN GODS NAME WOULD YOU SEND ME AN EMAIL FOR EACH SUBSCRIPTION WHEN I USED THE MASS CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION?&nbsp;&nbsp; I digress.. </P>
<P>Your subscription will stay active until what you paid for runs out.&nbsp; At that time, you will be bumped back down to a 10 day trial with the option of renewing.&nbsp; This way, if you are still using the service and want to subscribe, by all means do so.&nbsp; This is much more fair, and it settles my mind that I dont feel like people are being charged on the sly.</P>
<P>That said, I will continue to have PayPal as an option but it won`t be recurring.. will need a week or so to do this because i have to reprogram it.</P>

							Guild Member last login
							Tuesday, July 27, 2004 - 1:43:06 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I added some logic that records the last time a member was online, to be displayed on the roster.&nbsp; I created a new roster column type (custom rosters only) that will allow you to plug this information into your roster.&nbsp;</P>
<P>It doesn`t record the login time, because you dont really login everytime you visit.&nbsp; Instead, it records the last request of the user.&nbsp; The information *is* delayed (up to 10 minutes on the roster page) with server caching, so dont expect instant reporting on the roster.&nbsp; On other pages that this field will become available on such as the profile page, it will be&nbsp;real-time info.&nbsp;</P>

							So I decided to just change the thing.. 
							Monday, July 26, 2004 - 8:38:20 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>A little late in posting this, but it was a hectic weekend!&nbsp; Instead of upgrading the web-server that hosts Guild Wizard, I decided to just change it over to another server.&nbsp; The new server has a much better processor, more RAM, and a faster hard-drive.&nbsp; I`d be suprised if anyone sees the service running any faster though, as everything was running tip top anyway :)</P>
<P>I`ve been experiencing a very steady increase in new guilds signing up and using the site, so I did this as a proactive measure.&nbsp; In the fall/winter (or who knows when), when Everquest 2 (EQ2) and Worlds Of Warcraft (WOW) come out, I am anticipating a sharp increase in new guilds.&nbsp; This new system is much more versed to sit in a small web-server farm (group of servers) incase server load gets high.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Guilds who have custom domains had a about 5 hours of downtime on their domain name while I was switching everything over.&nbsp; Some domains are really taking their time to update their DNS info, so I went ahead and rigged something up so they can continue using the domain with the old DNS info.</P>
<P><STRONG>Whats Coming in The Next Patch:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Going to add a new column to the Roster fields available "Last Login" to record the last time a member was actually at the site.&nbsp; 
<LI>Something might be up with the the raid list column roles checker.. its probably something very minor but it will be fixed 
<LI>I *might* be able to finish the new payment processing system.&nbsp; PayPal will still be available, but it wont be the default payment method for subscription creation.&nbsp; I really dont like this recurring subscription nonsense, but moreover I need a little more control on integration of my scripts which is very limited with PayPal.</LI></UL>

							Server coming down tonight for upgrade
							Saturday, July 24, 2004 - 9:15:30 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>There will be some server downtime tonight for a server upgrade.&nbsp; I will try to keep it as short as possible, likely under 1 hour (if everything goes smooth).&nbsp; I will probably put up a temp status page while the server is down on one of our other servers that I will redirect traffic to.&nbsp; </P>

							New Control : Fading Slide Show
							Thursday, July 22, 2004 - 5:18:47 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I created a new Control that will allow you to create a fading slide show.&nbsp; I got the idea from&nbsp; <A href="http://www.shadowedstrife.net">http://www.shadowedstrife.net</A>&nbsp; who has it on their guild wizard site (it`s on the right side).&nbsp; Like any other control, you create it in the Control Editor and select Slide Show Control from the Control Type List.</P>
<P>A few things you should be aware of:&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>When you Add images to the slide show, the list is NOT SAVED until you click the Save button.&nbsp; Just because it`s in the grid, doesnt mean it will be saved, so please remember that.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>You really should have all the images the same size.&nbsp; You can resize images in pretty much any image editor.</LI>
<LI>The fade effect doesnt work in Mozilla browsers, but the control itself should (images should change on time etc)</LI>
<LI>You can select the duration of each image being shown by selecting the desired duration from the list.&nbsp; Default is 3 seconds.</LI></OL>

							Fixed login cookie, Submit template function
							Friday, July 16, 2004 - 11:29:06 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I fixed the login cookie issue from before.&nbsp; You dont have to login everytime you visit now, which was pretty annoying.</P>
<P>I added a <STRONG>Submit Your Template</STRONG> function to allow people who like making templates, to be able to share them with other guilds.&nbsp; It doesn`t just submit the stylesheet, it submits all your control positions, the images attached to them, it basically clones your look/feel.&nbsp; After you submit a template, and after its approved, other guilds can use your template.&nbsp; So, if you have design skills, use em, and share em :)</P>

							Todays Guild Wizard Patch
							Thursday, July 15, 2004 - 11:22:25 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Today`s patch added a new Control type, and added edit support for existing controls.. as well as a few bug fixes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>New control: <STRONG>Embeded Page - </STRONG>This control creates a Custom Page that embeds another web-sites content in it.&nbsp; For example, lets say that you want to have a page that has a live video feed from another service you can simply specify the URL (address) of the page, give it an ID, and the guild wizard system will create a custom page for you.&nbsp; Create a button for it (it automatically adds the custom page to your links list in the Control Editor too), and you are all set.</LI>
<LI>You can now Edit all Custom Controls that you create.&nbsp; Pretty self explainatory in the Control Editor.&nbsp; Click the edit icon for the item you want to edit, and away you go.</LI>
<LI>There is a new style element for the forum message page.&nbsp; The column that holds the avatar is now able to be styled in the Style Editor.&nbsp; You can give it a different background color, border etc.</LI>
<LI>I fixed a problem with the Delete Private Message button.. it was only deleting the first message.&nbsp; Its working correctly now.</LI></UL>

							Dude, two upgrades in one day??
							Monday, July 12, 2004 - 11:58:09 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well, you can tell that I am not playing any MMORPGs at the present time :)&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent tonight doing some nice tweaks on the new style editor, based on a couple peoples suggestions (and a few peoples whining/death threats) hehe</P>
<OL>
<LI>When you adjust the width of the Left or Right panel, the Center panel`s margin will automatically adjust accordingly.&nbsp; So, if you make the left panel width 400pixels, the Center panel will automatically have a 400pixel margin.&nbsp; Good suggestion whoever sent it to me. 
<LI>I fixed a little bug when you type in a URL for the background image of stylesheet item.&nbsp; Before it was always assuming the image was in your guilds image directory, which is fine for most cases but I can see it would irritate an advanced user wanting to use an image on their own webserver.. so the system will check if a valid URL is entered, if not it defaults to look for that image in your guilds directory. 
<LI>Ok those who styled their guild site entirely with the visual editor is going to hate me when they read this.&nbsp; You can now copy style settings between elements to ensure a consistent look/feel throughout your elements.&nbsp; For advanced users, its still easier to just hop into the stylesheet and cut/paste the style settings, but for normal users this is going to save a LOT of time.<BR><BR>Example:&nbsp; Lets say you want all your grid headers to look the same as your Roster header.. no problem now.&nbsp; Just select Roster Header from the new dropdownlist to Copy From, and then select the Raid List Header, for example.&nbsp; Click the Copy To button and the Raid List Header automatically inherits the style settings for the Roster Header.&nbsp; Rinse and Repeat for the various other elements that build the grids, and you have a consistent look/feel without having to remember colors, borders, font-sizes, padding, margins etc.&nbsp; Just remember, you can *still* customize it after you inherit a style, its just a base to work with.<BR><BR>This is going to save a lot of time for button styling too.. design your first buttons style, and then copy the style to all your other buttons.. </LI></OL>
<P>Thanks for all the suggestions from the various guild leaders / web masters out there.&nbsp; I really appreciate the help to make Guild Wizard better.&nbsp; Believe me guys/gals, I am on your side.. if you want something added, changed, altered, or removed.. let me know!&nbsp; </P>
