							Forum Buttons and Icons configurable
							Tuesday, September 07, 2004 - 4:31:21 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>Today`s patch enables guilds to change their guild forum icons and buttons.&nbsp; Previously, guild forums buttons where setup to as text type links where you could change their appearance in the style editors.&nbsp; I now have them setup as Image Buttons, which allows greater design possibilities for guilds.</P>
<P>If you don`t customize your guild forums buttons/icons, the system will just use some default gray buttons.&nbsp; To customize your guild forum buttons and icons, login with your admin/officer account and go to the guild Forum Editor.&nbsp; If you click the Change Forum Icons link, you will be brought to the panel that allows you to change the various icons/buttons.</P>
<P>To change the icons, click the (change) link which brings up the File Manager.&nbsp; Upload/Select the image you want to use and click the save button.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I think for the next patch, I will focus on the guild forums voting component.&nbsp; </P>

							Small forums update
							Thursday, September 02, 2004 - 12:38:40 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I changed the smiley icons access in the forums to show up on the right side of the text box instead of having to click a button for the window.&nbsp; When I created the filemanager a couple weeks ago, I pretty much broke the smiley window which was dependant on the old filemanager page.&nbsp; I will be adding more smileys soon too.. the way I developed the component now, I can add smileys very easily.</P>
<P>I also reworked the way the system complains if you try to post a message in the forums while logged in with the Administrator account.&nbsp; Before, it would just send you to the login page, was very cryptic as to what the problem was.&nbsp; So, to avoid confusing new admins, I created an entry in the error page to display a message explaining that you cant post&nbsp;with the Administrator account.</P>
<P>I think next, I am going to create some configuration settings to allow admins to change the post buttons to graphic buttons.&nbsp; I think the buttons right now in the forums (the buttons you push to make a post/reply etc) look incredibly cheesy.&nbsp; Some guilds have done some pretty cool things with their stylesheet to cover up the cheesyness, but not everyone is that skilled with CSS so I figure if I change them to Image Buttons, it will be a lot easier.</P>
<P>You may have noticed that the updates have been not as frequent the last few weeks.&nbsp; I am involved with a new web-service project that is taking up a lot of time at work and even after hours.&nbsp; I will chip away at my guildwizard TODO list when I get a few hours here and there, like today.</P>

							File Manager - Reloaded
							Tuesday, August 17, 2004 - 11:07:28 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just got finished deploying the new File Manager.&nbsp; This new file manager that I created will allow you to organize uploaded images in directories, copy/paste, move files etc.&nbsp; I think it`s a lot more intuitive than the other one (for the record, I didnt program the other one!!).&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is a help file to explain the various new features, but honestly if you are a Windows user, you should feel right at home as the file manager is very similar to the Windows file manager.&nbsp; I had actually created a pretty neat drag/drop component to allow you to multi-select files/directories and drag them into new directories, but it was only working in Internet Explorer, so I opted for a more tradition `web-application` model.&nbsp; So, instead of drag/drop, you can multi-select, but you have to click the copy/cut icon then paste into the directory you want to copy/move files to.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Next on my list is to start focusing on the forums again.&nbsp; There is a lot of little things that need to get done on the forums, and I have gotten some great feedback (and some whining too!) on new features.&nbsp; Hopefully after the next patch, most of the forum`s unfinished features will be done.</P>

							Image Button Generator
							Thursday, August 12, 2004 - 11:30:48 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I created an Image Button Generator in the Control Editor.&nbsp; Basically, this allows you to select a blank button and add some text to it.&nbsp; The when you select Image Button as they Control Type in the Control Editor, you can now generate a button as well as just uploading a premade image button.</P>
<P>Right now, there is about 75 button styles that you can choose from.&nbsp; When you are in the editor, you can choose the button style by clicking the icon which brings up a new window with a picture list of all the available button types.&nbsp; Double click the button you want to work with, add the text for the button, and click the Generate button which will generate the button and display it on the screen.&nbsp; The image is saved, but the Control is NOT saved untill you click the Save button.</P>
<P>You can create some pretty good buttons with this tool.&nbsp; Keep in mind, it is very basic compared to any half-decent image editor.&nbsp; If you can use an image maniplution program like PhotoShop, you should create your own buttons.&nbsp; This tool is for the people who dont know how to use these programs, and want a simple way to create some buttons.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am going to reprogram the file-manager next.. </P>

							Button Generator, and new domain extensions (TLDs)
							Wednesday, August 11, 2004 - 1:19:17 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I added a few more domain extensions (Top Level Domains) for guilds who want to register a custom domain name.&nbsp; You can now register .com, .net, .org, .info.&nbsp; I can actually register all the TLDs but some of them have restrictions such as .biz can be only for business, .us can only be for Americans, and .name can only be for a personal name etc.&nbsp; I might add them in anyway if people ask for them (can do .de, .co.uk too)</P>
<P>I also fooled around with making&nbsp;a button generator (image button) for the control editor.&nbsp; A *lot* of people are asking me for blank buttons from the templates, and when I give them to them, they ask "Ok what do I do with it?".&nbsp;&nbsp; So..&nbsp; I think i might make a dynamic image button generator.&nbsp; So, you can pick (or upload) a blank button, type in the text, set the width/height and let the system generate the button.&nbsp; The system will actually create&nbsp;an image on the fly and save it to your directory.&nbsp; I actually have it working with hard-coded values.. i just have to make a data-entry form and integrate it with the Control Editor.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Depending how busy work is, I will probably have the button generator done in the next couple days.</P>

							Manual entry of raids
							Monday, August 09, 2004 - 4:25:21 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I added a way to allow people to add raids without having to use the Raid dump files from everquest.&nbsp; You can now go to the Add Raid page, and simply select the Encounter, dkp/point value, raid date, and the members who were at the raid (multi-select box).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Everquest guilds *should* still use the raid dump files, as its a heck of a lot easier to just upload the file and let the parser determine who was there or not.&nbsp; However, for FFXI, EQ2, and World of Warcraft guilds, they should use this manual entry.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that Everquest 2 will have some sort of attendance export, World Of Warcraft I am not too sure of.&nbsp; Those in beta, keep me posted (hey give me your account info so I can play, I swear I wont tell the NDA people! :) </P>

							Guild Application Page
							Tuesday, August 03, 2004 - 10:54:46 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I just deployed the new guild application/recruitment request page.&nbsp; This page allows you to create a form for guild prostects to fill out to join your guild.&nbsp; The questions are totally configurable by you, as well as the order in which they appear.&nbsp; You can also mark questions as mandatory/required, which will display an asterix next to the fields that are required if they are not filled in.&nbsp; </P>
<P>How to setup your guild application page:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Login with your admin/officer account</LI>
<LI>Click the admin menu link and click Guild Application Setup</LI>
<LI>The first page sets all the non-question items such as Page Header Title, Description paragraph (this is the paragraph before the questions, maybe to explain your recruitment policy etc), and an email address to send the guild applications to.&nbsp; Fill in all this information, and click the Submit button to save it</LI>
<LI>Click the Manage Questions selector to change to this panel</LI>
<LI>Add your questions that you want to ask in the New Question section, select if its mandatory, and click the Button to save each question.</LI>
<LI>You can change the order of the questions&nbsp; in the grid below, as well as delete any questions </LI></UL>
<P>I might add some more features to the application depending on the feedback/usage it gets.&nbsp; I know that most guilds are going to want to have a thread about the applicant, and thats where the voting usually happens.&nbsp; Will play it by ear to see what people want and make some feature additions from there.</P>

							Guild Application Form
							Tuesday, August 03, 2004 - 7:59:22 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I am about 60% done a new component that I will be deploying probably today or tommorow.&nbsp; The Guild Application page will allow recruits to post an application to join your guild, with questions that you create in the administration panel.&nbsp; Of course, you will have complete control over the questions, the order of them, and all the content on the page.&nbsp; I also have a spot for a paragraph above the questions for you to have some preface/intructional text for people to read before they fill out the app.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The administration panel for this page will have a field for an email address that the application should be sent to.&nbsp; If you leave it empty, it will just send it to the admin accounts email address.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To start, the application will be emailed and thats it.&nbsp; I might&nbsp;expand it to store the answers in a database etc but honestly I am not sure if its worth it.&nbsp; I am thinking most guilds, after the app is submitted, will make a post regarding the recruit and members have their say.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other side of me says to have this functionality right in the application page.&nbsp; I just don`t want to have to make a forum system for the guild application page because it would be a little redundant.&nbsp; </P>

							Your Subscription To GuildWizard.com Has Been Cancelled
							Thursday, July 29, 2004 - 9:30:01 PM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>EDIT : Please read this before emailing me, my mailbox is getting flooded by PayPal.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyone who has an active subscription with PayPal for Guild Wizard has, or will shortly, be receiving an email from PayPal saying their subscription is cancelled.&nbsp; No, I am not closing :)&nbsp; As I reported a couple weeks ago, I am not going to continue to use PayPal for subscription payments as I don`t like the recurring billing.&nbsp; I for one get irritated when I subscribe to something and get billed a year later because I forgot to unsubscribe, its kind of seedy in my humble opinion.</P>
<P>In their last effort to irritate me, PayPal is seeing fit to send me an individual email for each subscription that I mass cancelled.&nbsp; WHY IN GODS NAME WOULD YOU SEND ME AN EMAIL FOR EACH SUBSCRIPTION WHEN I USED THE MASS CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION?&nbsp;&nbsp; I digress.. </P>
<P>Your subscription will stay active until what you paid for runs out.&nbsp; At that time, you will be bumped back down to a 10 day trial with the option of renewing.&nbsp; This way, if you are still using the service and want to subscribe, by all means do so.&nbsp; This is much more fair, and it settles my mind that I dont feel like people are being charged on the sly.</P>
<P>That said, I will continue to have PayPal as an option but it won`t be recurring.. will need a week or so to do this because i have to reprogram it.</P>

							Guild Member last login
							Tuesday, July 27, 2004 - 1:43:06 AM
						</p>
						<p class="newsBody">
							<P>I added some logic that records the last time a member was online, to be displayed on the roster.&nbsp; I created a new roster column type (custom rosters only) that will allow you to plug this information into your roster.&nbsp;</P>
<P>It doesn`t record the login time, because you dont really login everytime you visit.&nbsp; Instead, it records the last request of the user.&nbsp; The information *is* delayed (up to 10 minutes on the roster page) with server caching, so dont expect instant reporting on the roster.&nbsp; On other pages that this field will become available on such as the profile page, it will be&nbsp;real-time info.&nbsp;</P>
