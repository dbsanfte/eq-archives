							Forum categories implemented
							Monday, July 12, 2004 - 4:35:17 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just deployed a patch that allows you to group forums into Categories.&nbsp; So, if you have 5 public forums, 2 for Members and 2 for Officers, you can group them together and even set visibility settings to the category.</P>
<P>For example, the lets say you have 2 Officer forums, and you create an Officer Only category... it gets seperated from the other categories, and if you set it that only Officers/Admins can see it, the whole category gets hidden to non-Officer/Admins.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You create Categories in the forum admin section (same place you do all your forum administration).&nbsp; You create the Category first, then go to the Forum Manager and either create new forums in the Category, or edit existing forums to be moved into the newly created Category.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the Category Manager, you can also set the display order of the categories much the same as you set forum order in the Forum Manager.</P>
<P>You can set the Category Header style in the Style Editor under the Forum List Page section..&nbsp; Remember, when you set styles for things like this, it doesnt just have to be the font color and background color.. get creative with the background images, border size/color etc!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

							Style & Layout backup/restore 
							Friday, July 09, 2004 - 5:49:57 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well at the suggestion of Tilithien of&nbsp; <A href="http://ilmr.guildwizard.com/">Inverse Logic</A>&nbsp;, I created a back-up/restore function for the style sheet and layout editor.&nbsp; The reason for this is, if you use a template, your layout positions get overwritten, as well as your style sheet.&nbsp; Not to mention if you dont like how you ended up editing your styles, it can be a pain in the buttocks to get it back the way it was.</P>
<P>So, before you start fooling around with your nice layout/colors, hit the Save Look/Feel icon in the Style Editor.&nbsp; This will save your stylesheet, control layouts, and all other look/feel options.&nbsp; If you do something that you don`t like, simple restore your website`s look/feel to the last save point!</P>
<P>Keep the suggestions coming in guys/gals, it really helps me out to make the service better when people make suggestion.</P>

						<h2>
							Todays patch
							Friday, July 09, 2004 - 2:05:48 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Well another day, another patch :</P>
<UL>
<LI>Forum admins can now edit/delete Registered User accounts .&nbsp; These are accounts that are not roster accounts.&nbsp; These accounts are from users who sign up, usually recruits.&nbsp; The link for this panel is the the Forum Manager, under the Registered Users link</LI>
<LI>I fixed the width problem with the item stats viewer</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem with the roster, raid, and purchase list permission.&nbsp; It wasnt letting anyone in that shouldnt see it, it was locking out everyone but the admin when certain conditions were met.&nbsp; This must have been like that for a long time because I didn`t touch this in the last patch.. nobody must have noticed :)</LI>
<LI>Added some validation for non everquest guilds on the custom roster</LI>
<LI>I moved the subscribe button to go on the top right, instead of the left.&nbsp; It was interfering with the Admin pages link in some cases</LI>
<LI>Guilds who have a custom domain, and registered it before last year, their guild domain and DNS server has been moved to another server.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Caught a nice performance hit on a very important method .. I recoded it, and instead of taking .01 seconds to execute, it takes .005!! yay! :)&nbsp; Seriously though, under heavy load it will make a big difference, so I spent the time on it.</LI></UL>
<P>I will probably start fooling around with the raids attendance now.&nbsp; I just want to add a manual way to create a raid, without the log file.. so non-EQ guilds can do their attendance.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I do have some other stuff planned, but its 2:30am and I am too tired to type</P>

							Patch in progress!
							Wednesday, July 07, 2004 - 12:25:06 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<H2 align=center>Style And Layout Patch In Progress</H2>
<P>The Guild Wizard service is being patched for the new style and layout editor upgrade. This is a VERY significant upgrade in the amount of control you will have over the look and feel of your site. There are help files on the 3 new style/layout pages to help you along, but here is a quick overview of what you will have to do when the server comes back up:</P>
<OL>
<LI>You will notice that your site look very different because everyone is using a base template to start.&nbsp; The starting template has horizontal navigation (along the top header) instead of the usual vertical navigation along the left side.&nbsp; 
<LI>Click the login button and login with your administrator/officer account 
<LI>You will notice an Admin Pages link on the top left or right side of your screen, depending on your screen resolution. 
<LI>This new Admin navigation panel contains all the Admin pages that are not linked from containing pages. 
<LI>The links to the new Style Editors are at the top of the list.&nbsp; Each page has a help file explaining what they do. The icon for the help file is right beside the page title for each page.</LI></OL>
<P>The new system is VERY different from the old one.&nbsp; It`s MUCH MUCH MUCH more powerful in what you can do to control the look and feel of your site... BUT, it can also be a little overwhelming with all the choices now.&nbsp; Take some time to fool around with the new options, and remember that if you screw up, you can always just reload a template and start over.. its no big deal.</P>
<P>Advanced users who know how to use CSS will be pleased to know they can work directly with their CSS file.&nbsp; Make sure you read the help file about the structure and the importance of maintaining the format of it.&nbsp; If you choose to use the Advanced editor, and you screw up, you can load a template to start over (or be smart and cut/paste the text before you start working on it :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep in mind that I do not have time to train anyone on CSS.. please use Google if you want to learn the CSS.</P>
<P><STRONG>Changes To Expired Trials/Subscriptions</STRONG></P>
<P>I am scrapping the banners for expired trials/subscriptions. If your account expires, you are brought to a subscription page. If want an extension, there is a link to email me.. the banners are dumb, and I dont believe they serve any purpose.</P>
<P><STRONG>Changes To PayPal Subscriptions and Payments</STRONG></P>
<P>In the next few weeks I am going to stop using PayPal for subscriptions.&nbsp; I don`t like the recurring subscription model, because I *know* people forget to cancel their subscription, and people get charged for something they arent even using, which I dont like.&nbsp; I will change the system over to my company`s credit card processing system which will be a one time charge... when it runs out, you simply pay again when you want.&nbsp; If you arent using the site when the subscription expires, you are NOT charged for anything.&nbsp; I think its a much fairer model.. </P>

							Still working !
							Monday, July 05, 2004 - 4:58:45 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>The layout/style update is still being worked on.&nbsp; I really wanted to deploy it on the weekend, but I didnt feel right deploying it when there was still some quirks with some browsers.&nbsp; Basically, Internet Explorer 6 has this dumb bug that doesnt interpret Table Cell widths properly when set as a percentage....&nbsp; in Mozilla based browsers things liked great, in IE6 browsers it looked odd on some pages.&nbsp; I wasnt about to send the update with this issue, it would have irritated me.</P>
<P>Anyway, what I did was change the whole system to a pure CSS layout.&nbsp; So, no tables for the layout, its all done in the cascading stylesheet.&nbsp; Now, it looks good in Mozilla AND IE6.&nbsp; </P>
<P>With that out of the way, I can now continue working on the 4-5 templates I want to setup to get yall started.. then update the core Guild Wizard server component that handles new subscriptions (I have to convert it to setup new guilds with the new stylesheets/templates etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have to make some basic documentation for everyone, so they will know how to restyle their site.</P>
<P>I`ve been getting some emails from City of Hero guilds asking me to include support for CoH.&nbsp; I will do that after the style patch.&nbsp; To implement City of Heroes wont take long, but I want to get the patch done first before I worry about CoH.</P>

							New style manager almost done
							Friday, July 02, 2004 - 7:05:46 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I`ve been chugging away at the new style manager, and I am pretty happy with it so far.&nbsp; I will admit, I don`t want to see any Regex expressions for a while :)&nbsp;&nbsp; I`ve done a few test skins, and man you can really get creative now on your look/feel of your site.&nbsp; Sites arent going to look so cookie-cutterish (is that&nbsp;a word?).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, the re-skinning of the pages are taking a little longer than I thought.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I will get the done tonight though..&nbsp; after that I will have to create a few templates for everyone to start with, and then I will deploy it.&nbsp; I do have 1 bug I have to fix, but I am not expecting it to be a big issue.</P>
<P>One thing, you *will* have to restyle your website.&nbsp; I am going to probably assign everyone to a default template, and you can edit it from there.&nbsp; I will probably send an email to everyone to let you know when I actually deploy it, so you can go in and change your styles.</P>

							New style editor and layout Progress
							Friday, June 25, 2004 - 9:20:23 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Last night I got a lot of work done on the new style editor, layout editor, and control editor.&nbsp; Controls are a new thingy that I am adding into the admin functions.&nbsp; It`s very similar to the plugins that exist on the system right now, but they are going to be MUCH more advanced and customizable.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On the side panels, you will be able to add controls such as a Picture Control, Linked Picture Control (when clicked it goes to the link you specify), an HTML control for adding custom content, as well as all the propietory guild wizard controls such as Top 10 Raiders, mini-calendar, voting topics etc.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What`s going to be nice, is that if you want to change the look of the Top 10 Raiders grid, for example, you go into the style editor, choose it in the dropdownlist, and start setting all the attributes.&nbsp; The new color selector is a hell of lot better than the cheesy one that`s on there right now.. not to mention you will have a lot more style control elements (font, font-size, text alignment, control over individual borders, background-image etc).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Right now, I have all the base functions complete..&nbsp; I have to made some more administration pages for the new Control system, as well as convert all the pages to the new style system.&nbsp; My best guess is that maybe by the end of next week, I will have the system ready for everyone to start using.</P>

							Changed gears a little
							Tuesday, June 22, 2004 - 4:41:46 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I kind of changed gears on the order of new features.&nbsp; I reported that I was going to start working on the raid manager to make it a little more generic, and less dependant on EQ.&nbsp; Well, I realized that I would be doing some things over if I didn`t do the style and layout editor first.&nbsp; So, I started a couple nights ago on a totally new style editor.</P>
<P>I think everyone is going to like what I have planned for the style editor.&nbsp;I am going to do a General Style page which will control the look and feel of the site.. such as background image, logo, layout of columns, font size, font type, font color etc.&nbsp; Then, each page will have it`s own style editor for the unique elements of that page.&nbsp; So the Roster page will have an editor to control the grid width, header image, colors, font size, link color etc. </P>
<P>Also, I am going to have an Advanced Edit function which will allow leet CSS familiar people the opportunity to work with their guilds stylesheet directly.&nbsp; This is going to be nice for people who know CSS, and want to really customize their site.&nbsp; You can do some pretty amazing things with CSS if you know what you are doing.</P>
<P>I have a basic framework in place, and it`s working very nice.&nbsp; I now how to integrate it with the whole system, and re-markup all the pages in the service.&nbsp; It`s going to take a bit before I can actually launch it because I am only doing it when I have spare programming time at work, and at night.&nbsp; It`s going to be worth the wait.. you are going to have 100 times the control over how your site looks when I am done.</P>

							Everquest2 & World Of Warcraft signups and little facelift
							Friday, June 18, 2004 - 4:47:19 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I enabled EQ2 and WoW guilds, so they can signup (or pre-signup I guess) their guilds for Guild Wizard.&nbsp; Anyone excited for these games?&nbsp; I am :) ..&nbsp; I am still trying to decide which I like better.. WoW seems like it is going to appeal to me more than EQ2, but who knows.&nbsp; I know I wont have a lot of play-time, so I guess I will play the game that is the friendliest to the casual gamer.&nbsp; Unless a guild or two wants to PL me :) </P>
<P>I also spent some time cleaning up around here.&nbsp; I changed the layout a bit, and changed the navigation, colors and few other cosmetic things.&nbsp;I also created the support page which has links to email and the forums.&nbsp; I also put a Coming Soon for the knowlege base.. i figure if I put that up there, it will give me some motivation to actually make one! </P>
