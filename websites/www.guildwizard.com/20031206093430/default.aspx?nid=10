<P>If anyone notices an error or problem with this patch, please email me right away.&nbsp;I usually spend a few hours testing and watching for errors, but I am dead tired :)</P>
<P>I am going to fix some small problems with user-interface, and then start working on the Color Configuration page.&nbsp; I want to have it so when you are picking your colors, you dont have to post back to the server with ever choice.. it gets tedious.</P>

<P>You will also be able to use this new database to show stats on items that dropped on your raid.&nbsp; I am going to program up a component that will create the images of the stats `on the fly` so you can search the item, get the link and use that link on your news page, for example, to show the item(s).&nbsp; As with all other images, you will not be able to hotlink it to another server though.</P>

<P>I left in support for the /who list cut/paste.. you just have to click the checkbox to enable it.. when the Dump thingy works in EQ though, use that.. its better and more reliable.</P>
<P>I also changed the cache to update immediatly after you enter a raid.. It was causing too much confusion with it adding later, people were thinking the raid wasn`t added at all.. which is understandable.&nbsp; So now when you add a raid, it will show up right away in your Raid List page. </P></font></span>

<P>Up until the dump feature was added in EQ, the who list (or raid channel dumps etc) was the only way to parse who was on the raid.&nbsp; This new feature will create a text file of everyone on the raid, their group #, and the group leaders.&nbsp; Only the name will be parsed.</P>

<P>There was a bug in my graphics handling engine, which caused Gif images to get converted to jpeg images.&nbsp; It wasn`t a big deal, unless the gif was animated, or had transparent backgrounds.&nbsp; This is now fixed, and my engine will output gifs as gifs.&nbsp; This engine is the one that checks to make sure nobody is hot-linking pictures to the server.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also increased the timeout timer for logins.&nbsp; So if you are logged in and editing your news or whever, it won`t make you login if you spend more than 30minutes of inactivity (typing etc).&nbsp; It now gives you 60 minutes.</P>
<P>I am probably going to implement an items database in the next patch.&nbsp; This will allow you to pick items from a centralized list with proper stats/graphics and simply assign your value to the item upon purchase.&nbsp; I have to implement it so its backwards compatible with the existing system, hopefully it won`t be&nbsp;a big deal :)</P>
<P>Also, the new raid dump feature of the Guild Manager in EQ will be coded in.. i just need someone to email me a sample of the dump so I can code up my parser to accept it.&nbsp; Ironically, I am not in a guild, and don`t have access to a sample file right now.&nbsp; So if someone can email me with a sample file, that would be great!</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl7_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I just deployed a patch that allows you to register a custom domain (<A href="http://www.yourguild.com">www.yourguild.com</A>), and use it instead of the semi-private guildwizard (<A href="http://yourguild.guildwizard.com">http://yourguild.guildwizard.com</A>) address.&nbsp; You can click the `Domains` button for more details, there is a FAQ link there too for more details.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you already have a domain registered, and would like to use it, it can be used as well.&nbsp; You have to point your DNS to our server and inform us of your intention to do so, so that we can add your domain to our accepted domain list.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Next patch will take care of the issues that have been reported in the last couple weeks.&nbsp; Raid, Encounter, Item grid sorting is up first.. I am also going to do some searching in certain areas where the cache isn`t updating immediatly, namely after raids are entered.</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl8_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>I am coding up a module to allow guilds to register their own domains.&nbsp; This will allow your guild to have its address as <A href="http://www.yourguild.com">www.yourguild.com</A> or whatever you want, as long as the name is available.&nbsp; I coded up the handler for custom domains a few weeks ago, and I have a few guilds using it.. it seems to be working well.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;I will admit, I wasn`t sure how well it would work... to my knowlege, GuildWizard.com is the only site of it`s kind that can handle custom domains like this.&nbsp; Most services just can`t offer it, because of software/programming limitations.&nbsp; I had implement 3 different methods in order to accomplish it, but it was worth it in the end.&nbsp; I really think it will add a lot more to a guild`s site if the name is personalized.</P>
<P>I will keep the cost for registering custom domains very competitive.&nbsp; Roughly half the cost of what Network Solutions charges, but I have to make sure.</P></font></span>
