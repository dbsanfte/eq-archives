						<h2>
							AA Points column added, fixed roster edit bug, cache issues
							Sunday, October 19, 2003 - 3:21:00 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I added a column on the Roster so players can put their total AA points.&nbsp; You can, of course, hide this column if you don`t want it by clicking the `Configure View` link on the roster (when you are logged in as an Administrator).&nbsp; You can edit this column by going into edit mode, and the player can edit it in their profile editor.</P>
<P>There was a bug in the roster edit that prevented you from editing it if you had columns hidden to everyone, including Admins.&nbsp; Prior to the fix you had to have the visibility to be set to atleast Admins to see it, so that you could edit.&nbsp; This has been fixed.</P>
<P>I looked around at methods that I might have forgotten to re-fill the cache after updates.&nbsp; This caused the roster, for example, to not show the correct number of raids or points when an admin would update it.&nbsp; I found a few, and fixed it.. there are probably more, I will find the rest and fix em.</P>
						</p>

						<h2>
							Raid List sortable, fixed Gif image bug
							Tuesday, October 14, 2003 - 2:08:45 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I added full sorting to the raid list.&nbsp; You can now sort by name, date, participants etc.&nbsp; If you click the same column twice, you can sort ascending or descending.&nbsp; I can`t believe I didn`t do this before, it just kept getting forgotten I guess.</P>
<P>There was a bug in my graphics handling engine, which caused Gif images to get converted to jpeg images.&nbsp; It wasn`t a big deal, unless the gif was animated, or had transparent backgrounds.&nbsp; This is now fixed, and my engine will output gifs as gifs.&nbsp; This engine is the one that checks to make sure nobody is hot-linking pictures to the server.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also increased the timeout timer for logins.&nbsp; So if you are logged in and editing your news or whever, it won`t make you login if you spend more than 30minutes of inactivity (typing etc).&nbsp; It now gives you 60 minutes.</P>
<P>I am probably going to implement an items database in the next patch.&nbsp; This will allow you to pick items from a centralized list with proper stats/graphics and simply assign your value to the item upon purchase.&nbsp; I have to implement it so its backwards compatible with the existing system, hopefully it won`t be&nbsp;a big deal :)</P>
<P>Also, the new raid dump feature of the Guild Manager in EQ will be coded in.. i just need someone to email me a sample of the dump so I can code up my parser to accept it.&nbsp; Ironically, I am not in a guild, and don`t have access to a sample file right now.&nbsp; So if someone can email me with a sample file, that would be great!</P>

						<h2>
							Custom domains and registration now available
							Thursday, October 02, 2003 - 9:55:31 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I just deployed a patch that allows you to register a custom domain (<A href="http://www.yourguild.com">www.yourguild.com</A>), and use it instead of the semi-private guildwizard (<A href="http://yourguild.guildwizard.com">http://yourguild.guildwizard.com</A>) address.&nbsp; You can click the `Domains` button for more details, there is a FAQ link there too for more details.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you already have a domain registered, and would like to use it, it can be used as well.&nbsp; You have to point your DNS to our server and inform us of your intention to do so, so that we can add your domain to our accepted domain list.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Next patch will take care of the issues that have been reported in the last couple weeks.&nbsp; Raid, Encounter, Item grid sorting is up first.. I am also going to do some searching in certain areas where the cache isn`t updating immediatly, namely after raids are entered.</P>

							Custom Domain registrations and handling
							Thursday, September 25, 2003 - 10:11:00 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I am coding up a module to allow guilds to register their own domains.&nbsp; This will allow your guild to have its address as <A href="http://www.yourguild.com">www.yourguild.com</A> or whatever you want, as long as the name is available.&nbsp; I coded up the handler for custom domains a few weeks ago, and I have a few guilds using it.. it seems to be working well.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;I will admit, I wasn`t sure how well it would work... to my knowlege, GuildWizard.com is the only site of it`s kind that can handle custom domains like this.&nbsp; Most services just can`t offer it, because of software/programming limitations.&nbsp; I had implement 3 different methods in order to accomplish it, but it was worth it in the end.&nbsp; I really think it will add a lot more to a guild`s site if the name is personalized.</P>
<P>I will keep the cost for registering custom domains very competitive.&nbsp; Roughly half the cost of what Network Solutions charges, but I have to make sure.</P>

							Sticky/Lock/Delete messages
							Saturday, September 06, 2003 - 11:28:15 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>You can now Sticky, Lock and Delete messages by going to the forum_admin page.. on the forum list (the one where you can change the order of the forums or edit them) , you will see a Manage Posts button.&nbsp; Clicking that will bring up a window with a listing of the topics in that forum.. from there, you can Sticky, Lock, or Delete each thread... also, you can delete a Reply in a thread (without deleting the whole thread).</P>
<P>NOW STOP EMAILING ME TO STICKY STUFF!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; jk :)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Have fun.</P>

						<h2>
							Edit forum names - small update to News 
							Tuesday, September 02, 2003 - 11:10:20 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>You can now edit the names of your forums.&nbsp; On the grid that lists your forums, there is an edit column that, when clicked, will update the name of the forum.&nbsp; Nothing really to explain, it`s pretty straight forward and self-explanatory.</P>
<P>The News administration page got a little work on the back-end.&nbsp; When you edit a news item, you can also change the date/time of the item.. this was patched a few days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the problem was that I had it set to sort the news items by their ID instead of the date.&nbsp; I changed it so items are sorted by date entered, so if you change the date, it will fall into place properly now.</P>
<P>Keep one thing in mind, if you enter an invalid date/time it will substitute it with the current date/time.&nbsp; Follow the same format as the default date/time format that is inserted when you enter a new item (I programmed it to pre-fill the date/time in the text box when you are creating a new news item).</P>

							Delete raids optimized
							Tuesday, September 02, 2003 - 11:07:41 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Update 2:42pm:&nbsp; I`ve been working on some pages, mostly DKP stuff.&nbsp; So if you are noticing that you cant add purchases or raids, just try back&nbsp;a few minutes later.&nbsp; I`ve noticed a couple guilds trying to add purchases right now, but it was locked until I was done.&nbsp; It *should* be ok now... I have to get back to my `real` work, so I probably wont be fiddling much with guildwizard till tommorow.</P>
<P>There was a problem with deleting raids for some guilds.&nbsp; It depended on certain conditions that arent really important, but it would cause the function to lock up and not delete the raid properly (or at all).&nbsp; So to temporarily fix it, I put a bandaid on it yesterday to fix it until I could fix it the right way later that night.. well I did end up fixing it, but I fell asleep at the keyboard while testing it!</P>
<P>Anyway, its fixed :)&nbsp; I am going to code in a checkbox to select to automatically roll-back any purchases associated with the raid being deleted too.&nbsp; Right now, it just stops you from deleting it and you have to manually do it..&nbsp; I will change that once I see the new code is working well for a couple days.&nbsp; I added and deleted about 10 raids on my test site and it looks fine.</P>

						<h2>
							Forum admin features added - button bug fixed
							Saturday, August 30, 2003 - 10:08:04 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>I added a couple features to the Forum Admin page.&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>I changed the way you add members to the private forums.&nbsp; Prior to this patch you had to get the username exactly or it wouldnt work.&nbsp; Instead of this, I have created a search function which will search the database for the username which most closely matches your entered username.&nbsp; It then presents a grid of possible matches, and you simply click the "Add User" button for the username you want to add.</LI>
<LI>You can now sort the order in which your forums appear.&nbsp; On the forum list grid, there is now a column with an up arrow and down arrow for each forum name on the list.&nbsp; You can move the forums arround by clicking these arrows to change their position in the list.</LI>
<LI>I changed the layout of a couple sections.. I will probably tweak it more so that its more intuitive (easy to use).</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp; Thanks to <FONT face=Arial size=2>Velyanae </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>Guild Leader</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2> of&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Contagion (Terris Thule), I was able to find the bug that caused your admin buttons to disappear, and give you a second copy of the non-admin bugs.&nbsp; Velyanae told me when it was happening, and from there I was able to isolate the problem.&nbsp; Turns out it was just a cache problem.. I was recaching two button sections when you editted or deleted buttons, instead of caching one admin and one non-admin section..&nbsp; thanks Velyanae!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I added a validator to the links entry page to complain if you dont have a full URL (<A href="http://www.guildwizard.com">http://www.guildwizard.com</A>) and not just <A href="http://www.guildwizard.com">www.guildwizard.com</A>&nbsp; .&nbsp; The linking system requires a full URL (needs the http://), without it you get your guild URL tacked infront of the real URL , which is dumb :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, this way it will prevent that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I will be adding this validator on the buttons, screenshots and other pages that the problem could occur.</FONT></P>

							Upload issues fixed
							Saturday, August 30, 2003 - 10:31:08 AM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Some people were experiencing odd problems with uploading images.&nbsp; It turned out to be server directory permission problems that was denying the uploads.&nbsp; I am looking into how/why it was caused, but it should be fixed.&nbsp; I made some configuration (global configuration) changes yesterday, which might have taken away some permissions to the account that runs guildwizard.&nbsp; Actually, I am pretty sure thats what the issue was.&nbsp; Anyway, it should be ok now.. Upload away ! :)</P>

							Sometimes it`s better to be smaller!
							Thursday, August 28, 2003 - 10:53:03 PM
						</h2>
						<p>
							<P>Sometimes it`s better to be smaller ... well when it comes to image file&nbsp;size anyway :)</P>
<P>This is a note, ok a plea to people posting pictures for news items, profiles, gallery items etc.. OPTIMIZE YOUR IMAGES!&nbsp; Now as you know I have been really tightening up Guildwizard...&nbsp;and I am running a lot of analysis on how much bandwith is being used etc.&nbsp; I am noticing that images are being posted in excess of 125kb per image, which is quite large.&nbsp; I, for fun, optimized the same image and got it down to 35k.&nbsp; Thats a huge difference..&nbsp; </P>
<P>So..&nbsp; this is where its at.&nbsp; I am going to politely ask everyone to optimize their JPEGS a little better...&nbsp; you dont have to have the settings at Maximum for general web-browsing, for the most part.&nbsp; You can easily get an image to be a third of the file size by setting down to Medium or Medium Low, instead of Maximum.</P>
<P>In the next few weeks I will see if people are doing it themselves.. if not, I am going to write an automated service on the server which will `Do it for you`..&nbsp;I will probably enforce smaller uploads too, if need be.&nbsp; I don`t want to do it, as its about 5-6 hours of work that I could spend on other guildwizard features, instead of playing bandwith cop :)</P>
