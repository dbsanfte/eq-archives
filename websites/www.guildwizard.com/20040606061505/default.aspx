<P>To add moderators, go into your Manage Forums tab and you will see the Manage Moderators link in the list now.&nbsp; Choose the user and the forum and click the button.&nbsp; To remove the user from the moderator list, click the delete button on the grid underneath which shows all the moderators.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Moderators are NOT admins.&nbsp; They can Delete, Edit, Sticky, Lock threads in the forum(s) they are set to be moderators for.&nbsp; They do not have access to the Manage Forums tab, and may not ban users.</P>
<P>I am really hoping to add in little things here and there over the next few weeks, just the stuff that everyone has been suggesting.&nbsp; Then, after that, I am going to start on a VERY aggressive re-work of the style and layout editor.&nbsp; We are talking a total redevelopment.&nbsp; The whole service + forums will go full XHTML compliant, and allow FULL CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) support.&nbsp; So those users who know css will literally be able to work with their own CSS file.&nbsp; The other 95% of the users are going to work with a much more robust editor than whats there now for style/layout.</P>
<P>I am going to be honest, the above project is really for another project, but heck guildwizard might as well use the same tools :)&nbsp; I wish I could spend quality development time on GuildWizard, but I would have to charge much more to justify it.&nbsp; Keep in mind, with my `real` development projects, I have a dedicated graphic designer, HTML coder, text writer (author) and me as the lead developer for programming.&nbsp; </P>

<P>I know I said that I might allow the old forums to continue to run, but with both running, it`s a big waste of server resources.&nbsp;Now that guilds are really starting to use the new forums, I am seeing that it`s just not going to workout with both forums running.&nbsp; Also, the old forums are starting to act up again with that dumb connection warning.... </P>
<P>I figure I would mention it now, to give those using the old forums a few weeks to let it sink in.... some of the guilds have already started using the new forums.&nbsp; Some are continuing to use them until I turn them off... which is fine.&nbsp; Like I said, I won`t force anyone until the new forums have all the features I want, and they are working 100%.</P></font></span>

<P>It honestly wont be hard to implement at all.. i just need the time to do it.&nbsp; Of course the forums have to get done before anything.&nbsp; Lots of guilds are&nbsp;using them, as I am adding features and I am getting some good ideas from the various suggestions!&nbsp; I&nbsp;expect to spend some time today on adding some&nbsp;features .. probably a&nbsp;New messages icon on the forum list to show forums with new messages..&nbsp; </P>
