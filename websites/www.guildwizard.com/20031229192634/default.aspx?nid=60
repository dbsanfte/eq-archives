<P>Let`s face it, I know some people cannot pay.&nbsp; Some people just don`t want to pay, and I respect that.&nbsp; Just keep in mind I am not beginning to charge for the programming I did (I LOVE programming, its my pleasure)... quite honestly, there are costs to running this service and I can`t absorb the costs anymore.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I did exactly 2 advertising rounds on the message boards and I got this many guilds now.&nbsp; I could imagine if I `really` advertised.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, more on this later.&nbsp; I am only starting to sign up for ad servers and things like that... it will be a few days.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am going to also look into the feasibility of throwing in a custom URL (<A href="http://www.yourguildname.com">www.yourguildname.com</A>) as part of the subscription.&nbsp; Don`t hold me to that yet though :)</P></font></span>

<P>One thing though, when I deploy the new code, you will have to spend a couple minutes configuring your colors again.&nbsp; Your site will default to a black skin color scheme... I will send an email to all the admins letting them know to change the colors, when I deploy the code (possibly today, most likely Monday though)</P></font></span>

<LI>Add more options to the Roster (keys,epic,magelo)..</LI>
<LI>Add more options for customization - will rework the color/layout configurations</LI></OL>
<P>I list those 3 only because they will require the most coding, which really isn`t a lot - relatively speaking.&nbsp; The other suggestions by people will also be done, just they are minor changes that can be done very quickly.&nbsp;</P></font></span>

<P>Tommorow, Tuesday Feb 25, I will be moving the server that the sites run on.&nbsp; When I say move, I mean physically move it, to our new office.&nbsp; I will be lugging the box over in the morning (EST), and should turn it back on shortly after.&nbsp; Keep in mind DNS will change a bit so it might take a bit before all the DNS servers get updated.</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl9_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>Off the top: The Filemanager should be back to normal now.</P>
<P>I have created a page for admins/officers to manage security/password issues.&nbsp; For now it has two tools to use, however I will probably add more as the need arises.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First of all, you will see the link in the top right corner of any page, as long as you are logged in as an Admin or Officer... think link is called Manage Members.&nbsp; From this page you can (the admin only) promote members to Officers, which in essense gives them Admin rights to your site.&nbsp; Be very careful who you allow this priveledge!&nbsp; The only thing, at this time, that an Officer cannot do, is add/remove other officers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second tool on the page, is a password resetter.&nbsp; This tool will allow an Admin/Officer to reset the password of a guildmember who lost their password.&nbsp; I was going to implement an email the new password type tool but not everyone lists their email so this was the easiest way.&nbsp; After you reset the password for them, they are free to change it to what they want, via the link on the login box.</P>
<P>Now that the Roles based security is in place, I am going to re-visit the grid columns.&nbsp; I will likely be adding the option to only show Guildmates certain columns (points, loot, raids etc).</P>
<P>Moreover, I am going to look into implementing the ability for administrators to `lock` certain pages.&nbsp; What i mean by this, is allow the admin to set, say, the Calandar page as "Guildmembers Only" permissions.&nbsp; That way, only guildmembers would be able to see that Calendar page.&nbsp; Some guilds are on very competative servers, and they don`t necessarily want to show other guilds what they are going to be up to. No promises on this, but like I said I am going to look into it.</P></font></span>
