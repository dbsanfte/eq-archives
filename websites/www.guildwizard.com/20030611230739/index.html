<P>Well after spending all day yesterday trying to figure out why there was bottlenecks to certain sites (not guildwizard sites), I finally narrowed it down to a router at my office.&nbsp; Guildwizard didnt seem to be affected for some reason by this POS (no I dont mean Parents Over Shoulder) router..&nbsp; I think because Guild Wizard`s DNS is managed offsite, it somehow helped, but other sites who`s DNS was fully hosted here were having a heck of a time connecting sometimes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway...&nbsp; now that the router has been replaced, I see a pretty good performance boost on the sites.&nbsp; I linked up via my test proxy and it seems quicker.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Things that are coming in the next few days to guildwizard.&nbsp; Account limitations will start to happen on un-subscribed accounts.&nbsp; I am going to work on a flow chart right now on what exactly will be limited.. maybe I will post a description later on if I have time.&nbsp;</P></font></span>

<P>I also coded the Paypal subscription component.&nbsp; Everything is in place right now for Guild Wizard to move to a subscription model.&nbsp; The only thing that I didnt code yet, is the limiting of abilities for non-subscribers (after the trial period).&nbsp; This will be done after I roll out the update tommorow.&nbsp; I still need to sit down and figure out what will be limited, so there is no need to rush it.</P>
<P>After tommorow, those who have been using Guild Wizard for over 30 days, will see some banners/buttons on their pages.&nbsp; If you want to remove them, your guild will have to subscribe via PayPal which accepts all credit cards etc.&nbsp; I will make a page regarding subscriptions tommorow before I roll out the update.</P>
<P>Subscription cost will be $25 for 6 months, which is less a lot less than other comparable services.&nbsp; Figure if you had to pay hosting alone for your site with a hosting company (without popups), you would be paying atleast $60 for 6 months.&nbsp; Atleast with guildwizard you get all the tools to go with it.</P>
<P>Anyway the update will be in the afternoon (EST) around 1pm if everything goes ok.&nbsp; Downtime should be about 15 minutes in total.</P></font></span>

<P>As I`ve mentioned in the past I will be implementing a subscription model for Guild Wizard very soon.&nbsp; The price has not been determined, but I am definatly going to allow those who do not want to pay, to still be able to use the service.&nbsp; Guilds who do not want to pay will have some banners (no popups), and probably limited use of the service.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What will be limited?&nbsp; I don`t know yet, I was thinking to allow the roster, news, and gallery(without filemanager access).&nbsp; File-manager (the ability to upload your pictures) will definatly be a subscription item, as will the DKP tools and the forums.&nbsp; Those items are the biggest resource hogs on my server.&nbsp; </P>
<P>BTW, guilds who just signed in the last 30 days will not be affected... The model will allow a free 100% use of the service for the first 30 days, so you can decide if you like it or not.</P>
<P>More on this in the next day or so...&nbsp; </P></font></span>

<P>Once my projects for work get under control, I am going to code up the features I have been talking about for the last little while (Better forums control, roster updates from the new Guild-Manager in EQ etc).

<P>I have created a page for admins/officers to manage security/password issues.&nbsp; For now it has two tools to use, however I will probably add more as the need arises.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First of all, you will see the link in the top right corner of any page, as long as you are logged in as an Admin or Officer... think link is called Manage Members.&nbsp; From this page you can (the admin only) promote members to Officers, which in essense gives them Admin rights to your site.&nbsp; Be very careful who you allow this priveledge!&nbsp; The only thing, at this time, that an Officer cannot do, is add/remove other officers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second tool on the page, is a password resetter.&nbsp; This tool will allow an Admin/Officer to reset the password of a guildmember who lost their password.&nbsp; I was going to implement an email the new password type tool but not everyone lists their email so this was the easiest way.&nbsp; After you reset the password for them, they are free to change it to what they want, via the link on the login box.</P>
<P>Now that the Roles based security is in place, I am going to re-visit the grid columns.&nbsp; I will likely be adding the option to only show Guildmates certain columns (points, loot, raids etc).</P>
<P>Moreover, I am going to look into implementing the ability for administrators to `lock` certain pages.&nbsp; What i mean by this, is allow the admin to set, say, the Calandar page as "Guildmembers Only" permissions.&nbsp; That way, only guildmembers would be able to see that Calendar page.&nbsp; Some guilds are on very competative servers, and they don`t necessarily want to show other guilds what they are going to be up to. No promises on this, but like I said I am going to look into it.</P></font></span>

<P>Don`t get me wrong, Roles security was already there, just I am reworking it so it uses the .NET security model.&nbsp; I really should have done that from the beginning, but this project started out as a casual project to be used by 2 co-guildleaders.&nbsp; I didn`t design the login-in for what its being used for today.&nbsp; Regardless, most won`t even notice a difference... it really is mostly boring server side stuff that is behind the scenes.</P>
<P>One thing that guildleaders will notice, is they will be allowed to give Officer permissions to certain users which is pretty much giving them the same powers as an Administrator.&nbsp; The difference is, an Officer will not be able to add/revoke officer status.&nbsp; Only the Administrator Role can do that.&nbsp; I am not going to go much deeper in the permissions than that.&nbsp; As some of you know I could program it that each feature could be a configurable permission, but quite frankly I don`t think it will be used, so I will only do a broad permission setting.&nbsp; If I get a lot of requests, I will revisit that decision though.</P>
<P>Members will notice very little, except they will log in at the same login as the administrator now.. you can log in, and it will know what you should be seeing or not based on your Role.&nbsp; Also, there will be an option to Remember your login, so you don`t have to log in everytime you come to the site... </P>
<P>I have atleast 1-2 more days of reworking the permissions, then I will begin working on the documentation, and adding some more plug-ins.</P></font></span>

<P>I will continue to shrink my TODO list, and start working on a Roles based Security model.. this will allow different roles when logging in.. (GuildLeader, Officer, member) etc..&nbsp; It will also merge the admin account with a user account... </P>
<P>I haven`t seen that bug in about 15 hours now.. might be handled... hopefully it is.</P>
<P>Well... going to play some Shadowbane :)</P></font></span>

											<span id="DataList1__ctl37_Label1"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><P>&nbsp; Up until now the message board I have has been used for other projects but not for anything like this.&nbsp; I am having a small problem with getting the moderation roles set up the way i want.&nbsp; If you signed up and requested a message board, you will get an email from me when I have this settled.&nbsp; I am hoping to have it settled by tommorow!</P>
<P>With all the new signups today it was brought to my attention that even after you delete a player from the roster they still show up in the random player profile display.&nbsp; This has been corrected.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip guys!</P>
<P>I have changed the text sizes from reletive to absolute.&nbsp; Simply what this means is that you shouldn`t have problems anymore if you crank your text size to Large in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; IMHO it`s bad design to do this, since people who are visually impaired could have problems, but I have had too many emails asking why the text was overlapping controls :)&nbsp; </P></font></span>
