    Bio:</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Ceny was born in the lovely city of Kelethin. Learning quickly that she
    was distracted by the beauty of the trees and wildlife in the Faydark forests, she soon
    moved to the Qeynos area where she could study the warriors art under the watchful eye of
    Ebon Strongbear. Ceny prefers outdoor zones where she can feel the wind in her hair, but
    will travel to dungeons if an expert guide can be found. <br>
    <br>
    Ceny is quiet and shy, preferring to hold a place in the background in most groups.
    However, those that are closest to her know that she can be quite a feisty, mischievous
    wood elf with a witty remark for any situation when the mood takes her. <br>
    <br>
    Over the years, Ceny has discovered that many of the creatures of Norrath enjoy trips to
    visit different areas of their homes. She can often be seen leading several friendly
    creatures to see the sights. Unfortunately, these creatures often become very excited and
    over boisterous and accidentally mistreat their tour guide when she is showing them the
    sights to be found close to the boarder of the neighboring area. </font></td>
