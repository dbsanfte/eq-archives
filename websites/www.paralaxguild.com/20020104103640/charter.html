 <!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 A<font size="2" face="Tahoma">n apparent change in the direction of an object, caused by a change 
 in observational position that provides a new line of sight.<br>
 <br>
 I.e : Paralax Guild aim to change the normal guild's goal. Our position and our orientation is 
 different. Our chosen way is completely fixed to the enjoyments of our high level members. So on, 
 our goals are fixed in a different way, another axis... a Paralax.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>1. Main goal.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Paralax Guild was built in the spirit of goodwill, faith and the desire to have fun together in the 
 world of Norrath.
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>Guild leadership has the responsibility to make available transportation 
 and disponibility of events for every member</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Members of Paralax must 
 respect elementary rules of social conduct and community life,
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>harsh language and off the hook comments are not tolerated in the 
 guild’s chat</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Every Paralax member must accept and respect the guild's 
 laws and other members of the guild, human respect of others is necessary to be a part of Paralax.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>2. Official Guild-Event</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 All events classified under the board and quoted as a guild event will be considered mandatory for 
 Paralax members. All Paralax members are held responsible of the life of the guild and as such
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>must be present during guild events when online</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
 <br>
 Guild events will be lead by an event master, a specific person put in command of that event. It 
 can be the requiree of the event, an officer delegated to the task or the guildmaster. Event master 
 will be in charge of handling groups and strategy appropriate to the event's area
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>or delegating to a knowledgeable person</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. The 
 event master will try to make balanced and equitable group as required by the planned area's 
 strategy. Special demands about groups will be allowed but will be respected within the limits of 
 the possible.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>3. Presence and absence from Norrath </b>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Every Paralax member is required to be on guild events if present online in the world of Norrath. 
 Event participation will be taken into consideration by the class officers and will be accountable 
 in the sharing of loot. People leaving Norrath for a Real-life situation must contact the 
 guildleader or an officer prior to do so. Extended leave (be it planned or not) will result in a 
 removal from active roster. Members that warned about their leave will be allowed back with a minor 
 administrative penalty, members that left without giving warning for an extended period will be 
 allowed back with initiate status ( to show us they really are coming back to active status ).<br>
 <br>
 Members present online during an official events and not with the guild will be issued a first 
 silent warning. At the second offence the member will be /telled and asked for explanation, any 
 further offence will get a penalty decided by the guildmaster. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>Guests are allowed on a very specific basis. All guests must be 
 registered to the guildleader before the event starts. As a rule of thumb only candidates or needed 
 guests are allowed.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 There will always be
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> official events per week + rotation events.
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>There will also be prized FFA kills when available. Official events can 
 be called by the guildleader when its judged possible to take down a notable target.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 Events will be held starting at the following hours.<br>
 Mon-Fri : 6h15 EST.<br>
 Sat-sun : 11h-1h EST<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>4 Loot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>5. Officers </b>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Officers are selected from the guild amongst people who show great potential, dedication and every 
 officer has some responsibilities to attend to.<br>
 <br>
 The officer roster is dynamic, and any officer, can be decided to be replaced, can ask to be 
 replaced so on. <br>
 <br>
 People can talk to the guildmaster if they have interest to become officer and have tasks that need 
 to be done/responsibilities to accomplish.<br>
 <br>
 Current officer list : <br>

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>6. Recruiting </b>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Minimal level to join Paralax is level
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>57</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
 <br>
 All potential candidates must talk first to the officer in charge of recruiting. Then be present to 
 a couple of raids and be noted as a good candidate. The officer is responsible to invite only 
 prospective recruits and / or constant guests to Paralax's events.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Recruiting is currently
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>CLOSED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 Special cases may apply, contact Velamon for more information. <br>
 <br>
 All candidates must be subjected to a first screening session by the person in charge of recruiting 
 ( Velamon ), afterwards if judged potential candidates they are placed on the guild board, name, 
 class, level and some considerations written. <br>
 <br>
 Every Paralax member has the choice to express his feelings on the candidate, after a certain 
 period of time ( as deemed necessary by the person in charge of recruiting but a minimum of 48 
 hours) the candidate is either inserted in the guild or told that his membership has been refused. 
 Any negative vote on a candidate by a member automatically voids the membership of that applicant.
 <br>
 <br>
 Every new member must pass thru a 4 weeks initiation period (or 6 raid points, whatever is faster) 
 in which he will accumulate event points but may not use them ( except in the case of them being 
 the only one interested in an item ), during this period initiates will be also subject to be 
 removed from guild if it is noticed that they do not fit the Paralax mold, Officers are in charge 
 of taking notes about the initiates.<br>
 <br>
 Every member that returns to Paralax, after an out of guild period ( Removed himself ) must also 
 pass thru the initiation process again. No one will ever be re-invited in Paralax after a 2nd /guildremove.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>7. Guild's pride.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 All members of Paralax should be proud of their guild and as such it will be specially asked to 
 avoid being anonymous. Roleplay will be an accepted mode to avoid being bugged. <br>
 <br>
 Warnings will be issued to members who are repetitively anonymous. </font><br>

<font size="2" face="Tahoma"><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 We will take note of people always arriving late and leaving early at events.<br>
 Common sense rule, dont expect points if you come to the last 10 mins of an event. <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>We will also take note of people repetitively arriving late and 
 leaving early. Events should not consist of coming to get a group...killing 2-3 mobs then going 
 back off. Thats not the goal of it. Warnings will be issued after a second noted offence.<br>
 </i>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
 <br>
 Points are usually noted when Officers/Guildmaster make groups for events. If you have a tendency 
 to arrive late to events, this may have some consequence on your points bank. If you did arrive at 
 an unusual time at the event, make sure your presence has been noted by the event's 
 leader(guildleader).<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i><br>
 People have the responsability to make sure they are noted when they arrive to a raid. Managing 
 everyone's attendance is ungrateful already. When you arrive late to a raid make sure the raid 
 leader ( making groups ) is
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>AWARE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of your arrival.<br>
 </i>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
 <br>
 Players with multiple accounts/characters must register their
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>main character</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with the guildmaster. The MAIN 
 character will gain points and will be enabled to roll on items during events. <br>
 <br>
 For specific events it will be allowed or &quot;asked&quot; to come with a secondary character, in those 
 cases, the main character is granted a point, the alternate character cannot participate in loot 
 but the main character is allowed
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>if it is possible and reasonable to bring him to looting ground.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 Only 1 change of this character will be allowed, and all must be agreed with the guildmaster/his 
 assistants before taking effect, points may or may not be kept or certain conditions may be imposed 
 before the transferal happens. <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>Random events</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>Big target events (Velketor, Dain, Derakor/Statue, TOV Named) are always 
 registered as official by the guild master and as such participation is REQUIRED.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>2/ Items are categorized </b>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 ( this is general barem of points, set values by loot officers ALWAYS override points written in 
 this list ).<br>
 Every items will get its separate value but in case of an unknown item, this is the general list.<br>
 <br>
 - 0.5pt: Jacynth, Black Sapphire, cheap items.<br>
 - 1pt: common spells ( level 55-59 ), diamonds Jewelry, Fine armour and weapons. Old planar stuff. 
 Spells level 55+.<br>
 - 2pts: Old nice planar stuff (valorium, carmine, etc, if it still drop...), Good armour or 
 weapons. Level 60 spells<br>
 - 3pts: Some talismans in WW. Trakanon's tooth<br>
 - 4pts: TOV armour(except BP's and robes), old planar BP/Robes, Excellent weapons and armour, 
 (stuff generaly better than planar, but not than boss mobs). Some talismans in WW.<br>
 -6pts: Boss mob loot, BP/Robes from Kunark/Velious. Exceptional armour or Weapons<br>
 <br>
 -7+pts : TOV BP's and robes, Exceptional items / loot. ST talismans.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>NB : Officers and GM can modify the value of items by +/- 1pt as they 
 see it during an event. <br>
 </i>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>3/ Participation on lotto</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Lotto is allowed if you possess the
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>FULL value</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of a given item for the character 
 present at the event and if the character bidding can use the desired item.<br>
 <br>
 No secondary character may roll for an item if a primary character will use that item. Respect and 
 common sense are required when requesting for participation in lotto for an item. The guildmaster 
 may limit/allow certain classes/persons on specific lotto's depending on arrival time, previous 
 winnings and so on.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i><br>
 After seeing multiple cases of adherent participation in lotto's there will now be a ruling out of 
 participation in lotto's. The guildmaster and officers will discuss any of those case by case on 
 the fly. Gross Greed will not be permitted.<br>
 <br>
 Repeat winners :<br>
 Sometimes, random and fates plays some strange ways and some people always seem to get the good 
 pick repetitively. Common sense IS required. If you won a couple of items in recent lotto's or took 
 items from guildbank or ... you know. Step out of a new item's lotto, leave chance to others to win 
 items too. After a couple of wins you might receive a friendly tell by an officer if common sense 
 didn't work.<br>
 </i>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>Multiple Lotto's<br>
 Lotto's are exclusive. In the case of Multiple item drops, Participation to lotto is limited only 
 to ONE of the dropped items (unless you are the only one in need of one of the dropped item). Since 
 lotto's are sequential and your point value might influence rolls from multiple lotto's, it is the 
 only viable fair possibility.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>4/ Lotto numbers</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Lotto on item is done using the current lotto rules.<br>
 - MaxLotto is 100+(MaxPoints*10)<br>
 - Every player rolls from (MyPoints*10) to MaxLotto<br>
 - Higher roller gets the item.<br>
 <br>
 Exemple :<br>
 Lotto is done from BaseLotto to (max number*10)+100<br>
 <br>
 Velamon 6pt<br>
 Topaz 5pt<br>
 Rowbert 4pt<br>
 Jull 3pt<br>
 Leyrin 1pt<br>
 x 0pt<br>
 y 0pt<br>
 z 0pt<br>
 <br>
 Maxpoint is 6 ( from Velamon )<br>
 <br>
 So random is done to 160.<br>
 ie. (100+(6x10))<br>
 <br>
 Every person rolls.<br>
 Velamon rolls from 60 to 160<br>
 Topaz rolls from 50 to 160<br>
 Bamana from 40 to 160<br>
 Jull from...<br>
 ...<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>There is a maximum point value used to roll, the maximum value allowed 
 on rolls is 40pts. If a player has more than 40pts, he only uses 40pts as his maximum to roll for 
 items. <br>
 </b>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>5/ No drop items exception </b>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Items which are used by no one, and collected only for Secondary equipment (i.e CR Gear) can be 
 looted at no point cost
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>if called as such by the raid leader</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Item 
 cost maybe degraded depending on the situation, if only 1 person desires that item. <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>6/ Returning items</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Any item returned to the guild gives back half its value in point to the person who returns the 
 item, only when a similar item is received.
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>Only items received from the guild in an official event and that costs 
 points can be used to get points back.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It is highly recommended to return 
 an old item after receiving a new one from the guild.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>7/ Guests</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Guests looting is limited to items that cannot be carried over or on items the officers and GM 
 agree to let them participate on. Their point total is always 0pt in the case they are allowed to 
 lotto.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>8/ Guild stash and bank</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Items can be purchased from the guild stash for second characters or personal use at a later date, 
 only and only if that item has no use for a primary character and could not be traded/sold.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>9/ Epic items :</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Never will any Epic Item be given out with direct attribution if there is competition about it, if 
 all people agree and rejoice on giving the item to one of them, ALL THE BETTER. <br>
 <br>
 The goal is to make it CLEAR and I mean Crystal CLEAR that there is no Attribution and no 
 favoritism and our decisions arent tainted with any external consideration.<br>
 <br>
 If everyone agrees with with the one person finishing his epic COOL, FANTASTIC. If there is 
 competition between two or more members, then there will be lotto for that item like all other 
 items.<br>
 <br>
 The biggest exception to this rule is the following :<br>
 An item directly concerned on an epic event called for the benefit of one person goes directly to 
 that person, and she must pay the regular price in points for that item.<br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i><br>
 The guild doesn't handle epic items attribution. There can be arrangements made between people of 
 classes if this is the case and an item is allocated to someone, great, but the guild will never 
 force the allocation of an item to a specific player. If no arrangement was taken, random lotto 
 will be done in all cases.<br>
 </i>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 NB: Points are received
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>AFTER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> an event.<br>
 <br>
 NB2: Points are deducted
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>INSTANTLY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> after gaining an item. Not at the 
 end of the raid. <br>
 <br>
 NB3 : The guildmaster and its assistants, always have the final saying on item point costs and in 
 lotto's participation.
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>There are many items which are restricted on participation in lotto's
 </b>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD END-->,<br>
 <br>
 NB4: Cash items received during events will be kept by the guild officers to pay for expenses. <br>
 <br>
 NB5: Guild item received ARE noted and are property of the guild. A Paralax member must give back 
 an item if another item of the same type and of greater power is acquired during a guild event. <br>
 <br>
 NB6: Items obtained in a guild event cannot be traded or sold. IF these items aren't needed anymore 
 and wishes to be traded / sold, there must be some talks made to an officer or guildmaster before 
 doing so. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--></font><b><font size="2" face="Tahoma">IMPORTANT NOTICE : The loot 
 system(tm) only applies during Official Paralax Events. Free events are always done using the 
 general means, free open lotto or direct attribution according to participants.<br>

 Fun, Respect and common sense are the most important values in Paralax, any person not respecting 
 those will be warned. Repeat offenders might have to look out for a new guild.</font><br>
