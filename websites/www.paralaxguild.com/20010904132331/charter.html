        I.e : Paralax Guild aim to change the normal guild's goal. Our position and our
        orientation is different. Our chosen way is completely fixed to the enjoyments of our high

<!--EZCODE BOLD START-->        <b>1. Main goal.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
        Paralax Guild was built in the spirit of goodwill, faith and the desire to have fun
        together in the world of Norrath. Members of Paralax must respect elementary rules of
        social conduct and community life. Every Paralax member must accept and respect the
        guild's laws and other members of the guild.<br>
        <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START-->        <b>2. Official Guild-Event</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
        All events classified under the board and quoted as a guild event will be considered
        mandatory for Paralax members. All Paralax members are held responsible of the life of the
        guild and as such must try as possible to be present during guild events.<br>
        <br>
        Guild events will be lead by an event master, a specific person put in command of that
        event. It can be the requiree of the event, an officer delegated to the task or the
        guildmaster. Event master will be in charge of handling groups and strategy appropriate to
        the event's area. The event master will try to make balanced and equitable group as
        required by the planned area's strategy. Special demands about groups will be allowed but
        will be respected within the limits of the possible.<br>
        <br>
        Every Paralax member is required to be on guild events if present online in the world of
        Norrath. Event participation will be taken into consideration by the class officers and
        will be accountable in the sharing of loot. People inactive for a long period will be
        asked simple questions to their whereabouts and maybe retired for a period or simply
        removed from guild as wished by the guild's council and guildmaster.<br>
        <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START-->        <i>(16-06-01)<br>
        Members present online during an official events and not with the guild will be issued a
        first silent warning. At the second offence the member will be /telled and asked for
        explanation, any further offence will get a penalty decided by the guildmaster. <br>

        Guests will be tolerated and approved by the Paralax guild but must be registered by an

        conform and respect to Paralax's rules.<br>
        <br>
        There will always be 2 official events per week + unpredictable events ( Gods, Dragon,
        some rare epics...etc).<br>

        The officer roster is dynamic, and any officer, can be decided to be replaced, can ask to
        be replaced so on. <br>

        Points are usually noted when Officers/Guildmaster make groups for events. If you have a
        tendency to arrive late to events, this may have some consequence on your point bank. If
        you did arrive at an unusual time at the event, make sure your presence has been noted by

        Players with multiple accounts/characters must register their main character with the
        guildmaster. This character will gain points and will be enabled to roll on items during
        events. No frequent change of this character will be allowed, and all must be agreed with
        the guildmaster/his assistants before taking effect. <br>
        <br>
        Random events such as Lodizal, Kelorek Dar, Faydedar, Ragefire, Golem calls are a special

        - Higher roller gets the item.<br>

        Any item returned to the guild gives back half its value in point to the person who

        <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START-->        <b>7/ Guests</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START-->        <b>9/ Epic items :</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
        Never will any Epic Item be given out with direct attribution if there is competition
        about it, if all people agree and rejoice on giving the item to one of them, ALL THE
        BETTER. <br>
        <br>
        The goal is to make it CLEAR and I mean Crystal CLEAR that there is no Attribution and no
        favoritism and our decisions aren't tainted with any external consideration.<br>
        <br>
        If everyone agrees with with the one person finishing his epic COOL, FANTASTIC. If there
        is competition between two or more members, then there will be lotto for that item like
        all other items.<br>
        <br>
        The biggest exception to this rule is the following :<br>
        An item directly concerned on an epic event called for the benefit of one person goes
        directly to that person, and she must pay the regular price in points for that item.<br>
        <br>
        (16-06-01)<br>
        The guild doesn't handle epic items attribution. There can be arrangements made between
        people of classes if this is the case and an item is allocated to someone, great, but the
        guild will never force the allocation of an item to a specific player. If no arrangement
        was taken, random lotto will be done in all cases.<br>
