<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>abguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was guilded with this fool a while back, while on poa raid  doin war blades.<br />
<br />
Well he got all pissy and disbanned from the guild because we were after 3 days of poa and almost a full day of war blades we were moving to next island for mage epics, <br />
<br />
Pre rolled the last kill and i won yaaaaaaaa me:P<br />
this fool for some reason was left in a group and stole the blade.<br />
<br />
I have seen him in a few different guilds, mentioning none, i ofcourse sent tell asap to guild leader of what he is known for doing. and soon not seeing him on line at all or not guilded :P<br />
<br />
You have been marked fool! <br />
Might be different if he had made some attempt to fix his mistake, but has has only been an ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well he applied for my guild today and his app was promptly laughed away <br />
<br />
here is him and his allts as listed by him on his application soulwolff / 60 / druid<br />
frostfistt / 54 / monk<br />
Battlcatt / 59 / warrior<br />
<br />
 You have been warned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ariakkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">he also has a gnome enchanter....i believe<br />
<br />
<br />
can't think of his name atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>makril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wasn't soulwolff(sp?) booted from kaizen'x for begging help from guild to get one of those shields from katta,only to sell it?.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shadowbud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You forgot to mention at the time of him looting the blade he was a proby member which entitled him to no loot what so ever :)<br />
<br />
And yes he did ninja it. But who cares the epic is outdated and if it is that important to him then let him be happy with a crappy weapon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TumTum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you talking about Battlecat the vah'shir warrior, if so then I have met him in GD and he was begging me for some of my Champion's armor. What a dike....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AlderacEninvictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This &quot;person&quot; was also involved in a blatant train / ks of my friends giant fight for the Talisman / Bracer of Benevolence quest in EW.  My friend had waiting for around 3 hours for the quest to become triggerable.  He asked for assistance, and when Battlecat et al of his alts entered the zone there were 4-5 of us there.  Since it turned into a pissing contest, we trigged the mob, got it down to around 30% then he trained and killed us, training the mob onto a waiting group of friends / alts all of whom's name I had written down somewhere years ago and have since lost.  After this his friends / alts (dunno how he could have any friends really) killed the mob, and my friend lost his piece.<br />
<br />
Its not a huge deal, it was petitioned and the reward was poofed from BC's druid.  <br />
<br />
I just found it personally offencive because prior to that I had considered this &quot;person&quot; a friend, even to the point of allowing him to join me and my friends on nightly pog raids we ran about on at one point. <br />
<br />
I was also guilded with this person long ago.<br />
<br />
I cannot reinforce enough his complete lack of a personality, any morals, or any redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Im more than happy to comment on this, feel free to drop me a line at the ATOF forums at atof.wittsend.com in the general section.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Should note that when I was guilded with him, it wasnt with ATOF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He looted, and jumped off the island.<br />

Hope he gets his tail caught in the PoI windmill!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mourneblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I read these boards daily, yet do not often post.  When I read this thread I felt compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
It's never good to have your name splattered all over the E.Marr boards in reference to actions you've taken against the community.  Honestly, most of the &quot;flames&quot; I've seen have some basis to them.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, situations where someone might take the time to rant about the actions of an indivitual can be avoided with a few simple apologies (If done unintentionally) or some etiquette concerning mob spawns, zone-out calls and common sense.<br />
<br />
We at the Order of Flaming Shrine take great pride in our guild, and our community.  We search the boards in reguards to any applicant and take note of any past accomplishments, hails, etc.. and vice versa.  As I would assume any other respectable guild would do.  This is where the bulk of us get our information about members of the community.<br />
<br />
Reguardless of if these accusations are true (One of them admittedly is) it would be in your best interest to attempt to correct these situations and begin rebuilding the trust of the community.  It take a big person to admit to their own faults, and an even bigger person to do something about them.<br />
<br />
Take this time not to defend yourself, but to move on.  Make the apologies neccessary and take the appropriate actions to correct those mistakes.  Trust me, once you've done that and proven yourself all will be forgiven.  <br />
<br />
Sorry for the lengthy post.<br />

Ah yes, I remember this one well.  While looking around in WW,  I noticed that the Scout was up.  I tell my rogue friend Hotplate, whom was the one who was going to get the BoB, that the scout is up, and that lets get a force over here quick.   I port out and pick up a few people, then we head on over.  Battlecatt and Soulwolff were sitting there, saying they had people on the way.  We were there and ready, and I had spotted her first.  So Hotplate turns in the tools.<br />
<br />
I harmony the scouts, and pull the General, or Captain... or what ever it is.. been to long since I did it.  We proceed to tear apart the giant, when I see Battlecatt run over the hill down to spawn point of giants.  I follow him and watch him agro all of them, then run back toward were we are fighting them.<br />
<br />
So, he trains us, we die, and Soulwolff pulls the named over to his group to kill them.   We reported the action, and I believe Soulwolff lost the talisman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before this had happened, I had been in Ater Draconis with Battlecatt... he wasn't a plesant person, and I'd suggest avoiding him.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
regardless if he's dishonest in obtaining an &quot;uber&quot; or lame item, it's a reflection of character.  no, things arent always black and white.   <br />
<br />
but sometimes we've gone too far in the &quot;let's try to understand why he did what he did&quot;.   &quot;who cares?&quot;   i do for one.  he may be sad for gaining a fleeting sense of inner worth over silly pixels, but we dont have to just accept it.   <br />
<br />
what can we do?  come to this board and post it.  will it have any effect?  maybe.   does this posting get abused and false accusations occur?  sure.  but that's where we, the readers, take the information and make our own opinions.<br />
<br />
laugh if you want, but the line from Gladiator is so true.  at least for me.   &quot;What we do echos thru eternity&quot;...or something to that effect.   sure, we mess up, and can attempt to undo mistakes. but if you choose to feed your greed, then be prepared to be &quot;marked&quot; by those that dont like it.<br />
<br />
some may not care what people do.  no biggie.   but some of us do.<br />
<br />
the saddest example is one upper lvl character who always came across as nice.  once this &quot;nice guy&quot; promptly marched into a camp my lowbie alt and others had, and started killing everything for some special drop.   not a &quot;hey, mind if i loot..&quot;  nor &quot;if i buff you guys may i loot....&quot;.   nada.    in his opinion, we were f$%#ing lowbies and beneath his consideration.   it is/was a reflection of his character.  given the &quot;power&quot; and the opportunity, he takes what he can.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cerden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, it is true.<br />
<br />
We where doing spirocs. And you where a probationary member, not entitled to loot. You thought since you where there the entire time, you deserved itmore then someone else who was a Fullmember. From there, can't remember which, I either deguilded you, or you yourself.<br />
<br />
You where told to leave, you are not part of our raid anymore. We had a guest guild with us then, and you had been in their group. Ended up getting the kill, ninja looting it and jumping off the island.<br />
<br />
Before that you kept ranting about how you wanted to be the first Vah shir warrior with epics, and how your friends in Magister where going to kill the queen for you.<br />
<br />
Well, I hope you did get your epics, and you where the first. Good trade off huh? Your reputation for some shitty blades.</div></div><hr />
