<br />
-----<br />
<br />
     Zariel sat near the Wizard Spires in the West Commons, watching the sun set, remembering the words Brother Nandei had spoken to her just a few days before. He had hailed her as &quot;The Mother of the Light and Darkness,&quot; and spoken of an ancient legend. A legend of a child who would be born of Light and Darkness.  A strange foreboding made her wonder if he might have meant the child growing inside her, and so she pondered the words again now.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Once long ago my father spoke of a legend. Several nights ago, as I tried to sleep on Siren Rock it came back to me in a dream.... I went in search of an old friend in Greater Faydark...he told me of the return.  &quot;The legend is old even by the standard of the elder races. It tells of a woman of great virtue and kindness who traveled the lands of Antonica. She befriended and aided many in her travels...soon her name (which escapes me now) became known by the evil races. They considered her a threat...her Inner Light blinded them in their plans to enslave to good folk. Light such as that of the soul only blinds those entrenched in darkness.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Here Zariel had remarked that she did not hate those blinded by the Light, only pitied them. Nandei had disagreed with her view.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Do not feel pity,&quot; he had said, &quot;for these creatures of the night only sought to deny the world of this Light. They lured her to the darker lands of Norrath many times in attempts to kill her -- but to no avail. It seemed that every time she was faced with certain death, the world would be blanketed in darkness, and she would awaken many days later in relative safety, but with no memory of the events.<br />
     &quot;Soon she gathered many to follow he ways of Light, and they all entered the dark lands to end these attacks. They traveled in the deep woods, always alert for those who did not follow the Light. As they traveled, the night slowly closed around them. Their lights slowly winked out one by one...until only the woman of Light stood as a beacon. There she stood, alone, it appeared. No sound was heard.... As she stood in the silent darkness she knew that she was truly alone....<br />
<br />
     &quot;The sound of immense wings could be heard approaching. She could feel the waves of force in her body. Soon the sound and force were enough to force her to the ground. Then, as suddenly as it started, it ended.... Only a faint hiss filled the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
     At that point, Zariel had no longer been able to keep silent. With great trepidation, she had asked Nandei, &quot;What could it have been?&quot; By way of answer, he continued the story.<br />
<br />
     &quot;She began to move towards the hiss, crawling slowly. As she stood, she was enveloped in a damp, clawing heat and was face to face with an enormous blood red eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Zariel had gasped and shuddered. &quot;Oh, no,&quot; she has whispered into the pause.<br />
<br />
     &quot;HA! Almost the same reply,&quot; Nandei said. &quot;How apt...hmm. The Light, as she had become known, fell to her knees...slowly the giant head turned to face her...2 deeply evil red eyes burned into her spirit. As she looked in the face of one of last of the great dragons she was revolted to realize something...this creature did not reflect light, it absorbed it. This dragon radiated darkness....just as she had witnessed others do, so many times before as she fought.<br />
<br />
      Zariel had shuddered again. &quot;A...a dragon? Like Vox, or Nagafen?&quot; But Nandei had been caught up in the tale.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Out of the shadows surrounding this great creature that the light believed to only of legend came what appeared to be a man, but unlike any man she had seen before.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Unable to contain herself, Zariel had burst out with, &quot;How so, brother? What was he like?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;This man stood encased in armor that, like that of his dragon steed, radiated darkness. As he moved his armor was unlike any she had seen; it moved as if alive...as if he and the armor were one and the same. This man of darkness stood a good head over her and stared. His eye had the glint of steel in a pool of blue...they appeared to be almost the only human thing about him. He refused to speak. He stood there, facing her, almost ready to strike.<br />
     &quot;The Light readied herself...she would not fall to the night's creatures! She looked into his blue eyes and asked, 'Who and what are you that can ride what men believe to be only a legend?'&quot;<br />
<br />
     There was another pause. Zariel broke in again. &quot;Who was he? Her nemesis?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;A voice that sounded like clashing steel said 'I am Darkness.' The Light was stunned. 'What? What is it you want from me? I have done you no harm!'<br />
     &quot;Once more he spoke..the sound almost visibly causing him pain. 'I am Darkness and I alone ride the night.'&quot;<br />
<br />
     Again Zariel had spoken, asking, &quot;The child...of Darkness and Light...but how?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;That is where my father's legend grows hazy. The elder in Faydark spoke of an epic battle between the two.... The Elder told me the battle raged for many days...neither the Light nor Darkness could hold the other down. As the battle raged on, The Night, as the dragon was known, watched. He had little care for<br />
the battles of men, but was bonded to Darkness with old magic. Both The Light and Darkness fought with the strength of many..both feeling their way was righteous.<br />
     &quot;Soon The Light tired of the battle and attempted to reason with Darkness...this was to prove a fatal mistake. She reached her arms out in a sign of faith and spoke to Darkness. 'I shall fight no more...I have never sought the path of death..let us end this.' She dropped her weapon and raised her head once more to look deeply into Darkness' eyes. Was there some hesitation in his eyes?<br />
     &quot;As she stood looking into those deep blue eyes, they appeared to fill with pain...his movements became wooden, almost as if he were fighting his very armor...one step at a time he edged closer, sword raised.<br />
      &quot;Still, the Light asked that they end this and go their ways. It would prove nothing to die this day...it was not her way...still he came closer...were those tears?<br />
      &quot;Once more he spoke, it was a voice of pure anguish. &quot;I am Darkness I alone ride the Night&quot;....then a scream! It filled The Light's heart with ice. <br />
      &quot;Then Darkness cried, &quot;END THIS ETERNAL NIGHT!&quot;'<br />
<br />
      &quot;At this point my fathers legend matches that of the Faydark Elder,&quot; Nandei had explained. <br />
     Zariel had not cared whose legend matched whose. &quot;What happened?  What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      &quot;Almost as one The Light and Darkness clashed....but sadly for The Light, so did the dragon Night. There was a flash of light, then a stark darkness, which slowly faded. And as the darkness faded, there grew a light. There lay The Light, a deep wound in her chest, almost cleaved in two with the force of Darkness' blow and the talon of Night. But Darkness was not unscathed. For in Night's furious attack, he had wounded his bonded kin Darkness. Darkness too lay dying, his life slowly ebbing away. The dragon Night remained. As we know, dragons are creatures of great magic. The Night was bonded to Darkness; if he died, the Darkness fate was unsure.<br />
       &quot;Darkness spoke with his dying breath. 'End the darkness, let the night give way to the light of the new dawn.' <br />
       &quot;This was an old time of great magic and the dragon Night knew what he must do.  He would end his bonded kin's pain and end his service to the forces of darkness.<br />
      &quot;With an almost gentle talon the dragon Night gathered the corpse of the Light and the near dead Darkness together. As the two opposites lay together, the dragon began to chant, an unearthly rumble deep with force and power. The power eddied around his enormous form, gathering in waves that few had seen, nor will ever see again!<br />
      &quot;At it's very peak Darkness' ended his life with the cry, 'Cry for the dawn's new light!'&quot;<br />
<br />
      &quot;And then?&quot; Zariel had urged.<br />
      &quot;That, Zarry, is a story for another time,&quot; Nandei had said. &quot;Get some rest, and I will tell you the next part soon.&quot;</div></div><hr />
