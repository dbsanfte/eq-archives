&quot;Dear EverQuest customer, <br />
Earlier this morning someone unsuccessfully tried to log into your account more than 15 <br />
times. It is our job at Sony to let the owner of the account know if someone had tried to <br />
log into the account 15 or more times unsuccessfully. <br />
In this situation we give the owner the choice to block the ability of changing the <br />
password for a day just in case the person is successful. <br />
To do this we need to verify that you are the original owner of the account. To do this we <br />
need: <br />
Account name: <br />
Password: <br />
<br />
If we do not get this information we will be forced to suspend the account until further <br />
notice. <br />
We are doing this for the safety of your account. Thank you and we are sorry for any <br />
inconvenience that this may have caused you. <br />
Sincerely, <br />
Thom  Terrazas<br />
Customer Service Manager <br />
Sony Entertainment <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">E-mailing him back wouldn't help - he would probably just sell your e-mail account to a list service. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faeeldora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">HAHA so start a new email account reply then delete the account...or use hotmail and then ditch the account hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diina Tyme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ahhh, but you all know as well as I that we share this game with a few of the most monumental wastes of flesh, water and teeth in the world. Some poor moron has fallen for this one, and then posts on Emarr the next day, &quot;XXXXXXX HACKED! :(&quot;. Gotta love the truly stupid, for who else will fall for the quarter glued to the table trick?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats even more sad that the person is scamming?  The fact that some people out there fall for it, but I guess there is one born every minute...or second as far as eq is concerned.  I guess the same sort of people that would fall for it are the same people that got the &quot;do not drink&quot; warning put on bottles of liquid paper.</div></div><hr />
