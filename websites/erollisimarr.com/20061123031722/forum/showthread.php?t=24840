		<div>A Rogues Story.... <br />
<br />
part 1. <br />
<br />
&quot;As i wonder thru these halls i can only imagine what lies ahead of me&quot; Amezka thought as she snuck thru the depths of Neriak's common place. Now we all know that as a wood elf being inside of the city of Neriak would often mean suicide for someone as young as Amezka. <br />
&quot;How did i end up here and why&quot; that is the only thought that rushes thru her mind as she makes her way to the hidden caves buried and long forgotten within the floors and walls of Neriak. <br />
<br />
Her job? simple , infultrate to the caves of Neriak and await for a messenger , a spy such as herself. It seemed like a simple task when Tilania Shadowwalker had givin it to her, now as she searches the endless miles of caverns she begins to think to herself , is this the smartest thing to do? <br />
<br />
Now getting even close to Neriak is not an easy task in its self but Amezka found a very magical way in. A way that may result in tragidy if she gets to careless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hail Amezka&quot; became a voice from behind her. Amezka froze in her tracks and wanted to hide. Yes hide and escape it all, but she coudnt.&quot;Even if i could pull it off&quot;amezka thought,&quot;The city guards would be alerted in no time at all and my only exit would be blocked trapping me here.&quot;Now as the steps came closer, Amezka begin to shake with fear as she fumbled with the strap on her sheath. As the person came closer Amezka Drew her dagger out but in the fright she dropped it to the ground. As she stood there frozen with terror waiting to feel the cold side of a blade enter her she heard a faint chuckle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should be more careful with them things&quot; the voice said. &quot;that voice , it seems so familier&quot; amezka thought. As Amezka turned to face the voice she felt a great relief as she saw a friendly face emerge from a shadow. &quot;Tyflon!&quot; she shouted, as she saw none other then the very blackguard who had taught her everything she has learnt as a rogue. &quot;Quiet now , remember we are not the most welcome people here and no telling how thin these walls are.&quot; &quot;I heard they was sending someone new but i was surprised that it was you&quot; said Tyflon.&quot;Well i guess business is business , we have to get you safely back out of here before anyone notices me gone.&quot; With that Tyflon reached into a small pouch around his waste and removed a scroll wrapped in an amber colored ribbon.&quot;Take this to Master Expin back in the City of Kelethin&quot; he said as he handed her the note.&quot;For your safety i wouldnt read it&quot; he said,&quot;The less you know, the better.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that Tyflon stepped back into the shadow's and just like that he was gone. As Amezka tucked the scroll safely into her sidepouch she began her slow walk back out thru the caves.As she stepped into the Foreign Quarters of Neriak she saw the guards running towards her and she was scared. &quot;Ive gota make it out of this city&quot; she thought as she stepped into a close shadow hiding herself. The guards never saw her , instead there attention was of that of a human trying to take advantage of there weak armour and kill em one by one. Unfortunatly once more guards join it is tragic. As Amezka begin moving in the shadow's closer and closer to the opening to the forest all she could think about was the human and the cry of his sword as he was swarmed with guards.&quot;If only there was something i could do&quot;she thought as she begin to weep to herself. <br />
<br />
Amezka was out of the city, but she still had a long adventure left to go. &quot; How can i do this alone&quot; she thought, as she made her way to the eastern commonlands.As the sun faded Amezka begin to weep again, now that she was safe she just wanted to let it out. Amezka sit down inside the tunnel made within the walls of the commonlands and cried as hard as she could. <br />
&quot;If only i could have helped him&quot; Amezka said outloud as once again she thought of the horrific cry of the human she saw earlier.</div>

		<div>part 2... <br />
<br />
<br />
As Amezka begin to calm down she noticed that she wasnt the only within the tunnnel , in fact it was a rather busy place. <br />
&quot;Oh how foolish I must look&quot; she thought as she begin to gather her items. Once she had all her personals back together, she stood up to begin her journey again. As she begin walking back out toward the tunnel's entrance she felt a bit of greed come over her. She had never understood the sudden impulses she got sometimes, she just understood that it was wrong. &quot;Escuse me&quot; she said as she bumped into a warrior walking with some friends telling of his latest battle.&quot;He wont miss this&quot;Amezka said as the warrior unknowingly kept walking. <br />
<br />
&quot; I could do this all day&quot; she thought as she was pickpocketing random people. Then she realized that she was on a mission something to do. For once she wasnt just another thieve or pranster, but now important.So once again she gathered herself and smiled as she turned back on the tunnel and headed off towards the Human city of Freeport. <br />
<br />
'GRIFFON!&quot; she heard someone shout. &quot;Run Griffon!&quot; again she heard it but it didnt register. It wasnt until she felt someone knock her down as they ran past her in panic did she realize what they was shouting. First thing she heard was the flapping of a giant pair of wings and the wind forming against her back. As she turned to face the creature she was deafened by its screetch as it begin to desend towards her. All she could do is pray someone would see her and help her. As the beasts razor sharp claw's came down on her all she could do is put her arms up in fear. &quot;Unbearable&quot; is all she could think to describe the pain in her arms as the flesh was ripped away. <br />
<br />
As the griffon begin to swoop around for its second attack she heard it. The sound of an arrow traveling towards her. <br />
As the griffon fall to the ground, the arrow buried deep in it, Amezka heard the source of the arrow. <br />
&quot;You ok?&quot; the ranger asked as he examined the griffons corpse removing bits and peices of it. &quot;No , but im alive&quot; Amezka said as she held her arms in pain. The ranger pulled a box from his bag and removed some bandages. &quot;Hold still&quot; said the ranger, &quot;this may sting alittle bit&quot;. With that he poured some alcohol onto one of the bandage's and pressed them very hard onto her arms. <br />
&quot;OUCH&quot; was all Amezka could say as the alcohol burned into her wounds. &quot;Better this then the alternative&quot; the ranger laughed as he patted his sword. Wouldnt wanna lose them arms from infection he joked as he helped her up.&quot;whats your name,&quot; asked the ranger? &quot;Amezka.. Amezka Arnakis of Kelethin&quot; she responded. As the ranger begin to walk away Amezka said what is your name? The ranger turned over his shoulder not missing a step and simply responded with one word. &quot;Jethal&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Amezka shouted trying to catch up to the ranger.&quot;Where are you heading to?&quot; As the ranger grinned he said &quot;anywhere but here&quot;. Amezka explained her situation and told of the tunnel's of neriak and of the human and guards. <br />
She wasnt wanting to leave her new company , perhaps it was nice to see a friendly face or perhaps she was scared of the attack earlier. <br />
&quot;Would you like to come to Kelethin?&quot; asked Amezka. &quot;I can only help you so far but i have a group of friends i will introduce you to that will help you on your journey's&quot; said Jethal.With that they both was silent and continued towards the city of men , the city known as Freeport.</div>

		<div>Part 3... <br />
<br />
As Amezka and Jethal walked towards the outer gates of Freeport Amezka couldnt do nothing but marvel at its structures , <br />
Back in her town they had to build in tree's as a defense from the surrounding Orc of Crushbone , but Freeport was different , <br />
it was strong. It had a wall for a defense atleast 15 feet high , much higher then any barbarian Amezka has ever heard of. <br />
The gates was guarded also by the strongest of the Freeport Militia could train. This city was , with exception of the rodent problem , magnificent. <br />
<br />
Once inside the great city Amezka noticed something else right off the bat. Besides Humans she noticed a wide varity of other races across norrath , she saw gnomes and dwarves , barbarians and Half elve's. She also saw races she thought was made up as charactors in childrens books to amuse young wood elves till they went to bed. These included a cat-like race called Vah-shir.&quot;Is that a.. a ogre?&quot;Amezka asked Jethal. &quot;Yes im afraid so&quot; Jethal said with a look of disgust on his face.&quot;The are such a vile creature they should all be wiped off the face of Norrath without a second thought.&quot; he said as he turned past a building and headed to an area with a stage. <br />
<br />
On the stage she saw a person playing a lute , it was a beautiful melody , it was simply stunning , the soft notes melting into one another. Amezka could listen to that all day , in fact it wasnt until the music stopped that she noticed Jethal had walked over to a waterfront. As Amezka walked over to meet the ranger, a shadowy figure stood up and Amezka stepped back alittle bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Relax&quot; said Jethal, &quot;this is someone i would like to introduce you to , Amezka meet Scarlet.&quot; Amezka was shocked almost angered to see a dark elf , after having her trainer , her friend stuck inside of Neriak. &quot;She's with us&quot;Jethal said, as he gave her a huge hug. &quot;How have you been M'lady?&quot; asked Jethal. &quot;Couldnt be better&quot;replied Scarlet. Amezka was still a little nervous about this dark elf though. &quot;What if she finds out about Tyflon&quot; thought Amezka. &quot;She will alert Neriak herself&quot; Amezka was begining to get scared again, so bad she wanted to run.&quot;What is wrong?&quot; asked Scarlet. &quot;N.n.nothing&quot; replied Amezka quietly.Now Scarlet was about as experienced person as one could be and she knew something was wrong. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ive got to relax,&quot; thought Amezka.&quot;I am going to go listen to the bard,&quot;she told to Jethal. As she walked away she could here Jethal start telling Scarlet the story about her seeing the human in neriak and about the griffon also.&quot;Poor thing&quot; Scarlet said,&quot;no wonder she was nervous around me&quot;. <br />
<br />
Amezka was once again lost in the bard's melody when she heard Jethal and Scarlet come up and sit down beside her. <br />
Scarlet asked Amezka,&quot;Do i make you nervous?&quot;&quot;A little bit&quot; Amezka again replied softly trying to refill her head with the bards magic song.With that Scarlet stood up and raised a hand over her head, Amezka was frightened,&quot;does she know &quot; was all she could think as she closed her eyes and waited for the pain. <br />
<br />
But ther was none. She waited longer and still none. &quot;It's ok,&quot; she heard Scarlet say. As Amezka opened her eyes she could not believe what she saw, the shadowy figure in which she was terrified of was gone. Instead now stood a Wood elf much like herself. &quot;How?&quot; Amezka thought. She saw it but it wasnt registering, she had only read about shapeshifters in books but now it's no longer a story she has met one. She had met an enchanter. <br />
<br />
As Amezka stared at Scarlet all she could mummer was the faint sounding words of &quot;thank you.&quot; She did not now why she said it or even if anyone heard her , but seeing the light toned face and cheerful smile of the wood elf gave her a warm glow , one she hadnt had since she set out on her mission from what she felt like had been ages. <br />
<br />
Within the moment Amezka noticed something else different, not within her or even within the enchanter,but everywhere. <br />
&quot;The music&quot; amezka said. &quot;Pardon&quot; said both Jethal and Scarlet. &quot;The music it has stopped.&quot; stated Amezka once again in a more clear voice she has had all day. As they to stopped to listen it was true the music was gone , the lute was gone and the bard was gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if i will ever here that song again?&quot; Amezka said as she turned back towards Jethal and Scarlet. &quot;Perhaps it is possible&quot; said Jethal as he cracked a smile. As he spoke he begin to look past Amezka he begin to laugh and shouted a name as he held a hand out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Freefloat!&quot; she heard Jethal say as he grabbed the bard and gave him a hug followed by a handshake.&quot;How have you been old friend?&quot;asked Jethal. &quot;Great&quot;said Freefloat. &quot;Just about ready to head out in another adventure&quot; Freefloat said jokingly.&quot;You better use more then that set of strings there if you wanna win a fight.&quot; Scarlet said playfully as she held up her hand as it glowed blue.&quot;Nah all i need is my strings.&quot; joked the bard. <br />
<br />
Amezka could not believe it for it was the same bard she had just watched for what felt like forever. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; Freefloat asked Amezka.&quot;Huh , oh its nothing just that song&quot;amezka said. &quot;Oh that ol' song i havent played that in the longest time.&quot; said Freefloat. &quot;Well i would like to hear it again sometime&quot; Amezka said as Jethal interupted ,&quot; Dont worry good chance you will , Freefloat here will be joining us till the Butcherblock Mountainrange. Amezka smiled. For once on her journey she felt like she belonged , like she had a family</div>

		<div>Part 4... <br />
<br />
&quot;This is where i leave you now&quot; said Jethal gathering up his bow and bag. &quot;Here take this,&quot; said Jethal as he handed Amezka a dagger wrapped in a leather sheath,&quot;You may need to use that later.&quot; And with that said Jethal ,Freefloat and Scarlet all disapeared into the busy city of Freeport. <br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot; thought Amezka. As she glanced up towards the now dimming sky , she realized that it was late, much later then it accually felt. &quot;Where is the Inn? &quot;Amezka said to herself looking around. As she entered the chambers of an Inn ,she closed her eyes and begin to let her mind wonder. Now late and only the candle was lighting the room all she could here was the sprinkling of a rain begining. The rain was soothing to Amezka , everything about it made her feel good , the sound of it hitting the roofs, the smell of it coming down , but most importantly it drove everyone inside. <br />
<br />
As Amezka was organizing her stuff and looking over her rich's from the day before in the tunnel she noticed again the scoll. <br />
&quot;Its all your fault!&quot; she yelled under her breath at the scroll.&quot;If it wasnt for you none of this would be happening to me. I would be home with friends and faces i know , i would not have been attacked by that griffon and i wouldnt have had to see the human....&quot; she stopped and just thought. &quot;Poor human.&quot; she said as she begin to cry softly again. <br />
<br />
As Amezka sat there she stared at the scroll and it seemed to stare back. She couldnt stop , she had to know, and one quick motion Amezka grabbed the scroll and began to read. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dearest Tilania , <br />
It is as we have feared , the crushbone clan of orcs now have an ally. <br />
Clan Crushbone and Neriak council have signed a treaty and are currently <br />
planning an attack on our city. We must not let them achive this goal , If Neriak <br />
is able to walk onto the forest of Faydark there may not be much that can stop <br />
them. Among the orc and dark elf there is also another enemy. The Ogre. <br />
I fear that our very existance is at stake and i only pray that this letter reaches you <br />
in time. <br />
<br />
Tylfon. <br />
<br />
Amezka saw it but she couldnt understand it. &quot;Orc with the Legion of Neriak&quot; she said. Now knowing the situation was more greater then she had expected, Amezka quickly gathered her things and the scroll and headed to the ocean front of Freeport. <br />
<br />
&quot;How long till the next boat?&quot;Amezka asked the port authority. &quot;The Antonious Bale will be arriving shortly&quot; he said with a smile. As Amezka stood there in the night she could feel the rain hitting her and for once it scared her. A guard was just getting off post when he saw her standing there.&quot;Where are you off to&quot; asked the guard. &quot;Butcherblock mountainrange&quot; she said and turned back towards the ocean.&quot;beautiful isnt it?&quot; the guard said as he sat down beside her.&quot;How even in the worst of storms there is always a ray of hope&quot; he said as he pointed to a break in the clouds revealing the bare night sky. <br />
&quot;Well it looks like your ride is here&quot; he said as he smiled and stood up. Amezka could not beleive the splendor of the ship it was marvleous. <br />
<br />
As the ship hit the harbor of butcherblock, Amezka saw a much different story then Freeport. First thing she saw was the size , a mere post with 4 or 5 buildings and an unguarded gate. As she stepped off of the docks she heard a noise from behind her. &quot;Filthy goblins&quot; she said as she watched it run past. The goblins that roamed around the mountain range was nothing of any danger , more like a rodent problem.As Amezka was making her way across Butcherblock she found another infestation. <br />
<br />
Cold. <br />
<br />
Its all she could feel as she felt an object smash into the back of her head. Then another only this time more fierce. <br />
Amezka could only lay as she was able to roll over with every ounce of energy she had to see her attacker.&quot;Filthy Ogre&quot; was the last thought she could imagine. <br />
<br />
Then she saw it , a bright light, but not the comfortable light you would imagine. No this light was of fire and brimstone and it was hot , very hot. That was the last thing she felt. Amezka could see her entire being racing infront of her eyes , she saw the face of her mother and father, faces of her friends too. Among them was her new friends from City of Freeport , The ranger was there as was the bard and chanter. As her last thoughts fell from her mind she heard one final sound. The cry of the ogre's defeat. <br />
<br />
As Amezka lay bleeding in the hot butcherblock sun , something happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get her feet&quot; a voice said ,&quot;get her out of this path.&quot; &quot;I..I couldnt stop it&quot; said another voice.&quot;Is it to late?&quot; asked yet another. <br />
Then in a swirling of magic and prayers was when the impossible happened. <br />
<br />
Amezka gasped and tried but she couldnt catch her breath. &quot;Choking&quot; she tried to say but her voice wasnt responding. <br />
With her eyes adjusting to the light she heard whispers amongst the now growing crowd around her. &quot;Dont crowd her!&quot; someone shouted. &quot;You will be ok,&quot; as a female helped Amezka to her feet. &quot;Was i... ?&quot; Amezka started to say. &quot;Never&quot; said the cleric knowing that if she heard the truth it would possibly do more damage.&quot; People have hard time dealing with death&quot; she though,&quot;especially if they know that it had emraced them.&quot; You're a priestess&quot; Amezka said to the stranger . &quot;Lueinu is what i prefer.&quot; The cleric replied happily. &quot;How can i ever repay you?&quot; Amezka asked &quot; And what about the Ogre? &quot; There is no need to repay me &quot; said Lueinu. &quot; Your safe now&quot; she said. &quot;The Ogre....&quot; Amezka said again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dead&quot; she heard a gruff voice coming from the back of the crowd. &quot;I saw it happen but it was so fast i couldnt stop em.&quot; <br />
With that she moved toward the voice to see who had tried to help her. &quot;Hello&quot; said the person smiling. &quot;How did you kill it?&quot; asked Amezka.&quot;Incerated it&quot; said the figure as he lifted up a hand and made a small flame in it smiling.&quot;What are you?&quot; Amezka asked , not careing that she was talking to a dark elf.&quot;Magician or mage if you wanna shorten it up &quot;he said smiling.&quot;Names Arkash by the way and you would be?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Amezka&quot; she replied. <br />
<br />
As Amezka stood up she saw the cleric getting upon a horse something on her bag caught her eye. &quot;That crest!&quot; Amezka said allowed.&quot;Pardon said the cleric looking down from the horse. &quot;That crest i have seen it before what is it.&quot; It is the crest of the Legion of Kithicor , a group of noble people that bond as one , a family. &quot;Jethal&quot; she said smiling , she now beleived in her mind that the cleric wasnt there by chance. Perhaps when Jethal said he would have people watching me on my way, he meant it more as an expression. <br />
<br />
As Amezka started walking back on her mission she felt a great sence of pride within herself. <br />
&quot;Hey wait up&quot; said the magician. <br />
&quot;I see you are heading to Gfay , i myself am heading that way would you like to go together? asked the mage. <br />
When Amezka heard these words her heart sank. &quot;Could he be moving to Crushbone&quot; without hesitation she asked.&quot;Where are you heading to?&quot; Arkash replied with a story of an ancient city filled with vampires.Amezka knew the place and she was glad that it was his destination. <br />
&quot;How long have you been away from Neriak?&quot;Amezka asked. <br />
&quot;Never even seen it&quot; Arkash replied. <br />
&quot;Never even seen it&quot;Amezka said back. <br />
&quot;Yes never even seen it , was born in these very mountains of butcherblock&quot; he said smiling and they continued on there way. <br />
<br />
Amekza was now happy , happy knowing that her new aquaintence was washed of all ties of Neriak and was alone , just like her.</div>

		<div>Part 5.... <br />
<br />
Amezka and Arkash walked for days thru the Butcherblock Mountainrange's as they pushed on towards the great forest of Faydark. Over this time Amezka begin to care for Arkash as a friend , deep down maybe more but she would not show it. <br />
Even if She wanted to show her growing feelings she couldnt, after all she was a wood elf and he was not.As they walked along now more closer then ever to the forest she tripped and fell. Feeling clumsy she was starting to get up when arkash offered her a hand. As there hands touched Amezka was flushed with feelings,&quot;What is come over me&quot; she thought. <br />
<br />
As she stood up she was lost in his eyes, the worlds problems faded away. But as she stared into his eyes she saw a shadow coming , and another. &quot;OGRES!&quot; she shouted. As Arkash turned around he saw a sword moving down and without thinking he grabbed Amezka and thru her out of harms way. For Amezka she didnt have time to react to what she was about to witness. <br />
<br />
Arkash's hands grew red, more red then the fire from a dragons breath. Arkash hurled a ball of fire at one of the Ogre's smoldering it instantly. But as Arkash summoned the fire the second time the second Ogre struck.Amezka could only watch in horror as the shine of a blade apeared thru the front of Arkash and his body fall to the ground. As the Ogre begin to move toward Amezka , Arkash climbed to his knee's and called forth the Ogre's attention. As the Ogre turned his attention back toward the mage, he began to chant . Amezka could not understand the language but it was somehow fueling Arkash , as the Ogre reached down to finish Arkash off the sky opened up and called forth bolts of pure lightning upon both himself and the Ogre. <br />
<br />
&quot;ARKASH!&quot; Amezka begin to scream as she ran over to his now limp body. &quot;Oh god why!&quot; Amezka shouted out in anger,&quot;Why now!&quot; she was holding his hand close and was hoping that a preist would come. She waited and waited but no one. Arkash was dead. Amezka was devstated. All she could do was lay there with his lifeless body and cry. As she sit there she felt a cold rush of wind coming from the south, she felt the rain begin. Her comforting rain , which now twice has been with death.&quot;Tunare herself must be saddened at the sacrifice he did.&quot; said a druid as he tried to comfort Amezka. &quot;If i only told my feelings&quot; Amezka said partly to herself and partly to the druid. &quot;Maybe he would have loved me back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but he did love you back&quot; the druid said ,&quot;For by the act of love alone would make a man sacrifice himself for the one he loved.&quot; <br />
And with that the druid gave her one last look and with a tear in his eye turned and left. &quot;I didnt even get to tell him goodbye&quot; she said as she continued her way back home.</div>

		<div>Part 6.. <br />
<br />
<br />
As Amezka wandered thru the great forest of Faydark she could not get the images of her adventure out of her head. <br />
So many things over a short period of time , she did not realize how she was still holding together.As she walked her mind drifted back to the human and Arkash , how she had been there for both the deaths and both times she could have done something but didnt. Her mind also drifted back to her new found friends under the crest of the Legion of Kithicor. <br />
<br />
Then she saw something familier , the great city of the high elf. She was releaved for this meant she was almost home. <br />
As a young wood elf she would enjoy hours running down to play with the high elf kids for it was something different and alot safer then her cities platforms. She saw the guards beam a smile at her as she passed. This gesture alone made her feel as home as ever. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome home.&quot; said one of the personal guarding the lifts outside the city. <br />
<br />
Amezka was home. She could not wait to see all her old friends and her family but she knew she had to wait. She had to find Tilania and hand her the scroll. Amezka found Tilania wandering around the rogue training hall and chatting with some of the other trainers. &quot;Welcome back Amezka,&quot; said Tilinia,&quot;good news i hope&quot; she said with a smile. <br />
<br />
Amezka handed her the scroll. <br />
<br />
Over the course of the next few months Kelethin was transformed from a humble, tranquil city to being prepared for a battle field.All lifts were stopped and blocked off. Only the druids was allowed out of the city and that was just to find food every now and then. <br />
<br />
Silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;All there ever is anymore is silence.&quot; thought Amezka. <br />
<br />
Then one day as Kelethin was preparing for a guard change it happened. <br />
<br />
One arrow from the woods below. All was silent. <br />
<br />
&quot;God help us all&quot; said a young ranger as he prepared his bow.</div>
