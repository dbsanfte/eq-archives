In the beginning.  Pt 1<br />
<br />
Ezra stood beside Rhystine. She could she he had the respect of his people... he had her respect. But she knew that destiny had more in store for the Children of Darkness than Rhystine was willing to take responcibility for. Perhaps he had grown weary. Perhaps he didn't want to grow soft, though she doubted he could. Perhaps he simply saw what Ezra knew all along; The world would one day be hers to control. <br />
<br />
Ezra actually felt sad, seeing Rhystine pass command of the Children of Darkness over to her. But that was only for a fleeting moment. She had an army to build and enemies to destroy. Ezra's cold, ice blue eyes surveyed the few chosen ones before here and she smiled. &quot;Yes my father,&quot; she thought to herself &quot;We will do your bidding.&quot;</div></div><hr />
