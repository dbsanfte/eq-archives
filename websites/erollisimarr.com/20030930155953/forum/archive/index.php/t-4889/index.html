<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gkarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw the sale on PA. So be warned that you will most likely lose your money if you buy this. There was a warning in this section from a few months ago about a player getting him ganked. In the post the poor guy got him back for a short time, but he was taken again. So just a warning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daveena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buy the account, strip it and delevel the sucker to 10!<br />
<br />
Let them gank it back!<br />
<br />
Bwahahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PrincessRazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Phalnors original owner here. If  you buy Phalnor you WILL loose your money that is a fact. The person who is responsible for stealing him away from Spyn yet again is now be handled with and soon Spyn will get is shammy back and if Phalnor isnt in the same order he was when Spyn lost him this time i will make sure he is reinbursed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darue Ivywood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yea..thats what I was thinking...<br />
<br />
Buy it &lt;cheap&gt; , strip it to nothing, and then bind him in a nice *spot*.<br />
<br />
hehe<br />
<br />
that will cure the ganking blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darue Ivywood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">oh..and why not post an in-game name of the ass-clown thats doing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PrincessRazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the in game name wouldnt help any he has sold that account as well. Just spread the word NOT to buy Phalnor or you will loose your money for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darue Ivywood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actually the in-game name would help if he sold that account as well. Chances are whomever bought THAT account will have the same fate as what was done allready with the other account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PrincessRazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Brodek was the person who has stolen the account but that account has been sold off. But your right that account is at stack to .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>brodek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let's get something straight here Razz. Kenneth Rice may have played the game but he sure didn't pay for it. I owned the account and therefore it is mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PrincessRazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Whatever Steve Rice i really didnt want to get involved with this but i think its BS. Yes you bought him the account yes you may have paid for a few months of the account i say YAY your a great brother but come on that dosnt give you no right to steal it away from someone who bought if off of Ken. Ken did the work and Ken made Phalnor worth what he got off him. <br />
<br />
Steve I hope we can all get past this because its BS.  And i am sorry i got involved but you had no right to fook over Spyn. <br />
<br />
As for Brodek i dont think any one has a thing to worry about Steve isnt a bad guy and i think that account is safe.<br />

Quite a story you got here.  Sorry, I know it's not a laughing matter, but I can't help myself after all the years.  Too funny<br />
