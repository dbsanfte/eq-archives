<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gaspen moonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The hustle and bustle. The noise and crowds. The sells and buys. All this and more can be found in the eastern parts of the commons off freeport. The rocky cliffs echo the pitches of the sellers as it cascades to the plains off it. Shouts of leather goods, the calls of buying jewerly, and the signs showing what can be bought at the best price...guarenteed of course. Though farther out from the cliffs as you get to the west side of the commons you come across a sort of plaza of buildings. Inns,shops, and bars/cafes are located here. In the humid sunny day of the hustle and bustle gaspen sits at a table under shade writing away. At this part of the commons few come buy selling their stuff but you do get your share of business people coming through. Gaspen continues on writing looking about at the scene of busy people come and go. Then someone comes up to gaspen and greets him.<br />
&quot;Hello&quot;,she says in a happy manner.<br />
&quot;Hello&quot;,gaspen replies.<br />
&quot;May I sit down?&quot;<br />
&quot;Go ahead&quot;,gaspen says as she sits down at the table he is at.<br />
&quot;Do you remember me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Should I?&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess not...&quot;,she replies somewhat saddened at his response. Gaspen writes abit more then puts the pen down.<br />
&quot;Well if you want I'll play along with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;No...thats ok I don't want that, if you dont' remember me then thats better then going along.&quot; With a pause after that gaspen smiles,&quot;You're silly namnam.&quot;<br />
&quot;You do remember me!&quot;,namia states as she goes over and hugs gaspen.<br />
&quot;Now how could I forget my guardian angel now hmmm&quot;,gaspen states as they both smile. Namia sits down and nods at his statement.<br />
&quot;I'm just surprised that you would remember me.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can I forget you....you're papa!&quot; Namia says this with a slight chuckle as she says the word papa. It had been something she had called gaspen for a long time considering she always looked up to him and was a good friend to him during some rough times.<br />
&quot;How true....&quot;<br />
&quot;Well it is you've always been there for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I believe it is the other way around namnam.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok ok we've been there for each other.&quot; Gaspen looked around and got another cup of chocalate and got something for namia. She drank from her cup and looked around and then looked back at gaspen,&quot;So tell me how has the guild treated you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Good&quot;,gaspen replied.<br />
&quot;Thats good, I'm glad after all the stuff you went through....&quot;,namia responded with the last of the words trailing off as she remembered some of those things. Gaspen picked up his cup and took a sip and namia saw the ring on his finger and then spoke.<br />
&quot;Ooooh thats a nice ring is it for something or maybe from someone special?!?!&quot;<br />
Gaspen looked at the ring and replied,&quot;Yes its a special ring.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can I see?&quot;<br />
&quot;Go ahead&quot;,gaspen said as he held out his hand and she took it and looked at the ring closer.<br />
&quot;Its beautiful.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes and so is she.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh who?&quot;<br />
&quot;Calinie&quot;,gaspen said as he started spinning the ring. <br />
&quot;Hmmm not sure I know who that is, did I ever meet her?&quot;<br />
&quot;No you left for your travels before I meet her.&quot;<br />
&quot;She must be someone special&quot;,namia spoke knowing gaspen for a long time.<br />
&quot;Yes she is...I still do wear this ring&quot;,he responded pointing to it.<br />
&quot;Where is she?&quot;<br />
&quot;I have no idea.....not exactly sure been rough times the past weeks.&quot;<br />
&quot;Awwww&quot;,namia replied hearing what was in gaspen's voice and knowing pretty well after all she was his close friend during the council days and even after.<br />
&quot;Anyways enough of me&quot;,gaspen stated as he stopped turning the ring,&quot;How has your travels been?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well they've been good, its good to see you again thought you had left and I've missed you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Its good to see you too namnam.&quot; They drank their drinks and looked out into the crowd, it had been a long time since these two close friends had sat and talked, she had been there for him in those times and he helped her with her druid skills and overall ability of life. She broke the slience first.<br />
&quot;Maybe one day I'll be able to meet this special lady calinie.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe, it would be nice if you could meet her she is very nice and..&quot;<br />
&quot;I know papa she is very special to you I see that&quot;,namia said basically finishing his sentence for him.<br />
They spent the rest of the afternoon just talking catching up with what was goign on and soon enough gaspen would leave for duty called him and he said his goodbyes and was off.<br />
The hustle. The bustle. The buying and selling. The meeting of a old friend. <br />
<br />
