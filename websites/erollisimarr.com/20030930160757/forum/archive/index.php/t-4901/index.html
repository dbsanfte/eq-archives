<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doug50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If your interested in buying a 55 monk acount don't buy it from Ijac, &quot;sold his acount&quot; to a friend of mine, for 55k. My friend changed the pass word, but there is a PW recovery system that soney has, all you have to do is know the  date of birth , area code, and email of the person who registered the acount and *poof* instant changed PW, anyway i'm guessing thats what Ijac did.   My friends not posting this because he says &quot;55k really isnt that much money to me&quot;, but I'm not doing this for him, I'm doing this so that Ijac can't do this to anyone else.<br />
<br />
Just stating the facts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enbekay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That monk has an ironic name.  I Jack...  Jack meaning steal from where I grew up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Opalla Shadowpixie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A warrior called Lances in my guild sold the Ijac character quite recently because he had another higher level monk on another account also,<br />
Ijac is now owned by some member of Crimson Eternity, forgot the name of the person he gave to me,<br />
Lances no longer has anything to do with ijac, and has not got the account back (he wasnt origional owner of the account anyway, so dont see how he could). If your friend has problems, speak to Lances (he isnt the type to scam anyone) since he may know the origional owner of ijac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colmillo Icelander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yoora also knows the original owner of Ijac in RL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ijac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am the orignal owner of Ijac the one eyed Monk.<br />
<br />
I have not had that account in almost 2 years, and I don't have it now.  I did not give any other information when I sold it other that the password.  So..........<br />
<br />
Anyway thats all I have to say about that.  You don't need to bother Yoora or any one else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>haifuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not trying to start any bad mojo with anyone, if you are the original owner, perhaps you should get the account back from Verant and *gulp* delete the character so this person can no longer scam people with it...Just a thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colmillo Icelander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">any way I can get in touch with you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dwarkarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok something fvcking funky is going down here and I smell bullshit. The account has been owned by the same person for at least two years, I used to talk to Ijac all the time but then suddenly in the last month or two had no contact whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I don't know any other information than the above, the sacamming bullshit needs to stop but hey if you buy a char then you gots to be prepared to be scammed, no sympathy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dewstreehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For the record the account ijac is not owned by anyone in crimson eternity.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dwarkarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But Ijac did used to be in Crimson Eternity no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dewstreehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The original one yes, but he has been long absent from the guild for many months</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>helius wallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ijac was auctioning his account via auction a week or so ago. I just thought I'd mention I reported and petitioned him. Had I known this was not a scam, I probably would have over looked it. . . but anyway, I hope he is banned by now. They caught Blytzz so quickly, you'd hope they can catch this fool faster. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Armagnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Ijac was in Anam Kara, the original one. He plays Ninnin a level 60 wizard now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Athalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your one to talk about scamming people Dwark. When we were all in the same guild I loaned you 10k so you could buy something and raid with us one night and all I have heard from your lame ass since is &quot;This is not the same guy, it's a friend of mine&quot;. <br />
<br />
The original Ijac I knew 2 years or so ago was a good guy. He got rid of his accounts about the same time I did. Not likely he's involved in all this. <br />

<br />
<br />
Ahh finaly the fucktard crawls back from the innards of his trailer and decides to throw another weak salvo my way.<br />
<br />
Not once have you tried to contact me regarding the return of said money, not once have I seen you online to be able to return said money and yes I constantly check for you. As far as &quot;This is not the same guy, it's a friend of mine&quot; well all I can say is how is your PCP habit going? The only one that plays my character is me, not one other fvcking person, do you like to make up stories as a proffesion or is it just a hobby for you.<br />
<br />
These imaginary tells you keep sending me are quite amusing, seeing as I have never seen one. Secondly since I never see you online to send you a tell, I have never recieved one email from you trying to decide a time to meet to make the transaction. I have made the effort in looking for you but if you are not online then I cannot complete the transaction. <br />
<br />
Are you sure you are logged on to Emarr when you send me these supposed tells or are you just fvcking braindead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Athalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I must admit that finding me in the last 6-8mos would be pretty hard since I haven't played since then. I did post on the Affliction web sight quite a long time ago and left my email for you to contact me. I was even told by another member that it was moved to the members only area so it might actually get read. I have talked to you IG a few times about it but in the end just wrote it off.<br />
<br />
I just find it ironic that you talk so much trash here when you have pulled a few scams yourself.</div></div><hr />

How is he suppose to pay you if your not online?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I really think you need to get online the same time with Dwark before calling him a scammer. How you suppose to pay one back if they aren't online?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dwarkarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I must admit that finding me in the last 6-8mos would be pretty hard since I haven't played since then.

<br />
The Affliction website? I have never been a member of Affliction so posting there would have done zero good.<br />
<br />
It's quite pathetic how you come here accusing me of scamming even though you admit yourself there was no way for me to pay the money back to you in the last 6-8 months, and believe me I have been looking for you for longer than that. Ahh yeah then there is those /tells you supposedly sent me ummm yeah right.<br />
<br />
 I have talked to you IG a few times about it but in the end just wrote it off.<br />
<br />
Not once did you talk to me in game about it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry to disappoint you but I have never pulled a scam, well unless of course you consider not being able to pay someone because they are never online a scam.<br />
<br />
I noticed you accusations are plural now and not singular, care to provide details of these other supposed scams? Or are you just making sh|t up as usual?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/e believes Dwark a hell of a lot more than some guy who has only posted here 43 times..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Alethia Telecontar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've only posted here I THINK going on 3 times. Gonna believe me? ;) <br />
<br />
Sorry just starting shiat and showing how that's not a good basis on whether to believe someone or not. I don't believe him for the simple fact he sounds like he has no clue and doesn't even know what guild Dwark and them were supposedly suppose to be in together. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">True...but I also consider Dwark and you my friends, and I've never heard of this other guy in the last 2 years I've been playing.</div></div><hr />

Thyne, do us a favor a post some more if it's a big issue.  Which I personally I believe it is.  55k is a lot no matter who you are.  I know some level 60's as poor as level 5's thanks a lot to no drop gear.<br />

<br />
Some people, unlike you, me, Dwarkarn and a few others, have better things to do than post here =P<br />
<br />
Some people are too shy to post here.<br />
<br />
Some people couldn't give a rat's ass either way.<br />
<br />
Understood?</div></div><hr />
