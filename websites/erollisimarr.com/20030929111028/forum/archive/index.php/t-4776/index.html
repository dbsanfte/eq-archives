<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bdaabin Buultengrind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">An acrid odor wafts through the air as the tiny door is opened, mixing with and overwhelming the slight loamy smell in the hallway.  Inside a flame sputters, sending shadows dancing across the walls and revealing a sturdy wooden table in the center of the room.  Objects in the room are revealed by the flickering light, half glimpsed images of glass jars holding oils and powders, animal parts sitting in bowls, and metallic implements of ancient design clutter the table and nearby shelves.  The wooden table itself is stained and burned, attesting to it's durability and age.  It has been used by generations of mages in the Buultengrind family and is now in the service of Bdaabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blasted inefficient lighting, these candles, I don't know why I bother with them.  I suppose they do serve a dual purpose. Controlled heat sources are needed during the mixing, wouldn't you agree Jobann?&quot;<br />
<br />
As with most of their conversations, Bdaabin's pet remained as silent as the rocks from which he was formed.  He did, however, turn to face the little gnome and seemed to bob in affirmation.  Even though not needed in the safety of Ak'anon, a pet is still a welcome companion in what would otherwise be a lonely pursuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good.  Have a seat my friend.  There are no enemies within these walls.  You may rest here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words from Jobann sounded like the rumble of a distant avalanche, &quot;Changing position master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bdaabin turns to place the object he was carrying on the table.  It is not another candle, but rather a device of gnomish design.  It appears to consist of metal rods, tubes and a bottle with knobs attached.  A few turns of the large knob elicits a clicking sound deep within the bottle.  With an adjustment of a smaller knob near the neck of the bottle, a flame appears but burns brighter than any mere candle or lantern could achieve.  The workroom is bathed in light as bright as the midday sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better.  Wonderful things you can do with Firewater and a few spare parts.&quot; he says to no one in particular.<br />
<br />
He clears a spot on the table and removes a book from his pack.  The book is similiar in appearance to the spell books carried by all casters in Norrath, with one exception:  its size.  The book would appear large in a humans hands, in the hands of a gnome, it is gigantic.  After struggling with the book for a moment, he places it on the table near the light and opens it.  The pages are yellowed and crisp but protected by a thin sheen of magic.  Inscribed on the pages are runes of such power and complexity, they could drive an untrained person mad.<br />
<br />
Bdaabin mutters to himself while perusing the pages, occasionally shouting in surprise at the revelations contained within.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I see, I see.  Yes, that makes some sense.  However...hmmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turns to Jobann and says &quot;With any luck, my friend, I will be able to give you a more powerful form the next time I call you.  And, if I am reading it correctly, I will be able to call your brothers from the other realms.  It will take some practice though...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jobann watches in silence.<br />
<br />
Bdaabin begins searching his packs and rummaging through the shelves, retrieveing items and arraying them around the book.  During the entire process he mutters The Words...barely perceptible to the ear but entirely obvious to the eye as he is surrounded by the glowing embers of magic.  They are merely preparatory phrases taught to every mageling, but they place the mind in the proper alignment with the energies being harnessed.<br />
<br />
His hands leave a lingering glow behind them as the selected items are placed on the table.  Each item seems to glow with it's own unique light as his hands pass nearby and then fade as he moves away.  <br />
<br />
The cadence of The Words increases as the little gnome refers back to the book.  He picks up a sheet of zombie flesh and places it on a blank sheet of parchment.  There is a brief glow as the skin bonds to the page, infusing it with its power.  A little bit of ground Bloodstone, mixed with oil from wasp wings and the ink is ready.  He carefully selects a quill from a nearby jar and dips it into the mixture.  The quill begins to shimmer in the steady light of the gnomish lantern.  <br />
<br />
A shower of sparks erupts when the quill tip touches the parchment and words of power are inscribed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Azia!&quot;, and the rune is complete.<br />
<br />
There is a fresh, sharp smell in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!  Not bad, eh Jobann?&quot;, he asks showing the rune to his pet.<br />
<br />
The process is repeated, using raw-hide armor instead of flesh.  Ground Onyx and spiderling silk oil make the ink.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Beza!&quot;, and the companion rune is complete.<br />
<br />
Bdaabin grins in amusement as he moves the two runes near to each other.  The runes glow brighter as they approach the other.  When separated, the glow subsides.<br />
<br />
He carefully places the first rune on a blank page in the book, then lowers the second onto the same page.  The flash of light brings sudden understanding, the process is a little clearer, the way a little more sure now.  A smile of satisfaction fills his countenance.<br />
<br />
Bdaabin quickly gathers his equipment and turns to leave the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along my friend, I need more components and your services will be invaluable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Following Master.&quot;, Jobann rumbles and slowly turns to follow the little mage out of the room.</div></div><hr />
