*********************************<br />
<br />
Walkin through the morning dew I could almost see this place as home, but it was not. It was a place that was dark and cold, one that I had not before entered but now was forced to. I had no wish to be here, yet I stayed anyway. I had no choice. This was the place I was to meet my mentor, the one they called Lithiano, the one that would soon teach me the ways of those hated, those dispised by all others of Norrath. I had wished to learn for so long but none would teach me, none would tell me the ways of Innoruuk for I was not of their kind. <br />
<br />
Although able to show myself as one of the Tier-dal, I was not, and they knew it. To this day I can not be sure of what it is about me that makes them know that I am not one of them. Even in dark elven form they can pick me out of a crowd as one that is not of true blood. My father, being the Tier`dal that he was, taught me the ways of Innoruuk as best he could, but he was not able to tell me all that I wished to know as he died when I was very young. My mother, a half elf, attempted to bring me up in the ways of Bristlebane. For a while I tried to believe, I tried to follow in her footsteps, but unfornatnately I knew the truth. There was no other than the Father, the God of Hate, Innoruuk himself. <br />
<br />
Now I would finally learn what I wished to know, the truth of hate. I wished to bring my gift to the ones they called Cimmerii, the people of Shadow, those blessed by Innoruuk and feared by their own kind. They were to teach me the ways that I had so longed wished to know and hopefully I would aid them in their quest to bring Norrath back to the one true God. As a minstel I hoped to carry the word of Innoruuk to the far reaches of the globe and show those other fools what they have yet to learn.<br />
<br />
Suddenly breaking out of my flashback I proceeded onwards into the mist. Under the canopy of trees it was even darker than before. How anyone could see well in this place I did not know, I hoped this was one skill that this Lithiano would teach me. I knew nothing of this Tier`dal, except what was included in the letter brought to me the night before. The messanger appeared in my bedroom at the inn early this morning as if out of thin air. He said nothing, only handed me the letter and disappeared.<br />
<br />
The letter said simply: <br />
<br />
You are to meet me at the entrance to the great city of Neriak, if you are able to make it that far, you are worthly to learn from us. - Lithiano of The Cimmerii<br />
<br />
As I crept though the forest I hoped that the illusion would fool the guards posted all around, I had not attempted this before but I had been told that I would be safe, it had yet to be seen. As I approached the bridge they did not turn or even seem to see me. As I watched a young Tier`dal cross the bridge I noticed that the guards ignored him as well. I decided to chance it. Crossing the bridge and entering further into forest the guards also ignored me. &quot;Safe&quot; I thought. &quot;Now, to get to the entrance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Following the path I eventually found the place that I sought, looking like a simple hole in the rock, I knew this to be the hidden entrance to the dark elven city, the place that I had sought for so long. I saw no one as I cautiously entered the tunnel, the place seem deserted, even the guards were not in evidence. &quot;Odd&quot; I thought to myself. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, out of the shadows, a female Tier`dal, dressed fully in beautiful blue armor, appeared. She took one step towards me and drew her twin swords. In a menacing voice she said &quot;Speak your name and you might survive this encounter pale-one&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the bard, the one they call Arithana, the one that was called to this place by Lithiano of the Cimmerii&quot; I said, trying not to show my fear. It was obvious that she was a trained fighter, one of extreme talent...she was not one that I would want to have to fight, I did not believe that I would win.<br />
<br />
Nodding slightly she placed her swords back in their scabards and took two powerful steps towards me. She now stood only inches from me. Although over a foot shorter than I, she was a most imposing and impressive figure. &quot;I am the one they call Lithiano Kai`ahna&quot; she said &quot;I am the one that had sought you. You have made it this far and thus deserve my attentions. I have been told that you wish my assistance, and that of my brotherhood, in learning the one true way. Is this correct pale one?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and replyed &quot;I am Arithana, I have sought long and hard for training from those of the true god. It is an honor to meet you Lady Lithiano&quot; Kneeling before her I inclined my head and carefully examined the ground. &quot;I am yours to command Lady of the Dark&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning towards the entrance of the city she indicated that I should rise and follow her. &quot;Come Arithana, for you have much to learn, and it is time to being your training.&quot;</div></div><hr />
