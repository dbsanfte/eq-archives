<br />
Anyway. Here's what happend. I was auctioning &quot;WTB Thurg BP MQ&quot; And I got a tell from a girl called Dadani, saying her RL friend was selling one. I asked how much he wanted, and she said bout 50k. I offered 55k. She said she was gonna call him and ask if that was cool. He said sure. I was told that his roomate was gonna log his char on for him, cuz he was at work... <br />
<br />
<br />
I hooked up with Sanornik in Thurg. Here's the log. Read it for yerself<br />

Are there anything that can be done about this? And I know I'm a total loser for trusting this guy. Thought it would never happend to me. I've always been carefull about that stuff. I just wanted that BP a bit too much.<br />
