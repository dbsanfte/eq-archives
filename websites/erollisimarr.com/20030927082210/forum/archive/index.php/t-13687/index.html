<br />
Received this in an e-mail today and thought it worthy of mention.All,<br />
<br />
The FBI, ******** Division has sent an official notification of a pager/cell phone scam.  <br />
<br />
Please take note of the following information. A Government agency was recently alerted to the following phone/pager scam. For anyone who has a pager and/or cell phone, DO NOT ever dial area codes 809, 284 or 876.<br />
<br />
SCAM:<br />
You will receive a message asking you to call a number beginning with area code 809.  The reason you're asked to call varies from a family member who is ill, to someone who has been arrested, died, you won a wonderful prize, etc.  In each case, you are told to call the 809 number right away.  Since there are so many new area codes these days, people unknowingly return these calls.  If you call from the Continental U.S. (CONUS), you hear a long recorded message designed to keep you on the phone as long as possible.  While you are listening, however, you are apparently being charged CIRCA $2425 per minute.  As an example provided by Verizon, when you get your phone bill, you will be charged more than $24,100.00.<br />
<br />
WHY THE SCAM WORKS:<br />
<br />
The 809 area code is located in the British Virgin Islands (the Bahamas).  809 area code can be used as a &quot;pay-per-call&quot; number, similar to 900 numbers in CONUS.  Since, however, 809 is out of CONUS, it is not covered by U.S. regulations regarding 900 numbers, which require that you be notified/warned of charges and rates involved when you call a &quot;pay-per-call&quot; number.  There is, also, no such requirement that the company provide a time period during which you may terminate the call without being charged.<br />
<br />
It is important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since trying to fight the charges afterwards can become a real nightmare.  If you complain, both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved since, in fact, you did actually place the call.  Company policy is likely to be that they were simply providing the billing for the foreign company.  You will end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  Forewarned is forearmed.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the warning, but JESUS fucking CHRIST STOP with the hailing!  <br />
<br />
You know, as annoying as the hailing may or may not be, your use of profanity in direct connection to the name of Jesus is extremely offensive.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is a common abbreviation for continental united states.  Used more in government agencies (ie military) than any other place however.</div></div><hr />

Thread derailment police here.<br />
<br />
I love it when I see a religious mention and it turns into a flame-fest.  <br />
<br />
Add a log here---  How would 'Jesus' react to a response of 'Burn in hell' to another human.  What difference is that to the F** used with 'His' name?<br />
<br />
Pure Unitarian (all hail the big ???)  speaking here, so school me on this.<br />

Thanks!<br />

<br />
The facts behind it are somewhat true...<br />
<br />
The whole FBI alert part is a hoax.<br />
<br />
CONUS = Continental US<br />
OCONUS = Outside Continental US</div></div><hr />
