 I am about the 10th or so operator of he account Morphius a 60 High Elf, epic, Enchanter was on. Yesterday I attempted to log on, and found out the password was changed. The account is out of the bounds of my control, and just wanted to let everyone know Morphius is being played by a fraud if he is ever on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lurikeen MaliKyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting. Why would you be reporting that here if you are &quot;the 10th or so operator of he account Morphius&quot;?<br />
<br />
Why aren't you calling Sony customer service and reporting that your account has been compromised? Sony will lock down your account quickly. All you have to do is prove it is really yours by providing CD key and billing information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>myzterys Unsolved</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">:( man why they always got to go after the good enchs :(<br />
<br />
sorry man !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kordail Kneebasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lurikeen are you slow?<br />
<br />
He's the 10th owner, meaning hes not the original, meaning he doesn't have CD Keys and billing information.<br />
<br />
He's posting here to let people know the guy who has him now stole him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elnots Sadnes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hahaha! kord you're thick!<br />
<br />
Sony frowns seriously on anyone who sells their account.<br />
<br />
If he went through the proper channels his account would be banned from any usage because what he was doing was illegal in the first place.<br />
<br />
What Lurikeen is hinting at is that its a dangerous business, and if you get burned, there's no one you can turn to for help except to exact revenge upon whoever stole it by telling Sony and having the account &quot;destroyed&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kordail Kneebasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So how do you prove to Sony you had the account when you don't have original billing info or CD keys?<br />
<br />
Sony doesn't give a rats ass about the selling of accounts, they just say its against policy so they don't have to give customer support to mental midgets who don't know how to do it correctly and get scammed.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I've bought and sold more accounts than I care to remember.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Elnots, Verant doesn't &quot;destroy&quot; accounts.  Hell they hardly ever ban people for buying and selling account unless its causing a serious problem and stuff.  They want your 13 bucks a month.  Trust me, they very rarely &quot;destroy&quot; an account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Koreanz-DW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What the guy needs to do is call SOE and tell them that his account got hacked, they will look at the billing of the account and close it.<br />
<br />
Same thing happened to me when i first started, i ebayed some 26 or so druid and messed around with him, when i called SOE about the account being compromised, they closed it due too much &quot;activity&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cleptor Maniacle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Having brought a shaman up from 1 to 50 on a single account, which shared the account with my main, I wanted to move him to his own.  <br />
<br />
So I rush out and buy all the CD's (expansions galore).  Some 55 US dollars later I get home and fill out the online goodies to get the account set up with Sony/VI.  I cackle with glee as I see a fresh account waiting for my shaman to be moved to the new account (as they had just allowed the moves to take place by paying an additional $50).  Once the account was verified I rush out to the website for the move and fill it out completely.  <br />
<br />
I then wait for 3 weeks and begin to wonder whats going on, as I've seen 2 friends get their characters moved in a week or less. Not to mention my credit card was already charged for the move.  So, I call support.  They get all the details and tell me they will investigate.  The next day my main account is locked, my new fresh account is locked, and two other accounts that I owned (as the original owner) are both locked.  At this point I'm RAGING MAD.<br />
<br />
I call support once again.  This time I am told that because my main account was not &quot;always my account&quot; they decided to lock down all accounts that my current credit card has paid for.  I am baffled.  Then I realize that because on my previous card my name was list as &quot;first initial middle name  last name&quot; versus &quot;first name middle initial last name&quot; as it appears now they think it's two different people.  So I call and have to escilate this up about 3 levels before the person understands that CREDIT CARDS change every 5 years or less (as they freaking expire).  After waiting two weeks and getting a great tan while doing yard work, I get an email with an apology and am informed that they should be active again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moral of the story.... they WILL ban/lock an account down and force the person trying to play the thing to prove they are supposed to be playing on that account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viviblue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">my RL friend at school bought that acct off of player auctions and xfered the enchie to fennin ro so nothing you can do now.  and i better tell my friend b4 the original owner takes the acct back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jarezath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thanks for letting me know the account was bought and transferred, at least that puts my thoughts to rest. please have your friend email me, tjisyourgod@hotmail.com if you even read this again...im of course in no way gonna try and have him give me back morphius or anything, especially since in the transfer he lost all equiptment, including epic, jboots, gm jewelers eyeglas....sigh. but im very glad i know what happened to him, a tell in game would do to, i just want to talk to the current owner/operator. thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know &quot;ebayed freaks&quot; who play the character better than the original.  So dont be so quick to bash ebayers.  But i have also met some real idiots.  All I am saying is dont be so all inclusive in your statements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sheahay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Question?  Why did you not change your passoword and credit card info when you got the account?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Freezingfists</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">when my friend bought the account he transfered it to another server using Legends so it kept all the stuff when i told him that it was stolen and that the original owner has a tendency of stealing it back he sold it to someoen else and 2 weeks later the orig owner stole the account back.  My friend made the 100k off of kei he needed b4 he got rid of it though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Langree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So your friend sold it with the knowledge that the original owner would in all probability take it back?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Viviblue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">my friend was going to sell it sooner or later b4 he knew that it was going to get stolen back he just sold it earlier and got his money back basically.  And I dont care what I did in the game considering it WAS A GAME!!!  I dont understand how u can get pissed off at me over a game all I ever did was sit in EC and sell shit.  Everything else that people said I did was a lie.  I never harrassed anyone, I never scammed anyone, I never led a Naggy raid.  Considering I only went on like 2 naggy raids and 2 vox raids while I played I dont know where people get that I was leading one.  That one iksar guy Raktiz was leading that raid he wasnt gonna let me even go on it at first because I wasn't lvl52 then he ended up letting me go because i went and got his corpse.  So just because i was in the main group doesnt mean i was leading the raid.  All you people who think that I was leading that raid were misinformed lol.  If I was leading the raid how come I wasn't the one who took everything off of naggy?  It was Raktiz who looted everything and went LD because HE was the one leading the raid.  And for the like 100th time the little firepot thing that people said I was trying to do isn't what you guys think it was.  I came back from like a month vacation from the game and i had a backpack full of stuff that I wanted to sell so I sat in back far back corner of the tunnel on the fire back there.  I was on 56k at the time and I lagged really bad at shady so I went back and sat down in the corner.  I shouted that I had a bag of stuff in the back of the tunnel on the firepot and waited for people to show up.  A couple people showed up when they ran up I would jump off of the pot and show them my gear.  Someone sent me a tell after I shouted a couple more times and said that sitting on the firepot was a new scam so I said O im sorry im gonna move to shady then.  So I moved to shady and that was the end of it I thought.  Someone sent a tell to my guildleader and didn't bother to send me a tell.  So i change my shout and continue to sell at shady.  About 5minute later I get a tell from my guild leader asking me why I was trying to scam people and why I was still selling on the pot.  I told him that I was selling at shady and I didn't know that sitting on the pot was a new scam.  I told him that the second that someone told me that it was a scam I moved off of the pot.  A little later I ended up finding that the person that sent a message to the guild leader after the first shout I made was someone in my guild that was on an alt.  So to clear things up for no apparent reason the only thing I ever did was sit in EC and sell my stuff.  If you aren't going to believe me o well I don't play the game anymore I have no reason to lie to you.  I dont even understand where all these people got all of this stuff that they said about me considering 90% of the stuff they said couldn't have happened considering that I was sitting in EC selling stuff.  Well I'm off now I have better things to do with my life than to play EQ.  Have fun playing the game and GL to everyone.  This is the truth and nothing but the truth I have no reason to lie to you guys.  I don't play the game anymore so it's not like I have to lie to save the rep that was already ruined for no reason.  If you don't believe me thats your choice to make but for future reference know that this is the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Langree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">my friend was going to sell it sooner or later b4 he knew that it was going to get stolen back he just sold it earlier and got his money back basically. <br />
<br />
Doesn't change the fact that you..oh I mean your friend sold it KNOWING it would most likely be taken back. Makes you.. I mean your friend no better then the original owner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>OriginalMorphius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">so I figured I would come here and provide some info about Morphius.<br />
<br />
1) I played Morphius from 1 - 60.   <br />
<br />
2) I was not the original owner of that account.  I used to play a game called Realm and traded my old Realm account for the EQ account in '99.  The original account had a low level character on a different server.  She traded me the account because she said EQ gave her motion sickness.<br />
<br />
3) I haven't taken the account back, ever.<br />
<br />
4) I doubt the original person did either, since I played the account from Aug/Sep '99 until I sold it before SoL came out and never had any problems.<br />
<br />
5) Velious completely sucked for enchanters so I made the decision to try something else.  I traded the Morphius account for some PP and went on to play another character.<br />
<br />
6) I have no idea what happened to the account after I traded it away.<br />
<br />
7) I heard (from my RL friend) that there is now a low level druid with the name Morphius.<br />
<br />
8) I don't have the email info of the person who I sold the account to.  I really didn't have any reason to keep it, so I just deleted the info.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't really think of what other info to provide.  If any other questions, just post them here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ojuillean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yea - I got a question or three.  I think I got this right....if not then I apologize.<br />
<br />
You traded Morph for Shardon - then sold Shardon and bought Eido - correct?  <br />
<br />
Then weren't you also in Affliction and supposedly had the Eido account &quot;ganked&quot; back too - along with Affliction's BoC that was in your care at the time? <br />
<br />
And you have a druid named Dawnen that was online just a week or so ago and didn't bother sending any Affliction folks a tell as to what was up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>OriginalMorphius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1) I traded Morphius for PP.  Sold the PP for $$.  Used the $$ to buy Shardon.  Sold Shardon and added a bunch of my own cash to buy Eido.<br />
<br />
2) The Eido account was ganked.  I lost the $1,100 I payed for the account, the 100k+ worth of gear I added to the account as well as the BoC.<br />
<br />
3) My daugther occasionally plays on the Dawnen account, though she rarely (if ever) logs onto Dawnen.  She has an extremely low level character on the account that she plays.   I have a couple RL friends that may still use the account from time to time for ports, buy/sell stuff, etc.<br />
<br />
After the way I was treated by a couple Affliction officers when I let the guild know that I couldn't get the account back, I could care less about Affliction.<br />
<br />
To those that sent tells of condolences, I thank you.  I am sorry I didn't give more updates on the situation.  You see, I was giving updates on the situation until I was accused of making the whole thing up so I could scam a BoC.  For those that have known me for a long while, I have had 100's of k worth of items/pp and have never scammed anyone of anything.  <br />
<br />
These certain officers (not all of them, just a couple) could care less about the fact that I got screwed out of over 1k in $$ and 100k worth of gear, they were only worried about their precious BoC.<br />
<br />
After much time spent on phone and emails with SoE, playerauctions, my CC company and the person I bought the account from, it ended up with me being totally screwed.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story:  Don't buy an account unless you know the person.  SOE supports account scamming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ojuillean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ok - it just seemed very odd that you pretty much disappeared off the face of the earth after one post saying your pw was changed on Eido and a BoC was for sale in the Bazaar just days after you left.  It wasn't just the officers that had their doubts man - me included.   <br />
<br />
Water over the dam now and all that good shit...gluck to ya.</div></div><hr />
