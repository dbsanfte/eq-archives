<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorgerd Duskwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&quot;Oooph,&quot; exclaims Thorgerd as the flat of her father's broadsword connects with her upper arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, Thor, ya moost keep yer shield up ta block me! That's the third time I've gotten ya wi' the same attack! Now, let's try it yet again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thorgerd brings her short sword back to the ready position, setting her face to withstand the pain of the blow she expects to fall upon her shortly.  She attempts to focus herself on the sparring about to take place, but is overwhelmed by the fact of her inadequacy.  Her father senses her dismay and drops his sword.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't we stop a moment and take a break, eh?&quot;  He says, &quot;we can have a spot o'lunch and continue after we're fed.&quot;  He heads over to the pack containing their lunch and begins removing muffins, milk, and a chunk of meat that they got off of a wolf earlier that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don't know why I canna get this, the simplest o' weapons,&quot; Thorgerd sighs as she helps prepare the meal.  &quot;Are ya sure I be yer daughter after all??&quot; <br />
<br />
Sigurd looks at his daughter, a twinkle in his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, Lass, I made the mistake o' teasin' yer mother 'bout that once and I'll not fergit the beatin' she gave me fer that!&quot; Sigurd laughs and Thorgerd joins him, the picture of her warrior mother taking her father to task filling her with pride.   <br />
<br />
&quot;'Twill be nice when she can join us again, e'en if she hits me harder durin' me trainin' &quot; she states and gets up to put away the remains of their meal.  She stops when she hears the sound of trees rustling  around them.<br />
<br />
Just then, a hill giant breaks into the clearing! Sigurd and Thorgerd freeze in place, but not soon enough as the giant notices Thorgerd standing beneath it.  It raises its fist for a mighty blow and she falls back, knowing she cannot reach her sword and shield in time to meet the attack.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gi' off her ya lilly-livered son of a Gnoll!  Yer too weak to take on a real warrior, I see!&quot;  The mighty taunt from Sigurd halts the descending arm and the giant turns to meet the new attacker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Run Thor!&quot;  Sigurd shouts as he meets the giant's swing, grunting when the full weight of the blow falls upon the training shield, breaking it.  He counterattacks with a stab to the creature's side, but a back-handed swipe from the huge hand knocks the blade out of alignment.  Thorgerd retreats under cover, wishing her mother was here to help and cursing her inadequacy with sword and axe.<br />
<br />
Sigurd's next attack sees his sword bite deep into the<br />
giant's arm, causing foul blood to spurt across the<br />
clearing.  But the blade gets stuck, and the giant uses<br />
the distraction to deliver a smack upon the head of the annoying warrior.  The strike breaks a horn from Sigurd's helm and he falls, stunned. <br />
<br />
Confident of victory, the giant raises both arms over its head, clasping its hands in a hammer-like fashion to smite the collapsed warrior.  But just as the hands descend, there is a blur of movement as Sigurd leaps up and buries the practice broadsword in the stomach of the giant.  <br />
<br />
Surprised, the giant falls, but as it slowly descends, it swings one last time, catching Sigurd in a backhanded slap that knocks him across the clearing.  Thorgerd rushes to her father's still form as the ground shakes from the giant's demise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thor... 'tis a great wound the foul one has set upon me, I fear it may just be the last...&quot; Sigurd chokes out the words as she reaches him.  Thorgerd shakes her head and squeezes him tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot;  She states as she holds him up, feeling his blood pour over her, realizing that he is slipping away.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; The rage builds within her, the futility of her plight angering her beyond reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot;  She screams as she clutches his body to hers. Her eyes close in furious frustration and she sees a shadowy form behind her lids.  She realizes that it is Sigurd's spirit preparing to leave his body.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; A final statement as she directs her will at the glowing soul, demanding that it remain in Sigurd's form.  She feels it resist her, but knows that it is blocked by her determination.  She prays for help as she continues to trap Sigurd's soul within his dying body, knowing that she cannot hold it forever.<br />
<br />
A warmth spreads through her and she feels release as his spirit settles back into her father's form.  She opens her eyes to see that his most grievous wounds have healed.  Exhausted, she looks around the clearing and sights a human standing near, praying.  She feels rather than sees the healing power travelling from this newcomer to her father and falls unconscious, knowing only that somehow the battle has been won.<br />
<br />
Thorgerd wakes to a conversation, hearing bits as she rises into consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tell you, the girl has power,&quot; says a voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are ya sure ya didn'a just arrive in time?  We've got no power in our line as far as I ken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She kept you alive until I reached you, there's no denying that.  I've never been able to heal someone so far gone before - almost like she had trapped your soul within your corpse until your body could accept it once more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thorgerd yawns and stretches.  Sigurd goes to her, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya done good, Lass, I believe we've found out why ya ne'er get any more skilled at swordplay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so weak.&quot;  She turns her head as another man steps into the firelight.  Its the man from the battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;This here's Geoffrey, a cleric of Mithaniel Marr.  He healed me back, but says you are the one as kept me from dyin' this day&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right, Thorgerd, it looks like you command the power of the spirit world.  We were just discussing what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thorgerd shakes her head.  In a way, the discovery fits with her inability with sword and axe.  She had not yet been taken to Halas to be tested, but then, her whole family was warriors and had been for so many generations that when jobs kept them from Halas, no one thought to worry about it.  She hoped the Shamans of Justice would still take her as she was now quite old to be a novice in their ranks.  What to do?<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me, my temple is near.  As you have discovered, the Commons is not the place for peaceful<br />
resting!&quot; Geoffrey says.  Thorgerd and Sigurd laugh at the joke and pack their belongings to follow Geoffrey into Freeport.  <br />
<br />
ooc - the characters (other than Thorgerd) in this story are ficticious, any relationship to other persons in Norrath is unintentional...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gateau Mocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sweet Thorgerd write some more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice story:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorgerd Duskwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OOC - Sorry to take so long with this one... The other char was once an EQ player and this story is loosely built on how we met.  I was unable to get his character the way he wanted, though, and I'm lazy, so I've simply changed his name a tad and left the story the way it was...<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, is this place chill!&quot; thinks Thorgerd as she makes her way across the tundra.  The end of her long journey is soon to come, though, Halas cannot be too far away from this frozen wasteland.  She can't imagine why the main city of her people would be in such a forbidding place.  She shrugs, no wonder her parents never made the trip to have her tested as a Shaman!<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoops!&quot; She exclaims as her distraction almost leads her directly into a goblin camp!  She stops and examines the group camped there, a caster and some scouts.  Hmmm.… too much to take on by one's lonesome, better mark the place and continue on.<br />
<br />
She continues along the edge of the canyons, seeking the entrance to the one leading to Halas.  As she passes one box canyon, she hears the sounds of battle within.  Eager to see and perhaps help in the fight, she rounds the canyon edge to see a large barbarian warrior standing toe to toe with three goblin scouts.   After admiring his axe- and footwork, she decides against helping as it looks like he has the battle well in hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;The goblins will destroy you….&quot; croaks the last scout as his life drains away.  Having killed all three goblins, the warrior begins to search the bodies, obviously looking for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dern it, where be those beads?&quot;  The barbarian finishes his search, easily tosses the bodies into the underbrush, and sits down.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The goblins have beads?&quot;  She asks.  Startled, the warrior leaps to his feet and spins, axe ready.  He spies her and her breath catches as she feels the ferocity in his intensely blue eyes.  His face relaxes in response to her, a wry smile dancing across his lips.  The wicked-looking axe is returned to its place on his belt.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hi Gorgeous, headin' fer Halas?  I've a quest, or I'd be the first ta escort ya and show the place. Next canyon's the one, ye'd best be goin' afer more of these arrive.&quot; he says, gestures in the direction of Halas, and sits upon the ground once more.  Thorgerd laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I be not afrai' of the littl' gobbies, love, they've fallen to me mace time and again,&quot; she replies and takes a seat by the warrior.  She notices the breadth of his shoulders, the muscular biceps, and the thick auburn braid hanging down his back.  &quot;Yum!&quot; she thinks.  &quot;What ya seekin'?&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'ma waitin' on a caster,&quot; he replies and looks her over.  &quot;Ya might be enough fer the littl' ones, but yer no match fer a caster.&quot; She cannot keep the growl from her voice as she replies.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I'll do just fine, love, ye look to yer own and don't worry 'bout me.&quot;  He laughs heartily and shakes his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I be more than a match fer 'im, so ya'll do just fine wi' me around.  Joost keep from his notice and outta the way.  I guess I can stand to have yer pretty eyes watchin' me werk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thorgerd feels herself flush with anger, &quot;What a pig!  He doesn't take me seriously!&quot;  Furiously thinking of a retort to the arrogant man, she notices that the camp they're in is not like the other caster camp she found.  She gets an idea…<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes ya think a caster's gonna come?&quot;  she questions, &quot;this dinna look much like a caster camp ta me.&quot;  Thorgerd spies a piece of paper in the warrior's belt and sneaks it out.  She opens it to find a crude map.  After gazing at it a bit, she realizes that her hunch was correct -- he's at the wrong camp!  The one she saw earlier is the one he needs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ye be a bright one, love, ya canna read a map proper, eh?&quot;  He looks up, sees that she has taken his map, and grabs for it, but she jumps up and out of his reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;What this? Wrong camp?! Gi'e me that, or I shall enjoy takin' it from ya!&quot;  He gives a playful growl and lunges, this time for her, but she dances away, tossing the map towards him.  He catches it, looking a little disappointed that she gave up so easily, and studies it once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be a nice one, love, and I'll show you the proper camp,&quot; she offers and steps closer to him.  He smells of leather and steel and she drinks deep the heady scent of a battle recently fought. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm always nice to the wenches, lass, e'en when they're as saucy as you,&quot; he replies with a low voice.  He looks down at her and she sees a new intensity in the deep-blue eyes.  He places the tip of his index finger on her elbow and slowly drags it up the back of her bare arm, leaning slightly towards her.  She feels the bottom drop out of her stomach as she realizes he's about to kiss her.  His strong hands wrap round her arms and she feels her lips part in anticipation, then he spins her and smacks her on the rump, knocking her forward a few steps!<br />
<br />
 &quot;Lead on afore I decide ta change me quest, lass!&quot; he says with a voice turned gruff.  A little shocked, Thorgerd curses herself for being so easily taken in, then starts a brisk pace down the trail without looking back.  She hears a chuckle behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, lass, twas only a bit o'fun, didn't mean ta make ya run!  I'd like to not be overtired for the battle ta come, ya know.&quot;  Thorgerd turns and gives him a saccharin smile, but slows her pace a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;One would think a fine warrior sooch as you could keep up wi' a mere lass and still be able to handle a littl' gobbie, love.&quot;   His answering laughter soothes her anger a bit - at least he can laugh at himself!<br />
<br />
They arrive at the camp just as the goblins begin a foul-smelling meal.  The warrior spies the beads around the caster's neck and sprints past Thorgerd, battle cry ringing.  The caster jumps up and prepares a spell against the advancing warrior.  Thorgerd stomps her foot and sounds her battle cry.<br />
<br />
Two scouts attack her and she sets about with her mace.  She fights handily, but gets a dagger in her side as she holds off the gobbies.  The warrior staggers as a Frost Rift hits him, then dispatches the caster with a swing from his axe.  He helps Thorgerd finish off the scouts and notices her clutching her wounded side. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yer hurt, lass, that'll need a bindin' &quot; he admonishes and moves closer to inspect the cut.  She steps back and stops him, then casts the simple Heal spell she was able to learn at the cleric guild in Freeport.  The wound closes seamlessly, the only reminder a blood smear staining her armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told ye I can take care of meself&quot; she replies and looks up at him.  His face breaks into a wolfish grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, that ya can I see - ya needing that escort to Halas now, lass? Or would ya rather camp here for the night?&quot;  She is once again brought into his masculine aura as he steps closer to her.  He brings up his hand to cup her face, but this time she pushes him playfully away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Camp?  In the early afternoon?  Yer a fine one, love!  One small battle and that's it fer the day, eh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Twas another type o' battle I had in mind, lass.&quot;  He winks at her. &quot;Ah well, To Halas, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, to Halas, 'tho I'll not bother ye for a guidin' - can get there meself, thanks.&quot;  Thorgerd shoulders her pack and turns to leave.  &quot;You can call me Thorgerd if our ways cross again, love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hight Gornil at yer service, lass.&quot;  He bows to her, saying, &quot;And the guidin's no' a bother, I'd like ta take ya there…HEY!!!&quot; he exclaims as a flash of light blinds him.  She leaves before he regains his sight, running down the trail to make distance before the spell wears off.  While the thought of letting such a fine warrior show her Halas sounded pleasant enough, she wanted to enter the home city on her own terms, and not be connected with anyone just yet.  It would be nice to happen upon him again, though.<br />
<br />
Thorgerd arrives at the lake separating Halas from Everfrost and neatly swims across it, noticing how its chilly presence makes Halas more a fortress than a city.  She follows the directions Geoffrey gave her and quickly locates the Hall of Justice.  With a quick prayer to the Tribunal, she enters the hall, hoping that the note from Geoffrey will be enough to get her accepted as an apprentice Shaman.</div></div><hr />
