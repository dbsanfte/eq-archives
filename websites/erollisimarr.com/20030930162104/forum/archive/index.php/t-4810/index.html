<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Legeran Aquila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Legeran had just returned from a long journey to the Overthere. As he walked through the guild hall he noticed how it seemed deadly quiet for this time of day.<br />
He continued on to his room, passing the rooms of the seniors, then advisors and finally the elders. Just as he approached the room of Tynia he could see that the door was ajar and immediately he knew something was up.<br />
<br />
Dropping his backpacks he rushed over to Tynia’s room, pushing the door open, he walked inside. The first thing he noticed was the lack of belongings within the room. Quickly giving the room the once over he noticed only a few items scattered about. Moving towards Tynia’s desk he immediately caught sight of a ring, not any ring, but Tynia’s guild ring.<br />
<br />
Legeran started to feel faint, he steadied himself and pulled out the chair of the desk and took a seat. He picked up the ring and held it in his hand, a tear started to run down his cheek and he knew this could mean only one thing…..she was gone.<br />
<br />
Legeran’s mind started to drift off and think of Tynia. He could remember the day that he first met her, they had hit it off superbly and were instant friends. Meeting up on numerous occasions they started to form a bond and became hunting buddies for some time. She was the sister that he never had, although he would never say to her how much he cared, he was always worried for her safety.<br />
<br />
He turned and looked out the window. He knew that it must have happened, something to finally push her over the edge. He knew how much she had put into this guild since he has been called to the Greater Power some time ago. She had done all she could to carry on his legacy but what for? He knew how she much be feeling…..tired, unappreciated…..wondered why she bothered, but he knew that the love of this guild was the answer to it all. Many had come through the doors of this council but only few made it their home and did everything they could, through thick and thin, to keep it alive…..Tynia was one of these people.<br />
<br />
With that, another tear started to roll down Legeran’s cheek. He felt solely responsible for Tynia’s departure. He knew how much she cared about the guild he had created and how she had put her life and sole into it when he could not.<br />
Legeran stood up. Keeping Tynia’s ring, he knew that although this was to signify the bond of the council to a member, that Tynia should have kept it if not to represent the council but to have something to remember the guild by. He turned around and headed back into the corridor. Picking up his backpacks, he tucked Tynia’s ring inside one of them with his belongings and headed onto his room.<br />
<br />
Once there he flung open the door and immediately threw his backpacks down. Taking a seat at his desk he pulled out a sheet of paper and grabbed a quill and started writing.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 &quot; My fellow council men and women,<br />
It is with great sadness that I write you this letter today. The departure of a great friend of mind has caused me to rethink my future. I know now that I was wrong to return to you as your leader once again and should have left the good times in the past. I founded and ruled the council for a long time and it was good up until I received the calling. I came back to help you all out but should have let you begin a new era as the Legeran Era ended a long time ago. By the time you read this, I will have passed my amulet of leadership to Geneinae Morivala. My future now lies elsewhere, where I do not know but I know for one thing that before I decide I must seek out Tynia and make peace with my dear friend. I hope you can find it within your hearts to forgive me but I have only ever done what I have seen to be the best thing for this council. This council has been my heart and soul for so long now and I think the time is right to move on.<br />
From the founder of a guild that will always remain within my heart,<br />
 Legeran Aquila&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And with that Legeran signed the letter and stamped his seal into the letter. He got up and walked over towards the door, sticking his head out of the room, he shouted out for a messenger. &quot;Please seek out Lady Geneinae immediately, tell her I need to speak with her, and make sure she knows it’s urgent.&quot;<br />
The messenger ran off with the spirit of the wolves to aid his journey. Legeran flung the door closed behind him and he went back into his room. Grabbing all the backpacks as he could, he started to pile all of his belongings into them. Knowing that the sooner he leave the better, as the longer he staying having already made his decision the more painful it would be.<br />
<br />
About half an hour had pasted and Legeran had just finished packing his bags. It was surprising how much he had, but he had lived in this one room for many years now. As he was done, he went over to the glass cabinet that was above his desk. Within that was the amulet of the council. He opened up the cabinet, took out the amulet and kissed it. He knew that this would be the last moment that he would have this in his hands and he wanted to savour it. He put the amulet around his neck and grabbed his backpacks. Heading outside he made his way to the stables. Nob the Stableboy took his backpacks and loaded them onto his horse ready for departure.<br />
<br />
Legeran then walked back towards the guild hall. He headed into the Elders office, taking a seat in the chair at the window. This would be that last time he would look out of this window and admire the courtyard that he had helped to build. Another tear ran down his cheek. And then there was a knocking at the door. The door opened straight away and Geneinae entered. &quot;I came immediately my friend, what is wrong?&quot; she seemed out of breathe and Legeran ushered her to sit down beside her. &quot;Geneinae, we have known each other for a while now and I would just like to take this moment to apologise for coming back the way I did. I know the three of you, as it were, were having problems but I shouldn’t have come in as I should. My time here is done and I want you to start the beginning of a new era for this council, my time ended many moons ago. Please take this amulet of leadership, do with it as you will but please carry it with the same pride that I have. I must go now, I do not know where my future lies but I am sure it will be in Norrath somewhere. Please deliver this to the rest of the guild for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Legeran then handed Geneinae the letter he wrote earlier. &quot;I hope they understand my reasons&quot;.<br />
They both stood up. Legeran took the amulet from around his neck and gave it to Geneinae. As he put it in her hand there was a split second when time stood still. Legeran heard a voice from above and new immediately it was the Greater Power. &quot;“Your mission is now complete Legeran. We know how hard this must be for you right now but you are doing it for the best of the council. Your work will always be remember and don’t forget about all that you have done to bring together this group of fine individuals and what you have done to give them a place to call home. Go now and let the spirit of wolf carry you as quickly as can be, just don’t look back Legeran.&quot;<br />
Geneinae received the amulet and wasn’t sure if she should put it on, but Legeran ushered her to as it was hers now. As she did so there was a tear running down Legeran’s cheek and he knew that it was over. He hugged Geneinae, turned and walked out of the door, not looking back.<br />
<br />
Heading to the stables he jumped on his horse and thanked Nob the Stableboy for his services, tossing a few platinum coins his way, he rode off towards the mountains of Butcherblock. Halfway down the main road away from the council halls, he stopped. Looking over his shoulder he took one final look at the building he had once created, a tear rolled down his cheek and this time they wouldn’t stop. He gave the horse a gentle kick and continued his journey. This was the end of something great for this old wood elf, he knew he would never look back but he would always savour the memory of his council. <br />
<br />
Tomorrow would be the beginning of something new, but for now he must be on his way to find a close friend and say the two words he had never said to her.....thank you.<br />
