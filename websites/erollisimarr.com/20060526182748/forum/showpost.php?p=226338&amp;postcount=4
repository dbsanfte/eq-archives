		<div>Chapter 3: A Shadow Grows <br />
<br />
<br />
The sky in the east was just turning a soft shade of pink, announcing the approaching dawn. Nasu drew in a deep breath of the clean, cool early morning air. It was her long-standing custom to arise before dawn and withdraw to a quiet spot deep in the forest to re-establish her connection with Mother Tunare’s creation. The majestic pines differed from the trees of her beloved Faydark, but the sense of peace and closeness to nature was the same. <br />
<br />
Her morning ritual complete, Nasu headed back to the path that lead to town. She heard someone approaching and silently melted back into the trees. As she peered out from her place of concealment, she saw Relik coming down the path. Taking this opportunity to study him unobserved, Nasu noticed his strange but compelling barbarian tattoos on his face. They looked like sharp hooks, one above and the other below his right eye. They were outlined in red and each had a small, deep blue circle next to it. She knew very little about the customs of Barbarians, but did know the face tattoos told something unique about the wearer. She found the huge warrior intriguing and was curious to discover what his tattoos meant. <br />
<br />
She slipped silently in step beside him and asked, “Good morning, Relik. I trust you had a restful night’s sleep after all that occurred last night?” <br />
<br />
Relik tried not to show that he had been taken completely by surprise. “Uhh, as well as I could with trying to keep one eye open to make sure that rogue didn’t make off with any of my possessions,” he replied gruffly. “I would get stuck with the little sneak thief.” <br />
<br />
“I know rogues have a reputation for thievery, but I have complete confidence that Lady Erissa would include in our members only those that were completely trustworthy. I think you will find your purse completely safe around Teggwin,” Nasu said with a smile. <br />
<br />
Relik found himself momentarily unable to reply. This was the first time he had seen Nasu with a genuine smile on her face and he found it dazzling. Mentally he shook himself. “Take hold of your emotions, warrior!” he silently rebuked himself. Morning had fully arrived, and as he took a good look at her in the bright sunlight, he found that the dim lights of the night before had hardly done her justice. What was wrong with him, he wondered. He was not one to have his head turned by a pretty face, but then Nasu was hardly just another pretty face. <br />
<br />
“Well, I will trust your judgment in the matter then,” he once he found his tongue again. The gravity of their current situation struck Relik anew and distracted him from his unsettling thoughts. “I have more questions now than ever about what we are to face. Will we receive more definite plans today? All must surely feel the same sense of urgency I feel. There is no time for delay!” <br />
<br />
Nasu’s look turned serious as well. “I feel as if the bottom has dropped out of my world. Before last night, I would have found even the suggestion that the Paragon could be in such danger laughable. Its defenses have always seemed impregnable. Now we must move it? “ Nasu shook her head sadly. “Where could it possibly be any more secure than where it is now? I suppose Lady Erissa will tell us shortly what our role is to be in all this. Come, let us return to see if there has been any word from her.” <br />
<br />
They rounded the last bend in the path and entered the little town. There seemed to be an unusual amount of activity this morning, with many hurrying to and fro. They saw Alyina coming toward them. “Come with me quickly! Lady Erissa has called for all to meet as soon as possible.” <br />
<br />
Relik and Nasu followed, wondering what they would learn next. <br />
<br />
Alyina escorted them to a secluded corner of the village where the rest of the Party stay in waiting. Relik and Nasu were the last to arrive and everyone was eager to see them. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't very well bloody like it&quot; stated Gurundel the Dwarf to anyone who was listening &quot;we're supposed to be saving the world and we don't know a bloody thing about where we're going!&quot; The Dwarf gave an unsatisfied grunt and continued grinding the head of his hammer into the dirt floor. <br />
<br />
Relik agreed with the Dwarf although he understood Lady Erissa's reason for secrecy. They were all summoned up fairly quickly and there was no way to have enough time to be certain that they really were who they claimed to be. Hopefully the Lady was good enough to check on something as important as that. Relik eyed around and noticed that there was actually one person missing; the Lady Erissa herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't bloody take all this waiting!&quot; grunted the Dwarf. The others turned as he spoke but paid no mind. Everyone was gathered in his or her own thoughts and arguing with a Dwarf was almost as pointless as buying rat whiskers from a vendor. &quot;I'm going to go find her, we must wait no longer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That won't be necessary Gurundel.&quot; Said the Lady Erissa as she seemed to appear from nowhere. &quot;There will be no more waiting. The matters at hand are far graver that I thought. Word has just arrived that Odus has fallen under a black cloud. A battle happening as we speak rages across the lands to the west and threatens to bury Erudin whole. The skies are darkening from the fires of war.&quot; The Lady sank with her words and the group erupted with questions. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the love of Erud!&quot; moaned Arenth, the only Erudite in the bunch. &quot;What unspeakable evil besieges my brethren?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A young wizard who had barely managed to flee to Northern Karana when the fires started burning could barely speak by the time he entered Qeynos. He spoke of a horrible terror. Fiends rising up from the very crust of Norrath. Bones clattering, wraiths screaming, undead servants coming to life right before their very eyes. The numbers were vast spanning as far as the eye could see-&quot; <br />
<br />
Arenth abruptly cut off the Lady Erissa. &quot;We must go help them now!&quot; The powerful wizard seemed to grovel before the High Elf. <br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot say I do not wish to be there as well Arenth but it would do no good. The Knowledge stones have been destroyed and the black cloud prevents us from teleporting any closer than to where we stand now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The gods save my people.&quot; said Arenth in a voice that slowly faded like a dying wind. <br />
<br />
The group sat in shock unable to comprehend the words that had just come out of The Lady's mouth. &quot;This cannot be happening. The Erudites are a powerful people. This evil must be greater than I thought.&quot; thought Nasu to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn those tainted s in Paineel! They made this happen! Those damned fools will pay for their sins! CURSE THEM TO THE FIRES OF RO!&quot; shouted Arenth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enough!&quot; said Erissa. Her commanding voice boomed through the trees demanding compliance. Her expressions hadn't changed. She stood there as cold and still as a stone before she began to speak again. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is more bad news I am afraid. The shadow in the sky moves east and threatens to consume Antonica now. We must move with haste. The tide of death is nipping at our heels.&quot; <br />
<br />
************************************************************  *************************** <br />
<br />
“Success, my lord!” proclaimed Varg Sh’Kim, commander of the Shadow Knight legions. “The city of Erudin is ours! They were caught completely unaware and their pitiful attempts to defend themselves were quickly thwarted. Our undead servants were unstoppable. They inflicted excruciating agony on any who tried to resist.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two evil, red eyes of the black hooded figure seated before Varg gleamed with vicious glee. “Good news indeed, Commander! Once our legions have secured the area we must proceed immediately to our next objective. There is no time to celebrate our victory. The enemy will not wait. Go now!” <br />
<br />
“As you command, great one.” Varg kneeled in humility and fear, then hurried from the room. <br />
<br />
Marek T’gul felt a thrill of dark exultation surge through his powerful body. The victory, just as Lord Innoruuk had promised, was the result of an unprecedented alliance (albeit an uneasy one) of all the evil races on Norrath. Marek had obeyed his dark god to the letter, of course, for it would be certain death to do otherwise. Still, this was the first time he actually felt hope that this unheard of co-operation had a chance of holding together long enough for them to obtain their ultimate objective: the complete subjugation of all the detestable, weak good races and the free reign of the will of Innoruuk across the face of the land. <br />
<br />
The leader of the Shadow Knights of The Dead in Neriak looked around at the sumptuous, decadent quarters he had been granted in Paineel. Everything, from the violent artwork on the walls to the many assorted instruments of torture lining the shelves, to the greenish, glowing sources of illumination fed his growing excitement. He was eager to go inform Suria, the mistress of the Necromancers of their triumph. They shared similar dark, perverted tastes in many areas. While the troops may have no time for celebration, the same was not true for their commanders.</div>
