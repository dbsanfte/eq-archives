<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dundridge DweomerDoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Another rainy day in the Karanas and as usual, stormy weather beat down outside the building. Dundridge DweomerDoom, leader of the League of Non-Aligned Wizards sat restlessly in his tower in Queynos. He had recently fought a mighty battle with some of the seedy inhabitants of his city, and tried to relax.<br />
<br />
He looked back on recent events and pondered while his wounds healed. What exactly did elementals have against wizards anyway ? Why had the Darkpaw’s changed their threats ? How many more of them were hidden in the hills ? What were the druids up to, did they really think it was funny claiming clarity armour existed ? What lay in those distant lands Captain Rohand had mentioned ? Where was Kunark exactly ? He cared not, several of his senior researchers were close to discovering a shortcut and he would soon find out.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door, one of the junior wizards. His apprentice in fact. “Sir, is there a reply from the Blades yet ?” “No.” he replied. “They STILL have not graced us with a final answer.” “Why are we continuing with this ? What is wrong with them anyway ?” he enquired. “The Blades of Honor have insulted us. They have called us names. They have called us cowards damn it. They have threatened us. They have made intolerable comments. They have declared that we shall gain no victories, and they will sit back and watch us die if need be. They have made slurs against our character, our methods, and our very way of life.” “I’m not a coward Sir” said the youngster. “Nor I.” replied Dundridge. “That’s not all, have a look at this.” he said, handing the youngster a piece of paper with a message on it.<br />
<br />
“It’s from our allies in the Army of Valor, I haven’t heard much from them lately.” “Nor I. I hope they are faring well.” replied the wizard as he sat back and sipped some more of Tunare’s Finest. A circle of light erupted below him as he floated into the air folding up his last batwing. The youngster read the message aloud. “Dear Dundridge. You recall our guild was gathering in the commonlands near Freeport ? A guild called the Blades of Honor decided it would be fun to interfere with us. They deliberately interfered with our event, insulted us, harassed us and threatened us. We attempted to end this in single one on one combat, however things continued. I am not prepared to take this kind of action, so I am declaring war. Please assist us.” – Lenar, Army of Valor.<br />
<br />
“I don’t recall a war between the Army of Valor and the Blades of Honor ? What happened ?” “Simple,” replied the guild leader. “Dazzler, the leader of the Blades of Honor thought that she would be a prime target in the war, and that many people under her command would die, so refused combat.” “Hang on,” said the apprentice, ”did she not call US cowards ?” “Indeed she did young one. We wizards do not easily forget facts. We train our memories long and hard to make sure mistakes are not made, and if they are, never repeated.”<br />
<br />
Another knock on the door, and a young rogue entered. “I’ve got that box of batwings you ordered Sir, and another case of Tunare’s Finest.” “Excellent, have a seat Autolicus. This concerns you too.” Dundridge took out a batwing, and cast a spell. A circle of light once more erupted, this time under his ally from the Defenders of the League. Autolicus floated skyward. Slightly disoriented by the lack of gravity, Autolicus simply replied “Thanks.” as he wobbled in the air. He caught his balance, and looked around in his new perspective. “What concerns me ?” asked the rogue, pouring himself a drink with his old friend.<br />
<br />
Dundridge replied “The forthcoming conflict with the Blades of Honor.” “Oh THEM. Flipping troublemakers they are. They tried pushing one of our clerics around recently, and he was only trying to help. Would you believe they actually threatened him with physical violence just for walking near them ? You would not believe the insults they made against him and our guild. Most of them I can’t repeat in polite company. We are the Defenders of the League, and we are also prepared to defend our rights, and yours too Sir.” “Thank you Autolicus. I received the official word from Kiadi earlier, he said the Defenders will stand beside the League should this break down any further and go to war.”<br />
<br />
Dundridge looked across the room. “Hmmm. You look troubled young wizard, ah, I know what it is. This should help.” and smiled as his apprentice floated into the air. “I really hate gravity. Oh, Autolicus, I have another job for you. Can you take this to Belgareth up in the library, I think he’ll like it.” <br />
“Another rune ? He’s got quite a large collection up there now. I’ve seen whole shelves full of them, and a bunch of those scroll things you guys use. Ha, ok, I’ll take it. Maybe I can catch a ride out to oasis with him, I hear the fishing this time of year is terrific, and I’m a bit worried about that punk gnoll Fippy Darkpaw. It’s probably nothing, but he’s changed his tune recently, and it just makes me nervous. I think they are planning another invasion of the city.” “You can take him out now Autolicus, specially after that new dagger I’ve got on order for you gets here from Kelethin. I’ll send you a message as soon as it arrives. Good hunting and good journey to you friend.” <br />
<br />
Autolicus passed another wizard on her way to see Dundridge as he was leaving. He bowed to the officer, and continued floating down the corridor. The apprentice looked over to the officer, saw her hands were empty, and poured her a drink from Dundridge’s new case. “Tunare’s finest, my favourite imported beverage.” she commented. She too floated slightly above her chair as she sat down. “They have no honour Dun.” The apprentice looked a little surprised at her familiarity, but she continued “I heard you discussing them again. They’re just not worth the effort, time and trouble you spend on them.” <br />
<br />
Another knock. “Lord Dundridge Sir, I have a petition from our membership. They demand the blood of our enemies, or at very least an apology. Something, ANYTHING. They are restless. They have impeached our honour, and we demand satisfaction.”<br />
The officer spoke in her soft voice. “Dun, They have to back down, or I will be unable to control our own people any longer. Things have dragged along far too long.”<br />
<br />
“Will this ever go away ? How much more can I do ? I sent an envoy of peace, he was turned away. We offered assistance, it was refused. I sent them gifts. Never even got an acknowledgement. I have made every effort for a peaceful solution. I even offered an apology if we somehow offended them without knowing. Of course it was refused. I have gone out of my way not to respond with anger and speak only from a position of fact.” “But Sir,” said the newcomer, “they called our legitimate complaints garbage. They have point blank REFUSED to apologise. You’re not going to tolerate that are you ?” “No, I am not.” said Dundridge. “I have once more sent a message asking for an end to this. I have asked them one final time to apologise. If they believe we wizards are so easy to defeat, they can meet us on the battlefield should they choose. We shall prove to them we are not the cowards they think we are. Their idle threats mean nothing to me.”<br />
<br />
The wizard paused and pondered once more sipping from his glass. A couple of days previously, a loud sound and a blue flash of lights came from outside Dundridge’s door. A senior member of the guild had teleported directly into the hallway. “I have an important message. You’ll never believe this, but rumour has it that some of the junior members of the blades think their name has some meaning, and actually believe in honour ! Impossible is what I thought too.” The guild leader smiled, and thought for a moment. “I have an idea. Perhaps if what you say is true, this will get their attention. Dear Blades. I have heard rumours that some of you still have honour. Assuming your guild leaders anti-wizard comments are not the true viewpoint of your guild, insist to her that she apologises. If this does not work, bring me her head, and we shall set aside our differences. Signed, Dundridge DweomerDoom, League of Non-Aligned Wizards.” “I don’t think Dazzler will appreciate that !” “Perhaps not, but since she has refused to apologise and seems afraid of being a target, this may be our last chance at a real peace.”<br />
<br />
The newcomer spoke once more. “The messages are not enough, we simply refuse to sit back and be insulted. We should take a page out of the Brothers of Obsidian book, and kidnap one of their members and hold him hostage until they apologise.” “Did they ever release that Paladin or whoever it was ? I hear Elnot had a lot of fun burning him ?” said the officer. “Not really sure. I think it was a stalemate or something. Either that, or a ceasefire. Haven’t heard the last of it, I’ll bet. I’ve noticed some of the other guilds stirring.” “I hate to say it, but you may be right about taking a prisoner. Problem is, I don’t think Dazzler would even notice. I’ll send another message, one more day.” “But SIR. They are just delaying us. We should teach them something about honour. You always wait for someone else to start a fight, but I say, they have ALREADY started the fight, and we should FINISH it, once and for all.” “This is it. The final message. Their last chance. They know our terms. If they want a fight, I’m not backing down. They will learn we are not cowards. Failing that, if they still want peace, they can deliver me Dazzlers head. I grow weary of this.”<br />
The officer spoke once more, softly as usual. “But they can still apologise ?” “If they choose, but they had better make it pretty darn good. They have a lot to answer for.” “Sir.” said the newcomer. “If there is no reply by tonight, may I humbly suggest YOU declare war on them and not wait any longer, we have had more than enough of their provocations, and want their blood. This HAS to be resolved.” The officer turned to Dundridge, and nodded. Dundridge sighed, and replied “As you wish.”</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lamil RoJetthe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;Miserable rain,&quot; the hooded wizard cursed. He had been traveling for days now, in search of Dundridge to tell him news. He had information concerning the Blades of Honor, a guild who had seemingly revoked its 'honor'. The Blades of Honor had been interrupting an event which was none of their business. The wizard was elected to take the message. With the rain beating down, he sighed and continued on. <br />
He had been walking for hours, and the blasted rain still had not let up. He glanced skyward, to see if the rain might be coming to an end. He shook a fist at the black thunderheads. Suddenly, a THUNK was heard as an arrow plopped into the wet mud beside him. Apparently the rain had just saved his life. <br />
He turned. &quot;Who goes there?&quot; he shouted. In answer, another arrow plucked into the ground. The wizard's eyes narrowed. Small golden ball-like shapes floated from his hands and his eyes became stronger. With the new-found Sight, he dimly saw a man standing back, nocking an arrow. The wizard dived out of the way, and the arrow splatted the ground where he had just been. Furious, he picked himself up. With wild gestures, he threw an angry bolt of flame at the hostile archer. He heard a scream of pain and agony, and ran over. An arrow flew out of the downpour and thunked solidly into his shoulder. With a cry, the wizard dropped to his knees.<br />
&quot;Foolish wizard,&quot; came a voice. Looking up, the mage could make out a shape standing back. &quot;You coward. You fool. I will kill you this day in the name of the Blades!&quot; The man pulled a rapier from his belt. Undaunted, the wizard worked up the strength for a spell. As the Blades of Honor member hurled at him, his feet suddenly stuck. His rapier flew forward by the momentum, and suddenly he was unarmed. <br />
The wizard rose. &quot;The Blades, eh? Foolish.&quot; The mage was bristling with anger. &quot;Attack me from behind and call me a coward? You yellow backed...&quot; The wizard continued his rant. Finally he brought himself under control. &quot;I will leave you here, for the animals. Dundridge shall hear of this!&quot; Blue wisps rose from around him, and the ranger watched in dismay as he vanished.<br />
<br />
Dundridge sat back, sipping a bottle of Tunare's Finest. He raised the bottle to his lips. *CRACK!!* He abruptly dropped the bottle to the ground at the sound. He cursed as the door opened. &quot;You idiot! What are you doing! I ought to-&quot; His denounciation stopped as he saw the blood-soaked figure in the doorway. &quot;Are you who I think you are?&quot; He asked of the wizard.<br />
&quot;Hello, Dundridge Dweomerdoom. I am Lamil Ro`Jetthe, member of your guild.&quot; He kneeled, slightly unsteady.<br />
Dundridge was shocked. &quot;What happened? Are you hurt?&quot; He called in for a cleric. &quot;You arm...&quot;<br />
Lamil stood in the doorway, swaying. He looked ready to say something. &quot;Blades,&quot; he croaked out, then fell to the floor, unconsious.<br />
<br />
The wizard opened his eyes. He was lying down, on a bed. He tried to sit up, but bolts of pain from his shoulder nearly sent him back to sleep. He managed to look around. He saw a man sitting in a chair next to him. &quot;Dundridge?&quot; he rasped.<br />
The man sat up. &quot;Hello, Lamil. I'm glad to see you are better. The arrow tip seemed to have poison on it. Do you know who it was?&quot;<br />
Lamil leaned back. &quot;No,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Although I do know his guild.&quot;<br />
Dundridge leaned forward expectantly.<br />
&quot;The Blades of Honor.&quot;<br />
&quot;What! Are you serious?&quot; Dundridge was storming. &quot;A Blade attacked you? How? Where? Why? Wha-&quot; <br />
Lamil placed a hand on his arm. &quot;I don't know. It was somewhere in West Karana. In the blasted rain I didn't see the arrow. I was able to escape, but if Root hadn't taken hold- well, I wouldn't be having this conversation with you.&quot;<br />
Dundridge looked at Lamil. &quot;This seals it, then.&quot;<br />
&quot;Seals what?&quot;<br />
&quot;I just spoke with an officer.&quot; Dundridge took a sip of his brand new bottle of Tunare's Finest. &quot;We are going to war.&quot;<br />
Lamil gasped.</div></div><hr />
