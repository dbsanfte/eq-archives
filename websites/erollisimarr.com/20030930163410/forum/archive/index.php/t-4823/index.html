<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TrueflightKHS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stay your hand, brave warrior! Stay your hand that I may live!<br />
You see yonder elven slave? Her freedom I can give!<br />
<br />
Give no mind to that Royal Guard. He has not seen the light.<br />
Don't be alarmed at his piercer. He is not looking for a fight.<br />
<br />
Brave and brilliant warrior, I see you stayed your hand<br />
Your kind is known for wisdom, I knew you'd understand.<br />
<br />
Sheath your blade, my dear warrior, sheath your blade - dine with us!<br />
I expect some folks for dinner, maybe Dvinn or Emperor Crush.<br />
<br />
Brotherhood of Indigo, so misunderstood! <br />
And the Dread Guard Outer, I really must include.<br />
<br />
Superb insightful warrior! I see you've sheathed your blade!<br />
Allow my oracle to heal you and all your wounds will fade.<br />
<br />
The truth may be surprising, but about those Leatherfoot Raiders…<br />
There's not a one among them who could not be called a traitor!<br />
<br />
Stand down, warrior friend, stand down that I may see<br />
All of us gathered together, former foe and enemy.<br />
<br />
About my sword so blood-stained - it's raised only in salute!<br />
And about that orc behind you - in his hands a harmless lute!<br />
<br />
Tasty morsel of warrior, I see that you stand down!<br />
Which is good for me and bad for you, because now we go to town!<br />
<br />
