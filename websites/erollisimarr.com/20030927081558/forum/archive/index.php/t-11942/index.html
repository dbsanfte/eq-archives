<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spiderling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the members of Dragons of Myst just got ripped by Aurywolf for 8k in 2 bags worth of gear.   He not only laughed at the fact that we petitioned him, but said he'd just log when a GM came on.    Watch out for this guy, and if he has similarly named alts.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Note - This guy went directly to bazaar and started auctioning her wares off, laughing about how he scammed her out of 8k.<br />
<br />
This earned him about 30 /reports from the folks in the bazaar.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd also like to mention Limpy &lt;guildless&gt;  a trader in the bazaar that offered to donate gear to help our guildie get back on her feet.  He gave an incarnadine helm as something to help.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, Limpy.<br />

GM's (not guides) can log on any account/character they choose whenever they want to.<br />

I recall an example when some low level rogue ninja'd Vox, and the GM just logged the character on and gave back the gear.<br />

Aurywolf made a big mistake.  I asked him why he stole from a friend of mine and he rambled off a speal about it being too bad the friend shouldn't have trusted him and how the gm's couldn't do &quot;shiznat&quot; (his word) about it.  heeh, i instantly reported the conversation, and then found he had been bragging or so it seemed to a whole zone.  Of course by the time the gm's came he had about 30 reports from various people in the zone.  Last word I heard was that he would probably be banned and the items returned.  Just wanted to thank all those who reported him and refused to buy those items he stole when he tried to sell them off.  Thanks all ! :) <br />

hit him in the head with a brick. it's a great solution.<br />
The GM's can give everything back, there will be a record of the transaction. it is either 30 days or 90 days that they keep a record of every player-player transaction in game so that situations like this get resolved quickly. Had a couple friends lose control of accounts recently and lose items, they had them returned quickly and the players that had traded off lost accounts.</div></div><hr />
