<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ninnin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Magus slumped into his chair.. exhausted and tired from his travels to his homeland.  The fact that he was a wizard was of little assistance in his recent travels to alter planes of existance as the amount of magical energy required to enter these realms alone was overwhelming.. let alone the power needed to combat the forces therein.<br />
<br />
He sat alone in his anti chamber, once teeming with life and the sounds of bubbling experiments the room was dark, cold, and broken.  The whole city had become complacent in the passing waves of peace that had recently been founded in this realm.  Teir’Dal smiled and laughed.. the sights and sounds of this peace made the wizard sick to his stomach and he found himself wretching into a basin at the far end of the room.  He returned to his chair and pondered many aspects of what had become of the father’s beloved kingdom.  Ninnin found his mind wandering to the thoughts of friends long since gone, the brothers D’aeler – his friend Tarantazsh.  He found himself thinking of his wife .. how he longed to hear her voice, to hold her silken hair and stroke her flesh.. something he knew deep inside that he would not in this realm or any other hear, or see.. the Magus wept only to find peace in his slumber.<br />
<br />
Ninnin awoke to the footsteps in the hallway leading to his anti-chamber  and a quite knock at it’s door.<br />
<br />
“Come” he spoke as he wiped the signs of  the previous night’s weakness from his face.<br />
<br />
A small Teir’dal boy appeared from behind the door.  “Sire” he spoke as he bowed before the aged wizard.<br />
<br />
“Aye, what brings you to this place boy?”<br />
<br />
“The King… he has charged me with the delivery of this.. “ withdrawing a small scroll from his pocket he held it forth.<br />
<br />
The wizard motioned with his hand and the scroll lept from the boy’s hand and flew threw the air into the claws of the Magus.  Startled the boy turned and ran out the door and down the hallway from which he came.  Ninnin smiled thinly at the boy’s fear.  He unrolled the scroll that had been sealed in wax with the royal seal of the king of Neriak.  His eyes scanned the page of text and a small laugh escaped his lips.<br />
<br />
“There is much that need be done.. and many that we must retrieve..” he whispered under his breath.<br />
<br />
With that he got up from his chair and headed to the far wall that contained his vast library of books on the arcane sciences.  He carefully looked over his collection eyes peering into the darkness carefully studying each book’s binding searching for what seemed like hours.  He removed several tomes from the wall and placed them upon the ice clad table he had restored the previous night.  Opening the books he drew forth a pen, ink well and parchment from his pack and began scribing incantations and mystical symbols searching for the answer to his question.<br />
<br />
“Damn Solstaar… where is he when I need his knowledge..” he said half cross at himself for failing to understand his friends particular sphere of study.<br />
<br />
“The question is who has become poisoned? .. Who will we need to re-educate?”</div></div><hr />
