<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Lady Amalthea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My dearest Papa, <br />
<br />
I am deeply sorry it has been so long since I have put quill to parchment, but it has been a rather trying time since I left the convent. I miss the convent with every fiber of my soul…its cool marble walls, strict sense of order and the emphasis placed on study and learning. I know I was the best student having the finest penmanship, adroit skill with the needle and the clearest singing voice. I was undoubtedly the most brilliant scholar, able to memorize any spell with a speed that delighted my teachers! It was my duty in the convent, to help those of a less scholarly persuasion attain my level of excellence. I made it a point to correct all inaccuracies and mistakes by those around me as well as passing on the wisdom I have collected. Why, just before the Mother Superior told me I was destined for a life outside the convent, I corrected several mistakes she made in her sermon before the Arch Bishop! <br />
<br />
I was most surprised when the Mother Superior informed me of a vision sent to her by our Glorious Goddess, Tunare. In this dream, Tunare told the Mother Superior that I must take my brilliance and magickal abilities into <br />
war and serve her as a battle cleric, helping warriors fight great evils upon the land. I know, of course, that I shall excel in battle skills and healing and the Mother Superior assures me that great glory in the service of Tunare awaits me on the continent of Antonica. I overheard the Mother Superior tell the visiting Arch Bishop that Odus would have been ideal but Antonica was at least a good start, distance-wise. I know that the Mother Superior has great faith in my battle prowess because I heard her tell the Arch Bishop that she greatly pities any orcs that I happen to come across. <br />
<br />
I embrace the great honor of Tunare’s choice of me as her beloved Avatar upon the land, responsible for dispensing the awesome blessing of her healing and potent magickal forces. Of course, I’m sure it was not difficult for Tunare to choose me, aren’t I the loveliest and cleverest elf-maid of my generation? I do find myself wishing (very rarely!) that I might have been a little less beautiful or a little less clever and had not been selected for this great honor. I sometimes wish I might have stayed in our lovely convent forever, embroidering beautiful altar cloths with golden needles and raising my sweet voice in song. <br />
<br />
I find traveling most unpleasant; the rain, the heat, the mud, the stinging insects, the endless struggle to stay clean. I nearly weep when I see the state of my hair and complexion! How Nanny Pickwick would be horrified if <br />
she could see me. I hate sleeping outside, and I most certainly do NOT like moldy iron rations and milk that has been kept in my travel bags too long. <br />
<br />
Endless walking has rubbed blisters on my dainty feet and wielding a morning star has raised calluses on my formerly milk-white hands. I know how you hate sniveling, papa! I shall follow my duty and bring honor to the Goddess and our house, never fear. <br />
<br />
Most unpleasant are the loud and uncouth beings that roam the continent of Antonica: vile dark-elves, half-breed elves, hulking ogres and loud-mouthed humans. I have no experience dealing with the lesser beings, so I try to follow your wisdom and teachings. I struggle to remember my deportment and attempt always to remain a fine lady like dear Mama. Nanny Pickwick always said she was the finest and most gracious of elven women and her image is a <br />
model for my behavior. <br />
<br />
I have met one fascinating creature, papa, an immense talking dog named Zalan. He is a creature of magic, suffused with the power of Nature. Occasionally he takes the form of a man and even thinks he IS a man. I go along with his delusions so as not to hurt his feelings. Although he is a large, imposing animal, I have found him to be stalwart and true, albeit a bit slobbery at times. He rather reminds me of your great hunting dog Felice, the one who was gored by a boar during the Great Hunt of 3177. <br />
<br />
I am ashamed to admit, papa, that I am terrified in battle. The war cries, howls of anguish, clash of weapons and gibbering of the enemies makes me tremble. I swing my mace with as much strength as I can muster, clench my teeth and endlessly repeat “I am the holy Avatar of the Great and <br />
Glorious Tunare, I work her will on Norrath!” My only joy is giving Tunare’s sweet blessing to those in need. How their eyes light up when I heal them, how their gratitude to the Goddess makes my heart sing! I have never known the pleasures of being NEEDED, of helping others, it nearly makes all my sacrifices worthwhile. <br />
<br />
Papa, I fear I have written far too long. The second moon is nearly fully risen and I must wake my companion, Jered, for his turn at watch. He is a half breed, mixing pure elven blood with lowly human and a vagabond minstrel <br />
to boot, but I find him a fine companion. He made me dreadfully homesick for Nanny Pickwick’s fine baking. Like myself, Jered has an appreciation for tarts! I miss you dreadfully, papa, and you are in my thoughts often. Know that I strive to exceed the high goals and expectations that you have for me. <br />
<br />
Yr loving and obedient daughter, <br />
Amalthea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mistress Ezra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;Read that part again.&quot; Oumadar said rolling in laughter.<br />
<br />
Shadowlyth held the scroll up and tried to calm his own laughter before reading &quot;'I swing my mace with as much strength as I can muster, clench my teeth and endlessly repeat “I am the holy Avatar of the Great and <br />
Glorious Tunare, I work her will on Norrath!”&quot;  <br />
<br />
The room filled again with raucous laugher as Shadowlyth read the section of the letter again.  Under laughed but it was clear he wasn't certain why he was enjoying this humorous moment.  Ezra watched as Nastur spoke in the Dark Speech rather than the elven tongue of the Teir'Dal to explain to Under what every one was laughing about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hur hur hur.&quot; Under laughed as he finally got it.  &quot;Dat be wot so funne iz.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ezra smiled at Under.  The letter did amuse her as it had the others but with each letter Amalthea wrote home, Ezra's desire to seduce the girl for her own amusement grew.  Corrupting such purity coupled with complete ignorance to her pomp and arrogance was one of her greatest joys.  The prissy Amalthea continued to arouse the Teir'Dal Mistress with each passing day.  <br />
<br />
Ezra sighed.  She would not be able to take the girl.  She had already arranged for Brinven to take care of this girl of the prophecy, though he did not know it of course.  At this point, few could know of the Children of Darkness.  Secrecy was critical at this stage in the game.  Well, she smiled again thinking of the &quot;golden boy of Tunare,&quot; Fyndolyn.  She knew he would be ripe for the picking in just a short few months.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be sure the letter is resealed and delivered wont you dear.&quot; Ezra said.<br />
<br />
Struggling to contain his laughter, Shadowlyth said, &quot;Of course, Mistress.  I will personally attend to this matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ezra smiled.  &quot;Patience.&quot; she thought to herself.  &quot;Perhaps the opportunity will present itself.&quot;  After all, Brinven might be more than capable, but he was far from infallible.  Ezra, like a spider, would be waiting.</div></div><hr />
