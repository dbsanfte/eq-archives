		<div>I finally sucumbed to finally quitting back in December. I really logged on probably twice within a three month period up till than. I discovered that EQ withdraw really begins in game. You don't go and hunt, you just sit in PoK, or wander, or even do pathetic things like walked around to older zones where nobody goes (Befallen). I was finding myself going to places liek the entrence to Veeshan's Peak for no reason really but to go there. I'd chat a bit with friends and log off.<br />
<br />
I did the SoulFire quest for my Paladin and felt a bit more empty.<br />
<br />
I got some new armor and shined myself up, even leveled up soem lower lvl characters.<br />
<br />
I just could not break that 50's grind I was in as a Necromancer looking for a group. Although I will say that LDoN helped get us more groups easier.<br />
<br />
Nostalgia was the worst part since I played long in the days of yore. Just things like &quot;Griff to Inn 2!&quot; Still ring in my ears and echo.<br />
<br />
I think the worst part of EQ withdraw is feeling like you are losing some good friends and a sense of community. Those relationships you make in game with buddies who you have some to know so well are hard. I find myself trolling the boards and wanting to speak and relate, but feeling odd because I no longer play. I even find myself looking at Allakazam's for no particular reason but to see what new monsters look like.<br />
<br />
A part of me is telling me to reactivate my account and get back in there, but after writing a large letter and sayingmy good byes, and even giving out most of my equiptment, I would feel like a putz. Making people feel obligued to give the stuff back is enough to make me not play at all.<br />

Any other retirees care to share a bit...?<br />

I won't turn this in to a nostalgia thread or anything, but you asked for fellow retirees. I'd qualify if I wasn't too damn reluctant to cancel my account. I've wasted far too much time on that thing to just throw it away.</div>

		<div>I've been there. Everything you said seemed so very familiar. LMAO<br />
<br />
I played a druid up until shortly after Luclin came out. I then got burned out. Quading with no KEI (it wasn't popular back then) was just more than I could stand. 4 minutes killing, sit for 14 minutes, 4 minutes killing, sit..... Anyhow, I gave away almost all my gear/plat and quit the game for 3 or 4 months. I played Return to Castle Wildenstein and BF1942 Demo. I had no intention of coming back to EQ even tho I did miss it. Finally, a buddy of mine bugged me enough that I came back.<br />
<br />
When I got back, I knew I didn't want to play a Druid anymore. Those hours wasted medding caused me to start hating him. I rarely play him now except to PL friends and even then, I bitch and moan.  :p  Anyhow, I started a Necro, found a guild, found these boards, and found fun in the game. I hit my mid-50's rather quickly soloing. It was painful after that tho and I did the same things you described for a while. I visited old zones for no reason, sat in PoK, and chatted with friends. <br />
<br />
At some point, I hooked up with some people who I will always consider true friends (/wave Annzabeth, Silverron, Finefeline, Samaire, Nalyn, Nefareus. /bonk Baeron and Scur). We grouped day in and day out. We clawed our way to 65 and/or earned AA's. We have had some great times and endured some hard times. We have all spread out into different guilds now  :hmm:  but are all still good friends and chat every day.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my point is...hang out and play with your friends. Stay busy doing things with them. Otherwise, it's just not worth logging on. The game itself really isn't that good IMHO, but I don't know where I could find a better bunch of ppl to hang out with.</div>

		<div>I was walking back from lunch today and a pack of &quot;office buddies&quot; was walking ahead of me... it got me to thinking about my friends.  Sure I have left over buddies from High School, College and former coworkers, but I only see them once every couple months.  My friends are all online these days, and playing EQ.  That is why I came back to EQ, that is why I will go play whatever they end up playing, be it EQ or WoW.</div>

		<div>I probably could successfully quit EQ if it weren't for the online friends I'd miss. It's what makes the game worth it when all the rest of the crap starts to get to you. <br />
<br />
That said, I also had the scary realization that most of my friends these days <b>are</b> online in one form or fashion. I honestly can't remember how I spent my time before EQ, and I'm sure if I quit, I'd spend the first few days and weeks going, &quot;What now?&quot; It's kinda scary how an online world becomes your reality if you let it.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to going back to school this fall, moving to a new city, etc., and having a really really good reason to get out more. I don't know that I'll try to balance EQ with school this time. If I could get moderately good grades while I was playing non-stop, maybe I can put it aside and graduate with a 4.0 this time. ;)</div>
