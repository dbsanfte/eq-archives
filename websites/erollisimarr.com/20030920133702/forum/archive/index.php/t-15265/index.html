<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Martigan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any of you still playing this? My wife was playing at keast 8 hours a day, every day, for at least two months (beta + release)...and when her class started a few weeks ago, she just stopped cold turkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All of us (my friends and I) who started playing have stopped. There isnt much content and the game is still riddled with bugs. It will probably be good about this time next year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ojuillean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm still playing it a bit here and there - not a &quot;lot&quot; - maybe 2 nights a week for a couple hours - it keeps me entertained. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rashim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I played for about two weeks but I'm considering cancelling the account before my 30 days end.<br />
<br />
It looks great but for some reason going on mission after mission just dosen't do it for me.  Don't care much for crafting so thats kinda out of  the question.<br />
<br />
It would be nice for a change of pace to gank a few noobs every once in a while but you can't do that if they don't declare themeselves rebels.  <br />
<br />
I gotta say the interface and that email function are nice ideas and the scenery is very nice and weather effects too but....i dont know, it just dosen't compel me to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nosfy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play the game for 3 weeks and am still enjoying it. But those that knows me, knows that I am a real casual gamer. SWG is aimed at casual gamer so far. Progress are fast and you can do so many things that you dont get bored too fast.<br />
<br />
Some old players from Emarr are with me on Radiant server if you want to pay us a visit, we are hanging near Tyrenna on Corelia. Some name you could remember: Zacarius, Serafina, unforgiving, Roper, Cenan, Wilmore, Kanly, Claireece and Nosfy :D And some more joining us regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chiteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I only started because my wife had a birthday,and she requested<br />
it as a present. I routinely grant such requests. So much better than flowers or candy.<br />
<br />
The game DOES have problems...but they can be corrected.<br />
There is no doubt that the high end of the game is boring right now.<br />
All the players I know have gone Imperial. Not because of attitude<br />
or disposition, but because of EDGE.<br />
<br />
The Rebels cannot defeat the ST or AT type tanks.<br />
I watched a fight in BG vs 20 rebels and one IMP sniper and an AT.<br />
The Imps won EASY. Remember that so far there are NO jedi.<br />
<br />
Also IMP missions pay better and are easier.<br />
<br />
What can you say?</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised a lot of you guys didnt end up on Eclipse with it being the European server.<br />
<br />
If they offer transfers when the official servers go live I may move over.,<br />
<br />
<br />
In the meantime stop by Eclipse occasionally and say Hi to Rylan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lurikeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I played the game for about 2 weeks and stopped. All it managed to do was drive me back to playing EQ.  :o <br />
<br />
I think this will be a good game in months to come, but right now it hasn't the content to keep my attention. When playing SWG it feels that every aspect of the game is just about experience points. Hell, they could hand out exp for walking if it was needed to move through a experience tree.  :p</div></div><hr />

From the sounds of it though, I'll have to drop by Radiant sometime :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nosfy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kerryn, we choosed the server way before they announced which server would be the official euro, spanish, frnch or UK ones.

Anti, will add you on my friend list :)</div></div><hr />

This is our forum. Well, crappy EZboard, but it was Roper who created it. I blame it on him :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Finefeline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am still playing on the Sunrunner server. Although I miss EQ, this game allows me the chance to log on and play for an hour and accomplish something where as in EQ I would spend that hour of freetime looking for a group or waiting on a raid to get ready.<br />
<br />
My time is very limited these days with school starting, family in the hospital and visiting my grandmother 45 minutes away to take her grocery shopping.<br />
<br />
The game is fun, but I agree there is no high end content.  I do love the idea of owning your house and player made cities.  From what I understand you will be allowed to run for mayor of your little city once things are incorporated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cassaendra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">(Hi Antilles! Good to see you around!  :)  Do you remember the story I told you about my husband and your name.  :D )<br />
<br />
Buying sooo many different outfits in SWG is FUN!!!! There's so much to do in the game instead of the boring old exp grind.  I think the game is what you make it.  Tons of bugs and they're nerfing things GRRR...with that, it is still a FUN game!<br />
<br />
I have one serious character (Cassaendra) on Lowca. My husband, Szelaedan, has 3 characters on Lowca. :D  I still play EQ on a raiding capacity.  Szel plays SWG 99.9% of his waking non-work hours.  <br />
<br />
It's great fun since I am primarily working combat medic, but have a little of everything in each but brawler.  I have no intentions at this point of mastering combat medic.  :p <br />
<br />
I am glad that the game has enough for someone like me to go in and accomplish something in 10 minutes, as well as have things for me to do when I have 10 hours to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Antilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hahaha yep!<br />
<br />
Glad to hear you are having fun with the game :) I've been trying to track down a greater sludge panther baby today, all day, with no luck. That hasn't been too fun, but it's been neat running all over Talus just to take in the sights. Picked up a number of the encoded rebel and imperial disks, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ojuillean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hey Ant, <br />
<br />
I tamed a greater sludge panther baby the day before the big CH nerf.  He worked great until he grew up and hit level 15 (or 16 - don't remember) and now I can't call him.  So I'm stuck with using a Cu Pa until I get enough CH exp to call him again - and boy is there a big difference between the two.  :\<br />
<br />
btw...I found my panther on Talus - just north of the Imp Outpost (I think that's the place).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Antilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tame a rock beetle baby and run around outside Mos Eisley or another starting city with a huge number of static low level spawns and help it fight, you'll get roughly 100 ch xp per kill and can shoot through getting taming and training 1.<br />
<br />
Rock beetle babies have like 220 health, so its really easy to keep them healed and chew through everything. They also have a ranged attack, which helps. The weaker the creature you use, the more xp you get, and the pet only has to do 5% of the damage to get xp.<br />
<br />
I've been all over Talus, ran from Dearic up to Nashal, over to the Imp Station, back to Dearic. Now I'm south of Nashal again. Frustrating stuff, but worth it if I can find a gsp. Or a grand wrix. Or both, haha. They are each like CL 22/23, but you'll need both taming and training 1 to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cassaendra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Szel has 2 grand wrixes, greater sludge panther, mountain dewback, and 2 cu pas that he uses for hunting only.  He has this funny thing, a code of ethics I suppose, where he refuses to use his pets during BH missions. <br />
<br />
Anyway, he found his around 2 km northeast of Coronet, near the water, and usually mixed with a mottled wrix...but he hasn't really kept track after the nerf. <br />
<br />
I want a durni or a shauputt (sp? -- little lemur looking thing) for a pet. <br />
Kawaii~  <br />
<br />
GL - guess SoE didn't like people baby slaving to get exp.  :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Eltherion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i play on wanderhome , have a wookie Master Combat medic with 0 4 4 0 in doc so i can buff and use res pacs then 0 1 4 2 in pistoller and now i am just running rebel missions to get my next rank which is warrent officer 1 then back to buying more factories and keeping the guild i have in supply with stims for the non medics.. <br />
<br />
Anyway i find the game buggy but stil fun, i play with a few rl friends..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sarrin Kanth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I still play.  Im working towards mastering Commando, and having enough CH skills to pull out 2 level 20 pets or one 35 at a time.  My guild recently went Rebel.  The game needs to be fixed and fixed soon because alot of people are considering looking into other games.<br />
<br />
Chiteng, Imps dont have the edge... not on my server atleast.  And if you really wanted to balance the edge the imps have with faction pets, just send someone to spam converse with the AT-ST and it will stop attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Trith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I quit about a week ago.  The game &quot;had&quot; a lot of potential, but I think between Sony's horrible CS and their warped views of class balance have ruined any chance it had of being a big kid on the block kinda game.<br />
<br />
It looked good on paper..but just didn't cut it as a fun game once installed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Abneo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I am still playing. I am on the bloodfin server. Working on Master Archt and Pistoleer. Name is Kneo if anyone wants to look me up.</div></div><hr />
