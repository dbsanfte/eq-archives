<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zanifer Mali Kyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The fight of the century,” Lithiano said, “and we’re going to miss it!”  She glared at Zanifer, “This is all your fault!  If you hadn’t have stopped to look at that stupid glass bowl that human wench had we would be at the Arena already.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “I told you already, it’s not a glass bowl.  It’s a Palantir!” Zanifer flinched under her frown, and belatedly added, “Commander”.  He turned away from her glower.  “Palantir’s are very rare and extremely powerful.  Why with one of those…”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Don’t bore me with your lectures, Wizard!” Lithiano said.  “Just get us to the arena, and be quick about it!”  <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer gave a quick fist to his heart, and automatically said, “Yes Sir!  Err I mean Maam…or whatever…” He mumbled an oath under his breath.   <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “What was that?” Lithiano’s eyebrow arched.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer jumped.  “Nothing!  Why nothing, Commander.  I just said that we should probably hurry if we want to make it to the arena before the fight.”  Zanifer pointed to a canyon in front of them.  “There, that’s where we want to go.  After you, Commander.”<br />
<br />
Lithiano charged ahead through the canyon.  Zanifer huffed as he tried to catch up with the warrior armed in midnight blue steel.  It took all that he had to trail behind her strong, purposeful strides.  His face was drenched in sweat.  He looked over at Lithiano.  He noted the smile on her face.  She was enjoying this!<br />
 <br />
“Do…you…think…you…could…slow…down…just…a…tad…err Commander?”  <br />
<br />
Lithiano slowed down her pace.  “There, is that better?”<br />
<br />
“Aye, it is.  He matched his strides even with hers.  “Thank you!”<br />
<br />
“You really should try to get more exercise,” Lithiano said.<br />
<br />
“Aye, I’ll remember that, Commander.”  Zanifer decided that a little idle chitchat would help her forget his earlier transgression.  He said, “I hear that this is the first time that Ravenlark has ever faced Slugwort.”  He gulped a breath of air.   “Rumor has it that she has never lost a fight yet, but then again she’s never faced the reigning champion before.  Who do you think will win?”<br />
<br />
“I’ve got 13 gold pieces on Slugwort to win.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, my Commander is most wise beyond her years.  Slugwort will wipe the floor with that barbarian!”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “But of course,”  Lithiano said matter of factly.  “I never doubt an ogre’s strength.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The two came out of the canyon and onto the bank of a huge lake.  “Curse the gods!”  Lithiano said.  “There’s a lake in our path, and no boat to cross it!”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Hah!  Who needs a boat when we can fly!”  Zanifer reached into a sack on his belt and pulled out two batwings.  He held the two wings in the palm of one upturned hand.  Then he murmured a prayer to the spirits of the winds, while waving his other hand over the batwings in a circle.  He felt the winds beneath his feet lifting him off the ground.  He peered over at Lithiano.  She was also levitating.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Well, what do you think?”  Zanifer smiled with a glee of triumph.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Impressive, Wizard.” Lithiano said.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer bowed.  “Tis a pleasure to be of service to you.”  He pulled out his map and studied it.  “According to this map, the arena should be somewhere over there.”  He pointed across the lake.  “If I may be so bold as to lead from here, Commander?”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Lead on.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer chose his course, and began to fly.  He could feel the winds begin to pick up with speed.  He looked over his shoulder to see Lithiano right behind him.  All around them everything began to blur as the winds hurtled them forward with impossible speed.  Gigantic waves formed around them, churning with deadly menace.  Zanifer could barely hear the curses of the local fishermen over the soaring winds as their boats capsized and pulled them underwater.  He cackled with delight over their misfortune.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp He looked ahead, and saw a huge black shape racing toward them.  He raised both arms out to his sides, slowing both of them down.  Finally they stopped in midair, a giant dark rock in front of them.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Uh oh,” Zanifer murmured.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “What do you mean, uh oh?”  Lithiano said. <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “I think we went too far across the lake.  The arena should be back over there some place.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Back over there some place! You sound unsure of yourself!”<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp <br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Do you doubt my power!”  Zanifer straightened up and frowned at her skeptical expression.  He lowered his tone of voice at the glare in her eyes.  He sighed.  “I know where we are going, I’m just a little disoriented from the effects of the spell, that’s all.”<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Well then, perhaps we should ask for directions.”  Lithiano pointed to a tower straight ahead on top of the giant rock.  “There, it looks like there is a settlement over there.  Ask directions as to how to get to the arena from them.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Do you think that that is wise, Commander?”  Zanifer said.  “After all, we are a long way from home, and in potentially hostile territory.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Lithiano arched an eyebrow.  “You dare to question my orders?”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “No…not at all, Commander!”  Zanifer flew over to the tower.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp As he came closer to the structure, he saw two humans in gleaming, silver armor guarding the entrance to the tower.  Uh oh, the Knights of Marr!  This was a very, very bad idea.  He tried to put on his most pleasant, polite smile as he gingerly approached the two knights.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Pardon me…but do you happen to know where…”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The female knight raised her sword at Zanifer.  “Filthy Dark Elves!  You dare to soil this holy shrine with your presence!  Prepare to face the wrath of The Lightbringer!”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Err, no, I mean we don’t mean to be trouble!  Please don’t…”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “I’ll accept your challenge!”  Lithiano dived down, sword out to face the female’s knight’s blade.  The two women, one in silver armor, one in black blue steel danced with menacing grace as blade met blade.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “I guess that leaves you with me,” The older knight said, pulling his sword out of the scabbard on his back.  “Defend yourself, Darkspawn!”  He charged toward Zanifer.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “NO! I don’t want to fight you!”  Zanifer ascended, escaping the menacing charge.  “I only wanted to ask for directions to the arena.”  He dodged a slash of the blade.  “This isn’t necessary!  Just tell us where we want to go and we’ll leave!”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Silence, Darkspawn!”  The knight made a thrust toward Zanifer, attempting to stab him in the ribs.  <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer darted to the right to sidestep the blade.  “Hah, you missed me!”  Then he dove under the knight’s slash.  He flew back and forth, up and down to avoid the sting of the knight’s blade.  The knight growled with fury, making wild stabs at the flying wizard.  Zanifer cackled with glee as he evaded the knight’s furious swings.  <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp RIP!!!  Zanifer looked down to see a tear in his robe.  “You ruined my robe!  That’s it!  No more Mister Nice guy!”  He whispered an incantation, and flaming pitch erupted from his fingertips, consuming the knight from where he stood.  The knight’s cries were silenced by the scream of fire as it charred his armor.  Zanifer coughed and waved away the smoke as he looked down at the knight.  All that was left of him was his armor, blackened beyond belief, and the smell of burning flesh.  Zanifer gave a satisfied nod, and turned to see how his Commander was faring.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “My lord!” screamed the woman dressed in the holy armor of a Knight of Marr.  She gasped at the site of where her officer last stood.  Fury burned in her eyes as she focused her gaze on Zanifer.  She started to make her way toward him, and then jerked with astonishment.  Zanifer’s eyes followed her’s down to where a sword tip covered with blood was protruding from her navel.  She dropped her sword as her hands touched the gaping wound, her face pale with surprise and horror.  She keeled forward, onto the blood drenched ground in front of her.  Lithiano’s steel encased foot stepped on the fallen knight’s back, pushing down hard on the corpse.  She pulled her sword free.  After wiping the blood away from the blade with the fallen knight’s cloak, Lithiano placed the sword back into her scabbard.  <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Amateur.”  She spat on the dead woman’s body.  She surveyed the remains of the other knight, and said, “Nice job, Wizard.  Very nice.”  She looked up at Zanifer.  “Now what should we do?”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp WHISH!!!  Zanifer flinched as an arrow grazed his ear.  He spotted hordes of knights racing toward them, firing crossbows.  “We run!”  Zanifer took to the air, retreating away from the tower, with Lithiano right behind him.  They flew over the lake, away from the angry mob of knights while dodging cross bolts.  Finally Zanifer stopped, and looked back in the direction of the tower.  “I think we lost them.” He gasped for breath, and looked around.  “Then again, I think we lost ourselves too.  I have no idea where the arena is.  Great, now we’re back where we started!”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Look over there,” Lithiano pointed below them.  “There’s a fisherman.  He’ll know the way to the arena.  And this time, I’ll be the one to ask him for directions.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer sighed.  “Very well, Commander.  But might I suggest that you do so politely?  We’ve been in enough trouble already.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Polite, eh?”  Lithiano snickered.  “Don’t worry, Wizard.  I’ll be as dainty as a High elf maiden.”  She flew toward the boat.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer rolled his eyes.  “Oh boy, here we go again.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer followed his commander, who landed on the boat, in front of the middle aged fisherman.  He winced as he watched her grab the human by the neck and put his face in front of hers.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Now, dear sir.”  Lithiano said.  “Would you be so kind as to tell us where my friend and I could find the arena?  I would so hate to have to crush your windpipe…”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “T-t-t-t-here” the frightened man pointed off to his left.  “P-p-p-please don’t hurt me!” the man cried.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Lithiano grinned.  “There, now was that so hard?”  She dumped the man back into the boat and took off in the direction of where he pointed.  Zanifer caught up to her.  She turned toward him, and innocently asked, “Was that polite enough for you, Wizard?”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer shuddered.  “Y-y-yes, of course.  My commander was the epitome of femininity.”  <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Lithiano laughed.  “Femininity, eh?  A good jest, Wizard!”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp They slowed as they neared the riverbank.  Lithiano grabbed Zanifer’s hands, and pulled him underneath a dock, into the shade.  “What’d you do that for?” Zanifer scowled.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “There are aviaks afoot.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Aviaks!”  Zanifer poked his head from underneath the dock and looked up.  He spotted the two-legged birdmen patrolling the dockside and surrounding huts.  The brown feathered creatures were renown throughout the land for the ferocity in combat.  They used their sharp beaks and even sharper claws in battle, to rend an enemy to shreds.    They were also renown for their hatred of magic users.  Zanifer mumbled a prayer to the Lord of Flame for protection, and then went back to his commander.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Any suggestions?” Lithiano asked him.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Fighting our way through is completely out of the question,” Zanifer said.  “There are just too many of them, and I for one do not intend to become a martyr just yet.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Then we’ll have to sneak our way through the camp,” Lithiano stated.  “Do you have any spells that can help us get by them without attracting notice?”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Zanifer nodded.  “As a matter of fact, I do.”  He took an eyeball out of his pouch, and put a finger to its pupil.  “Close your eyes,” he instructed Lithiano.  He touched her eyelids with the tips of his finger.  He noted with satisfaction when he saw her eyeballs begin to faintly glow underneath her eyelids.  Then he touched his own eyeballs, and felt them tingle with magic.  Satisfied with the results, he murmured a prayer to the ghosts of criminals to the Tier’dal, whose souls were chained and enslaved into the service of the dark lord.  He offered them the eyeball as a sacrifice for their service to him, which they readily accepted.  He heard the wind howl with anticipation.  His skin began to tingle as he felt something cover his body, like a cold wet blanket.  He looked over to Lithiano, or rather, right through Lithiano.  Her body was a faint light blue shade to his eyes, and somewhat transparent.  “You can open them again,” he told her.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “I can still see you, faintly,” Lithiano commented.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Aye, the result of another spell that I cast upon us.  We can see each other, but to other mortal eyes we will be completely invisible.  I thought that it would be best that way.  Don’t you agree?”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Aye, I do.  Now follow me.”  Lithiano crept out from under the dock, and hovered to shore.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The two dark elves snuck past the aviak guards, who never detected their presence.  They passed the huts and made their way deeper into the surrounding forest.<br />
Lithiano cut a path through the vegetation with her sword.  Finally they reached a clearing.  <br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “There it is!”  Zanifer pointed straight ahead to the giant gray stone structure.  “See, I told you I would get you there.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Aye, but it looks like everyone’s leaving,” Lithiano scowled.  “We’re too late, the fight’s over.”  She frowned at Zanifer.  “This is all your fault!”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Now, now.  Let’s not be hasty.  We can still find out who won, now can’t we.”  Zanifer walked over to the crowd exiting the building, and tapped the shoulder of a half elf.  “Excuse me, Sir.  But can you tell me who won the fight?”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Ah, was the greatest fight I ever did see!  I’ve never seen such fighting, such brutal animal power before!”  He raised his hands, as if he held an imaginary sword in them.  “First Ravenlark jabbed at Slugwort.  Wham!  Then Slugwort wrapped his morning star around Ravenlark’s sword.  Clang!  Then Kapow!  And Pow!  And…”<br />
Zanifer tried to interrupt him.  “And then he did this.  And then she did that.  And Slugwort spit at her.  And Ravenlark kicked him in the groin.  And then…”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Just tell me who won the cursed fight!” Zanifer yelled.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Oh,” the half elf blinked.  “Why Ravenlark of course.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Oh dear,” Zanifer mumbled under Lithiano’s accusing gaze. <br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp <br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “I’ve a bet to pay off,” Lithiano stormed off towards the arena.          &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp <br />
<br />
