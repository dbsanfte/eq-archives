<br />
PROLOGUE – The Darkest Hour<br />
<br />
He stared in silent horror, unmoving, unable to help or intervene. It was too late and this time there would be no remedy, no way of resurrecting those that had been lost. For the first time in his life, Zacarius Zu’l Zorander, Arch Wizard of The 50th Circle, Commander for Tunare, noble and fearless leader of the mighty Phoenix Crusaders, had to admit total, irreversible defeat. Even though he wished he could, he was unable to look away. <br />
<br />
Before him, strewn all over the barren, rocky plain, were the bodies of his loyal subjects. His friends. His allies. The people he would have given his life for. Instead, they had given theirs. Frozen in place, robbed of all his powers, Zacarius knew it was only a matter of seconds before he would join them all in their fate. Oddly, that thought came almost as a relief…nothing could be worse than witnessing the massacre of those he had sworn to protect. Or so he thought, until his gaze shifted downwards to his feet.<br />
<br />
There, long dead, laid the woman he loved, his wife, Serafina Pekkala, kindhearted ranger and mother to the Crusade. The sight made him pray for his quick demise.<br />
<br />
He looked up at the monsters scrambling, rushing at him. There was no escape, and he wasn’t looking for one.<br />
Instead, he sat on the ground where the blood of his wife had soaked into the porous rock and waited to be slaughtered for his gravest, fatal mistake. Gently he lifted Serafina’s head, resting it in his lap. He knew she had considered all of them her children. Their family. Even in death, the radiance that had so smitten him that fateful day outside the South Gate of Freeport, that radiance still shone brightly.<br />
<br />
“ I love you dear. I am coming to you”.<br />
<br />
He smiled one last smile, the love in his heart far exceeding the pain of his enemy’s single, fatal blow. Then Zacarius’ lifeless body sloped forward, his face resting next to his wife’s. <br />
<br />
And so the soul of the Phoenix was extinguished by treachery. All that remains are the stories and tales of the past. And those, dear friends, are what I am here to tell. <br />
<br />
So gather around if you will, and hear the many legends of the glorious Crusade.<br />

CHAPTER ONE: ENCOUNTER<br />
<br />
Yet again he found himself in the same imposing, awe-inspiring temple…he had no other word for it. Golden sunlight poured in through the ivory walls, filling and enveloping everything. He could hear and feel a gusty breeze, carrying the sound of chimes from afar. Even though he could sense great danger and the fear of many, all was overridden by a calmness and resolve. A warm feeling of purpose and duty, of fulfilling ones destiny. He didn’t walk, he glided forward, knowing he was not alone, knowing that a great, benevolent force would guard him no matter what he would encounter. Without ever seeing himself, he knew he was older, wiser, at the pinnacle of his life. This was his moment of glory. He never expected what came next, it still caught him by surprise…shadows began to gather, the sunlight faded and darkness began to ooze in. Strange, chaotic voices rang out, cries and yelps, then a whisper, close and yet far, far away “Son, please…”<br />
<br />
“Boat!”<br />
<br />
“Incoming! All ready to bord!”<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes. Gathering his spirits quickly, he sat up and rubbed his eyes. The dream. He tried to hold on to it this time, that ending…the voice…but as always, the dream faded away quickly, leaving him with the same empty feeling of missed purpose. Yawning, he stretched his long, aching limbs, then gathered his few belongings and followed his fellow passengers up on deck, finally leaving the humid, putrid belly of the ferry. <br />
The seabreeze did much to bring him back to reality. He squinted a bit, so to get his frist glimpse at this continent he only knew from the stories of those who had claimed to have been here…Anatonica. He had arrived in Freeport, city of humans and largest city in all of Norrath. Single file, the passengers left to boat. Peeking ahead, he saw the intimidating guards, all red and silver, their helmets gleaming in the sun, inspecting travel documents. He attempted to appear calm and collected. Finally, his turn. The attention of the four guards turned to him.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to Freeport, traveler. You have entered a taxable port, your information will be taken for future use. Name?”<br />
<br />
“Zacarius”<br />
<br />
“Class and experience?”<br />
<br />
“Wizard, aligned with light, 5th Circle of experience”<br />
<br />
“Race?”<br />
<br />
Zacarius scoffed, what an entirely superfluous question, as if it weren’t obvious. One of the guards turned to another.<br />
<br />
“Sir Lucan, I believe we have another traveler unsure of his own race”<br />
<br />
Sir Lucan, the largest of the four guards, leaned closer.<br />
<br />
“Disrespecting the Port Authority. Ten platinum.”<br />
<br />
Zacarius’ eyes widened. He had heard stories about Lucan before, none of them pleasant. His stomach churned realizing that ten platinum was more than all he owned was worth.<br />
<br />
“Sir, I didn’t mean disrespect, I am still a bit drowsy from the travels, please…”<br />
<br />
“Ten piece platinum you snobby shit or we take you back to the Militia House and hold you for further questioning. Your high elf whore sisters always enjoy our questioning.”<br />
<br />
Every part of Zacarius wanted to scream in outrage and frustration. But what would it get him? <br />
<br />
“I don’t have ten piece platinum Sir, that is more than I have ever owned.”<br />
<br />
Lucan grabbed Zacarius’ pouch filled with traveler’s rations, water and his one prized ruby given to him as a farewell present by his dearest friend Unforgiving, a dwarf from Kaladim.<br />
<br />
“We’ll take this.”<br />
<br />
Zacarius was about to vehemently object. Lucan leaned in again.<br />
<br />
“You don’t want to say anything. You just want to enjoy our graciousness.”<br />
<br />
He pushed Zacarius forward onto the dock, tripping him. Zacarius caught his fall, but still ended up on his stomach. He could hear snickering and bemused cackling all around him. His face burned with anger. All the stories he had heard, the disrespect of humans for his kind, the corrupt port authority. It was all true. As he gazed behind him, he saw his pouch disappear in a guard’s pocket, not to ever be seen again. <br />
<br />
Getting up and dusting himself off, Zacarius already regretted his lifelong longing for exploration and adventure. He shuffled by more guards, he thought them smiling condescendingly behind their visors, towards the South Gate. He had been told that around the gates, more powerful wizards, healers and conjurors might be willing to bind younger adventurers for a nominal fee…even though it did occur to Zacarius that due to Lucan, he now entirely depended on the good-will of strangers. <br />
<br />
Almost like a long delayed reaction, the smells and hustle and bustle of Freeport faded into Zacarius’ consciousness. Grilled meat, gutted fish, fresh baking, putrid potions, dust, dirt and the strange odor so particular to humans all blended into one aroma. When the high stone arches of the gate came into view, Zacarius stopped. The worries of minutes before were overtaken by the awe of the sight before him…the many races and classes and mixing and mingling, praising their wares and services or just idly chatting. He had never seen anything like it, nowhere in Faydwer could such diversity be found relating to each other. <br />
<br />
The spirit of adventure rose again in the young wizard. This would be his life, his adventure, and it all began now. He felt ready. And so he strode towards the arches.<br />
