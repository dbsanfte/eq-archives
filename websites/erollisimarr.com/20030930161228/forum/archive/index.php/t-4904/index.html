<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LogicalEntity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why I do agree that he should not have been near the corpse to begin with ... he did offer to give up a Dragon Scale.<br />
<br />
Whether or not this loot makes up for the Fear drop, I don't know.<br />
<br />
But what I do know is that Cydril offered to give up his Dragons Scale to remedy the situation, and stuck around to actually make things better.<br />
<br />
A Dragon Scale was given up which is a sign of forgiveness!!<br />
<br />
Lets move on now ... nothing more to see here. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Renwell Destab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fine all drop it but my brother wanted the other loot that you ganked from him. I dont know why you even by the corpse in the first place. Are you that dumb? You best not do it again foo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Renwell Destab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And you think you made things better LOL. you didnt make anything better. You think my brother was all Happy, no he wasnt. He was still very upset. So dont think you made things better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LogicalEntity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hope that wasn't referring to me.<br />
<br />
I made the best I could out of a bad situation. I'm sorry your brother could the sh*t end of the stick, but I did what I could ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Renwell Destab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Was talking about cydril not you your in PC would never say that to guild i like...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moltaenya D Magmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In no way does a red dragonscale equal the value of that no drop item.  That thing is pretty rare.  Red dragonscales are a dime a dozen these days.  Nice to offer it up, but looming over a corpse just says a few things.<br />
<br />
And since I know Cydril from an old guild and various dealings with him, I can pretty much say that the item will go to waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toxx The Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was about to mention that, it's complete bull that he ever got that close to the corpse. There is no way he just decided to wander up to fear, go to the Fright corpse and loot it. Complete bull, just because he offered up the red scale doesn't mean anything. IMO, he was trying to cover up for being caught.<br />
<br />
No way in hell a red dragonscale is worth the golem ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>VelondraSedai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Talking about a ball of everliving golem? We got 3, one off each golem, in fear while clearing to CT a few weeks back. Are they really THAT rare?! Oh, and please dont flame me if technically they are not all golems or something. If it looks like a golem and makes sounds like a golem and drops golem balls, it's a golem!<br />
<br />
 On the subject of this, if it was some sort of a bug where you were holding the corpse and items were looted without your consent isnt it possible to petition that and see if some kind of GM invtervention can be given? Probably they wouldnt do anything about it because there is no catalogued bug like that. I've never heard of it before, nor expirienced it, and I've held plenty of corpses. The new head GM is a pretty dandy fellow though, from all I have seen and heard, you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Euge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">cydril your an ass, didn't you just buy this account? if so, i'd start over with a new character, so far i've heard so much @#%$ about you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Enbekay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Velondra -<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the head GM can get the logs for a specific item and see what happened to it.  Like, at time 1 it was on the corpse, at time 2, so and so clicked it, and at time 2.1 that person had it in their inventory.<br />
<br />
Since there was no zone crash, and the corpse would have lasted a good 30 minutes (I think Golems last that long, not sure) I doubt they would find anything wrong with the above scenario... therefore doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Technically, nothing went wrong.  The guy just made the intentional mistake of looting the ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Renwell Destab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yea lol there was no problem i fkn doubt that. Cydril just wanted to be a lil bitch for not getting it so he looted it. And so that's why everybody should watch out for him. He dont win it he well get it by Ninja.<br />
<br />
    So watch out<br />
<br />
<br />
  Peace-Renwell Destab-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>TheClericBanton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Enbekay-  Well according to Kaik VI doesnt log anything. Since i had a mishap with my epic....<br />
<br />
Glad that lying SOB is finally gone! Oh and the new GM is a great person so far, havent had any trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Enbekay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am 100% positive they can track items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>VelondraSedai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Apparently items might be somehow trackable but Kiak could not tell who gave an npc an item (the human RF) who killed or got exp on a mob (dragon RF), who looted a certain mob, or anything at all about anything in general that might require more than 2 minutes of though and/or looking through logs. Probably because his head was too far up his... lol nm no big deal anymore. <br />
<br />
 Not only that incident but if you remember a Naggy raid awhile back where the server GMs did in fact find the ninja looter (days or weeks afterwords). But they couldnt just see who looted items off Naggy. Doesnt make any sense that Kiak would take a week and a half and need names of everyone in the zone and goodness knows what other info from player logs in order to resolve who the ninja was if he could just see who looted the corpse.<br />
<br />
 However, they can seem to track items on players and movement of items or pp from player to player. Because Kiak had done that in cases relating people I've been connected with to resolve things... So uh... in conclusion who can tell what GMs can or cannot do or if there is any logic at all prevailing? I was just saying that if there was a random and he lost but ended up with the item by whatever means he should have petitioned it if he really cared because if it was a &quot;bug&quot; as he stated then it is possible the item could have been moved to the rightful owner. At the time time with the likelyhood being that it wasnt a bug, its possible that the gms could have moved the item to its rightful owner anyway. I wouldnt see why not - all it would do is give the &quot;ninja looter&quot; no item and the winner the item. It could have been /reported with the statement he made that it was a bug looting it or the random and winner's name announced on people's screen so that they could see that he wasnt supposed to loot it. Sometimes gms are nice people. Could happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dauragon N Sethius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What does his sexual preference have to do with how much of an @#%$ he is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dalamarn Darkgem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With the raid leader , the winner of the roll, and the one who &quot;mistakenly&quot; looted it all present, I'm sure the GM would switch it.  To the looter, if it was truly an accident, you have an obligation to do everything you can to get it to its rightful owner.  You're going to have a hell of a time doing the rest of your epic solo.  If you dont remedy this and get him his piece back.. alone is probably the only way you'll get any more done.  Anyone know what guild he's a member of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Malisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">At one of the recent naggy raids I was on, someone looted a no drop mask off one of the giants by 'mistake'. It was petitioned immediatly, the guy admited he took it, said it was a mistake, so the GM gave it to the rightful owner. The whole thing took a few minutes and everyone was happy... <br />
<br />
So, if it was a mistake, and the looter admits it to the GM, the rightful owner should get it back, not sure if its too late now tho..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fliflher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Dalamarn to answer your question Cydril is a member of (KoDM) Knights of Dragoon Mist . But i also have a question for you , what does his guild have anything to do with this piece he looted ?? You ask that question.. Why ?? Is it because you want to talk smack about my guild ?? Well before you guys go on to do that , think twice ... This guild is not responsible for cydril's actions , nor anybody else's . One bad apple does not spoil the bunch .. And so forth my guild has nothing at all to do with this. We have discussed this matter between the guild and is there forth nobodies business but KoDM members . I was not at the scene to declare whether or not he was innocent or guilty and neither were you or half the ppl that has posted here. I went by what i was told by the raid leader and he appeared to have believed cydril. So before anybody goes on to spam or give my guild a bad reputation keep that in mind ... And for you renwell if your brother is so mad about this shouldnt he be posting here and not you ?? Just a thought ... And if your brother was not happy about this situation maybe he should of spoken up Like any other normal person would have done.. I know 98% of Eq players would have let you know they werent' happy yet ... And maybe your brother should have done so to fix this problem to his exspectations.. Thank you and have a good day renwell , I'm sure i'll be hearing from you again soon =) And believe me I look forward to this conversation ...<br />

Allaynna Lvl 53 cleric - Leader of KoDM -</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Seeden Platinumfists</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Allaynna.... i declare you Victorious on this thread........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dalamarn Darkgem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sorry, I haven't visited scammers R us in a few so I'll take a second to answer your questions Allaynna.<br />
<br />
I asked that question for a few reasons.  First off, many times bird of a feather flock together.  Is this behavior acceptable in your guild?  You say  Why ?? Is it because you want to talk smack about my guild ?? Well before you guys go on to do that , think twice ...  If this kind of thing doesn't raise an eyebrow in your guild.. we dont have to talk smack.. the actions speak for themselves.<br />
<br />
Now, the main reason I asked what guild he was a member of is so that the person that got screwed out of their loot by your reject could talk to his guild leaders and perhaps they could convince their member to take the proper action.  After your post here, I doubt that would accomplish much.<br />
<br />
Now for:  This guild is not responsible for cydril's actions , nor anybody else's . One bad apple does not spoil the bunch .. And so forth my guild has nothing at all to do with this. We have discussed this matter between the guild and is there forth nobodies business but KoDM members .  WRONG!!! He wears your guildtag?  Guess what cool breeze, he does represent you.  You're his proud leader?  Be prepared to take responsibility for his actions while wearing your tag.  If you dont want that, I suggest you be more selective about who you let join your guild.  As far as it being no one but KoDM's business, it wasn't a KoDM member who lost an epic drop due to your ninja looter was it?  Your member should never have been near the corpse and he surely didn't ACCIDENTALLY loot his epic piece.<br />
<br />
Now for: And for you renwell if your brother is so mad about this shouldnt he be posting here and not you ?? Just a thought ... And if your brother was not happy about this situation maybe he should of spoken up Like any other normal person would have done.. I know 98% of Eq players would have let you know they werent' happy yet ... And maybe your brother should have done so to fix this problem to his exspectations.. Wrong attitude again my friend.  YOUR guild member did wrong.  Getting an attitude like this with the people who were wronged shows me that perhaps it was good that I asked for his guild name.  If the attitude of your followers are the same as the leadership, I might do well to avoid them.  What shocks me is that neither you NOR Cydril offered up an apology here.  If you plan on representing your guild, I'd suggest you learn a sense of decorum.  <br />
<br />
As far as the raid leader, Logical is an awesome guy who did the best he could with a bad situation.  You think he found this acceptable?  It was the best HE could manage with a nasty situation.  HOWEVER, your guy could step up and do as suggested here and lay the story to GMs and get things straightened out.  Possibly not now because of the time period that has passed, but he should have done it then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dalamarn Darkgem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Allaynna, after making my post here, I decided to check out your guild before making a final decision on them.  To my surprise, I found you well spoken and ultra polite on your own guild board.  Based on what I found from perusing your site, I re-evaluated my view of your guild in general.  My only guess as to why you changed so much coming here is you felt your guild was being attacked and came to your friend's defense.  Unfortunately, in this situation, your guild member was simply wrong.  He has no defense.  I also found this on your board  6) Ninja looting not allowed or any form of scam. First time you are caught you will be removed from Guild.  If you post rules such as this, they should be followed.  That they are a high level about to be epicced shouldn't factor in.<br />
<br />
IMHO, as leader of your guild, you would have served them much better by coming here, offering a sincere apology to those affected, doing your best to rectify the situation (best chance for this has been laid out in this thread already), and doing your best to insure your guild name isn't further smeared by it happening again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Barrymore Yorke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">6) Ninja looting not allowed or any form of scam. First time you are caught you will be removed from Guild.<br />
<br />
Nice detective work, Dalamarn.<br />
<br />
Anyone wanna lay bets as to whether Allaynna has the courage as leader to actually enforce her guild's most draconian rules?  The majority of guilds I've been members of in the past have NOT had the balls to enforce a rule like this, especially if it could cost them a power player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dalamarn Darkgem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Was talking to a RL friend of mine in PC. He's got Cydril listed as DO NOT GROUP.. NINJA LOOTER in PoF. Sad part is that was before I showed him this. Apparently this isn't the first time he's pulled this stunt. I noticed his guild leader never came back, anyone know how this story turned out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Toxx The Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I was personally on the raid that this was ninja looted. I was not in anyway in charge, or affiliated with the leaders, but here are is my perspective:<br />
<br />
PC and some Affliction members were called in to help out a poorly lead fear raid (wipeout) we had already been there for atleast 7 hours, before PC came in. They came in in charge, Logical was the leader if I remember correctly. Some Affliction people came for the CR, but left shortly afterwards when everyone was set.<br />
<br />
The group of PCs, stayed and took over leadership of the raid. (And a great job they did I might add) We moved along the wall, quickly clearing the way. We managed to set up a camp, and prepared to pull Fright. <br />
<br />
We pulled him once, and wiped when Kogur got killed. <br />
<br />
We pulled him again, and succeded. (Let me also mention, Cydril was NOT in anyway affiliated with this raid in the beginning or in the recovery process.)<br />
<br />
Fright died, and a warrior in our raid won the Ball of Everliving Golem. The next thing I hear is one of the raid leaders shouting &quot;Oh You did NOT!&quot; or something of the like, =P<br />
<br />
Apparently someone had looted the ball of golem. This person was pointed out as Cydril, who apparently just happened to be in PoF for a stroll. *shrugs* Why the hell would you wander in to PoF? (Being a non-iksar monk)<br />
<br />
Allegedly Cydril claimed it was an accident. As you know, a little &quot;No drop confirmation box&quot; appears when you attempt to loot a no drop item. Cydril claimed he was just &quot;looking&quot; and that he never intended to loot the corpse. Apparently it was cleared up and the warrior that won the roll was given Cydril's Red Dragonscale in return. (I know this is not an even trade, but apparently the winner found it to be acceptable).<br />
<br />
That's what happened, as far as I know the raid leaders never brought this to a GM's attention, and assumed it was an accident.<br />
<br />
What ever you want to believe is your own business, personally I don't think it was an accident, but that's my opinion. I tried to state an unbiased explanation of what I thought happened. . . there ya go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dalamarn Darkgem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hey Toxx, did Pio come up for the recovery?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Coajik Deloloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hey here's another question for ya Cydril....if you are still reading this post. Remember the GoFM you won at the last Naggy raid and swore up and down to the entire raid that you were gunna sell your Colbalt Gaunts and wear the GoFM? Why aren't you wearing them? You've been inspected by alot of people since. =o) Just curious.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Toxx The Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm not sure Dalamarn, it was atleast a month and a half ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>kdsktan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i think items are trackable - i accidentally logged with a fbss in a no rent bag and when i logged back on and realised i lost it i completely had no idea how and i asked a gm and they told me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dalamarn Darkgem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">/shrug  They dont always track them right.<br />
<br />
I logged on one day to find everything gone from my character (down to last cp).  They told me I died and my corpse sat there for a week and rotted.  Only problem with this is that I played the day AFTER they said I died, and I promise you I wasn't running around soloing naked.  /shrug  I know trades are trackable, but I think sometimes they give the answer that is easiet for them to come up with.  It probably depends on which GM you get.  I got Kaichaiki so I was told &quot;too bad so sad&quot; in not so many words.</div></div><hr />
