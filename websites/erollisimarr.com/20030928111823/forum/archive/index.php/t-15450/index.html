<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BanishofInnoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this in rants and flames....the short of it, dont trust people to pay you for services rendered, when they are wearing bronze armor and asking you for 1.5k to buy a weapon.<br />
a 13 year old punk who promises 35k for powerleveling then disappears and refuses to pay....I should have know better when he said, &quot;yea i have the pp but it's on my other character.&quot;<br />
I want to maim him!!!!!<br />

Can't believe you fell for the &quot;money's on my other character&quot; act... that is so old, I can't believe morons are actually still USING that scam!  Well, that's one that SHOULD die now that y'all have the shared plat slot...<br />
<br />
I'm sorry this happened to you  =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, powerleveling for plat, great idea, its people like you that contribute to the population of this server that have no fucking clue how to play their class.<br />
<br />
If people would actually play their class and learn the skills necessary instead of the &quot;i want it now&quot; attitude then we wouldnt have every fucktard in the game post 60 and causing headaches for those that want to have fun.<br />
<br />
I say once again, thanks for letting us know you are doing your part to screw over the majority of people in the upper levels.</div></div><hr />
