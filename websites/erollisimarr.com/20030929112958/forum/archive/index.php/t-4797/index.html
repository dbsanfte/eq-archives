Twas a long night and the battles between the storm and the brothers of obsidian are finally ending. Blood is on the battlefield and clerics and shamens are tending to the wounded. Honor and Justice... is it worth the cost of death. Is it worth the cost of many of my brothers and sisters life or am i just to proud to make a deal with obsidian. Mayhaps i should trade Zenathlon for Radius, But that would not allow Justice to procede. Zen dieased the knights and admitted to it yet radius was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Is it worth a good life for one of a evil persons? or better yet is one life worth another life. Radius has sent me missives stating to make no deals and I will not but I have to wonder if making a deal would have made a difference. Why am i rambling so much. I need to sleep but I can not have any of my men attacked in the night. They need the rest more than I do. <br />

With that Elth looks at the vally in the commons and walks down to join his brothers and sisters.</div></div><hr />
