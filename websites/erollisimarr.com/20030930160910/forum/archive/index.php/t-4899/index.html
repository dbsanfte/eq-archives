<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems that my account has been hacked. I have talked with Kavlor about my pasword having been changed, and I trust that he is telling the truth when he says that he has never changed the password since the last time I changed it. So, if anyone sees Milander, Camien or Ganyon running around, it is NOT me. I plan on getting another account and start over, but it is sad that someone would steal the last 2 years of my time. Thanks to whoever you are, asswipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toxx The Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey Milander,<br />
<br />
That sucks bro, 8(<br />
<br />
If you make an Enchy, I can PL you with Toxx (Once you get mem blur). It's the most I can offer to you. <br />
<br />
Besides that, I'd say that you should call up VI and do what most people do when they lose access to their accounts. You'll probably have to supply them with some information, but you CAN get your account back. If you're sure you want to start over, go for it, I wish ya luck. However, I'd also hate to see some @#%$ with a character that used to be my friend.<br />
<br />
Good luck. =\</div></div><hr />

:eek:  Its me Vall :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dazoid1000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well if you are indeed the ORIGINAL owner of the account you can get it back.  Call Verant and have your account info (ie. old credit card info , original name and address on the account and or have the account #'s off the cd's you used to install the game), otherwise then this is just a lesson that playing an account thats not yours can be dangerous.  Well to compound on top of that, giving your account info to people can also be dangerous :)  .  Good luck with whatever happens.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am indeed the original owner of the account, I have everyhting except for the CD keys...those I threw away when I retired, because I thought I wasn't coming back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And hell, since it seems that I have to defend my stance here, if you wish to verify that I am the original owner, you can contact Haldor/Goldi of the GreyLords who fought on his twink monk with my first char, Milander, back when I was levels 1-5 in EC...I was invited to GreyLords by Nyda later that night. I met Celoria/Alethia A few months later when I helped her with a few item trades in Greater Fadark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dazoid1000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not the one you have to defend yourself against :P .. i could care less.. You need to step in front of the VI judge and prove yourself innocent.  They will indeed!! let you have your account back if you can at least give them your address info , name and the last i think 6 digits of the original credit card you used on that account.  Then they will change the password or at least send you an email that allows you to go in and change it.  Don't get hostile with me little cleric, or i'll bite your toes off!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dazoid1000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Those are the only two routes i think VI allows to get the password changed.  1. give them the account #'s from the cd's, or 2. give them the Name, address and last 6 digits of the original credit card and they will change it asap.   Again though i'm only posting this info to give some help / guidence not to come across as the enemy.   Just some people do buy and sell accounts on the internet and those people get screwed over when the original owners come back and use one of those two methods above to snatch the account back.   Either way if you don't get your account back and start a new one i'm more then willing to help out in anyway i can, i can attempt to PL yas with my lvl 30 shammy for a few lvl's at least and help with stirx to get ya some starter gear again.  /shrug just trying to help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the offer...I wasn't aiming that post solely at you, but also at anyone else who felt I was not the original owner of the account. No hard feelings? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kossorri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If ya need some PLing bro give me a hollar or email me. PLing is my specialty. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ulujain Ebonelphette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can assure people that there is only one real Milander out there.<br />
<br />
Definitely one of a kind...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Razer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">why do people sell their gear, and throw away cd keys, etc. etc. when they decide to &quot;quit&quot; the game? :P<br />
<br />
I like to keep all sorts of paperwork. if i have a game I don't play anymore, I don't throw the cd's and cases away, I keep them around. I have a bunch of game boxes stored away too for games.<br />
<br />
When I quit eq, I always leave him geared up, cause i am willing to admit that some time in the future I might play again, and I always do.<br />
<br />
Other people I know have sold all their characters gear, or given it away to others, only to start playing months later and have to gear themselves up again.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my point is, don't throw your cd keys away if you think you won't play the game anymore. write them down on a piece of paper and stick them in a file folder with the rest of your important docs like I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Toxx The Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Razer, some people consider EQ an addiction. What would you say the first thing a smoker does when they decide to quit?<br />
<br />
Get rid of the lighter and the pack of cigarettes.<br />
<br />
Granted there is no physical addiction here, however if you don't think / want to come back, getting rid of everything could help you. I'm a packrat like you though, I keep everything. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whee....got my older account reinstated...43 Druid, Azer, 45 Warrior, Kakul....plus a few mules..all nnaked *sigh* created new chars...Caymien, level 1 Cleric..and Mylander, lvl 1 pally. I don't go down that fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thelis Stormwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey Mil, haven't seen ya around in a while. If you don't know yet, I saw Camien on the other day with a Radiant Eclipse tag on. If that's not you bud, better start talking to the RE leadership<br />

Warguror Thunderknight<br />

P.S. I can confirm that the above g00b is the real Milander =P hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thelis Stormwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Please disregard the post above seeing how it was done while I was half asleep. Yeah, I know, Camien was in RE BEFORE being hacked. I should say that the Camien avatar is still in RE so if Mil hasn't got the account back to have em keep an eye on Camien's comings and goings.........<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PrincessRazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">all you need is the original credit card number your original email and address. Go to www.everquest.com under password recovery takes about 24 hours then you get your @#%$ back<br />
