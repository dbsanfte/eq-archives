<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loethar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Loethar leaned back having cast his line. He hadn't notice the bait had slipped from the hook on the last cast. The setting sun caught the water and bathed it in a deep crimson light. The wind blew softly against his face as he stared off into the distance. A vessel was sailing into the harbor at Freeport but he paid it no mind. His thoughts were beyond the fish, beyond the dwarf who just snuck off with his ale, beyond the ship and the sea itself. He thought back to Halas, years ago..<br />
   <br />
   It wasn't unlike the gnolls to test the defenses of Halas, but this time it was different. Loethar stood inline of battle along side his good friend Gorm. &quot;This day will be ours me boys!&quot; the commander shouted. A cheer rose along the line that echoed down the narrow snow covered valley. &quot;We'll cut them down, an let tha bears have em for loonch&quot; Gorm shouted in his thick accent. More cheers followed, the soldiers could hardly contain their excitement. Loethar turned and saw his sister Snowybear in the second line with many of the healers. Loethar was confident as were all those in ranks that they would crush the gnolls once again. <br />
   In the distance they heard a shrill high-pitched yipping that came bouncing off the the snow. Around the corner they came, yipping and yelling. The came running as fast as their half canine bodies would allow for. The two lines slammed together and the slaughter commenced. The barbarian warriors stood shoulder to shoulder. For a time it seemed as if the contest would favor the northerners. Then a bolt of fire came screaming down from one of the hills striking the brave commander of the army in the chest. Some of the men and women, seeing this turned and ran. Loethar looked to the hillside where the ball of flame had originated. Through the smoke he thought he saw a figure that vanished in a flash of blue light. A sudden explosion of fire errupted around Gorm. Loethar heard his friend cry out as he fell. This time was different, this time they had help.<br />
   He kneeled down to Gorm and to his horror noticed the statue like gaze frozen forever in a moment of agony. He fell back, and instinctively crawled away in terror. A wounded man ran by on fire shouting &quot;Retreat! retreat!&quot;. This isn't right, he thought, this can't be happening. He took to his feet as a gnoll charged him, his blood now pumping hard he caught the gnoll off guard and ran home his spear. Suddenly he found himself bathed in blue light, he had not realized he had been wounded. In the distance he could see Snowybear casting again, and the burns on his side vanished as if it were never there. There was nothing between him and Snowy when he started toward her, or so he thought. A blue skinned man stepped out of no where and produced a razor sharp blade and brought it across Loethar's face. He screamed in pain as he fell, bringing his hand to the slash on his face. He felt a sharp sting in his back. Loethar fell forward, the ringing in his ears now silenced the clanging of weapons and screaming of those who were mangled. He lay there able to watch but not able to even move. The seconds seemed more like days to Loethar, everything moved in slow motion. He watched as the gnolls ran over him and began to decimate the second line, some of them tripping over the bodies as they ran. Snowy struck down gnoll after gnoll. But the gnolls kept comming, soon he could see her no more. And his vision faded away.<br />
<br />
   The wind blew softly on his face once more and Loethar once more came back into the here and now. He reached for his long gone ale. He brought in his line, not one bite all day. &quot;Bah!&quot; he grumbled as he gathered his items and headed off to the pub.</div></div><hr />
