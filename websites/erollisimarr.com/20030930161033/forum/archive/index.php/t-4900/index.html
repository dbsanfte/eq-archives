<br />
..so that you dont wind up here in the end bitching and moaning you were hacked...<br />
<br />
Make sure you know what you are downloading.<br />
<br />
/shrug.<br />
<br />
just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darue Ivywood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">figured I would shamelessly bump my own advice.<br />
since somone is allready trying this stunt (as seen in the 'general' thread).<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember kiddies....self extracting .zip files may contain much more than UI Skins to complement your Interface.<br />
<br />
It may sound like a cool skin or mod, but remember trojans, virii, keystroke programs, and any thing else that can maliciously hurt your system or hack your account, can very well be contained in any number of self-extracting .zip files without you knowing about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take heed when downloading, even from 'percieved' friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously...it can, and Im sure will, happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lasiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best way to not get scammed with keyloggers etc, is to run either a hardware firewall (linux firewall/router) or a software firewall. Zonealarm (http://www.zonelabs.com) Pro is what i use, but their free ver is excellent but less customizable. Been using Zonealarm about 3 years now, with 0 probs with EQ. Also, use a trojan scanner to scan files you're unsure of as well as virus scan them. The Cleaner (http://www.moosoft.com) is one of the better trojan scanners.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as how this has happened from skins on EQ Stratics.</div></div><hr />
