 From her earliest years, the elfling child carried the mark of the forest. Her features were fine, even for an elf. It is for this reason that the Eldar gave her the name she would bear for this lifetime, and perhaps one that she has known before, the child was to be called Lycanthia.<br />
<br />
As she grew in stature and beauty, she also grew in her devotion to the Mother of All. There were few elvlings who spent as much time in the holy  sanctuaries as Lycanthia did. It was not long before those who were versed in the arcane lore of the elves detected something unusual about the elf-girl. Lycanthia had been gifted with magic talent of the elves  of course, but her destiny did not lay in the temples and sanctuaries of Felwithe. She was to be special. Not a priest of the elves,  she was a chosen Childe of the Forest. She was a soldier of Tunare. She was a Druid.<br />
<br />
Even among the elves, there were few who had the abilities to become a Druid. For although gifted with a great love of nature and of the Goddess Mother herself, few possessed the ability to channel the wild forces of nature and bend its power to his or her will. Lycanthia was considered by her  people to be very special, for the priveledge of a devoted Druid was a rewarded rank  in the legions of Tunare in her realm beyond the horizon, in the Plane of Growth where she dwells. <br />
<br />
Lycanthia spent most of her time in the forest, communing with nature and tending to the needs of the Faydark. She assumed a vital role in the wars with the orcs that were trying to take hold in the forests. She would frequently join groups of rangers that would go to battle to defend the city of Kelethin, acting not only as a healer of the body, but as a bringer of hope. For even to see her inspired the soldiers, more than one dying ranger passed into the Mother’s Realm carrying only a picture of the young Druid in his mind. During these years, she met a young ranger by the name of Fiore. Those who knew him fondly referred to him  as the “Earthshaker”.  Friends claimed that when Fiore went to battle the earth shook as he felled foes with his swift bow.  Many warriors had heard tales of Fiore’s bravery and skills in combat. Fiore and Lycanthia spent many days together wandering the mysteries of the Faydark. They became closest companions. She was taken by his sense of humour and honesty, and he by her beauty and wisdom.<br />
<br />
News of a great evil spreading across the land came to the city of Kelethin. The forces of nature were being called to help prevail upon the shadow that was slowly spreading across Norrath. Lycanthia knew before word had arrived that something was very wrong. She could feel the pain of the forest, and sense the evil on the air. It became clear that even the forest was no longer  a sanctuary against this evil. In her battles with the orcs she had grown strong and wise. She knew her time was drawing near.<br />
<br />
Standing before the Council of Eldars, the young Druid learned of her fate. It was decided, that as a priest of the All Mother and Guardian of the Wood, it was her place to answer the call of the South. Because of the wars with the orcs, there were no surplus soldiers to send, so the council had decided to send only one, and she was to leave immediately.<br />
<br />
Lycanthia departed without telling her love goodbye. She knew that it was unlikely she would ever see him on this side of the sun again. Yet, she hoped that one day they might meet again, but if evil prevailed, love, like the forest, would wither and rot. She collected a few items and began her journey to the unknown land of Kunark.<br />
<br />
On her way to the Unknown Land, Lycanthia traveled to many different realms, fighting evils wherever she roamed. On the wide plains of the Karanas, she helped fight Gnolls and defend the realm of a race of bird-men. In the scorching desert of Ro she joined the Knights of Love in guarding the city of Freeport against invading giants. As her journey continued, Lycanthia grew in power and reputation. The elves of the refuge of Jaggedpine showed her how to travel the secret ways of the unseen, allowing her to travel much faster across great distances. She made many friends, but always continued on her journey southward. It was in these days that bards sang of a beautiful and fierce priestess of Tunare who couldn’t rest until she had completed a quest, and  they called her “The Wanderer”.<br />
<br />
Eventually fate led Lycanthia the forests of Kunark known as the “Burning Woods” It was in these strange lands that she was approached by one claiming to be a messenger of Tunare. He told her that she was to attend a council of the chosen in order to lay plans for cleansing the lands of the sickness that was quickly overtaking it. <br />
<br />
The Council of the Chosen convened in the Eastern Karanas, a place of both great vastness and beauty. The council met for three days, and it was not until disaster struck that a final decision was reached. On the evening of the third day, a dark elf attacked the council and several of the members were killed. In the end it was Lycanthia who conjured a swarm of deadly insects to attack the assassine, and therefore saved the council from complete destruction. So it was decided, that in order to combat the evil they faced, one must retrieve the legendary sword known only as “Natures Wrath”. This task was not to be easily undertaken. It was said that to even wield the sword took such great will, that only one who followed in the footsteps of the “Mother’s Walk” could harness its power. Thus it was that Lycanthia’s destiny was revealed, and her quest to retrieve the ancient sword of nature began. But first, she had to travel to the land of the halflings and learn of the test that she must undertake to prove herself worthy of her prize.<br />
<br />
As Lycanthia approached the small halfling community of Rivervale, she was met by  small crowds of onlookers. It was not rare for visitors from far lands to come to the small city, but rumour had spread of her errand, and many were anxious to see “The Wanderer”, who searched for the sword of power. It was in this small community that Lycanthia met a halfling female by the name of Ella Foodcrafter. Ella greeted Lycanthia warmly, with eyes that at once showed her worries over the spreading shadow, and revealed a wisdom that ran as deep as the unending rivers of the countryside. Ella told Lycanthia of a great sickness that had befallen Norrath. This evil was spreading across the world, and unless it could be stopped, the balance of nature would be upset, and the lands and all creatures would surely fall into peril. Ella confided in Lycanthia that the council was desperate, or would certainly not have set this task on one so young, even if she was renowned, for the evils that must be vanquished were relentless and were born of hatred ancient when the Forest of Tunaria was still young. The only information Ella could provide was to seek out the wisdom of the ancient race of treefolk that dwelled out of mortal site in the northern plains of Karana. Before Lycanthia left Rivervale, Ella gave her a beautifully crafted scimitar as a token of her quest, for it was only by its presence that the treefolk would acknowledge and aid the young Druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Everclear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">-------------------------------------------------------<br />
On the plains of Karana, Lycanthia used her tracking skills to find a clearing described by Ella. It was thought by the Druid to be a meeting place of the Treants, an ancient race of beings who took the forms of trees to live in the wild plains of Karana. On the second night of camping in this place, the young Druid was praying to the All Mother for guidance in her quest, and her prayer was answered! A massive ancient treant by the name of Xanuuses approached Lycanthia and told her of the Great Sickness. So it was that Lycanthia learned of the great evils corrupting the fair land of Norrath. Together the forces were unstoppable, yet individually, there was hope of their defeat. Lycanthia set about her task immediately, vanquishing evil after evil across the lands once known as Tunaria. With every defeat of evil came hope to the residents of the lands. As the seasons came and went, Lycanthia had made many friends and had much aid in her quest to cleanse Norrath of its vile disease. However, tales of “The Wanderer” faded and gave way to the heroic victories of the One who came to save the land, the One who had reclaimed hope from the evils abroad….this was “The Preserver”.<br />
<br />
It was said that after every battle Lycanthia fought she gave thanks and praise to the All Mother for her victory, and in time it became apparent that the Goddess had blessed her greatly for this. But as the battles continued, the evil seemed to get stronger, as each foe gave way to another even stronger opponent.  The weight of battle soon began to way on the Druid, and rumour began that she did not simply fight for the citizens of Norrath, but that she was in fact opposing the power of something far greater…..for the first time Lycanthia felt fear. <br />
<br />
After the Siege of Kedge Keep in the year 2027, the words of her latest foe prevailed in her thoughts. As she struck the final blow to the Sea Demon of the Keep, his final words were a warning from the Planes of Beyond. With his last breath, he told Lycanthia that his fate would be hers, for she knew far too well the price of restoring the balance of nature, good was to prevail today, but at what price tomorrow? With these words weighing on her mind, she rallied her troops and headed for the lair of the final evil, but what she found there was not only a test of her mind and body, but of her faith.<br />
<br />
The great evil of the Ocean had a name, and he was called Faydedar. He was of the ancient race known as dragons, superior to all beings in both strength and intellect. The army shook with the fright that seems to surround these creatures like a dense fog on the seas. It was finally clear how deep the hatred of this evil ran. For no other being in the planes could have engineered such destruction of the lands than the mother of this final foe, the Wurm Queen, Veeshan herself. As the army prepared to lead an assault on this most dreaded of foes, Lycanthia spent her time praying to the All Mother. Why had she been set as a pawn in the games of the Gods? How could the Mother let her charge blindly into certain doom, and most of all….why wouldn’t she answer? With her head held high, and only a faint redness to her eyes, Lycanthia led her troops to battle one last time. The war of the Lands was fought bravely, but alas, it seemed that the army was no match for the son of Veeshan. There in that dark hour, Lycanthia knew the price of victory must be paid, or all her efforts, and the hopes of Norrath would be in vain. Bravely she marched out on the field to meet her foe directly, and accept her fate. She knew that she would be consumed by the dragon, but hoped that in her last moments she could complete her spell of treeform and slay the beast from the inside out. As she stood on the battlefield before her foe, she thought only of the cool forests of her home in the Faydark and of fond memories shared there with her love. She grasped at these memories as if the cool rain of the forest would help defray the pain of her oncoming fiery fate. But then something happened that neither she, nor her enemy anticipated. For as the dragon rose up, ready to come down upon his prey, the air around her whistled with energy. And the dragon screamed. Openeing her eyes, Lycanthia had just enough time to see the shaft of an arrow pierce the throat of the young dragon, as Faydedar struck a dying blow…not to her, but to his slayer...As the dragon fell, the earth shook, and Lycanthia’s heart was rent. For there, breathing his last, was the ranger of her past, the love she had sacrificed, and who had sacrificed for her, she held him close as  life slipped away from the ranger and he passed into the Grove. Lightning seared the sky, and thunder pealed on the plains, yet Lycanthia heard nothing except the falling of rain on the ocean, for nature seemed to weep for her lost love, but it is not love the Gods desire………<br />
<br />
In rage, Lycanthia tore the heart from the beast, and began one final quest. She would go to the plane of her Mother with the heart, and take her beloved with her. Using the secretways of the Jaggedpine Treefolk, Lycanthia ventured to the sacred Wakening Lands and entered the Plane of Growth. She set her sights on the Great Tree of Tunare with a glare. She was home, and she was angry. The guards at the base of the ancient tree moved to stop the young Druid, but seeing the still beating heart in her hand, they let her pass. Lycanthia strode up to the throne of Tunare and threw the heart to the floor before her. “There’s your prize, Mother, and here is mine!” she screamed as she fell to the floor still grasping the body of her beloved ranger. Tunare’s visage softened as she looked upon the elfgirl “There are some things that are beyond even me, dear daughter. I did not abandon you, but the balance must be maintained, ….one of my children, for one of Veeshan’s……that is the will of the Fates”<br />
<br />
“Then two, you have lost dear mother, for the sorrow that consumes me shall cast me into darkness soon, and I shall pass into hatred and be lost to you! You have cursed me mother! I am forsworn!” cried the druid before the throne of her mother.<br />
<br />
Then with a small smile Tunare picked up the broken girl and brushed her hair saying, “ No, my daughter for it is your love that has saved you. This child of nature was not indebted as you were…..he is his fathers charge.”<br />
<br />
Puzzled the girl looked into the Goddesses eyes as if tormented,” What do you mean? He is lost as well?”<br />
<br />
Tunare explained, “ Did you not see the weeping of the skies at his passing? Did you not for one moment consider that you were alone in mourning and rage? Daughter of mine, with eyes eternal open them now and see! He is a child of Karana, and the rage of Karana is justified….You see daughter, the death of the thrall of Veeshan was to be balanced by the passing of my beloved daughter to save the lands. You were to join me here in the Sacred Groves…. But in her rage, Veeshan took that which was not due…a child of Karana, and  in doing so forfeited her child for naught. So you see, it was love that saved you both.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand,” sobbed the druid.<br />
<br />
“Dear child even the power of the Gods must be kept in balance. Veeshan upset the balance of power with her rage and greed, the power of the Gods is again in balance…do you not see? Daughter, your love approaches, he is whole again!”<br />
<br />
At that moment, the ranger came walking up to the pair….with a new body and renewed spirit. Lycanthia was weak with joy, and she and the ranger spent many hours just holding each other there in the hall of Tunare. When at last they could speak, Tunare drew their attention to the heart that was still beating.<br />
<br />
Tunare looked at her daughter with the pride of a true mother and proclaimed, “ This shall be your reward, Lycanthia, daughter of my love, and follower in my steps, take now your sword and strike!”<br />
<br />
Lycanthia drew the blade of the halflings, and drove it deep into the heart. At once she felt the energy of the heart flowing into her sword, more and more power flowed from the heart, her vision blurred and she felt like she would have to release the sword  or be consumed by it’s power. Suddenly, something deep inside her felt as if it snapped back into place, and the rage of the power ebbed to a low hum in her mind. When she opened her eyes, she saw that she was on her knees grasping a shimmering sword, surrounded by ethereal vines.<br />
<br />
“Rise Naturewalker, knight of my hand, soldier of my lands, and defender of my children,” said the Goddess. The Druid stood and collapsed.<br />
<br />
Lycanthia did not remember her love carrying her back to the sacred lands, or how she managed to open the gateway back to her home. In the followng days  the young Druid  and the ranger were married. They lived long blessed lives defending the lands against evils that tried to corrupt Norrath’s beauty. Some claim that eventually the couple faded from Norrath, and withdrew to the Mother’s plane where they are still blessed.  Some rumours even claim the  couple  guard the Great Tree of Tunare in a different form, and perform special tasks for the All Mother and for Karana, but that sometimes, they can still be seen strolling in the forests of the Faydark.</div></div><hr />
