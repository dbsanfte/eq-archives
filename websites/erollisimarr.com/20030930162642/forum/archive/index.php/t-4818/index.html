Hear Ye, Hear Ye!<br />
The Trading Town of Sanhedrin is looking for a few stalwart adventurers!  If you have the courage to forge out on your own, the skill to survive, the desire to make good friends, and the intellect to know when to fight and when to talk, please visit the island of Sanhedrin!<br />
Settled a few years ago by a band of adventurers, the core &quot;family&quot; of Sanhedrin is now ready to add new members to our ranks.  The folk of Sanhedrin share a neutral-good view of the world, and offer a friendly, low-stress environment.  If you are of good intent, we will welcome you.  (Necromancers and Shadowknights need not apply, but all races should feel free to visit.)<br />
Please pay a visit our island, sample the fine weather of the Timorous Deep, and meet our residents.  We of Sanhedrin look forward to your visit.<br />
<br />
Out Of Character:<br />
Do you want to RP a good-aligned character, but find that a military guild isn't for you?  Do you enjoy RP that revolves less around good vs. evil and more around people and friendships?  Do you enjoy a lighthearted atmosphere?  Do you think RP is more important than powerleveling?<br />
If all the above are true, Sanhedrin is a guild that you will find to your taste.  We have recently decided to accept new members.  There are many fine RP guilds on this server, but everyone is suited to a different style.  Whether you are a seasoned RPer looking for a home or a beginner looking to make some friends who RP, please feel free to come by our website:<br />

<br />
From there, you can find out all about the guild, IC and OOC.  Drop by our Message Boards and visit The Embassy to let us know of your interest.  A member will contact you IC as soon as possible.<br />
As the Ambassador of Sanhedrin, I wish to stress that this is _not_ a flame towards the members of the good-aligned military guilds on this server (and there are several of you)!  The members of Sanhedrin respect all roleplay and all roleplayers, as long as courtesty is maintained.  We simply wish to offer an alternative to joining a military force as part of RP.<br />
