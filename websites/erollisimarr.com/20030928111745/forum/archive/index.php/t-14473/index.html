guys, so I would like it if you would stop saying that. I <br />
hate it when someone calls me an ebayer. No, I do not <br />

You should get a few PC's from your guild if you think <br />
you can get it at a lower price. Once you buy it, a deal <br />
is a deal. I do not ever make different characters to scam. <br />
I do not ask for the item first. I also inspect so much <br />

So, you admit you overprice items to try and con items of <br />
an obviously higher value from people, with apparently <br />
no remorse? Congrats! You sir are a fine example of one <br />
of the worst pieces of filth this server has to offer. If your <br />
post was an attempt at an appology, consider it a horrific <br />
failure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From your former assistant Worlaen:<br />
hey im no scammer thats first time i did that he sent me a tell asking to tell country that which took bout 30 min for me to think on it then offered me 5k to do so i did never got my money tho  <br />
<br />
He seems to share your dubious command of the written word, but in the above quote he says that you did send him a tell offering 5k to tell someone else the PC on an item.  Rather directly conflicts with your story.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank you for creating this SECOND thread with your name in the title in the Scammer section.  Helps to make sure people get a little more background of the story surrounding your scammer reputation.  <br />
<br />
Of course they can go further down and read all about it here in the other Linkin=scammer thread. (http://www.erollisimarr.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13524)</div></div><hr />

Whether you do it anymore doesnt matter, it is the thought that you did it and seem proud of it.<br />

Glad I never ran into you in game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caharrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey, maybe this guy's innocent. In order to scam people you have to have enough intelligence to not only form a complete thought, put mold it into an actual sentence; something this genius is obviously incapable of.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Leldari L</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I vaguely remember running into him in bazaar...He wanted me to trade a Valorium Ring of Gallantry for several items that added together didn't equal half the value of the ring. I just laughed and said no..<br />
<br />
He didn't continue to bug me. Had I not known prices I might have been tempted but he never put a price on anything just asked for a straight up trade. He may not be honorable but he didn't actually lie to me. I am always careful about buying or trading items. Many folks don't bother to check prices. <br />
<br />
So while he is a conman the buyer is also responsible for not getting price checks. I find if no one knows a price I can go to eqprices.com and allakhazam.com average the prices deduct 25% and come up with something that is at least a ballpark figure. I go to this trouble because I am perpetually broke and can't afford to get ripped off when I can save a few k in pp by doing 2 minutes of work.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry I don't sit in the bazaar 95% of the time trying to make money, he's probably no worse than you. This Link guy is just pulling off a buy low/sell high. Seriously why don't you go make a thread flaming car salesmen. If you're smart, you make the money. There were plenty of people who did this in EC before bazaar. Don't get all pissy cause he's usin some standard sales technique to make profit. He's not taking advantage of you, you're letting yourself be taken advantage of. Get a reliable source for prices. If I had bought something from this guy and got ripped off, maybe I'd be saying something different or maybe not. It depends on how much you want to blame someone else for doing something stupid.</div></div><hr />
