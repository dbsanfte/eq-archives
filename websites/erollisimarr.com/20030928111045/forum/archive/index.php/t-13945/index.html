<br />
Chapter I- The Odyssey<br />
<br />
An odd odyssey became of Attica X’Layan, former servant of Edwrin Obsidian. Captured after the fall of Obsidian, she was transported from Qeynos to back to Feeder for her crimes. Various murders, threats, and even boxes of “special gifts” sent to heads of state on the continent. Hung? Tortured? Beaten? No! Not the Feydwerian way. They stuck her in the smelly mines of Aka’non with that sub race the Gnomes! Attica cursed as another stupid small ore moving gadget stepped on her foot. What was her reply? She kicked it hard; not realizing the small device weighted the same as a boulder. She hobbled in pain, cursing.<br />
<br />
“I wish they would have hung me, then I would have some dignity. But no, I get gnomes and stupid devices!” She continued to pick at the mine wall, grunting her complaints to herself as she had done for the past month. <br />
<br />
CRASH! Clunk Clunk Clunk!<br />
<br />
Attica turned and watched a large ore skimmer pass through the mine past her… It was filled with surplus grain from the windmills for the workers. Was this her chance…? What was the worst they could do, hang her? She jumped into the empty corner of the grain cart as the foreman chatted with a guard. Attica reached out combing the grain over her, suddenly avalanching most of it onto her. Grumbling, she laid under the powdery, itchy grain as it came up to and out of the city to the storage mills.<br />
<br />
The crafty Drowess jumped out and made a run for it… No spell book, not staff or weapons, she ran in nothing but her bits of clothing and her Advisor’s Robe. The little gnome guards almost spotted her once, and she came close to coming face to face with some Kobalds, but she finally found her way to Outer Faydark, but… Where to go from here…?<br />
<br />
“Why do these forests all look alike? Just a hill and a tree everywhere I look.” Hungry Attica growled. After hours of walking in what seemed to be circles, she got to the top of a hill and spotted a bunch of Fey Drakes… Downed columns and these fey drakes, most likely a landmark. <br />
<br />
As she walked toward it, she suddenly cried out, being hit in the back of the head. In the darkness of the forest eyes lit up behind her… The Vampires of Mistmoore dragged her to the Manor.<br />
<br />
Attica’s eyes opened, she lay on top of a coffin in the coffin room. Her eyes shot open all the way upon seeing Mayong sitting comfortably with slaves around him. He nodded to a guard at the door who grabbed Attica by the hair, forcing her arm behind her back. Mayong Mistmoore grinned evilly. “You should not return to places you scar. One of my agents recognized you.” The dizziness and ache of the blow to her head made Attica think about his words a second… The memory came to her much quicker though. “This isn’t about that old supply station Obsidian raided, is it…?” The Drowess suddenly realized it was a stupid thing to do, incriminating herself voluntarily.<br />
<br />
Mayong glared… He did not forget as well. “One of those Vampires was my favorite concubine. You thought wrong to ever challenge Mistmoore.”<br />
<br />
Was this the end…? That is what Attica thought in her mind. Enough to make her start to shake in fear. Perhaps the mines in the gnomes were not so bad after all. “Are you going to kill me…?” the Necromancer asked, almost sure she knew the answer. <br />
<br />
“No.” Mistmoore smirked. Attica let out a sigh of relief. “But I am going to do something worse… You get to live as a Vampire, and live forever… You won’t like the cost though. I’m going to make you have the greatest hunger for blood you have ever experienced, but you can never quench it. Why…? Because you will be put in a steel coffin and locked away for all eternity, never feeding the hunger. You’ll suffer forever.” Mistmoore’s eyes were full of hatred. He never thought he’d ever run any of the one’s who deprived him of one of his beloved for all eternity. They would flee to the other side of the world until they died of age and peacefully.<br />
<br />
End of Chapter I<br />
<br />
Chapter II- The Awakening<br />
<br />
Time passed throughout Norrath. The land of Lucin discovered, Planes opened, the Trolls driven from Grobb. Countless changes came upon the world as Attica laid in the steel coffin, only knowing a hunger and solitude that destroyed her sanity… Or at least the sanity she may have had.<br />
<br />
Gnome tomb robbers hacked at the ground, unearthing the marked stone Attica laid under. The stone bared the marking of Mayong Mistmoore. The robbers had others gnomes distracting the undead guards so they would open tombs. <br />
<br />
KRACK!<br />
<br />
The tip of a pick broke a small hole in the coffin, the gnome digging with more curiosity. They most defiantly have a tomb to open. Shoveling and hurling dirt to the side, the gnomes finally pulled the coffin from the ground, turning to hear a howl of a beast somewhere near the Castle.<br />
<br />
“Quick! Open it!”<br />
<br />
One of the gnome rogues picked the lock, opening the coffin. Inside was Attica in her Advisor’s robe, her eyes wide open with a red energy flowing through them. <br />
<br />
“It’s a vamp, run…!” yelled one of the gnomes, already running and leaving his friend behind. The Drowess leapt up with unbelievable power, grabbing the little one and biting into his neck, trying to quench the hunger that tortured her for so long… <br />
<br />
But did Attica remember it…? Just barely. As she crept along the mountain tops and out of Mistmoore and back to Faydark, she began to realize where she was. How long was she in that box…? Memories of her being there seemed more than memories of being above the surface. “The Indigo Brotherhood post and Priestess must be near.” She thought, traveling through Lesser Faydark. Finally, she saw some glowing ambers, and what was left of the destroyed camp…<br />
<br />
The Drowess Vampire hissed, feeling she would never escape from this. As Attica set up camp near the ashes of the site, she heard a low scream. She rose up, and traveled through the forest… Why…? Attica indeed would not logically look for trouble… But something in her wanted to be fed. Peering over into a small valley she watched as Cutthroat Bandits kicked a Wood Elf woman. She carried the tattoos of a Cutthroat, so she must have been one of their own.<br />
<br />
Attica X’Layan watched as they beat her… To much of a monster to feel sorry for her, but sorry they are wasting such a tasty morsel. As the bandits left the other for dead, she walked down the hill, looking at the dying Wood Elf with careless eyes.<br />
<br />
“So… A Dark Elf has come to watch me die…?” She said, looking up at Attica. She flashed her fangs at her. “Ahhh… An Agent of Mistmoore instead…” Hungry Attica looked down at her, but… Somehow in her cold heart she felt sorry for the twisted and beaten thing.<br />
<br />
“I offer you an escape from death, but you will forever be bound to me… Bound to do my bidding. You’ll help me destroy the world of Order.” Attica spoke to her, looking into her eyes emotionlessly.<br />
<br />
“How could you ever hope to win? Then they would kill me when we fail…” The Woof Elf started to cough hard, coughing up crimson blood.<br />
<br />
“Would you rather die today?” The Drowess smirked.<br />
<br />
“Save…me…” The Wood Elf fainted. Attica kneeled, and pulled the girl into her lap… She brought her fangs to her jugular and began to drink, and finally, reinjected some of the corrupted blood through her fangs into the Wood Elf.<br />
<br />
The Vampire Drowess leaned against a tree, cradling the dead Wood Elf in her arms. For some reason giving some of the blood back robbed her of some of her strength and made her very tired. After hours of sleeping against the tree, the Wood Elf awoke… No scar, and no longer the tattoos of the Cutthroats that were branded onto her.<br />
<br />
As if she were a child, she looked up into the eyes of Attica… “What is your name…?” X’Layan closed her eyes a second, seeing her title in her mind but not speaking it, until finally, with great dignity it came from her mouth. “My name is Attica X’Layan. And what is yours…?”<br />
<br />
“I am…”<br />
<br />
End of Chapter II</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AtticaX'Layan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chapter III- The Beginning of the Round-up<br />
<br />
“Quarila…? Pathetic Fier’Dal name. You aren’t a back woods dweller anymore. You need a title fit for greatness.” Attica smirked, giving small talk as the two worked they’re way to the Wizard Spires of Greater Faydark. It was troublesome indeed to travel, but with a little help from local Gnome followers of the Dark Arts, the Vampire Drowess had a new spell book, and was able to put up a fight with travelers and steal their supplies, as well as their purse.<br />
<br />
Odd how in the world of right and wrong, chaos and order, and the conflictions and devotions of deities, one can be bought for a reasonable sum. With the bit of money X’Layan and her mentor stole, they were able to bribe for a teleport back to Antonica’s shores.<br />
<br />
The Vampires traveled through the commons outside of Freeport, a land somewhat new to both of them. The former bandit never leaving the lands of Faydwer, while the landscape has changed so much for Attica since her hateful eyes had last seen it. No more merchants…? It was explained to her by a group of Drow who were scavenging the commons for fresh meat that most transactions of trade happened on Lucin. The Vampire Drowess looked at her follower curiously, and then started to cackle uproariously.<br />
<br />
“No, seriously, was this land swept clean by the forces of Innoruuk…?” Attica snickered, trying to get control of herself. To think, everybody is up on the moon! Soon they will be telling her the Trolls are moving into Neriak!<br />
<br />
Sitting around a campfire, the Drow explained many of the happenings in the last few years, assuming Attica was a prisoner somewhere and secluded from such news. Her follower learned a great deal to by many of the stories. Lucin open to Norrath…? Frogloks’ take over of Grobb…? More Planes opened and Gods exposed…? It was to much to take in.<br />
<br />
“What of the Children of Darkness…? Shadow Guard…?” Attica inquired.<br />
<br />
“There is war brewing with The Shadow and the Holy Storm, and as for the Shadow Guard… Long gone.” The Drow lowered their heads in memory of the great Shadow Guard. Attica raised her head. <br />
<br />
“Who leads Children of Darkness now…?”<br />
<br />
“Why, the malevolent Banish.” The three Drow nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
Attica X’Layan looked down a moment and nodded. An memory snapped in her head, it clicked like a fine Gnome mousetrap. “And the Storm, Jethal Silverwing still in charge…?” Her eyes were very serious. Was her old archenemy still alive…?<br />
<br />
“No, but he is alive. He leads the Legion of Kithicor. He strayed from the path of the Knights.”<br />
<br />
Attica rose, and saluted the dark brothers. “Come, let us go to Neriak… Your skin from death has darkened to that of mine. They will just see another Drow now.”<br />
<br />
Along the way, Attica and her mentor spoke. “I must find my old partners. Somewhere in this land is Ponn, Silentheart, Mepthik, and Abaqar, perhaps even Grimz. Alive…? Maybe. They spared me, even though I had some of the worst crimes. It must depend on which cities held trials on them. I am sure with a bribe to the Freeport Militia we can discover the whereabouts of any of them.”<br />
<br />
“But Attica, if they are held in the cities prisons, there is no way we could ever reach them. Are they worth the trouble…?”<br />
<br />
“Well, if you mean worth the trouble of killing a few followers of Order for, yes. But, I do agree the two of us alone may not be enough. We may need to ask assistance from the Children of Darkness. I am not sure if it will be forthcoming of not, but if they do, we will have to owe them a favor.”<br />
<br />
The two walked into the dark, corrupt cavern door into Neriak.<br />
<br />

<br />
Chapter IV-Assistance of The Shadow?<br />
<br />
Attica and her follower walked through the Troll and rat infested streets of Neriak. She grumbled, seeing what has become of Neriak. She tapped a large Troll who stood, blocking a large door toward the Third Quarter.<br />
<br />
“Out of the way you fat, stupid, smelly Troll!” Attica growled. The Troll growled back, but Attica flashed her fangs. The Troll sneered, moving out of the doorway.<br />
<br />
The two creatures made their way to an inn room in Neriak 3rd quarter. There they sat, having informed the innkeeper they wish to “speak with the Shadow”. In Neriak this at least to used to get you an emissary from the Children of Darkness. By the nod and certainty of the innkeeper he understood to inform Banish Dsoul or her minions she wanted to speak to them.<br />
Attica sat at the small table their room, sipping at a large goblet. It’s red contents within a mixture of what was on the two table flasks. Simple, red Elven Wine and delicious Wood Elf blood. Both mixed together well in a fine drink.<br />
<br />
“Do you really think they will come…?” Her apprentice said with a look of uncertainty.<br />
<br />
“Indeed I do, or things have changed more than I thought. Neriak used to crawl with their agents. I highly doubt that has changed. At one time Shadow Guard ruled these halls, and after them that of Children of Darkness. I am not saying I am sure though. Perhaps they are tipping off the Indigo Brotherhood there are factions in town that inquire about another, so we may have to escape from here if needs be.”<br />
<br />
A small knock came at the door, the two Vampires’s heads turning instantly to peer at the door. Attica walked to the door ready for anything… Ready to blast whatever it was or greet it.<br />
<br />
((OOC note: I figure Banish is presently busy with other RPs, so I will put this on hold till her character is free to reply. :P Hope everybody likes my story thus far.))</div></div><hr />
