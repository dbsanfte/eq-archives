		<div>Chapter 2: Cont'd<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Surefall Relik.&quot; Said Nasu as she grinned. &quot;Follow me, we must meet the others.&quot; <br />
Nasu turned and went down the path heading for the large tree in the back of the town. Relik looked up at the tree, and was stunned by the size of it. &quot;This is the Jaggedpine Treefolk, they are the Druids of Surefall Glade.&quot; said Nasu. As they were entering the tree, they noticed a Halfling standing outside. Relik stopped and stared at him. The Halfling looked up and said, &quot;Hail! I am Teggwin, a Rogue of Bristlebane Fizzlethorpe. Can I help ye?&quot; Relik replied, &quot;How did somebody as little as you make it all the way down here?&quot; &quot;Ahh, that would be my Druid friend, Truvan.&quot; answered Teggwin. &quot;I would like to speak with this...Truvan,” said Nasu. &quot;Well, then you will want to be headed to the lake. He said that he was gonna go try and catch some fish&quot; said Teggwin. <br />
<br />
Nasu hurried over to the lake while Relik stayed behind. A few hours later Nasu hurried back with another person. The man pulled down his hood and Relik saw that he was also a Wood Elf like Nasu. The man was carrying a sword that had green leaves floating from it. &quot;I am Truvan, a Druid from the wonderful city of Kelethin. I have also received a summons, although I do not know what for,” said the Druid. <br />
&quot;I think it has something to do with the Dark Elves,” replied Nasu. <br />
Teggwin stepped forward and said, &quot;Maybe we should journey closer Neriak, the city of Dark Elves?&quot; <br />
&quot;I do not like the sound of that.&quot; Relik said nervously. <br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a loud noise as if the very air was being torn apart. The group was nearing the druid ring when six souls appeared in the previously empty circle. It was an odd assortment of races with a regal high elf woman who was apparently in charge. Accompanying her were an Erudite resplendent in rich purple robes, a colorful Froglok, a powerful-looking Dwarf, a wiry Gnome, and the human druid who had ported them in. <br />
<br />
Nasu kneeled before the pale and beautiful high elf and said, “Respect, Mistress. I am relieved to see that you have arrived safely. I was concerned for your safety after encountering three minions of evil in Qeynos.” <br />
<br />
“Please rise and let us not bother with such formalities. We have much to do and no time for such trivialities.” She smiled at Nasu, taking the sting out of the gentle rebuke. “We encountered no difficulties on our travels, nor did I expect to, due to the excellent talents of our guide, the druid Laoden. Thank you for your transportation to this place. You have done Norrath and our Mother Tunare a great service. We must proceed with our meeting immediately, if all is ready.” <br />
<br />
Laoden bowed briefly and replied, “Yes, milady. All has been arranged according to your instructions. If you will follow me, we will go to the prepared place.” <br />
<br />
Laoden led the group toward the bear caves. They entered and followed many twisting passages until they came to a large room furnished with a huge table surrounded by ten chairs. Torches on the walls burned brightly giving the room a warm, inviting feel. <br />
<br />
“Would you like for me to send for drink to settle the travel dust in our throats, milady?” inquired Laoden. <br />
<br />
“Yes, that would be most welcome. The rest of you please have a seat so we may begin.” <br />
<br />
A young half elf appeared silently and listened intently to Laoden’s instructions. She nodded and slipped quickly away. Laoden took the remaining seat at the table. <br />
<br />
“Allow me to begin by introducing the members of our company. To my right is Arenth, Lead wizard from Erudin; next we have Gribbet, a master shaman from Gukta; Gurundel, cleric from Kaladim; and an arch mage from Ak’Anon, Mistress Calera. On my left is Nasu, Ranger of Kelethin; Relik, warrior of Halas; Truvan, druid of Tunare, also from Kelethin; and Teggwin, our stealthy rogue from Rivervale. For those of you that don’t know me, I am Lady Erissa, most powerful enchantress in our guild in Felwithe.” <br />
<br />
The members of the group nodded in greeting to each other and then looked expectantly at Lady Erissa, waiting to hear why they had been summoned here so urgently. Erissa gazed sadly at the gathered representatives of nearly all the good races of Norrath. What she had to say would not be easy for them to hear. <br />
<br />
“I must begin with the briefest of background information so you will know the importance of my message. It is not widely known, but when the Elves were created by our Mother, Tunare , entrusted to us a gem called the Paragon. This deep green stone with a living fire in its center is the source of all the mana that allows the good races to practice the magical arts. Lord Innoruuk bestowed a similar black gem to his corrupted, evil dark elves for the same purpose. I have learned from a very trusted source that the invidious guilds of The Dead in Neriak, the Heretics of Paineel, and the Dark Reflection of Ak’Anon have joined forces in order to learn how they might steal and then corrupt the Paragon. This would strip us of all mana and add it to their pool, leaving us at their mercy. I am sorry to say that they are close to succeeding!” <br />
The group let out a surprised gasp. Relik had heard of this stone, the Paragon. He never thought that it was real. The story of its making was a popular one in Halas among the mothers to their children. And he had heard it many times. Although he had no use for the Mana he knew that in the wrong hands it could very well cause the breaking of the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;That is why I have collected the very best from across Norrath to help put a stop to those who wish to take the Paragon. That is why we must investigate this further.&quot; The elf paused for a moment while she took a sip from the drink that had arrived moments earlier. &quot;The gem has been safe in its location for quite some time now but recent attempts at thievery and force have come close to breaking our forces. It is only a matter of time before they actually do have control. We will need to go the Faydark to collect this gem. We will take it to its new place of rest. Where no one will find it but the keepers.&quot; <br />
The high elven woman sighed as if a great weight had been flung upon her shoulders. Relik noticed the pain in her eyes and the sagging feeling in her heart. She was entrusted with a big responsibility. He could almost see the weight of the world resting on her shoulders. <br />
&quot;We must retire for the night, there is nothing more we can do. I will answer all your questions when I can, but at this time I cannot. There are matters I must attend to here in Surefall.&quot; She walked to the edge of the small area they were in and peeked her head out motioning for a servant to come in. &quot;The young Alyina will show you all to your quarters, please follow her.&quot; <br />
<br />
Relik had many questions but he knew that everything would come together in time, like all things have a habit of doing. He stood and walked out following Alyina. <br />
<br />
The servant led them to the only inn in the small village, which stood under the tall Jaggedpine Trees. The rooms were split up in pairs, Relik was staying with the Halfling Rogue Teggwin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Better sleep with my sack under my head tonight&quot; thought Relik to himself. He continued down the hall towards his room with the others, eager to get a good nights rest.</div>
