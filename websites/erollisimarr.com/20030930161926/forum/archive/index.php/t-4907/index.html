<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seelendieb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well dunno where i should put that down so i put him into scammer alert.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
I been sitting with my twink cleric in ass room to res a friend.<br />
I waited till the corpse got draged there, meanwhile his grp was camping it. Remeber im a cleric lvl 45 female. He said this room is camped and i should leave where i dont belong. I didnt answer. Than he says that i need a kick in the arse.<br />
I said that he should behave or i would report him.<br />
He said: ya leaving now ass<br />
<br />
Than i reported him<br />
<br />
After i resed the friend i waited a bit longer in hope the gm/guide would come since he kept inspecting me (prolly wanted me to go ld) and said some other stuff to show his immature (like shouting that i am ksing and such). Well his grp left him than and suddenly i had a lil train on us (dont know if it was his train or not but i think it was him)<br />
<br />
He camped than on Smidget telliing me: Hey when i get the stuff back which you stole??<br />
<br />
I whispered back: ??<br />
<br />
He said: yeah ya think it is funny to steal ppl??<br />
<br />
I said: Oh ya must be Dillydog right?? Did the gms already talked to ya?<br />
<br />
He said: lol yes and i told em that ya steal and i gonna petition and report ya every day now. ya better not log on<br />
<br />
I said: oh thats fine with me, just shows em how immature you are and rides ya even deeper in it.<br />
<br />
He said nobody messes with me. ya scared? i hope ya scared now lil bitch.<br />
<br />
Than i reported Smidget.<br />
<br />
I hope the GM will take care of him. In the case he is in any Guild (he been anon or on role if he isnt in any), so i would suggest them to observe this little boy a bit and decide if his behavior is good or not.<br />
<br />
I posted this just so the few ppl who gonna read the board and see smidget/Dillydog telling lies about Lexotica, Brainstorm or Seelendieb not to trust him .<br />
<br />
/e wishes that online game would have an iq test b4 ya able to play it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tumyeto Toeslasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always hated this annoying little tard.<br />
<br />
Dunno why, maybe its cause his name sux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even if someone is Anon or Role - you can always check their guild by doing a /guildstatus if they are in the same zone - then you can report his actions to their guildleadership. Just a friendly FYI.<br />
<br />
=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seelendieb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know Krrak, but after he camped i decided to leave too and gated to nektolous to meet a friend, than smidget started to send me tells, so we werent in same zone.<br />
And Dillydog wasnt in any guild (as far as i know, havent checked him), since i normally dont check the guild since the guild has normally nothing to do with a single persons bad behavior.<br />
<br />
Just wanted that the guild he is on (like i said if he is in any) to have an eye on him so he wont do to much damage to their whole reputation. Since i havent checked it i mentioned it here<br />
<br />
Maybe he had a pretty bad day and little boys tend to do than something which they regret later, and in my eyes he is only a little boy. Not worth to be taken to seriously. But i love to help little kids like him to come back to the nice way, and thats something only GMs can do in eq. Thats why i reported him, so he gets a warning hopefully and wont do it more often to other players to try to ruin their reputation by telling lies or even shouting lies thoughout a whole zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toxx The Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If he ever threatened to have a GM that he says is a &quot;friend&quot; ban you, HE can get in trouble.<br />
<br />
I got someone suspeneded for doing that. He was pissed at me for disagreeing with him in /ooc. (I love DL some times) He told me that I better watch out, because he is going to have two of his GM friends ban my account. A simple report, and I never saw him online again. (I find it easier to put certain people that I don't like on my friends list, rather than my ignore list :cool:  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tullywak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was one of the peeps in the Ass/sup room had been camping it for awhile , days in fact. He was a pain I am sorry if he anoyed ya , get me in game and I will tell ya a few things.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>solarise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aye, i was the friend who got rezzed by lexotica/seelendieb...and aye dillydog was being very immature and rude.  we only stayed for rez b/c that was the only main landmark known by my corpse dragger..it didn't seem like we interfered w/ the camp at all, and certainly weren't there to KS or anything, just for rez, and we both left...i believe dillydog did train my friend as we were leaving.<br />
<br />
thanks seelendieb for all your help &lt;3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Razer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw something about Smidget the other day in guild chat. I forget what it was about, all I remember is that I didn't like it. I simply sent him a tell saying &quot;Rude!&quot; and he just replied back with a &quot;Rude!&quot;  I think he got a port or something, and then ran off, so the porter said &quot;you're welcome&quot; and he said &quot;@#%$ you&quot; to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RetiredSlazzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He's just trying to wake people up and show them its a game and you guys piss on him. I think its funny how you guys bitch all the time...<br />
<br />
Dillydog if you read this, you should come down sometime.<br />

<br />
Anyone who tries to say anything against that is a jerk, plain and simple, and nothing will convince me that they aren't, no matter how hard they try.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the warning :)</div></div><hr />
