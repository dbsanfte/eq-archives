<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ysall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lamli, sure hope you enjoy that Tunic of Kinship you ninja looted (for the short time you have it before the GMs take if off you).<br />
<br />
The really sad thing is, we have no interest in Rumblecrush loot, and were about to ask for tells from the zone to random it to anyone in the zone who could use.  So who knows, you might well have got it for free anyway.  And no, dont try deny it, we saw your /ooc when we told the zone what had dropped asking if you could have it, the entire guild stood and watches you loot it, and someone even inspected you, and lo and behold, you even had the crass stupidity to have put it straight on.<br />
<br />
Not going to bring up your guilds name, suffice to say they responded appropriately, so should not be dragged down by your misdemeanour.<br />
<br />
GL finding a new guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lamli, u really are retarded... sorry this person was dumb Ysall, was truly nice of you guys to give the loot to the zone.. another nice gesture of CE :) (assuming it was your guild)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ysall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GM's promised they would arrange for it to be passed to a Beastlord who happened to be in the zone and who said it would be a big upgrade for him.  With any luck he should have a real nice surprise in his backpack next time he logs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ysall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and yes, it was CE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ysall, I still love ya though. <br />
(maybe a bit more after a few doses of kei...)<br />
<br />
It was an interesting situation and now I find it pretty funny. So just don't be slammin on Lamil Otep, he didn't do eeet !<br />
<br />
Thank you, drive through.<br />
<br />
Also congrats to the beastlord you guys helped out, thats awosome !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xerion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did you guys &quot;lock&quot; the corpse to prevent this from happening?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kalrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">how does that have any bearing on his theft?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xerion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">how does that have any bearing on his theft? <br />
<br />
Um if they had locked the corpse, then he wouldn't have gotten the chance to ninjaloot unless the timer kicks them off. If they didn't, then they are partially at fault for not taking the necessary precautions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ice Weasel X</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Uh, no.  Is the rape victim at fault for not wearing a chastity belt?  Is the homeowner at fault if a thief smashes into his window to gain entry because he didn't add bars over the glass panes?  Those are extreme examples, but it's his fault for stealing.  They shouldn't have to lock the corpse because you aren't supposed to loot a corpse that belongs to another party or raid without their consent.  There's a reason GMs intervene in situations like this.  See that other thread about the Grummus ninja looter?  That simple act earned the guy a banning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadowraven00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ouch that sucks that a simple act of kindness burned y'all.  Glad the looter got caught. <br />

  Somehow it doesn't surprise me that Xerion is blaming CE.  Things like kindness and being nice are alien to him.  T<br />
<br />
  To him its CE's  fault for trusting their fellow players. I am really glad I have never met you IG<br />

<br />
No but it would be her fault for wearing skimpy &quot;Hey look at me! Come fuck meh&quot; clothing.<br />
<br />
Is the homeowner at fault if a thief smashes into his window to gain entry because he didn't add bars over the glass panes?  <br />
<br />
Yes because he didn't make an effort to add bars to his windows to  safeguard his stuff.<br />
<br />
They shouldn't have to lock the corpse because you aren't supposed to loot a corpse that belongs to another party or raid without their consent. <br />
<br />
By locking the corpse, you are in a way, ENSURING that your stuff doesn't get ninjalooted. It's all about precautionary measures.<br />
<br />
Somehow it doesn't surprise me that Xerion is blaming CE. Things like kindness and being nice are alien to him <br />
<br />
I wonder what fucking world you come from. You're probably that same guy that Ice Weasel mentioned who's stuff got stolen because he never protected his shit. And you laugh about it. /b:confused:ggle I guess common sense is funny to you since you obviously have none. <br />
<br />
To him its CE's fault for trusting their fellow players.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, you can't trust everyone in this game.<br />

<br />
How do you know the rape victim was wearing skimpy clothes? My one of my close female friends was raped and she wears far from anything that could be considered tight or sexy.<br />
<br />
Women dont always get raped for the way they dress, many are raped by sexual predators who just dont care about who they hurt.<br />

Story of 3 women raped by a man, each over the age of 70, I hardly dout they were wearing skimpy and sexy clothes.</div></div><hr />

So you read and &quot;laugh about my stupidity&quot; as you claim it doesn't seem to bother you. But then....<br />

I got your Lemmings, bitch. It's called the Arena; you /tell me any time.<br />

Define inappropriate. Seems like alot of the posts on this thread are &quot;inappropriate&quot; but they still remain.</div></div><hr />

I blame Microsoft's Word for my Engrish.<br />
<br />
As for the other posts, Lurkerr is only a few posts away from getting banned too with those annoying and completely useless one-liners. I'm letting the rest stay but if you're bothered by it, feel free to report any of them (again).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Poog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Why put Bars over your window - a thief smashing through your window to get in is still illegal, its called burglary. <br />
<br />
Why should they have to &quot;lock&quot; the stupid corpse, stealing is stealing. He didnt have consent from CE to loot anything, and if you read the rules of the game, looting without consent of the person(s) responsable for the kill is a violation of the game. <br />
<br />
You blame Ysall for not &quot;locking&quot; an item, so your saying that lamli is not at fault for anything of any sort in this :confused: i cant believe you, they try to do something nice and when someone steals you blame them when they could have just looted and destroyed the item.  :mad: get a life....<br />

you're not gonna get a response from him Pooganes.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
one less set of non sense to have to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Irulan Dunedancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Geez, you sheep just can't fucking read. Apparently, neither can you.  Ysall (or maybe Hoppkins; darn Brits getting me confused  :p ) stated that they'd been keeping the corpse locked.  Lamli just snuck in (or stood there and spam-clicked) and ninja'ed when they unlocked it so someone else could loot something that they'd won/been given (a shield, I believe).<br />
<br />
So if we want to stick with your analogy, bars on the windows don't do jack if you get accosted at the door after you've opened it.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt wanna do that, then I wouldnt get my Daily laughs from your Posts, not saying I would miss them if you got Banned, but wouldnt waste my time ignoring you, cause something you are worth is a good laugh while at work.</div></div><hr />
