<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lgdood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was grouped in PoD the other day doing my normal auction in the auction channel when I got a tell from Linkin asking how much I wanted for my frostbringer, spiked velium mallet and rigid steelweave greaves,<br />
<br />
 from my prices it added up to 23k, he asked me if I would take a 25k spell for it,  cause he didnt care about the plat.<br />
<br />
 I asked him what spell it was, he linked me a copy of Talisman of Shadoo<br />
 ( http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=2258 )<br />
<br />
I did a PC in guild, I didnt think a Poison resist buff could be worth 25k, no one in my guild seemed to think it would be worth more than 500plat<br />
<br />
so I started asking some other people, Monorail, some guild shamans in tells and such when all of a sudden I got a tell from Worlaen, who I had NEVER asked a pc from, hes not in my guild and he cant hear my tells, saying &quot;25-30k&quot;<br />
<br />
When I asked Linkin about it, he told me he was a silly guildmate.<br />
<br />
aftter that point I told him I didnt wanty to trade, in which we got into a small arguement (he wanted to know why)<br />
<br />
anywho, I thought I should give a heads up, just seems like a shady dealing to me<br />

<br />
As for the value of the spell,i wouldn't pay more than 100pp for it,can easily be gotten in turn ins from spells you can buy for 50pp in bazaar.<br />

<br />
Exact same think happened to a guild member two days ago who stated Linkin wanted to trade this spell for an RBG (20k-28k?).  Have also been on the receiving end of about 20+ inspect in a min. or less from this tool.  That hits my ignore list quick.  Must have a second account or many people to assist in his 'Inflation' of prices to answer PC's as the PC when my guild member asked also came back as this persons did- right near his asking/stated price...which is a little (sarcasm) high for a group poison buff that is fairly common.<br />
<br />
And for the troll 'ers' this is not another 'This price is too high/low thread' this would be a 'this person hits the pipe before hitting the bazaar' thread.  1k-5k markup, who cares ill pay it if I want it now,  not a scam.  25k-30k and getting someone to answer the PC is a 'Scammer' in my eyes.  Don't ask me where the limit is...your limit is your own, mine is 20k+.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness for the ignore feature, saves so much heartache.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen this guy in auction lately a lot.  He wanted me to sell him a fungi tunic that I have on my monk (was trading some stuff between Jorfe and monk, when he started inspecting the monk over an over).  I told him; if it is for sale, I'll put it up for sale on my trader.  One thing I hate is when someone tries to get me to trade something or sell them something I'm not selling or trading.  Next I saw him asking for PLing and buffs in ooc and in auction channel.  I was about to say to him; hey why don't you just ask someone to play your character for you that way you don't even have to work at it, but since I'm a kinder, gentler Jorfe these days...<br />
<br />
I also saw him in PoK trying to sell a mana battery 6 for 20k, claiming it was a rare item, this can be bought in at least two places that I know for a little over 100plat.  Yes I'll say he's a scammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tried this exact same scam on me.  Wanted  my belt of the great turtle.  I had seen him auctioning a lot of different stuff constantly changing so i figured he was one of those buy low sell high guys so i figured the spell wasn't worth 25k in real.  Glad i refused....</div></div><hr />

Talisman of Shadoo's most frequent use for a shaman is as a junk buff when PR isn't required.  Talisman of Epuration or Talisman of the Tribunal are used for PR/DR on raids. <br />
<br />
The fact Shadoo is more recently now a level 61 BST (53 SHM) spell is probably how he's trying to angle the scam, since many beastlord's may not be aware of how EASY it is acquire this spell via this quest which I've written a spoiler for here:<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2783[/url]<br />
<br />
Fortunately, he wasn't even smart enough to tailor his scam to his potentially best target (BST's), and now he's been revealed.<br />
<br />
I personally would valuate Talisman of Shadoo between 100-500pp.  If I had an extra copy, I'd give it to an up and coming  main free, since sometimes those Kunark turn-in spell quests can be a pita, especially if you have faction problems.<br />
<br />
Using friends or secondary accounts to grossly inflate a PC on an item that is so severely overpriced as this case was IS scamming in my opinion.<br />
<br />
[U]Summary:<br />
Linkin=Scammer<br />
Worlaen=Assistant Scammer (maybe just a scammer's friend)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up Courtny, and to all those who replied with independent confirmations of this scam.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shadowraven00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Greetings good people, <br />
<br />
   Aye once again Frekkels is right as far as I know Talisman of Shadoo nowadays isn't worth more than 500pp at the max.  <br />
<br />
  As for this tool Linkin I will be sure to avoid him, sadly the increase of scammers is no surprise to me and its gonna get worse with the new expansion. *sigh* :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
  As for Worlaen I know Wor we were in a guild together and have talked often.  Hes a pretty good guy but to be prefectly honest it wouldn't surprise me if he told you it was worth that much so his friend could get the spell.  Sorry Wor but as you well know I know your recent history IG and I had to say it. <br />
<br />
  Anyhoo good to know you didn't trade it for that PoS spell which I hardly ever used when I was that lvl.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Denshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">unfortunaly enough, the mass increase  of scammers is giving us traders a bad name.  I have   lost count of the times  of the  idiots who  have tried to scam me that i petitioned/reported.  As far as linkin he frankly annoys the hell out of me at times,and i honestly cant stand him. <br />
All i ask is that everyone dosnt look on us traders in a bad light thanks  to some idiot kids that decided to start scamming people this summer.  <br />
 On another note, i'm working on getting as many of these jerk scammers busted as possible , my advice is the following<br />
<br />
1.  Ask your guild for pcs or ask a pc several times in the auction channel (auction:auction), make sure you know  your items value.<br />
<br />
2.  Do not, i repeat not give someone a item first without cash, they are 80% of the time trying to scam you.  They can use the shared bank to transfer items so dont believe  any crap they say.<br />
<br />
3.    Be careful of who you give shared accounts, there has been a increase of people losing their accounts, just a heads up.<br />
<br />
welp i'm done all, if yah need  help or suspect someone of trying to scam you, just catch me ig =)<br />
