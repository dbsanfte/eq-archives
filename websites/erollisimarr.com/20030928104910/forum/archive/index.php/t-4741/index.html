<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dundridge DweomerDoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...Brothers of Obsidian, is this what you really want ?<br />
<br />
Do not test the patience of wizards.<br />
<br />
The League of Non-Aligned Wizards has always in the past regarded the Brothers of Obsidian &quot;indifferently&quot; as long as no wizards were harmed in their petty squabbles.<br />
<br />
However, we have never made a secret of our policies about guilds who violate the rights of wizards.  Guilds have been warned that the League will intervene on behalf of the wizard.<br />
<br />
There is currently a &quot;cover up&quot; taking place at the hall of the Brothers of Obsidian, and their leadership does not want you to find out the truth.<br />
<br />
We would have barely looked twice at them last week.<br />
<br />
Now I find that the Brothers of Obsidian have commited injustices against wizards, and this we cannot tolerate.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the cover up simply irks us.<br />
<br />
Let it be known that we are now actively seeking Edwrin Obsidian out, in order to have a nice, quiet, cosy &quot;chat&quot; with him.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obsidian has been disbanded for about a year now.</div></div><hr />
