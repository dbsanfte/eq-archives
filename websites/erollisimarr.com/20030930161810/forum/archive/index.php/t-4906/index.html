<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Megaeros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't believe this druid decided to ruin his reputation over something as small as a Mithril Breastplate, but he surely did ninja it on July 13th.<br />
<br />
After grouping with him for over 2 hours, he was looting every corpse before it could drop, but no big deal there, since I wanted XP more than some plat. But the last straw was when he decided to run off with the Mith BP after the cleric in the group had won the roll (soo sorry about that Styches).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meglaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We'll this is all news to me. I have been off EQ from 11 july till 18 July. I have a feeling that someone has used my account while I was gone. I thought it was odd that while on a Vox raid the 18th a cleric had said he rezed me the days before. I told him he must be mistaken , do to the fact that my video card took a dump on the 10th and i was waiting for the new one to come in the mail.<br />
   I want to do whats right here, and i have checked my account and do have a Mith Bp I did not have before. So Styches, i not only want to return whats rightfully yours but apoligize for the whole thing. I know myself even if its crap it sucks to be robbed. I also will through in a few 100 pp .<br />
   Oh , and last but not least to the F*ck that used my account, and yea i know who you are. Play your owen sad as* chars and get a life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Devla Shadowsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds a bit iffy to me... possibility of the ole &quot;I don't wanna ruin my rep, so I'll spin some bullshit about someone else using my account&quot; excuse.<br />
<br />
/shrug may be real though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ysall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry, but the old 'Someone else logged my char' excuse just doesnt cut it.  First off, if you know who it is, name them and all their characters.  If you can't, or won't, or name chars noone can verify even exist, then I think we can all make our own decision on what really happened here.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if someone had ninj's using your char, why did they leave the BP on you char instead of transferring it to their own char?  It doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
I speak as someone who char was looted by a 'friend' who claimed someone else must have done it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lurkerr the Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What a crock of @#%$. <br />
<br />
Somebody used your account? yeah right. You were stupid enough to ninja and then ever more stupid to try and deny it.<br />
<br />
Smooth move, hope it works out for ya.</div></div><hr />
