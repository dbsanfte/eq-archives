<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cribra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bought this stripped account with a lvl 50 Necromancer about a month ago.  (Yes, im a nitwit and think people aren't out to get you.)  <br />
<br />
So, after about a month I've got this necromancer all armored out and up to lvl 53.  I try to log on one day and the password has changed.  <br />
<br />
I see Snayin online and say, WTF is going on?  He says, the old bullshit about how he was hacked while on vacation and just got back. (yeah right)<br />
<br />
So 2 days later he is posting selling lvl 53 stripped necro for 30k (omg laf) on the boards here.<br />
<br />
Just heads up, don't buy the Snayin account.<br />

All the original owner has to do is get in touch with VI and change their password. Happens everyday to people who buy charectors. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slazzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey @#%$ face, he was hacked, and most likely by you. He did go away for a while and whoever @#%$ around with his account stripped him down to nothing. If anything your the hacker who scammed him, so shut the @#%$ up and get your story straight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ifookinsuck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok man..i dont care wtf you think..but..its the truth about me getting hacked..and the reason why you had it for 1 month (more then likely you ARE lying about that) is because i had a famil emergency in New-Brunswhick...after about 2 weeks i came back...and sure...i didnt get it back then..because i have a @#%$ life unlike you..i have friends to hang out with..places to go...stuff to do..and if you say all ths is BS..then your even dumber then anyone could even imagine...sorry..but..i wasent gonna keep paying for someone else to play on MY account when i DID NOT sell it to anyone..sorry to burst your bubble...but..you do need to get your story straight before you post here..cause you just falsely accused someone for no fukin reason..so next time...you should try to figure out who you bought it from and try to check on his or her's rep not to get gipped...cause it sure as hell isnt my fault you got gangek by someone who hacked my account..</div></div><hr />

Fact remains it happened to me with that account.  So, I really don't care anymore at this point.  I just agree with Treage, and I've learned my lesson.<br />

<br />
p.s. blaming me as the 'hacker'?  good lord....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cribra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What are you retarded?!?! <br />
<br />
someone already posted that they almost bought the account, and if you go to auctions you will still be able to pull up his auction that he is selling it again. so i guess your account has been &quot;hacked&quot; again if you dont really wanna sell it.  <br />
<br />
and buying an account wasnt a good idea since people are asses about it.  one lesson learned the hard way. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Midggett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How is it that you get an account back anyway? Is it through the account key or the credit card number? I know you have to go thru verant but..<br />
=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toxx The Wizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How is it that you get an account back anyway? <br />
<br />
From what I have gathered from previous posts about account scams, it is very simple. You must sound less intelligent than the person whom has your account; if it is your account in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ifookinsuck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">crib..note how they said ALMOST...but they didnt..and i dont really care if you guys dont beleive me cause i know im telling the truth..and your blaming me cause i got my account back..as ive said before...it sure as hell isnt my fault you got duked out of cash..and to answer the question about whats makes em think i wont take back the account and such..its because if i DO sell the account..ill be happy with that money..i could care less about any more..and how would i sell the account again? especially since im a good 'scammer'..but..whatever..i got nothing else to say here..hope you get your story straight someday man..cause accusing people of scamming when their not..thats just destroying a guys rep for no reason what so ever..sorry you got duked..but. it isnt my fault</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enbekay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I was really really desperate for money, I would pull this off.<br />
<br />
It would be quite easy.<br />
<br />
1. Origionally create an account and get character to high level.<br />
<br />
2. Remember account name and password.<br />
<br />
3. Sell on EBay for X dollars.<br />
<br />
4. Recieve X dollars and email/mail the account information.<br />
<br />
5.  Wait like 2 or 3 days and go through the &quot;origional account owner&quot; deal people sometimes do.  All you need is the origional credit card number... I think.<br />
<br />
6. Take account back and resell for X dollars.<br />
<br />
That is probably what happened to you.  Plus you can't do @#%$ legally to the person because ebay doesn't recognize the selling of fake items (pixles).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thrasy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am posting only because I know Enantiomer and Aziline in real life and you cheated the crap out of them man.<br />
<br />
I can verify that everything that Enantiomer and Aziline have said regarding this matter is 100% true.<br />
<br />
I am glad they posted here cause you are a cheat and I hope that you get so black listed that you are never able to do it again.  If you are so attached to your character you would never even suggest that you might sell it (again).<br />
<br />
You reaped a huge benefit from Enan and Azi by having them level yer char up to 53 (and then you stole it back).<br />
<br />
I wish that Verant, Ebay and the local authorities treated all of this stuff like true personal property.  I believe they should allow for the purchase and sale of these characters just like any other piece of property.  They should deem these sales of characters as binding contracts that people enter into so that people have recourse.  <br />
<br />
I would love to be able to contact your local police department and have you prosecuted for theft, fraud and criminal misrepresentation.  Then I'd bring you into small claims court for breach of contract, tortious interference with property and every other damn thing I could sue you for.<br />
<br />
I think it is lame that you even try to save face with your lies.<br />
<br />
However, I am glad to have learned this valuable lesson regarding character purchases so that I won't ever do it.<br />
<br />
Go sell your hack story BS somewhere else.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Traxl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you really wanted to start some trouble, a simple email to Verant with the station ID for the acct and the characters/server information would  probably get it banned so no one could sell it.  The one drawback to this is it does have the distinct possibillity of getting your acct banned as well.<br />
<br />
However, if you are buying an acct with a lvl 50 necromancer, then your personal characters might not be all that high of a level.  Therefore, you could just buy another legit acct and start over, with the satisfaction that the acct stolen from you would never be stolen again.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raedwulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Snayin:  If you wish others to believe what you say, which is the only explanation for your action here, try using real words, punctuation and proper grammar.  And if you want to be believed, you probably shouldn't have scammer friends like Snazzer try and back you up.  <br />
<br />
If you are again selling your account, stripped, even the stupidest person on this site isn't going to believe you.  As no one has ever been &quot;hacked&quot; in this game that I've ever heard, you should probably use appropriate terms, ie. &quot;I gave my account information to another scamming arsehole of a friend of mine, and he sold it to someone.&quot;  Nothing was hacked.<br />

Do the math fuckwad (or in your case get someone else to do it for you because of your obvious lack of intelligence) how have I devoted my life to a message board when I have made roughly 4 posts a day? I know it would probably take you a lifetime to compose one intelligent post but honestly I am a lot quicker at it than you, but hey I don't look down on the &quot;special&quot; people like you , after all someone has to serve me at McDonalds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>omikron22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Here goes....<br />
<br />
Snayin, while still 51 traded his necromancer for Desenyea, a 51 darkelf warrior.  He still owns the warrior and has leveled it up to 53.  The person who had Snayin sold it to ent, who  proceeded to level up to 53 and get some warlocks gear among other good droppable gear.  Then Desenyea sold the account back out for a scimitar of the emerald dawn and SCHW to a friend of mine IRL.  I have the account keys and billing information on Snayin AND Desenyea (considering I owned desenyea for a while being friends with Dsenier) and if he pulls another pullback with Snayin, I will take the account back, move snayin to another account, then proceed to take desenyea and move him to another account and see him cry when it happens to him.<br />
<br />
I know paragraphs are my friend, but not today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>omikron22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Oh yeah... forgot to mention that he must have stolen account back from ent then sold it.  So you dont have to ask if thats a threat, i'd say it is considering I can ruin his everquest life if he scams again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>omikron22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">erm basically, as long as you dont steal snayin from my friend, who bought him.  Then everything is cool, hopefully you really are telling the truth that if you sell him then you will be happy with the plat.  I put more thought into it and decided to take some early action.  If you do steal the account back, you will notice that he just moved Snayin to another account.  Sure it costed 50 bucks, but now he can be certain that you cant scam with that account anymore.  So if you decide to steal the account, you will get nothing but another account to pay for and your other password may randomly change.  So GL with the items he gave you and have fun with Desenyea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>omikron22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I did sit down and level, my friend did not.  Learn to read and you wont sound so stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Dawnen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Some things that MIGHT protect you when buying accounts:<br />
<br />
1) Only buy with someone with a high Playerauction or Ebay rating.<br />
<br />
2) Ask for the original discs when you buy the account.  Agree to pay $4 extra to have those discs sent to you priority mail.  Don't send payment for the account until you have the discs.  That way, if the person is indeed a scammer, even if they were to try and scam you, you could get the account banned by Verant, which would only leave the scammer with the same amount of cash as they would have gotten just by selling you the account.  If the person isn't the original owner, then be very cautious.<br />
<br />
3) Deal with high level people in well known, well respected guilds.  Then talk to other people in that guild about the transaction.<br />
<br />
4) Don't deal with people that seem to be in a rush to complete the deal.  A good deal today is a good deal tomorrow.<br />
<br />
5) If the deal seems to good to be true, then it is probably a scam.   <br />
<br />
None of these will protect you 100%, but if you are careful, you most likely won't get ripped off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kerryn Darkwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Enan got the account he bought taken off him. Oh well. Sucks to be you. At least he realises this.<br />
<br />
Snayin, you got your account stripped and sold because you gave your details to somone. So not only is it your responsibility that this has happened, it's also your fault that Enan got scammed. He took it out on you with good cause because whether you jacked your account back for good reason it woulnd't have happened if you'd have kept your details to yourself.<br />
<br />
And as said earlier having Slazzer as your back-up is not going to do you any favours.<br />
<br />
Omikron, tell your friend that he's begging for the account to be jacked back again and please tell him not to come posting here for sympathy. Also the statement that you posted about him moving the character to another account is bull, he could not do it without the original CD Key and the credit card used must be in the name of the person who originally payed for the account.<br />
<br />
You don't need the exact same card but you do need the same name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>RetiredSlazzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Shut the @#%$ up Omikron, yes he did steal it back from you, i know this because he is my RL friend but ONLY because your donkey @#%$ @#%$ traded accounts and then right after you went on to your old one and stripped it. Then being the good friend i am, i spend 20k on him to get him started, which at the time was all my money and i was never extremly well equiped. Then you come up with a @#%$ load of lame ass stories of what happened...<br />
