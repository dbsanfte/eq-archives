<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silentheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Her golden blonde hair was losely braided.  The braid stopped near the small of her back.  A small piece of ribbon held the soft ends together.  She grabbed her black cap and tied it around her neck.  The young rogue placed the hood over her head.  The excess fabric around the edges hiding her face in the darkness.  Her ice cold blue eyes shimmered out from the black fabric.<br />
<br />
In the distance, she could hear the waterfall of the Glade.  She grinned slightly.  It always amazed her how one of evil could be befriended here.  She was one of two faces.  Not many knew that.  Not many ever would.<br />
<br />
The rogue walked quickly, yet softly to the Hills of Qeynos.  The familar face of a dear druid waited there.  She smiled as the druid whispered the words of camoflouge.  The rogue leaned to kiss him on the cheek.  With a few more whispered words, the rogue stood in West Commons.  She bid farewell to her dear druid and made her way for East Commonlands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah...I swear this tunnel never sees a day that no one steps foot here,&quot;  the lady rogue mummbled under her breath.  She took to her shadows to feel safer among the mass of people.<br />
<br />
The rogue rested her feet near the Shady Swashbuckler.  She cheered softly as a fellow rogue gave Shady some trouble.  It was a cute little dwarf.  Even though Kaladim disliked her elven face, she still thought dwarves were fun to play with.<br />
<br />
As she sat there she lady her head back against the wall of the tunnel.  A black raven feather drifted across her face.  It danced in the wind that held it dear.  She grabbed it tightly in her hand and studied it.  Her eyes closed as her mind drifted, &quot;I hate memories at times...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aura...Silentheart....&quot; the wind whispered.<br />
<br />
The rogue's eyes flashed open.  The turned cold and evil, yet sparkled with the moisture of tears.  A figure stood in front of her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Who is there?&quot; She whispered in common tongue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silentheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The figure standing before her was thin frammed, though cloaked heavily in robes and disguise.  &quot;Answer me now, Who is it that stands before me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I come from Kelethin ma'am.&quot;  The man spoke softly in elven tongues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot; She muttered quickly in Thieve's Cant as she stood up.  &quot;What brings a messanger of Kelethin to seek me out?&quot;  the rogue said in elven.<br />
<br />
&quot;The commitee is meeting.  Since the Starfyre's have seemed to vanish, they are choosing who shall lead Kelethin,&quot; the messanger stopped his words.  He had small, brown eyes.  They showed every bit of his anxiousness around the rogue.  &quot;Aura, I know you bare the mark of Starfyre, and the last of that name.  It is your right to control Kelethin and the elves, m'lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aura glared at the young wood elf.  No one knew or had called her by that name in years.  &quot;Tell me how it is you knew me to be the one that would answer to Aura Starfyre.&quot;<br />
<br />
She could she the young elf shake in front of her.  She hid her happy little grin.  Her head tilted to the side as he began to speak.  &quot;Ambassador D'Vinn....&quot; the young elf's voice cracked as he spoke.<br />
<br />
Aura's eyes flashed an icy blue.  With a quick movement, she stood behind the quiervering elven man.  She had placed a dagger at his throat and his back.  &quot;Listen to me well young one, tell D'Vinn to deliver his own messages, and not to send my own people chasing after me,&quot; Aura paused for a brief second, &quot;On second thought, speak not to D'Vinn, but go to Kelethin.  Tell the committee to gather, that someone is to come with a solution to who shall rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
She released her grip of the young elf.  A small trickle of blood ran down his neck.  He placed his hand on his neck to feel a thin cut on his skin.  Cold sweat dripped down and mixed with the blood.  &quot;I will be in Kelethin soon.  It will be more of a surprise if you know not for sure.  Tell them not who is coming.  For you don't even know your self young elf.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Aura began to walk off when she stopped suddenly. &quot;Give this to D'Vinn.  He'll know exactly what it means.  Tell him nothing.  Just hand him this.&quot;  As her words trailed off, a Dragoon dirk stuck deeply in the wall of the tunnel.  It missed hitting the elf by inches.  The rogued grinned slyly as she walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lead the way Raven.  Two things I see are returning.  I wonder what the Faydarks will hold.&quot;  Aura pulled her cloak tight around her body as she walked towards Freeport.</div></div><hr />
