<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darue Ivywood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With alot of the posts about people's buying / selling characters / accounts and such, be it for in game plat, or real cash..<br />
and having the passwords changed on them after a period of time, defaulting back to the owner..<br />
<br />
why not pay the (what is it..) $50? to SOE to transfer the character to your account(s).<br />
<br />
After that is done, is it still possible for the original owner to bring the character back into their possesion? back onto their account?<br />
<br />
If not, then why not do this if your gonna purchase an avatar?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Braydin Firebehli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off Verant/SOE will not transfer a character from an account under John Smiths name to an account an Billy Joe Jim Bob Hattfield. the Accounts have to be the in same name. So that makes this idea undoable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana Frostglitter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm embarassed to admit I got caught with this.  18 months ago, I bought an account with a 34 wizard and a 29 druid just to have someone to port me around.  It worked out pretty well with Kunark, but I started to use it less and less with Velious (34 wizard + snow dervish = bad).<br />
<br />
A week ago, I discovered the password had been changed.  Of course, I only have myself to blame since I did something as goofy as paying for an account.  I just never thought anyone would care enough about some lowbie wizard account to be a dick about it.<br />
<br />
I hope they were terribly disappointed when they reset the password.  I hadn't leveled either the wizard or the druid AT ALL (in fact, had managed to kill the druid several times while tracking rares in SK and she had lost exp).  No exp, no nice equipment, nothing.<br />
<br />
I had started a couple of twinks on the account, had a 10 barb rogue and a 12 iksar monk.  Yay, the guy got my rogue's mithril bp and the monk's FBSS, go him.  Basically, the guy got zippo...I'm just severely pissed the account showed up on my last credit card statement, I need to figure out how to get rid of just that one EQ account (I have two of my own).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>helius wallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, because I don't play my wizard at all. (Toxx) I was going to actually sell it to a friend for in game platinum. We were going to split the cost of the transfer and put Toxx on to his account.<br />
<br />
I read up on the account transfer service. The only way they're going to let you move characters is when both accounts have the same original credit-card number. They can obviously make some exceptions. For the most part though, if John Doe has account one, sells it to Jane Smith. Jane isn't going to transfer John's character to her account. They don't hold the same credit card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baledin Trueblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't you go in and change the billing info to your credit card?  A friend recently gave me his account as he doesn't play anymore.  I haven't used it yet, but probably will soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darue Ivywood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm...must be exceptions then..<br />
<br />
I have a friend (wow, I know) where I was playin on his account in the past (just for transfers and language skills thing) as was another friend of his (on another server but same account) with his kids having chars as well.<br />
<br />
well, to make this short and simple.. the other dude (after a year ..geesh) decided he liked the game too much and wanted to stay on his server without starting a new character. Well, my friend no longer plays and hasnt for some time (he got a cleric to level 20 and said thats enough) but he was still paying for the account. <br />
<br />
Well, the account came up with the Renew to Play feature (hehe) and his friend (the other dude) called him and asked if he was gonna re-new the account so he could keep playin. Well, seeing as my friend hasnt played in well over 2 years, he didnt feel like he wanted to keep payin for something that he didnt want.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my friends friend wound up taking over his account, and buying a second. He then moved his main character, which was on my friends account, to his newly purchased account which allowed his kids to retain their 'own' account (which was originally my friends account). &lt;yea, after reading this, my head hurts too&gt;<br />
<br />
Maybe they needed the credit card numbers or mailing address type thing to do it, (Next time I talk to him, I will ask for specifics on how they did it) but wouldnt someone ask for that information if they were gonna purchase an unknown account? <br />
<br />
The reason I even brought this up is because <br />
I know it has been done, so for those that are buying other accounts and dont want to get scammed by the changing of the passwords thing, you might want to look into this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dwarkarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All you need are the orginal CD keys, they will then let you change any character to any account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
You DO need more than just the original CD keys.<br />
<br />
I transferred one character from my main account to a secondary account that we took over payment from a family member who could not play after SOL was implemented (Win95).  It took many many e-mails (I detailed this story in a thread about this in R&amp;F somewhere that has been buried since) despite the fact that we had BOTH sets of CD keys, all the right billing info, and permission from the original owner (who received EQ as a gift from us in the first place).  Total time from trying to transfer to the actual switch taking place was ~3 weeks.  You have to have the credit card #'s of any accounts used to pay for the accounts, the registration info has to be made to be identical, and a few other similar detail-oriented hoops of fire to jump through just to transfer a character.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Salenie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ditto:<br />
<br />
I did a character transfer between accounts and once the CURRENT credit information matched it was no problem.  The accounts had differing credit information at start up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dwarkarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You DO need more than just the original CD keys.<br />
<br />
Trust me you don't unless this is something they only very recently brought in, if you have enough persistance you can get anything done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mr  Bodie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As Dwarkan says if you are persistent enough, you can probably make it happen.  However, if you do not have a legitimate reason for your info not matching the original info in some way, you will very likely be denied.  In fact I have read of cases where the transfer person tried it and got banned(probably for being an @#%$ about it and catching the wrong customer service person at the wrong time)  If the account has a lot of ownership changes or red flags of any kind due to past disputes this can also cause you major problems.<br />
<br />
Also, if you info doesn't match expect to be forced to jump through many hoops including TONS of questions about the original owner's personal info, which can include CD keys and a host of other crap, like birth date, last 4 digits on various credit cards used etc.<br />
<br />
You can get lucky and just get greenlighted with no effort, but the vast majority of people run into sticking points at some point during this process.  I buy and sell assloads of characters and stuff, and I've talked to a lot of people who have tried this.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, it's about 10 percent likely you will get a clean, no problems transfer. 70 percent likely you will need original owner info, and 20 percent likely you will get a CS rep from hell and the account could be banned.  So make sure you remove all droppable gear first to another account, because you are taking a risk.<br />
<br />
Added to all this is another 20 percent chance that Verant will @#%$ up or lose your request entirely, and you will end up contacting CS anyways, and any time you spend Verant's customer service dollar's is when they get aggressive.<br />
<br />
Your absolute best bet here is to have the original owner move the character for you to a brand new account, also signed up by that owner.<br />
<br />
I get requests all the time to do it, but I've given up after about 5 or 6 abortive attempts.<br />
<br />
Drop me a line at barhorst@bowlofmice.com if you want me to look over the specifics of any kind of deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kerryn Darkwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But Bodie...doesnt the idea of the guy transferring it to a new account for you defeat the purpose that he has access to the account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Izual Bain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Very recently I shifted a character from one of my accounts to another. To do so I went into the account charge information set both under the same cc number and then put in the request. All in all I think it took 3 days for the transfer to go through. No cd key information was required nor any verification on my part of any personal information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Colmillo Icelander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, considering I have done too much of this stuff, its a damn hassle to move a char to another account not owned by the same person, but you can.<br />
1)  You must have CD keys, both accounts.<br />
2)  You must have peronal info and credit card number from the ORIGINAL creation of the account and almost every credit card number and user name used on the damn account.<br />
I dont know many accounts that havent had more than one credit card or more than one user on them at any one time.  It would take a really trusting person to give you every name and credit card number that their account ever had so that you can switch the character from one account to another.  Helius you and your friend can probably do that with Toxx if you dont mind exchanging all your info, if you have all the numbers that have been used on your account.<br />
<br />
oh... yeah... I'm back.  Whats up EQ ho's?<br />
