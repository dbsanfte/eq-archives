<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thebudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It was suggested I mention Kerzog in this forum, because some do not read 'Rants &amp; Flames'.<br />
<br />
So if you are inclined, please direct your attention to the recent thread regarding Kerzog in 'Rants &amp; Flames'.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
There are no doubt many definitions of what qualifies someone to be a 'Scammer', and therefore be posted on this board to alert others of their actions.<br />
<br />
The definition I'm choosing to use is:<br />
<br />
&quot;An individual who chooses to ninja loot a 30K+ item from another group's kill during the confusion of a train in which his own group is mostly wiped out.  When questioned, the individual chooses to admit to the act, then chooses to disband and gate to East Commons, leaving his dead group without rezzes.  The individual further chooses to immediately auction the item, which is not rightfully his to auction, to whomever will take it off his hands quickly before word gets out about the actions he has chosen to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think I'll offer an apology if you are upset that someone is making your roommate accountable for his actions, but I do agree with you that people should indeed read all of the posts under the other thread, including yours, and draw their own conclusions.<br />
<br />

<br />
 This forum was set up long ago to alert everyone to some of the not so upstanding players on EMarr. So I guess you would have ninja looted it and done the same thing by your statements defending the stupid bastard.<br />
<br />
 I'm sure everyone is glad to know where you stand on these issues now, and can act accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hakken Spinesheath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My appologies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hakken Spinesheath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">...But things in life have changed and so has my attitude .. To anyone I may have pissed off or upset, I am deeply sorry, though I feel I could never repay for my transgressions I will give you all this notice:<br />
<br />
Kerzog is no longer under the same players control, the account was traded for one Sancta Nox.<br />
<br />
The scammer now runs the avatar Sancta Nox.<br />
<br />
Nope, I'm not his roomie anymore and will happily confess, he did jack that item (that I still vaguely remember) and &quot;steal it&quot;.<br />
<br />
I dunno if that will help anyone with anything but I have done just a small part of the reparations I owe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ulujain Ebonelphette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow, I'm still amazed that sig hosted by virtualave is still around. Thought Tidan trashed that years ago.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I can be easily amused =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sancta Nox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wow what an old thread lol as for who playe me (sancta) and whom plays kerzog has always been the same.. Me and kerzog are RL friends so we play each other sometime (I.E. i need a rez and cannot find one lol) but that is about it.  Pretty sad this is all you could come up with hakken.. a 2 year old thread. Or should i be honored you took the time to look so far for it Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hakken Spinesheath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, acctually, I was bored out of my mind and I put in my own name in Google and I found this thread that way.<br />
<br />
I just remember some of the things done by the original Kerzog and the times I went out of my way to cover the original Kerzog's butt and figured, since I'm supposed to be a &quot;good&quot; guy now I'd let people know that Kerzog isn't that same guy, so no old predjudices are held over from the old days. As well, of course, like I could MAKE people do different than have thier own opinions about each character in thier own way. *shrug* Not my job.<br />
<br />
But, what can I say. At least I didn't flame or rant and I think I was quite pleasant as well. ;) <br />
<br />
By the way, I know you guys are RL friends, I was his roomie, like I didn't know. LOL</div></div><hr />
