<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlessingAngel001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To those that give a damn or care,<br />
 <br />
I am not going to give any speeches on my crediablity or make this post more sweetier and have everyone side with me or whatnot. I don't flame people too often. I rarely do. But for this low life, she deserves to get flamed.<br />
<br />
Freyia scammed 50k from a friend of mine by promising to chain the Earth staff from Hate for his epic. They make an agreement and head over to FV for the chaining. The story starts here. Freyia turns in her pieces of her epic, (dirt of the underfoot, shovel, broom, and hate staff), but she was only suppose to turn in the Hate staff because that is what she is selling/chaining to my friend. For those that do not know, when you turn in all the pieces of your epic, you get the final piece/resulting piece is Power of Earth, which you turn into the PoA quest guy. So knowing what she has done, she sends a tell to my friend confirming that she has turned in the hate staff and that he is ready to finish his part. When he turned in his part, he messed up by giving in a wrong piece. So he heads to FV bank asap to get the correct piece and turns it in. The result was, he got nothing. Believing that it was his fault he gave her the 50k. She took the money and lied saying it was a bug etc. So my friend petitions. He waits for a few days for a response from Vharyon. When he finally got a response from Vharyon, it of course was unpleasant. The Server Gm said that he will not reimburse the item and that my friend got scammed as mentioned above. So my friend loses 4 pieces of his epic and 50k. <br />
<br />
That is what happened. Believing what you want to believe. Do what you want to do. This of course is my own reflection on what has happened. I believe there was a flame not so long ago on Freyia. She is not trustworthy and I think she should basically give the stuff back to safe her rep. Whatever is left of it. I know I won't let her have a good day in EQ =)<br />
<br />
Spelling/grammar whatever. It's late. Don't really care. <br />
I know who I will be seeing responding to this. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hoppkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">and this is why i would never buy the chaining of something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Argnoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well usually the quest mob gives some text when a quest item is turned in like, &quot;You Think i'm gonna give you uber lootz for just this one measily piece of the quest when there are three more i need?? GO AWAY!&quot; or something along that line hehe. probably just better to pay a bit of attention on these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Antra Dawnryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I recently did the mage epic, and had to turn in all four pieces before getting any vocal reply.<br />
<br />
Buying a chaining is dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>freyia69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i agreed to chain a staff 25kpp up front 25kpp after, we go to fie vie and the MORON hands in the WRONG items which you yourself admit in YOUR post blessing. I told him lets gets accounts reset and try again but he refuses saying &quot;naw lets just petition and gm will give us the items back&quot; /boggle NO GM is gonna give back EPIC stuff when u screw up a MQ. which he FOUND OUT. so becuase your friend is an idiot that makes me a scammer? drop the crack pipe and step back blessing cause your living in a fantasy world. and while i DID offer to get him another staff and redo it, as i did feel bad even tho HE screwed up the mq, as of now he can #(*@ off and so can you blessing. i still cant belive u even POST that your friend screwed up and handed in the wrong items and STILL try to blame me.<br />
<br />
at this point i dont care what anyone thinks, belive what ya want, but if u read blessings own post she states the moron handed in THE WRONG ITEMS. and now blames me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlessingAngel001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As information floods through, I am being told that Freyia is &quot;going&quot; to talk to the gm. If she is and things are fixed, I will owe her an apology. If I am wrong in any way or that my information was faulty (proven to be faulty by the gm/friend who petitioned) I will apologize to Freyia on the boards and whatnot. I will be willing to apologize to her guild for any headache I have caused. But until then, I will not apologize for anything and will let the flame head on.</div></div><hr />

Flaming the mage friend instead of just flaming Blessing is just plain low.  Not like he's ranting about you, not like he's being the total a$$ you are ... but you just keep calling him a MORON over and over again... from your former inciteful posts, and knowing said mage, I know he isn't an idiot.  You show yourself to be rude and not the sharpest of mages ... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is the third post I have seen regarding this little trasaction.  Firstwas from the Mage who bought the chaining.   Seemed VERY nice, and even apologetic.   Then I saw these other 2 by his friend.   He was being a bit harsh in my mind, but OK, so long as he appologizes if it is needed.<br />
<br />
  Freyia, you have shown a lack of discretion.   or just never saw the mages post.   He stated everything that happened, and said that he is probably in ways responsible for it.<br />
<br />
   He also mentioned that you turned in all 4 items needed at once.  That isn't a chaining, that is getting him to pay you 50K to watch you finish the portion of the quest.   Maybe next time ask him what it means to chain if you don't understand the concept.<br />
<br />
  He turned in 2 of the 3 items he needed, then went to the bank and grabbed the proper third item for his part and turned it in.   If you had turned in JUST the staff you were supposed to, it would have worked.   Whatever this &quot;character reset&quot; thing is you are speaking about, you don't need it, and as far as I know it doesn't actually exist (unless you mean the 30 minutes to loose your NO RENT, in which case that is all you do, is loose NO RENT).<br />
<br />
  I have before done 3 of 4 turn ins.  Left the area wondering why my quest failed.  then, DAYS later, remembered about the 4th items, got it, turned it in, and finished the quest.  That is much like MQing, just to yourself.   So long as the NPC doesn't despawn (killed or servers down) then he remembers what he has on him, and waits for the rest.   Nowadays, when I loot a quest item for something I know of that you can MQ, I go turn it in to the guy in hopes of one day having a newbie/lowbie come through and get half his quest free.   I have already recieved 5 TS armor quest items from myself in this manner; chaining them slowly over the course of a few weeks to myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
   So, is he a &quot;moron&quot; for turning in the wrong item?  nah, just mistaken.  Did he need to camp?  uh... No.   Did he screw up?  Well, for a couple seconds, but then went to bank and fixed it.  Did you screw up?  yeah, big time.   That is if the logs the GM reported are correct, and I tend to believe those things.   Was calling him a &quot;moron&quot; quite a base and senseless action?   yeah.    Should you be preperly termed a &quot;moron?&quot;   so far...  yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Antra Dawnryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Though I must admit I laughed my ass off when some @#%$ with too many gems turned them in to a dwarf and the next poor bastard that came along to MQ ended up getting a surprise.<br />
<br />
Only unfortunate thing was it happened to a guildie, though it does caution everyone regarding MQing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Euge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">jw, didn't the gm say that freyia turned in 4 items? while freyia says she turned in only one?...*shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>flapflapflap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">MQing an item is not illegal, but it is also not supported by GMS... so there will not be items reimbursed (trust me.. I know).  On the mage (and wizard) multiquest, when u turn 1 item in it _DOES_ (i guarantee it) trigger a response from the npc.  If no response was triggered than 1 of 3 things happened: 1. The first staff was never turned in.  2. the person turning in the first staff did not have proper faction at the time. (meaning either the invis trick wasnt used, or just plain didnt have faction). 3. the person doing the MQ was confused on how to multiquest and put the item in the trade window and instructed the second person to do the turn ins while the first staff was still in the trade window. (this last method is usually the one that generates no messages at all.)<br />
<br />
If 25k was agreed on before then 25k after, then freyia should give back 25k of it, if she has any honor... <br />
<br />
When i failed my 1st wizard multiquest, the guy doing it refused to take my money.. but on the other hand, if the 2nd guy messed up the multiquest then the original could easily say fook off (of she has no class that is).  I mean freyia did lose an item outta this that she could have easily sold to someone else.  Just all depends on the type of person ya get to multiquest ya.<br />
<br />
Freyia is a twink, rather a character that is retired, and despite her appearance is not a mage... but a druid. Not gonna call out any names here...dunno if the account has been sold or if maybe im just off by 1 letter.. but i gotta say.. ya just never know how people really are until money is involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bodar the Mage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, in this instance you are wrong about getting that text flapflapflap. I have helped a few other mages multi quest parts like the hand in to Walnan in Butcherblock and the Water Staff in Dragnors Cauldron. You do not get any response from those NPCs either.  <br />
<br />
She did not really lose an Item, she did the turn in, got the reward, and STOLE my 50k.  At the time I could not prove she had done anything wrong so I did as agreed and paid her the balance.<br />
<br />
For more on this topic flapflapflap you can dig up the “Rant and Flame” titled “Hate Staff Chaining gone Wrong” where I listed what the GM had to say about this issue. Started that topic 6/7/02. As of now its back 3 pages.<br />
<br />
As a side-note for those of you that read that little saga and still have interest, here is where it left off: <br />
<br />
Freyia and her guild were going to talk with the GM’s. It has been a month and I have not been contacted since, have received zero repayment, and am not surprised in the least.  <br />
<br />
Multi-questing is a risky proposition just be aware. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Qool Breeze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm gonna have to take Freyia side on this. <br />
<br />
I don't know Freyia... so why you ask?<br />
<br />
Because Blessing (http://www.lustybimbos.com) thinks I am such an ASS!<br />
<br />
She's probably right though. But thats ok... she just made 35k back. Right hun?<br />
