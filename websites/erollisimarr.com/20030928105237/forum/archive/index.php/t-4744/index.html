<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GoddessAttica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sons of Shadow Guard which hide under this banner, to Obsidian under this banner who now dwell, and to all of those who darken your path with Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, Rallos, Bertoxxulos, Sol Ro, and other dark gods... Hear the words of I, Attica X'Layan, servant of Edwrin Obsidian.<br />
<br />
I understand since Maugrim vanished, the Shadow Guard dwell among you. Neriak dies and rots without those of Shadow Guard. I call upon you to reform or to join the Dark Circlet, the present alliance between Obsidian and Children of Darkness. We ask for you recruits to join the ranks of us, or sign a pact pledging your loyalty to the Dark Circlet. More evil factions shall join soon enough.<br />
<br />
I remember a time where evil defeated the Knights of the Holy Storm and others... A time where evil walked Norrath with pride. Now more and more Dark Elves surrender and cower to Marr, Tunare, and Karana.<br />
<br />
I call upon you my brothers and sisters of the shadow... Rise now! Rise now to destroy enemies. A dark renaissance is around the corner for us all, for all the Legions of Hate, Fear, and Chaos!<br />
<br />
Attica X'Layan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mistress Ezra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Remember not forming this alliance with you, lady Attica.  I remember speaking with you of such intentions of your new following and desire of such an alliance.  <br />
<br />
The Darkness of the Allied Dark Gods swells within the Children of Darkness and spills forth over the lands of Norrath.  True victory comes from this alliance of Dark Gods and soon the world will be shadowed in their Darkness.<br />
<br />
Hate seeths within us.  A wake of fear abounds where we tred and a trail of decay follows our path of distruction. <br />
<br />
When you and yours can contribute to this, then perhaps we can speak further.  Until such time HAIL THE DARKNESS!  HAIL THE CHILDREN OF THE DARK GODS!</div></div><hr />
