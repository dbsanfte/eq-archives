Im serious when I say that, I mean we as a bleeding heart society have taken all discipline away from the teachers and point blank teachers see our kids more than we do from the ages of 5 to 18 and maybe even later if they go to college (although by 18 their path in life has started and the only detourant is death or jail).<br />

		<div>1) Accountability.  We spend more than most countries and get less for our dollar.  We can blame lawyers, political correctness, immigration, whatever, but the truth is that they can do a better job.  That doesn't just mean a teacher's job should depend on performance.  It means that every single administrator's job should depend on performance.  In fact, we need a top-down approach.  We make them accountable in the administration and they will start caring a lot more about the performance of the front-line educators.<br />
<br />
No more tenure, ever.  What a stupid idea is that?  Make people virtually unfireable?<br />
<br />
No more rewarding failure by spending more on failing teachers and failing schools.<br />
<br />
2) Fight the teacher's union tooth and nail.  Destroy it if possible.  It does not serve our children.  It doesn't necessarily even serve the interests of teachers.  It serves its own interests, which are often in conflict with the best learning environment.<br />
<br />
3) One other (controversial) solution I am undecided on is the idea of segregating kids at an earlier age for technical education.  This is quite popular in Europe.  They give up on the low achievers, yank them out of high school, and teach them how to weld.  This is one of the reasons, by the way, that our test scores look so shitty compared to theirs.  They aren't even testing their &quot;dumbest&quot; kids beyond age 13 or 14 because those kids have all started a technical education.<br />
<br />
If we did more of this, I think there would be certain costs and benefits.  An obvious cost is that we essentially give up on a large group of kids too early.  Some of them would eventually figure things out and become college material.  Others might be segregated to the vocational program when they really could acheive more, simply because teachers don't want their shitty grades affecting the test results.  Finally, what our kids really need is higher standards, not lower standards.  Giving them the option of simply skipping history, writing, math and science in favor of learning how to change spark plugs or work with power tools effectively lowers our standards a great deal.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest advantages here is that we stop dumbing things down for the kids who just don't care.  Like it or not, our test results determine our testing standards.  Not because they should but because that is how unionized, unfireable government employees work.  Effectively kicking the dumbest kids out of the classrooms <b>would</b> allow for higher standards.  If you can't keep up, you're gone.  We aren't going to slow the rest of the class down because you refuse to do 15 minutes of homework a night.</div>

		<div>Tenure protects teachers' ability to relate unpopular ideas and free speech without worrying about their job. Tenure doesn't even make any difference anymore, with the popularity of lawsuits against schools.<br />
You are spot on about teachers' unions, administrators, and the effectiveness of the majority of european schools. 80% of american students wouldn't be able to maintain a passing grade in a german, english, or even a portuguese high school.<br />
The gap between the high end and low end professions in europe is also much smaller, with many basic needs of society provided that we have to pay for ourselves. Of course, that also accounts for why europeans pay about 50% of their income in taxes.<br />
What hasn't been mentioned yet is A) the utter LAZINESS of american children, B) the tacit removal of the arts from schools via lack of funding, and C) the influence of gang culture.<br />
Kids are lazy because their parents are too busy working to be able to devote enough time to their children, to make sure they do their homework, their chores, etc instead of sitting at home playing EQ or fooling around on myspace. Teachers in an increasing number of districts are not allowed to punish students directly anymore (or they expose themselves to lawsuits or made up revenge abuse claims by the student), but can only refer them to a discipline officer (who the kids are already resistant to and see themselves as standing up to the man, rather than having behavior corrected).<br />
In schools where the arts are still taught, there are fewer behavior issues as the kids have a constructive outlet for their energy. In schools where there is nothing but sports, only a few students make it onto the teams, and the rest feel rejected and have nothing to occupy their time, so they turn to gangs and anywhere that they can feel accepted, leading them to crime and legal trouble.<br />
ADD is a real condition. ADD is also a convenient blanket for a school administration to give up on the child instead of finding the real problem. School districts are not required to recognize dyslexia as a real and impacting condition, and many dyslexics are misdiagnosed as ADD. Also, one of the currently popular methods of treatment for recalcitrant and tantrum prone children is to let them squall and give in to them instead of redirecting them.<br />
Standardized tests that children must pass or the school loses funding is also a major problem. In the entire state of Florida, in the name of accountability, the funding for a school depends entirely on the % of their students who pass the FCAT (FL comprehensive aptitude test). This causes the schools to drill only what is on the FCAT instead of teaching the children what they should be learning at their grade level. And if they don't pass, it's just another vector for humiliation and alienation for the child, and even for those who DO pass, they're learning nothing except how to regurgitate information and fill in little bubbles with a #2 pencil.<br />
Last thing then I swear I'll shut up is evolution vs intelligent design. This is the prime reason religion should not be taught in anything except an empirical/descriptive manner in our schools, because we're so busy arguing and suing about what to teach that we're NOT TEACHING ANYTHING except how to argue and that you can get what you want by pissing and moaning. Settle the argument, teach it all and let the child choose what to believe, since that's what's gonna end up happening anyway. There's a reason that sunday school happens on Sunday.</div>

To be fair, there are also parents who just don't care either.<br />
<br />
I agree with your point however.  If they are too busy working for more luxuries, then I think they fall under the 'don't care' group.  If they are too buys working to make ends meet, I think this shows the danger of having a capitalist system without proper social policies in place.  Everyone says that the purer the capitalist system makes us a richer country, I say that getting more children an education will have an equal effect and make us smarter as an extra benefit.<br />

In the entire state of Florida, in the name of accountability, the funding for a school depends entirely on the % of their students who pass the FCAT (FL comprehensive aptitude test). This causes the schools to drill only what is on the FCAT instead of teaching the children what they should be learning at their grade level.</span><br />

Either privatize the entire system or rely on standardized testing.  So they are being drilled for the FCAT; at least they are being drilled.  If the FCAT isn't comprehensive enough, add more subjects.  We cannot allow a system without accountability.  That means carrots and sticks.<br />

A great argument for vouchers or other measures to privatize the entire system.  Stop forcing parents to send their kids to schools that violate their core beliefs and this won't be a problem.  As it stands, public schools have a virtual monopoly on education, mandated by our local tax systems.  Imagine a company that forces you to pay for its product, regardless of whether you buy it.  Its product is widely scorned for low quality and features that many people oppose, yet they are forced to buy it anyway.  It ignores attempts to introduce any semblence of market controls because it has a government-mandated, local monopoly.  It charges more for its product than virtually any other company in the world yet it refuses to accept any quality controls, claiming that the only solution is to give it more money for its shitty product.</div>

What's the real story? I don't want to hear &quot;Oh, I read on rightwingnutjob.com that teachers force all students to become Muslims and they can't add two digit numbers and they spend all their time getting high in the teacher's lounge.&quot;<br />

At least for Houston, some areas have schools that (at least based on standardized tests) are pretty good, and some are pretty lousy. We're in the process of moving from an area where the TAAS scores are in the 50s to where they're &gt;90. My wife and I debated whether it made more sense to stay where we're at &amp; send the kids to private schools, but since there's another child on the way, we need a bigger house, so we 're going to need to move anyways (and local schools was one of the primary considerations in selecting a new area).<br />

Again, while its probaby very unPC to point out, the challenges facing public schools in the inner city vs a gated community where the average income is $90k+ are very different.</div>

There were standardized tests in place before the FCAT that were much better at measuring the performance of our schools. The FCAT was simply the politicians' attempt to make it look like they were reforming education. And THAT was a load of horse shit.<br />

There is some of that - while the government tries to balance out their funding, schools in wealthy areas will always have the advantage of being able to hold a bake sale or a car wash to get more funding.<br />

That said, it's much more important as to how the money is spent. I've seen high schools dump tens of millions into football stadiums &amp; the like. I'd rather send my kids to the school where they're putting in a good science lab. (Although it seems like every school loves to dump money on the computer lab - which in my mind is silly for high income areas, but whatever).</div>

When it's properly diagnosed, yes. However, our education system misdiagnoses many different disorders as ADD or ADHD, though, and wrongly medicates a great host of children.

	<span style="color: #BFAD97">That said, it's much more important as to how the money is spent. I've seen high schools dump tens of millions into football stadiums &amp; the like. I'd rather send my kids to the school where they're putting in a good science lab. (Although it seems like every school loves to dump money on the computer lab - which in my mind is silly for high income areas, but whatever).</span><br />

Well, I can tell you that we spend a lot of money on technology.  There are multiple computers labs in every high and middle school, as well as in some elementary schools.  There are wireless access points in pretty much all the schools and we're currently installing new switches in all the IDFs throughout the district (all of this is Cisco equipment, which means expensive).<br />
<br />
In some ways it's kinda sad.  I run the Help Desk for our district and see tickets all the time about how a teacher can't be effective without their computer.  You know, in my day, we had a total of one classroom that had a computer in it, and that only taught BASIC.  It saddens me that they are so reliant on their computers.  Strangely enough I attended a public school that turned out more National Merit Scholars than any of the private schools.<br />
<br />
As a peculiar aside, I learned this awhile back:  public schools that are located in better neighborhoods actually make more money off lunch.  Some students can have their lunch fee waived depending on the household income of their family.  However, this program is not available in a few upscale locations, because not enough children qualify for it.  I mean, it makes more sense to let the richer kids pay for their lunch, but that means the schools in better neighborhoods are bringing in more money in that regard.  Just thought that was strange.</div>

Yet another sign of the demise of education in america... Did you know by the time a german student finishes the 13th grade (those who make it that far), s/he will speak 4 languages fluently, and will have received comprehensive instruction in the literature of those societies?<br />
<br />
Kinda makes the occasional US requirement of 2 years of any one foreign language kinda laughable. Especially when the fastest growing segment of our population doesn't speak english.</div>
