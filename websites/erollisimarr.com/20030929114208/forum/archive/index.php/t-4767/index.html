<br />
Date:  Saturday, December 16, 2000<br />
Time:  8pm PST  /  11pm EST  /  2am Sunday for Cashew in N.Zealand :) <br />
Location:  Autumn Valley (DL wizzie spires)<br />
<br />
I am also in search of:<br />
A caterer/party supplies.  Requirements: Lvl 52+mage<br />
Master Brewers.  Requirements:  Anyone who wants to brew, bring it along.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone that is helping out: Wunderr, the porters, Goibniu (Master Brewer), my bridesmaids, and you don’t know it yet, but Dvain, I need someone to give me away! :p    And thanks to everyone that is helping/going to help that I have missed.<br />
<br />
My apologies to those that like to play in DL usually, if it’s too laggy you can just come to my wedding and be my personal security guards.  Free booze for the lot of you.<br />
<br />
Refreshments will be served during the reception.  The wedding party is not responsible for any deaths that occur during this occasion or one hour before and after we are there.  It’s the responsibility of the drunk, err individual guest, to agree on no death by pet or bleeding to death during duels.<br />
<br />
Thanks and may the goddess Erolisi bless you and guide you well!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>HoneybearLaggamuffin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OOC:  Unfortanely, NOW I am having an issue with Verant/Sony that my account is expired, even though I am paid up till March 2001.  I sent an email to customer service that I could not loggin, but we will see.  If they fix it before Saturday, it will be a miracle!  So, until further notice, it is postponed.  :( <br />

May Erolisi bless you and guide you well!<br />
