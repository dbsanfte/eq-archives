<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mordare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Krakooom! A flash of lighting streaked across the horizon as the thunder roared in the sky. Then the heavens let loose the tears of Karana. The winds blew fiercely over the water and the waves began to swell. <br />
<br />
Mordare quietly pulled his hood up trying to gain at least some protection from the rain. “Damned rain,” he quietly muttered to himself. “Romar and his damned coins. Ah well it could be worse I suppose.”<br />
<br />
“Look the docks! Back home to beloved Faydwer,” shouted a young woodelf.<br />
<br />
Mordare simply sighed as if disinterested. 'About time,' he thought to himself. It had been a long journey for the Teir’dal and he was now in a land where he was not welcome. If not for his desire to learn the secret of tashania, Mordare would most likely avoid this gods-forsaken place altogether. The boat slowly neared the docks and was secured in place when Mordare quietly made his way off the vessel. Clouding the minds of those around him, Mordare was tucked safely away in the shroud of his invisibility spell. Then as he approached the end of the docks, he began to cast another spell. Waving one hand past his face the, invisibility spell dispersed. Then, with a simple gesture of his hand the dark elf named Mordare was gone. In his place stood a dwarf.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he moved on and entered into the great dwarven city of Kaladim. Even Mordare had to admit to being impressed at the dwarven military. They seemed quite strong and very well organized. In fact the only true weakness he saw was their apparent disdain for magic. It cut them off from the lifeblood of Norrath and made them more vulnerable than they should be. However, for Mordare this was a blessing as he used this fact to easily slip past them. To the unskilled eye his illusion was nearly flawless, he appeared much like a dwarven rogue and made his way through the city. He had paid a diviner in Neriak to learn the whereabouts of the coin in Kaladim and only hoped that it was money well spent. Looking into the small pool he saw only his reflection at first then at the bottom a small item, a coin…<br />
<br />
<br />
His brother flicked the small platinum coin at him.<br />
<br />
“Go buy a sword you fool! Quit this foolishness at once. There is a reason we call them the spurned. If you wish to practice the arts you should practice the one true art. Serve Innoruuk well, join the guard or become one of his priests, hell join the lodge of the dead! But by the gods our family will not let you disgrace us by turning to the lesser arts.”<br />
<br />
Mordare glared at his brother. He was no child after all, and he certainly didn’t need to be reprimanded. Ever since he had been promoted to captain, Mordare’s brother had been insufferable. Then there were his parents, who were just as bad, urging him to join the guards of Neriak, and then when he showed disinterest the priests. The lodge of the dead was their newest campaign “Learn the black arts, let the dead do your bidding.” Mordare had no interests in corpses, however, nor had he ever. His family was respected in Neriak and as such he was expected to take a “noble” position, but he had seen what he wanted to do long ago.<br />
<br />
As a boy he had wandered off while his brother was visiting the Indigo Brotherhood for a fencing lesson. It was then that he had found his calling. Wandering into the Tower of the Spurned. A wicked place where quacks and fools practice the lesser arts he had been told. But he was utterly fascinated he stayed for hours before his parents found him staring in wonder at these arts. Furious, they had ordered him away from there, never to return. This of course made him only more interested he snuck away on a regular basis, watching and learning. Eventually he found an affinity for the art of enchantment. Bewitched by the Lady V’retta and her arts, he found a love for clouding the minds of others and eventually he learned well enough that he felt the need to practice. He went out and practiced in the Nektulos forest avoiding his brother as best he could he eventually gained in skill and power. He continued his lessons from the tower and eventually he had grown to learn a good bit about the art of the mind. The fun couldn’t last forever though, and Mordare knew this. Eventually his family discovered his practice of the “lesser magics” taught within the tower and that had brought him to this latest lecture.<br />
<br />
“Dammit!” Mordare exclaimed. “I am not a child. Yes I have taken up these so-called lesser magics, but I say that you are a fool. Have you seen what the masters of this art are able to do? Do you know how easy it is to deceive the eyes? You just don’t understand, and I fear you never will. Maybe I’ll just leave. As much as I love this city, I must know the secrets that this art holds. It is what I was meant for, somehow I just know that. I wish you would just leave me alone and forget about it.”<br />
<br />
Infuriated, the captain raised his hand balled into a fist and was about to strike the young enchanter when all of a sudden as if time had stopped, he froze in place. Mordare gasped as the rush of pure thought flew past him “It is possible you know.” Mordare recognized the voice as that of his master in the Tower of the spurned, Utvex D’Jerna        .<br />
<br />
“What is possible? What did you do? Can you bend time itself to your will now?” asked the young enchanter.<br />
<br />
Master D’Jerna chuckled. “Stop time? Heh, Only for him I’m afraid. I merely stopped him mid-thought. But more importantly, it can be done. They can be made to forget if you wish it to be. It would be a shame to lose your talents. Lady V’retta sees promise in you and she is not often wrong. If it is done though you must let them go, they will not remember you the same as you are now. You will be just another of the Spurned to them, tolerated but no more.”<br />
<br />
Mordare had always been impetuous and without thinking he simply looked up at his own brother, ready to strike him and said “Do it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Reaching into the pool Mordare grabbed the coin as it floated to the top. Examining the markings he smiled “Ah, indeed… a coin of Tash.”</div></div><hr />
