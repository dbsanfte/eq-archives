<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chiteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Actually the game isnt that bad. Progress is faster than in EQ.<br />
Characters are more limited in their options.<br />
Because there is less demand for the 'xp grind' people are actually able to explore the game.<br />
<br />
There ARE problems, indeed there are. But it isnt quite as bad<br />
as some would have you believe =)<br />
<br />
See you on the Dark Side, Vendy</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chiteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh Well =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of my problems with this game is that progress IS so fast. There is no meaning to being powerful anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chiteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If the intent is to lord it over other players, then you are correct.<br />
If the intent is to actually PLAY the game....then that really doesnt matter =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The intent is neither. The intent is to is to have a sense of accomplishment. The first time I took my guild into NToV was a wonderful sense of accomplishment. The reason why was because we had worked long and hard to become powerful enough to do so. Wasn't the same as zoning into, say Old Sebilis, for the first time because that is somethign that doesn't require much work and anyone can do.</div></div><hr />

Not by the Chitengs of the world, but by the Chukazombi of the world.<br />
Too many people sublimate their self-worth in VR. You can't throw<br />
your weight around in RL, like you do in EQ. <br />
<br />
An old and more patient friend of mine made an observation long ago:<br />
<br />
(he was talking about AD&amp;D but it still applies)<br />
<br />
People act ingame in the manner that they are not able to act in RL.<br />
(A curious statement since I was playing an LG Paladin in his campaign - but I digress)<br />
So if they are jerks ingame, that is because they cannot express that in RL. <br />
<br />
I think he may be on to something here.<br />
<br />
Just musing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with you. One of the downsides to the power argument is those who use their power for villany!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ultor Arcus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I won't argue that the game does still have its fair share of bugs. I much prefer this to EQ at this point in time. There finally came a point where I was sitting in front of the computer and it hit me...I'm REALLY bored with EQ. Guess that can happen with 275 days played. I went out and bought SWG, and installed it and have never logged back on to EQ. <br />
<br />
SWG is a whole different animal than EQ. It fresh and fast paced. Your not &quot;locked into&quot; your charachter, and there are lots of things to do, for just the casual gamer to the power gamer. <br />

Im back with my long time friends from Phoenix Crusaders and having fun!!<br />
