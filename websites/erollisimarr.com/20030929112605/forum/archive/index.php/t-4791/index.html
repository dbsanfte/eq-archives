<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solstaar Darkfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Lightning illuminated the skies in a horrific storm this eve, with the clashes of thunder exploding upon the grounds of the Karanas in claps.  A hill protruded from the valleys, with a dark being resting on the top.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Solstaar Darkfyre took out a book, and began to read out loud, not more for the chance of one hearing his words, but to talk to the heavens….as if to teach them.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “By the dawns of all whom believe in their respective figures, this day marks the final day of my studies.  Throughout the many years I have laid upon these lands, I have finally completed my full report.  It reads as follows….”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Solstaar took a deep breath, and continued to read loudly.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The gnomish armies of Ak`Anon are quite intelligent folk, with their little experimentive ways, but they lack patience and ingenuity.  Their primitive minds may spark new and useful ideas, but their minds are still indeed……primitive.  Perhaps that will change, but I would guess not.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The halflings of Rivervale are vile creatures.  They feed on minds like parasites, and lack the ability to distinguish what is private, and what is not.  Their bands in the Nektulos Forest are weak, and quite useless in their cause to seek revenge upon the Tier’dal.  However, their vengeance makes them a powerful asset for Innoruuk, especially those who look under Tunare for guidance.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The dwarves of Kaladim are stubborn folk, who believe their way is the right way.  They do not listen to others, nor do they believe that they should.  However, the simple fact is that they live in a hole, very unlike Neriak,….and that shows their intelligence enough.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The barbarians of Halas have few brains for their brawn.  Several sources have let me know that they just recently discovered the art of advanced mathematics.  How incredibly……intelligent.   Nevertheless, their relentless power and brawn make them a force to be reckoned with….on the battlefield.  I would enjoy playing a game of Chess with one of their kind.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The mysterious Iksar lizardman of Cabilis.  Intelligent beings indeed, with the ability to even prophesize.  In my studies of their ancient civilations, I have found an ancient globe in the Skyfire Mountains…the globe shows all of Norrath, including Faydwer, Antonica, and Kunark….but it also shows two other continents, one of massive proportions.  How is one to know if it is just blasphemy?  I believe it isn’t…as an iksar has never been seen on Antonica or Faydwer until just recently, yet they knew about the geography of Antonica and Faydwer thousands of years ago.  Very dangerous creatures, and quite possibly, more cunning then us as Tier’dal….”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Ogres of Oggok.  Well well, where can I begin?  They are very powerful, and although they lack the ability to speak the common tongue as all other races can, they do something none can ever do.  They base their hierarchy on physical power.  That is ingenious, and quite honestly, not as primitive as one would think.  They have the power to summon magicks, and control some of the environment around them.  They seem to be getting smarter by the day…..only evolution will show us what they become.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Trolls of Grobb.  Although quite strange individuals, they are extremely loyal to those who treat them with respect.  A powerful asset they are, but they don’t look for any reward.  They know who to destroy, and who to help….which makes them incredibly intelligent.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Erudites of Erudin.  A powerful group of people.  I suppose being a scholar, I see them differently then the rest of the Tier’dal, because the most powerful scholars ever to live, and the most influencial writers have been of Erudite origin.  They far surpass the patience and cunning of Tier’dal, however, they do not hold any type of leadership skills.  Which makes them quite….vulnerable.  Their only cover and hope is that they are an island away from the rest of civilization.  I am sure they pray it stays that way.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Fier’dal of Kelethin.  Incredibly poor people they are indeed.  They live in the here, and now.  They have no sense of the future, nor do they ever wish to.  Their families enjoy their pathetic lives as they happen, when they happen.  They let the love of Erollisi and the false wisdom of Tunare blind the real world from them.  And they never learn from the past.  I found proof of this on the Island of Erollisi in the Ocean of Tears.  What dumb, pathetic individuals.  And it doesn’t help that their entire city can be destroyed by one well-placed flame.  Somebody should put them out or their misery.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The pathetic half-breeds.  Fier’dal?  Human?  No, they are neither.  They are a mistake of their father and mother.  Hopefully the word will spread.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “The ‘pure’ elves of Felwithe.  Well well well.  I had thought they were a cunning bunch?  This is not true, whatsoever…..they took the bait of the intelligent iksar, and have left their precious capital unguarded, and vulnerable.  With the alliance of the Iksar and Tier’dal nearing completion…what will happen then?  They will swallow their cockiness, and will each be executed swiftly and neatly on front of an audience of cheering Tier’dal.  That is what will happen.  They take the bait so incredibly easily, how gullible.  Prepare for death, Felwithe.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Humans.  Innoruuk seems to trust some of them, so they cannot be all bad.  But of course so does Tunare.  Hmm, what to think of these beings.  Practical, somewhat neat, sometimes smart individuals.  Selfishness runs through their blood quite strongly…..they tend to welcome any into their cities, so long you have shown some sort of allegiance toward them.  Mostly to use them, I would guess.  They will survive in their port cities.”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Solstaar turned the page, and took one more, deep breath.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “Tier’dal.  What have we accomplished has a race?  Have we accomplished what we had thought Lord Innoruuk has wanted from us?  Will our hatred pull Norrath into our grip?  I would say no.  And what is the real test when we meet our father in the alter plane of hatred?  Our test is to slay our father?  What does that prove?  That proves that we can hate even the one whom we believe gives us our powers?  It proves NOTHING.  I see these dragoons, these warriors of the brotherhood, these knights of the lodge…..killing and maiming even the most insignificant fier’dal or human they lay their eyes upon.  I am not blind.  I know we are the supreme race, the perfect creation.  But answer me this……….Why kill the lesser, when you can use them to your advantage first?  I was arrested by the brotherhood for murdering a young Tier’dal who interrupted my study of the halflings in Nektulos before my studies were completed.  I would have rid of the filth when I was done, but his bloodthirsty sword needed to rid of them the moment his eyes laid onto them.  What has this race become?  A killing machine?  Apparently it has.  Kill the lesser, but why kill them until you have used all they have to offer?  I have presented this question time and time again, and none….not one Tier’dal understands me.  Of course, I do not need my brothers and sisters approval for anything.  I am a scholar, and they do not know what I have studied, only I know that……”<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The dark magi detached an emblem of the coveted Shadow Guard off of his robe, and held it in his hands, studying it.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp “What I hold in my hand, is the symbol of pure power on Norrath.  There is not one force capable of destroying our Guard, and that will never happen.  The only ones capable of destroying the Shadow Guard, are those within it.  I hope greatly that it never happens.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The Scholar of Innoruuk rose to his feet.  He removed a sacrificial dagger from his pack.  He slid the cool blade against his fingertips, against his palm, and heal of his hand....not drawing blood, just to feel the coolness.  He raised his face toward the skies, and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &quot;A scholar lives for one thing, and that is to learn, and teach......I could not find a Tier'dal whom I felt was suited enough for me to teach all I have learned, so I presented my most important findings to you....the heavens above.  Dimitrius D`Elovonte presented his findings on this very hill, and it was magically recorded in the library of Erudin by no author, so I know you all see this.......&quot;<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Gently, Solstaar slid the cool blade up his hand, until the edge rested onto his wrist.  He let his mind go free for the first time in his life and suddenly felt a shower of energy and warmth take over his cold Dark Elven body.  The warmth felt good, and felt promising to the magi.  A smile presented itself and with a smooth motion, Solstaar sliced his soft wrist, allowing the warm blood to flow freely onto his hand, and onto Norrath's land.  Free.  That is what Solstaar now was.......free of everything.  Free of politics, free of possession, free of hatred.  His soul would be possessed by whomever decided to claim it......his mind would rest in peace.  His learnings, would be scribed by no one, in the Library of Erudin....and placed where it belongs, in alphabetical order on a bookshelf.  On the inside of the front cover, will be imprinted in Gold, the symbol of the Shadow Guard.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The book is titled....<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Solstaar Darkfyre, Child Of the Spurned.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp In Memory of the Tier'dal Scholar.</div></div><hr />
