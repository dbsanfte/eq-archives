<br />
Fyndolyn sat beside the lake in the western common lands. His heart felt at peace watching the life that Tunare provided around him. The trees were lush and green, the grass silky and swaying softly in the breeze. The fauna varied in many ways, from giant spiders to the brown bears, even the footsteps of a giant could be heard thundering in the distance. Life was beautiful, in whatever form. <br />
<br />
Fyndolyn knew he needed to be getting back to Freeport. It was a long walk with a few dangers and he had already enjoyed this secluded get-away for a couple hours longer than he had intended. But he knew he could still make it back before nightfall, so, he treated himself to a few more minutes of basking in the glory of Tunare. <br />
<br />
Suddenly a massive hand fell on Fyndolyn’s shoulder and lifted him from the ground. Instincts taking over, Fyndolyn squirmed free of the powerful grip falling backwards slightly, but hitting another form. Reacting instinctively, Fyndolyn readied his weapon and maneuvered himself away from the two forms. Quickly he assessed the situation. Before him stood two massive ogres, both rather advanced in their studies. One was obviously a shaman as his spirit wolf snarled threateningly and paced slightly as if wishing its master would give the order for battle. The deep red eyes of the wolf reflected the hate and brutality of the shaman. The other was a Shadow Knight, judging by his Dark Forge armor. <br />
<br />
“Let me ask you a question.” Came a feminine voice and the two ogres stepped apart to reveal an attractive Teir’Dal woman. Fyndolyn knew he was at a grave disadvantage should combat ensue, and was ready to die if that was the fate Tunare had for him. But some how he didn’t think battle was the purpose of the 3 intruders, despite the look of bloodlust in the eyes of the two ogres. She continued speaking before Fyndolyn could respond. “Is the life that “mother” tunare provides better than the life that I give?”<br />
<br />
Fyndolyn was appalled that anyone could even think of a question like that, and he let it show on his face. The dark woman smirked at Fyndolyn then turned and seemed to summon some one forward to her. A Koada'Dal woman ran up and knelt down before her in humility and reverence. Fyndolyn watched as the woman waited for a signal to stand, which she never got. Suddenly he realized that he knew the high elven woman, from his youth. A childhood sweetheart lost to days gone by. Fyndolyn’s jaw dropped open as he looked at the woman kneeling beside the dark elf. She had not even noticed Fyndolyn, her eyes never left the Teir’Dal. “What have you done to her?” Fyndolyn demanded, unable to believe the sight before him. <br />
<br />
“I am Ezra, High Priestess of Innoruuk, leader of the order known as the Children of Darkness. This,” she said indicating one of the ogres, “is Nastur dark paladin of Cazic Thule and Elite, shaman of Rallos Zek.” She lowered a hand to the elf kneeling at her feet and stroked her hair. “And this is one of my slaves whose name is insignificant. We would like to perform a test, an experiment, and need your assistance.”<br />
<br />
Fyndolyn eyed the trio of evil beings before him suspiciously as she spoke. Her words rolled from her mouth like silk from a spider laying a web. “The question to be explored I have already asked you. ‘Is the life that “mother” tunare provides better than the life that I give?’” Ezra sat down next to the woman. Nastur seemed as if he was about to attack, growing ever more cautious now that the dark woman placed herself into a more vulnerable position sitting on the ground. She laid the elfess on the grass and took her head in her lap, looking down into her eyes. Fyndolyn could see a rush of energy in his childhood friend, a certain giddiness from the touch of the dark woman. He looked on feeling various levels of rage and confusion.<br />
<br />
“The test is this.” She said looking at Fyndolyn with her cold ice blue eyes, as she produced a nasty looking dagger. “If she cries out to you or tunare, you may save her life.” Ezra then lowered the blade into the woman’s stomach and slashing slowly from navel to ribs. The woman winced in agony, biting her lip, tears welling up in her eyes but did not cry out. Blood poured rapidly from the wound onto the ground. <br />
<br />
Fyndolyn’s body wretched at the sight. His stomach did summersaults and a sickly feeling filled his body as he saw the blood gushing from the elf he knew so long ago. Memories of simpler times rushed to him as he saw her blood spilling from the wound. Reflexively he stepped forward to heal her, but Nastur stepped forward to impede that movement. Disgusted and sickened as he was, Fyndolyn stopped, glaring at the ogre and waited to see what game the twisted elf was playing. <br />
<br />
The dark elf was holding the bleeding woman’s face in her hands now, their eyes were locked together. “Does it hurt, luv?” Ezra asked the woman.<br />
<br />
“Yes Mistress, terribly.” The she replied choking back her tears. <br />
<br />
“Call out to the priest of tunare and he can cure your pain, if you want.” She said running her fingers through her hair.<br />
<br />
“No, I do not want that Mistress.” She replied.<br />
<br />
“But… you will die.” The Teir’Dal said sounding sad.<br />
<br />
“Mistress,” she said, her words growing weaker already, “I know your will…” she coughed, “and the pleasure at serving you is greater than any pain…” she gulped trying to hold back the blood as it filled her mouth, “I could ever endure.” <br />
<br />
“Your such a good girl.” Ezra said, stealing a glance into the eyes of Fyndolyn who watched the scene with his jaw dropped in disbelief.</div></div><hr />

<br />
“MY GOD LIANDRIA!” Fyndolyn gasped in exasperation. “Your going to DIE!!!” But the woman seemed to ignore the plea of the cleric. Her world lay before her in the face of Ezra. She looked almost peaceful as her eyes began to glaze over. Ezra leaned in and kissed the dying elf deeply. <br />
<br />
Overcome with emotions, Fyndolyn began to summon up the healing powers Tunare had granted him. Suddenly Nastur was on the cleric, shaking Fyndolyn’s body fiercely, interrupting the spell that would have saved the woman’s life. <br />
<br />
“Damn it fool, let me save her!” Fyndolyn screamed at the ogre who now blocked Fyndolyn’s view of the dying elf. Nastur’s response was a low, rumbling growl that chilled Fyndolyn to the bone. Fyndolyn cried out again as he feinted to the right then cut swiftly to the left dodging past the ogre. “LIA! NO! DON’T DO THIS!” As he came around the ogre, the shaman jumped in front of him. Fyndolyn had expected this and had already begun swinging his mace, crashing it into the jaw of the second ogre. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the wolf was on top of Fyndolyn locking its jowls on his thigh, not letting go. The weight and strength of the wolf knocked him to the ground. Fyndolyn twisted his body and cracked his mace into the wolf trying to free himself. Fyndolyn felt his body sink into the ground some as the shaman cast the root spell. Nastur now swung his bulk around to face Fyndolyn. He reached down and placed his hand on the high elf as he struggled to free himself of the wolf and unleashed his gift given him by his god, Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
At first, Nastur hadn’t thought this idea of Ezra’s was good. He didn’t see the point. Nastur knew the reason behind this little “exhibition” as she called it, but thought that their point would be better taken if he and a couple of the boys simply “roughed” the elf up. But now he understood. Nastur was shaper than most ogres and he could see the terror in the cleric’s eyes, the confusion on his face, the sorrow tearing at his soul as he battled to save the woman’s life. The massive ogre knew the elf’s dreams would be haunted by this “exhibition,” this would be a day the elf would probably never forget.<br />
<br />
The elf hardly flinched when Nastur ignited the death energies and let it cackle from his hand into the elf’s body. The elf cried out in agony. Though it severely hurt him, Nastur could tell the cry was for the dying woman. He knew screams and cries. He could tell one kind apart from another like a mother could distinguish between her children. Nastur could feel Ezra’s hand on his back, the signal to step aside and let the high elf through. Elite gave a shape command and the wolf backed off of the high elf. Fyndolyn dove to Liandria and futilely called upon the healing energies of Tunare. Nastur relished this sight. It was truly beautiful. Terror in its most complete form. The ogre smiled a horrifying grin at Ezra, glad he had chosen to throw his lot in with her. Elite chuckled as the elf scooped up the dead woman into his arms.<br />
<br />
Fyndolyn prayed with all his might to summon the soul of the woman back to her body, but the soul was at peace, and would not return. Again and again Fyndolyn tried to resurrect her, but the last light of life was forever gone. <br />
<br />
Shaking from the shock of the moment, Fyndolyn could only whisper, “Why?”<br />
<br />
“It would seem dear cleric of tunare,” the silky words of that twisted bitch filled Fyndolyn’s ears, “that the life I gave to her was more important than what your precious mother could provide.” <br />
<br />
Fyndolyn could suddenly feel the body of the dark witch press against his as he kneeled by his childhood friend’s corpse. Her hands slid down the length of his arms and he could feel her warm breath on his ear. He wanted to throw her off of him, to clasp his hands around her throat and strangle the life out of the evil elf, but he couldn’t. His eyes were locked with the dead eyes of his friend. She had an eerie peaceful look on her face which reached into Fyndolyn’s soul. The dark elf whispered to him. “I want you to remember that. Remember how she chose to die to please me than to live with the gifts you claim tunare gives. I want you to forever see this woman’s death and know that I am the one who truly grants a life worth living. It was her choice to die, she wanted it, because I wanted it. Now, dear Fyndolyn, you have 2 choices; run and hide in your marble city or give up your life, either giving it to me, learning what joy you can have or by having it taken from you by Nastur.” <br />
<br />
She stood and sauntered away from the grief-stricken elf.<br />
<br />
Fyndolyn stood and saw the Shadow Knight facing him. “Yous no wot choose yous make dat Nastur wan’ yous ta make, don’cha?” Said the massive ogre with a grin then he turned and lumbered after Ezra. Fyndolyn watched the trio as they walked calmly away, his jaw clinched and tightened, his face hardened like a stone and a tear rolled down his cheek.</div></div><hr />
