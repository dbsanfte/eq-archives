<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colmillo Icelander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I am the dumbass, if anybody wants to know.  This story starts about a week ago when I was sitting in EC on my alt monk named Jonbobo, who I had twinked out with all my gear (leaving only nodrop stuff on Colmillo).<br />
     I saw this lvl 56 monk (Ijac) with epic being auctioned and thought I should look into it (my first stupid decision).  Then they said they were looking for around 60k.  So being excited that I could afford this, I said i'd give them my RBG, Tstaff, ancient seahorse hide cloak for the monk .  They said ok and I got the account.<br />
     I threw all of Jonbobo's stuff onto Ijac and continued to play him for a week, in which time I got a full AA point and was working on my second.<br />
     Then suddenly yesterday, I couldnt log onto the account.  All night last night, he was auctioning Ijac... I believe I have warned most of the EC community, but I have learned that it's smartest just NOT to do account trades.  I am now too poor to even buy rings and earrings to replace other than my nodrop gear...  Just dont fall into this scam.<br />
<br />
PS: I also learned that this same person has been auctioning &quot;60 ntov equipped warrior on another server&quot; so dont fall for that either... he gives a whack account name like &quot;eric 1440&quot; or &quot;patrick102&quot;.  If anybody can figure out how to scam him back, I will be glad to help you... this guy ruined me.</div></div><hr />

As for you missy, I would stay out of peoples business :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hiraken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cant the GM's do anything after the fact about these scams?(i know sony trys to prevent them with their policys...) or do they side with the original purchaser of the account? (for legal reasons I assume?)<br />
<br />
Trading/Swapping accounts is not allowed from what I recall, so is Sonys only answer to just say 'we're sorry but, you shouldnt have done it?&quot;  Just curious.  <br />
<br />
Sorry you got taken, thats a bum deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Graeme Faelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You break the rules, you take your chances.  Transferring of accounts is expressly prohibited in the EULA that you agree to each and every time you play.  Whether you think the policy should exist or not, you are still agreeing to it every time you play.  So, all I can say is, don't expect any help at all from Sony/Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SomewhatDamaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Saw this guy 4 days ago in the bazaar auctioning his char again, just thought you all would like to know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BronzAloy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have a friend that has obtained accounts successfully without issue. &quot;Know who you are buying from&quot; is his motto.<br />
<br />
Ex.<br />
1. Never use in-game funds for an account.<br />
2. Get a signed agreement faxed or mailed to you with photocopy of their driver's license.<br />
3. Make them sign for the money... what is an extra $xx.xx for a piece of mind.<br />
4. Get their phone number.<br />
5. Make sure they are of age and if not, deal with their parents.<br />
<br />
People that are not willing to do these steps are either <br />
a.) Are Scammers <br />
b.) Paranoid<br />
c.) Other<br />
<br />
Separate issue but, like many have stated... to get to the big level game doesn't mean just having a high level character... you have to know your characater's abilities and know raid etiquette. Anyone can wall farm and kite to high 50's and low 60's... doesn't mean as a tank you'll know how to keep mob out of the wall and with its back to the pets and rogues. Doesn't mean you know you need your resists to all be over 120 unbuffed, that you have an EB item or that you'll know how to nuke and heal without agro and without running out of mana.... /wink  ... and, Pet Back Off ... is a button for a reason!!!<br />
<br />
... be wary the evil scammers... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blagok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I may be wrong about this but if account selling is against the rules and basically &quot;illegal&quot; as far as soe is concerned I don't think having a signed agreement or receipt would help would it?<br />
For example say you and I make a bet on a football game in a state were gambling is illegal.  We write out a payment agreement and I lose and refuse to pay you.  You can't take me to court though nor would you have any legal recourse because the contract was for an illegal activity and thus is void.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BronzAloy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Blagok,<br />
<br />
Good point. That is why most people state that you are paying for their time to get the character to xx level vs. the account itself.<br />
<br />
Bronz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>MaStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sorry you got took Col, but Bronz has it right.<br />
<br />
Even if Sony can't/won't do anything because of the EULA, armed with signatures and papers (not to mention an ID), you can take someone to court. If more people thought they could end up in a real court for some of the fraud and theft that's perpetrated, I'd be willing to bet that there would be a lot less folks losing things that they or friends/family worked hard for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sanori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just saw this turkey in bazaar tonight, auctioning level 56 monk with epic.  I chatted with them long enough to find out that they're currently asking for a &quot;few hundred dollars&quot; for this account.  They also claimed to have recently acquired this account in exchange for pp on another server.  Keep your eyes peeled, folks.</div></div><hr />

Have not seen him since but he was still on 20 mins after I left the chat but had stopped advertising (hoping because he was being akled too)<br />
