Honestly though, I don't really care anymore.  It was a year ago, and BC has developed a worse rep from other things he has done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taevitus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Battlecat, your post is unintelligble. It is one thing to make a typo, but you are a just a lazy fucking poster. If you don't care enough to relay your thoughts to others here on the message boards correctly, don't expect for them to care about you or what you have to say.<br />
<br />
Many people here of upstanding reputation have brought to light your devious actions, your reputation is worthless, and all who visit these boards know to steer clear of you. If you found a cure for Cancer AND Aids, I still think most of the E-Marr community would still hate you.<br />
<br />
<br />
..for good reason.</div></div><hr />

The only reason I bothered to make a posting on this is because I feel a person's actions in the past should be taken into consideration by guilds considering offering a membership to that person.  This is mostly because a guild that offers you a tag now has their honor and reputation at stake, on the basis of your future actions.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't care anymore either, but I do not think the stature of limitations on your offences against common sense should be decided by my attention span in relation to morons.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to relate my personal experiences with anyone as a reference for guild membership.  Most of the negative experiences i've had with people have left little lasting impression.  Your's simply stood out more, because I considered it a bit of a betrayal (due to trusts and courtesies extended in other situations).<br />
<br />
I wish you luck with your future endevours in EQ and elsewhere,<br />
