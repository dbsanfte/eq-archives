<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tomb Bloodfists</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&lt; dust an inch thick stirs as he opens the door &gt;<br />
<br />
This place doesn't get many visitors does it?<br />
<br />
&lt; silence, the barkeep snores, slumped on a stool in the corner behind the bar &gt;<br />
<br />
Don't mind if I help myself do ya?<br />
<br />
&lt; grabs a couple bottles of Flaming Clurg from behind the bar, slipping a few plat into the barkeeps pocket &gt;<br />
<br />
Ah, not the best, but better than most. <br />
<br />
&lt; takes a seat in a dark corner and sits back to relax for a while, chugging the first bottle of Flaming Clurg, propping his feet up on the table and leaning the chair back against the wall &gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tomb Bloodfists</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&lt; stirs from his latest alchol induced nap and walks over to the bar &gt;<br />
<br />
So, what else we got behind that bar to drink?<br />
<br />
the still dozing barkeep doesn't reply...<br />
<br />
&lt; helping himself once again he notices everything is gone, including the Bog Juice and Ogre Swill &gt;<br />
<br />
Well, looks like the bar has dried up, time to be movin on.<br />
<br />
Don't spend all that platinum in one place good sir.<br />
<br />
&lt; walks out into a dark deserted street and fades out into the shadows &gt;</div></div><hr />
