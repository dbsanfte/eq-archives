<br />
~~~~~~~~~The Great War~~~~~~~~~<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~Chapter 1~~~~~~~~~~<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~Betrayal~~~~~~~~~~<br />
...in the year 1429 a war was brewing between the Humans of Qeynos, Lead by their General Desuka, Loyal Shadow Knight, and friend to all Humans, their enemys were the  Great Barbarians of Halas lead by the Vicious Olint, Warlord of the Barbarian Army, their war had been rageing long and hard for a great many years, but in the year 1457 the two sides made peace, the reason was not explained, all the people know is that one day Olint waved the White flag and gave up, and so there was peace in the land for a great while, but what the Humans did not know was that the Barbarians did not give up they simply bought themselves time to prepare and make a deal with a new threat which faced not only the Humans of Qeynos, but the entire world of norrath,The Iksar had come forth from the far away continent of Kunark &amp; they wished to make all the land just like thier own, but they knew of course that they could not do it alone, so they made a deal with the barbarians, The Iksar will help them Defeat the humans, but only if the Barbarians would help the Iksar, defeat the rest of Norrath, Starting with Antonica &amp; continuing to Faydwer, Odus, and lastly the newly discovered Velious. <br />
            The Barbarians agreed to this deal hoping that they could finally beat the Humans that they hate so much, although all was not as they thought, many Barbarians were against the war and wished for the fighting to stop, but more than that there was one that had many human friends before the war and did not wish to fight them, he avoided it by becomeing a guard to the General Olint himself, this way he did not have to go to war and could avoid fighting his friends but when he heard this plan he knew that his human friends would have no chance of survival this Barbarian was named Valden and although he was a Rogue by trade he had much knowledge of the Ways of the Warrior, and made his fellow Barbarians beleive he was one so that he could remain in the army, for Barbarians did not admit Rogues into the army only warriors.<br />
            So during the night Valden Rode away on his horse to Blackburrow the only passageway between His people and the city of Qeynos....after many hours of riding he came to the gate a Qeynos where he was immediatly captured, being a Barbarian and brought before Desuka who asked him,<br />
&quot;What are you doing in our Land&quot;<br />
Valden replied,&quot;What dont you remember me old buddy?&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you talkings about! I have never met you before in my life!&quot;<br />
&quot;That hurts man, we grew up together, dont you remember me, the young barbarian that used to play with you as a child?&quot;<br />
        At that Desuka had a flashback, suddenly he remembered playing with his human friends in Blackburrow before it became a city for Gnolls, there was a Gnoll Scout that found him and his friends, and had them cornered, it looked like they would never get out of there, but then all of a sudden the gnoll ran away like a cowardly dog, Desuka and his friends were confused, and when the turned around they saw a huge Barbarian and although he was the same age as them, he was much bigger being a Barbarian and all, and they became friends all of them, Desuka, Xeerex a high alf and only a child then but still training to become a great wizard even at his young age, Lahn a half elf and a decended of great druids of the past and studying to become a great druid himself one day, and the last boy that was with them that day was quite unusual, he was the only one of them that was not grateful for Valden's help, for he was very self dependant, and belived that he could beat the gnoll by himself, he was rather a cocky little punk, his name was Strykker a human and an orphan with no home or family, he had become a ranger at a very young age, seven years old he had decided to become a ranger, ever since his parents left him to survive on his own.<br />
      But even though they didnt get along at first Valden became good friends with Desuka, Xeerex, Lahn, &amp; Strykker and as children they grew up together during good days, before the Barbarian/Human war, but when the war began they lost contact each of them went home to their villages, and saw each other no more until the war ended, this in fact was the first meeting of two of them in more than 10 years,<br />
      Desuka then stood up and said,&quot;cut his ropes this man shall not be held prisoner he is our guest&quot;<br />
      The orders were soon obeyed and Valden and Desuka were left to Desuka's Quarters to discuss the reason of Valdens Journey.<br />
Desuka says,&quot;Well my old friend what brings you here on such a dark night?<br />
Valden replies,&quot;I wish i were here for happier reasons but that is not the case...the war is not over, not like you thought, Olint was not surrendering simply buying himself time to make a deal.  The Iksar have come forth, and they wis to take over the world.  That is why Olint surrendered to you, he is makeing a deal with the Iksar to take over first you then the rest of Norrath, I tell you this because you are my friend, and i have been against this war for a great while.&quot;<br />
         &quot;This is indeed i'll news my friend, but i owe you a great deal of gratitude now, for now that we know of this we can be ready, the war will not catch us by suprise we shall call for reinforcements,and we shall be victorious.  I ask you my friend to join us in the fight.&quot;<br />
         &quot;Aye and that i will my friend, that i will, but my weapon will kill no Barbarian, only Iksar Blood will stain my weapon, for i cannot kill one of my own.&quot;<br />
        &quot;That is understandable my friend, and tommorow we will have much to do, but for now you should sleep,  I will send a messenger tonight to Freeport, Where Xeerex is currently studying at the Academy of Arcane Science, he should be here for this, Lahn is with him and will be sent for as well, as for Strykker, he is currently residing in Surefall Glade across the Hills, no more than 10 minutes journey walking, I shall send for him tomorrow, and we will fight side by side once more, as we all did as children, but for now sleep my friend, if you need anything just ask the servants they will bring you whatever you need, but for now I must do some prepareing.&quot;<br />
<br />
        Valden is given a room within the great city of Qeynos, at last reunited with his friend, and soon to be united with all of his childhood friend, he begins to think of his own people in Halas, he knows now that he shall never be able to return there that he has done this, he has betrayed his people to help his friends, yet somehow he believes everything will turn out alright in the end, but for now he must get rest, he has much to do in the morning...<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the end of chapter 1 I will appreciate anyone comments about this and thank you for your time.<br />

~~~~~~~~~~~~Reunions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
The next morning Valden awoke to the sound of cheering as he looked out the window he saw that a huge crowd of people were in the center of town.<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; he said.<br />
Valden got dressed quickly and went downstairs to see what was going on. When he got there he saw Desuka on a podium telling his people of the oncoming war.  As Valden looked on he noticed a few familiar faces on the stage.  After getting closer he realized that they were in fact his friends Xeerex and Lahn. He was about to Greet them when something else caught his eye.  The man standing next to him had a cloak over his face hiding it completly, Valden didnt think much of this except that he felt something scaly brush his leg. He looked down and saw that it was an Iksar Tail. An Iksar was in the city, although why it was here Valden could only guess at.  He knew enough though to know that he must do something about this.  So in pure Barbarian fashion instead of coming up with a plan he simply approached the Iksar head on.  Senseing danger the Iksar attacked Valden viciously.  Everyone cleared away to see Valden at the mercy of an Iksar Assasin sent to take out Desuka.  it was armed with a Short Sword of Ykesha pressed firmly to Valdens' neck. The Iksar Pulled back his arm and just as it prepared to strike<br />
..................................*sounds of an arrows flying* <br />
*dull thud as Iksar hits ground*<br />
an arrow was sticking out of its eye and it lay dead.<br />
Strykker steps out from the crowd and puts away his bow.<br />
he bends down and takes the SSOY from the Iksar's cold dead fingers.<br />
&quot;Damn Punk Mugged me on my way here&quot; he said.<br />
Valden Replied,&quot;good to see you again my friend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thats one you owe me now&quot; said Strykker as he helped Valden to his feet.<br />
&quot;Indeed it is, and with the threat of war in the air I may have a chance to repay you before long.&quot; replied Valden.<br />
Desuka then concluded his speech,&quot;Now my friends, you see this Iksar, dead now for daring to oppose us. but there are many like him and we must make them all know that we will not easily be threatened. The time for peace is at an end, we must prepare for war. The city shall be locked down, we shall send messengers to our allies in the south, the east, and the west. for when the armies of the north Knock at our gate. they shall be met with Cold Steel, and Flaming Arrows!&quot;<br />
At this a cheer went up from the Crowd and Desuka met up with his four friends.<br />
 Desuka says,&quot;It is good to have all of us together again.&quot;<br />
 Xeerex says,&quot;yeah it is, good to see ya again Valden, I didnt expect to see you here, you know being a Barbarian and all especially when Barbarians are our enemies right now.&quot;<br />
 Valden says,&quot;what are you saying?&quot;<br />
 Xeerex says,&quot;nothing nothing at all, you guys wanna get some food? yeah lets get some food.&quot;<br />
 Strykker says,&quot; when is this war gonna start, I gotta a taste for Iksar blood just now and i want more.&quot;<br />
 Lahn says,&quot;that is so like you Strykker, always wanting more and more blood&quot;<br />
 Strykker says,&quot;.....so?&quot;<br />
 Lahn says,&quot;nevermind&quot;<br />
 Desuka says,&quot;enough of this anyway, i have jobs for you guys.&quot;<br />
 Valden says,&quot;What you talking about Desuka?&quot;<br />
 Desuka says,&quot; I need you guys to go with a group of Men to our allies in The Faydark&quot;<br />
 Strykker says,&quot;you want us to go to Kelethin?&quot;<br />
 Desuka says,&quot; yes we do not have the man power here in the city to face the Barbarian and Iksar Armies by ourselves, we need you to ask the Wood elves to help us in our most desperate hour.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;I'm in.&quot;<br />
Valden says,&quot; me too&quot;<br />
Lahn says,&quot;hell ya&quot;<br />
Xeerex comes out of a building and meets them. &quot;I thought we were gonna get some food?&quot; he said.<br />
Desuka says,&quot; you dont have time to eat you gotta go.&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot; Where are we going?&quot;<br />
Desuka says,&quot;you gotta cross the Karana, to HighKeep, then you go through High Pass to Kithicor Forest. you might meet up with a Ranger named Kithicor, if you do just tell him Desuka sent you and he should let you pass. once through you should be in the West Commonlands, oh i almost forgot. never Enter Kithicor Forest after Dark, the undead rise from their graves then and attack all who enter their realm.<br />
well continuing once you enter the commonlands the trip to Freeport is not long, but beware along the way there are Orcs, Dervs, Dark Elves, and Monsters of all sorts.  But dont worry they shouldnt be too much trouble if you stay out of their way, once you get to freeport tell the Freeport Capitan, Commander Abackus Mezzoforte, of our problem, I think he shall help us in our fight.  After this you must take the boat to the Butcher Block Mountians to finish the journey to Kelethin, I will be sending messengers to our allies in other citys, I will keep in contact with you and tell you of changes as often as I can.  I just wish I could go with you guys.  anyway since I must make sure things run smoothly here thats not an option.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;No worries Desuka, we'll get this job done and be back here before you know it.&quot;<br />
Desuka says,&quot;yes well i certianly hope so, ohh and by the way you should stop by Faydwer while in the Faydark, they are not the fighting type but a few like Xereex will be willing to join you and fight.  We need as many willing fighters as we can.&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot; I dont know if thats a compliment but thanks man we wont let you down.&quot;<br />
Valden says,&quot;when do we leave?&quot;<br />
Desuka says,&quot; I only wish we had more time but as we do not you must set out tomorrow we do not know how long it will be until the Barbarians come knocking at our door.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot; you can count on us man we wont let you down.&quot; <br />
Desuka says,&quot; well i never have been let down by you guys before...let us prepare you set out tomorrow.<br />
Desuka, Lahn, Strykker, Xeerex, and Valden then leave to each prepare for the Journey in their own way.  Unfortunaltly they do not know that away up North, the Barbarians are being warned that the Humans know of the plan.<br />
Olint says,&quot;What do you mean the Humans know?&quot;<br />
Mosca says,&quot;That Traitor Valden snuck away from here and told them all of your plan, when I heard him talking i thought i should tell you.&quot;<br />
Olint says,&quot;this is a very upseting turn of events, Mosca i want you to return to Queynos tonight. find out where they go and follow them, eventually i want you to earn their trust, and send me messages of your progress every chance you get.  If you do well on this Job i will let you return to your home and you will no longer be my slave.&quot;<br />
Mosca says,&quot;Yes Master&quot;<br />
Mosca Bows to Olint and leaves. He then Mounts his dog and rides back to Queynos.<br />
<br />
(for anyone who doesnt understand the dog comment Mosca is a Gnome and a Gnome riding a horse is just plain ridiculous)<br />
Well I have only gotten one reply to this story but everyone I ask likes the story so i'm gonna keep writing it. I hope everyone likes it and if you do please post a response.<br />
anyway until chapter 3 I'm out<br />

~~~~~~~~~~Across the Karanas~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day the four travelers departed from Qeynos to begin their journey, but bad luck befalls them less than an hour from departure.  As they enter the Plains of Karana from the Qeynos Hill they encounter a Werewolf hunting small prey, as it catches sight of them it stops.  <br />
Xeerex say,&quot;Whats it doing, why doesnt it attack?&quot;<br />
Valden says,&quot;I dont know maybe it knows it cant take four of us.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;No thats not it&quot;<br />
Lahn says,&quot; Then what is it?&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Its not alone.<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;What? what you mean?&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Over there in the bushes, another one, and a third on its way probably.&quot;<br />
Valden says,&quot;What do we do then?&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;We attack and quickly before more get here.&quot;<br />
Lahn says,&quot;Ok then lets do it.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Hold on, Xeerex you and Valden take the one up ahead, Lahn help me with the one in the bushes.&quot;<br />
Strykker calmly draws his bow, but keeps his sword ready.<br />
Valden slowly approaches the werewolf, it slowly walks up and looks him straight in the eye...suddenly Valden Disappears.  The Werewolf looks around confused. Then without warning Valden Backstabs the werewolf before it knows what hit him,  Valden drew back his Crystal Grinder and struck at the wolf many times.  The wolf blocked and parried his attacks and he blocked and parried the wolfs. Neither could seem to land a blow on the other until without warning an arrow hits the wolf through the head, it slumps over, dead.<br />
Valden says,&quot;Hey I had that!&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;no you didnt he was gonna kill you.&quot;<br />
Lahn says,&quot;you would think that a Werewolf could take more than one arrow.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;They can.&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;Then why did that one die?&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;It didnt.&quot;<br />
Xeerex turns around and sees the wolf staring at him right in the eye. An arrow sticking out of his head.<br />
Suddenly a Crystal Grinder is thrust forward, and pulled back slicing its Jugular ear to ear....Xeerex falls to his knees.<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;Thank you!&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Told you.&quot;<br />
Valden says,&quot;What happened to the one in the bushes?&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;I made a mistake.&quot;<br />
Valden says,&quot;What you mean?&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;It was a rabbit&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;So what happened?&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;.....whose hungry?&quot;<br />
After they had a decent lunch of rabbit, the travelrs continued<br />
on their Journey through the Plains of Karana.  They encountered few problems on their journey and eventually decided to camp a few miles off of The City of Highkeep.  For saftey they decided to sleep in shifts, two by two.  Strykker and Xeerex had the first shift.<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Its been a while man&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;Yeah, ten years i think since I last saw you.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;So what have you been doing these past ten years?&quot; <br />
Xeerex says,&quot;even though i do not support it I have been studying to become a wizard.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;You mean you dont want to be a wizard?&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;No what i really wanna be is a Warrior.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Your young why dont you become one?&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;My parents wont allow it. When they first asked me what i wanted to become, I told them Warrior, but they would not allow it.  My mother was a High Elf Enchanter, and my Father a Human Necromancer.  They wanted me to become a caster just like them, so i picked Wizard, that way I would be able to Translocate them away from me and they could stop running my life.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;....seems like a plan, where are they now?'<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;Dead. both of them, they had to go on a trip to Rivervale one day, passing through Kithicor Woods my father cast Invis to Undead on both of them...but somewhere they got seperated, my father searched long and hard, and when he found my mother, her Invis had failed and an Undead solider had ravaged her body.&quot;  <br />
Strykker says,&quot;Wow thats rough man...what about your dad?&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;He returned to Freeport a week later.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Ohh Freeport that place is a hole!&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;Tell me about it, well anyway, after my mom died my dad could not go on.  he was real quiet alot and he was never the same...one day his body washed ashore on the bank underneath the Academy of Archane Science.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;Wow man that sucks. but now that there gone why didnt you become a warrior like you wanted?&quot;<br />
Xeerex says,&quot;I dont know man, by that time i was already so far into my studies, giving up and becoming something else just didnt seem worth it.&quot;<br />
Strykker says,&quot;.....hmm well that sucks man....hey i think its our turn to sleep lets wake these guys.<br />
Strykker and Xeerex switched with Valden and Lahn, and went to sleep.  The next morning after a quick breakfast the Travelers continued on their way...at the end of the day they arrive at the great city of Highkeep, where their journey takes a new twist...<br />

~~~~~The Warrior of Highkeep~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
The next day our travelers arrive in the city of Highkeep, Once there they decided to find rest for the night, also they figure they should do some recruiting.  Strykker and Xeerex go to ask the Capitan if they can stay the night, while Valden and Lahn start recruiting.<br />
        Commander of the Highkeep Guards was a Stout Wood Elf named Fayceless; Valden explained to him about the oncoming war, Fayceless knew that his men were powerful enough to truly help the Qeynos Guard in their defense<br />
Fayceless said,” Yes we shall help you.  I shall dispatch as many of my men to Qeynos to aid you in your defense.<br />
        Valden said,” Thank you sir, also I wish to know if me and my company can stay here for the night?”<br />
        Fayceless said,” Of course you can, I shall have four rooms made up immediately.”<br />
        Strykker and Xeerex enter the room rather angry looking.<br />
        Strykker said,” That Capitan Dranko, says we can’t stay here.”<br />
        Valden replies,” Its ok Commander Fayceless here has already given us permission.”<br />
        Just then a panicked looking solider burst into the room<br />
        Panicked Solider said,” Sir the Pickclaw forces are attacking we need help!”<br />
        Fayceless said,” Get everyone to the Pickclaw mines! (To Valden) Stay back we can handle this!”<br />
        Fayceless and the solider run down the hall and the four travelers follow quickly after them, when they arrive they find a huge battle insueing in the Pickclaw mines beneath the city.  The Highkeep Guards are fighting valiantly against the Pickclaw goblins charging endlessly out of the mines.  Valden, Lahn, Strykker, and Xeerex look at each other, turn, and charge head on into battle.  Lahn dodged around avoiding Pickclaws, healing whoever was in need.  Xeerex hung in the back and used his Area Effect spells to Blast the H*** out of some Pickclaws.  Valden in true Barbarian style simple walked up and started slashing, backstabbing, and causing as much general pain as he could.  Strykker stayed in the back picking off little goblins with arrows.  The battle raged and the fighters grew tired, Lahn and Xeerex’s mana was low, Valdens’ kill count was rising, Strykker has increased his skill in Archery (103).<br />
        Capitan Dranko was ordering his forces to press further into the goblin mines; Capitan Fayceless was fighting Bravely alongside his warriors.  Suddenly a huge goblin appears from the mine, it is larger than the others, when Valden saw this a wave of fear passed over him, then he heard a voice to his right,” There he is.” A solider suddenly jumped up and charged the Goblin at full power.<br />
        The Goblin and the solider had a very quick fight for the size of the thing.  The fight lasted 17 seconds before it fell.  When it fell all the other Goblins got scared and ran as fast as they could back to their secret dwellings.  Valden star struck with this display of power had to talk to this warrior.  After the battle he approached him.<br />
        Valden said,” Hail Solider.”<br />
        Solider said,” Hail who are thee?”<br />
        Valden said,” My name is Valden, and I must say that I am much impressed with the way you handled that Goblin.”<br />
        Solider said,” It was nothing, these goblins do not take very good care of themselves at all, there weak.”<br />
        Valden said,” Tell me about it, will you be dispatched to Qeynos for the war?”<br />
        Solider said,” I haven’t heard about it yet, but if I am sent I will go.<br />
        Valden said,” Well it would be great to have your help, you are the most powerful warrior I have ever seen…what was your name by the way?”<br />
        Soldier said,” The names Samei, Samei Cannonarms of the Highkeep Guard.”<br />
<br />
Valden said,” Great to meet you Samei, I hope to see you again.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Samei said,“ Same here, and I hope you enjoy your stay in Highkeep.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden rejoins Strykker, Lahn, &amp; Xeerex.<br />
_ _ _ _ Lahn said,” Come on we have four rooms on the upper floor set up for us”<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden said,” What time tomorrow do we leave?”<br />
_ _ _ _ Strykker said,” We should be through Highpass by 8a.m. if we want to get through Kithicor Woods before dark.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Just then Samei Cannonarms walked through the room, suddenly a high pitched scream of a star struck girl rang out,” OH MY GOD ITS SAMEI CANNONARMS!!!!!!!  Suddenly a group of screaming adolesant girls ran by and surrounded Samei, who began immediately to sign autographs.  <br />
_ _ _ _ Strykker said,” DUDE! Do you know who that is?”<br />
_ _ _ _ Xeerex said,” It sounds like its Samei Cannonarms.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Strykker said” Don’t tell me you don’t know about Samei Cannonarms?”<br />
_ _ _ _ Lahn, Valden, &amp; Xeerex Stare at Strykker blankly.<br />
_ _ _ _ Strykker said,” Samei is a world famous warrior, he has been on more adventures than you could imagine, he is a veteran of more than a hundred battles, and he is very popular with the ladies.” <br />
_ _ _ _ Valden said,” No kidding.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Lahn said,” So if he’s so famous what’s he doing in the Highkeep Guard?<br />
_ _ _ _ Strykker said,” Well Samei has a rather cloudy past, he has done many great things, but he has been accused of many evil deeds, he’s probably trying to keep a low profile.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden said,” Hmmm maybe we should ask him to join us on this Journey?”<br />
_ _ _ _ Strykker said,” I don’t know man, he probably wants lay low, he does have a 1,000,000pp bounty on his head.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden said,” Still there isn’t any harm in asking.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Strykker said,” Alright go head, if you must.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden, Xeerex, and Lahn approach Samei, Strykker stays in the back.<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden said,” Hail again Samei.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Samei said,” Hail Valden, what can I do for you today?”<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden said,” Well you may not have heard of it, but the Iksar of Kunark have struck a deal with the Barbarians of Halas.”<br />
Samei looks Valden up &amp; down,” Umm you may not have heard but you’re a Barbarian.”<br />
_ _ _ _ Valden said,” When I heard of the deal my people were making I could not allow it to happen.  So I turned on my Barbarian brethren and joined true family in Qeynos.”<br />
Samei said,” Ahhh yes I see, so what was the deal?”<br />
Valden said,” The Iksar were planning to join forces with the Barbarians, they promised my people that they would help take over Qeynos, as they have been trying to do for years, and in return the Barbarians help the Iksar continue their domination of the rest of Norrath.”<br />
Samei said,” This is a problem indeed, tell me, why do you come to me with this problem?”<br />
Valden said,” Well from what my friend Strykker here tells me you are a world famous adventurer/warrior.”<br />
Samei said,” My reputation precedes me.”<br />
Valden said in a sarcastic tone,” Yeah…well I have seen you fight and I must say that I am impressed, I wonder if you would be willing to join us on our journey?”<br />
Samei said,” Where exactly will this journey be taking us?”<br />

&quot;Lifes Full of Small challenges, Its up to you to find those challenges, and make them less challenging&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheerleaders are just dancers gone retarded&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When the Dark comes rising, six shall turn it back;<br />
Three from the circle, three from the track;<br />
Wood, bronze, iron; fire, water, stone;<br />
Five will return and one go alone.<br />
<br />
Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long;<br />
Wood from the burning, stone out of song;<br />
Fire from the candle-ring, water from the thaw;<br />
Six signs the circle and the grail gone before.<br />
<br />
Fire on the mountain, shall find the harp of gold<br />
Played to wake the Sleepers, oldest of the old;<br />
Power from the green witch, lost beneath the sea;<br />
All shall find the light at last, silver on the tree.&quot;</div></div><hr />
