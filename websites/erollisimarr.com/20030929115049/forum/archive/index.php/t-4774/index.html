<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenrizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A tall hooded figure passes you on the streets of freeport, making his way from building to building, careful not to be seen by the Militia that patrol.  He ducks into an alleyway and reaches into a pouch and pulls out a bit of stale bread.  It's cold today.  Much colder than usual for this coastal town so near to the desert.<br />
<br />
The bread turns his stomach.  Food not fit for a warrior.  He used to dine with the likes of Hirazen and Sheg.  Bountiful meals with rack of kodiak, young ones the best, local berry pies, spiced potatos and a mead that would leave your head spinning in the morning.  But those days have passed.  Since Fenrizar decided to help his dearest and most trusted friend Kensupen and the Paladins of Marr battle the corruptness in the south side of town, his reputation is less than, well, amiable.<br />
<br />
Fenrizar shakes his head, pulls out a piece of parchment. Scrawled upon it is instructions from someone to meet him behind the leather shop on the east side of town to do &quot;business.&quot;  This wrenched Fen's stomach as he had a bad feeling about this.  Over time he's grown to trust his instincts.  A noise from around the corner makes him startle.  He curses himself as his years should make him more prepared.  He slowly extends the claws hidden from within his gauntlets.  Then, the person walking begins to whistle.  It's a tune from his past...<br />
<br />
A human stares right at Fenrizar, and walks over to him.  The man smiles at him as he sees the confusion on the face of the big warrior.<br />
<br />
The man closes his eyes, and mutters a few arcane words completely unintelligable to Fenrizar and his vision distorts and eventually becomes that of a High elf.  A very annoying high elf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hemptis!&quot; Fenrizar whisper-shouts, &quot;What are YOU doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish it was to talk about old times my friend, but I have some bad news for you.  Kensupen has sent me here with a message for you.&quot; Replied Hemptis.<br />
<br />
Continuing, &quot;He's been over in the Karanas on the other side of the prison and ventured south.  He says there are new gnolls coming forth from Paw that are killing many of your beloved centaurs as well as  any innnocent traveler who passes by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he okay?&quot; Fenrizar asks impatiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's managed to stay alive, has had to take the lives of some of them.  But his duty to Marr protecting the lives of NOrrathians is most difficult and he needs your help right away.&quot; Hemptis says. &quot;You must make haste, as they are almost invading the Karanas even North of the river.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fenrizar ponders this.  Kensupen's always getting in over his head, the headstrong boy.  Someday I won't be here to save him.  But I think he's already saved.<br />
<br />
Hemptis once more closes his eyes and begins to cast a spell.  His images becomes misty and is once more the human he appeared as first.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must preserve my reputation here in Freeport if i'm to remain as a devout liasion.  So I urge you to gather your belongings and be ready to run.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hemptis pulls a stone from one of his many hidden pouches, and begins to rub it and closes his eyes once more and Fenrizar feels a procective shield settle upon him.<br />
<br />
Knowingly, Fenrizar stands up, and nods to Hemptis.  (They've done this too many times.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Guards, GUARDS!&quot; Hemptis shouts. &quot;I see an infidel from one of the posters in the Training house!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you my friend.&quot; says Fenrizar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always.  For the Fate.&quot; Hemptis says as he claps the large warrior on the back.  &quot;Now GO&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Fenrizar emerges from the shadows, pulls his cloak back, his blue armor gleaming in the cold sun.  The guard pauses for a moment to see if this is what he wants to be his last mistake.  But then his duty forces his hand.  <br />
<br />
He lunges at Fenrizar.  But Fenrizar deftly evades the swing and counters by slashing the guards arm with his claws and leg with his axe. The guard swings up knocking Fen back.  Fenrizar picks the guard up and throws him down, and slashes him twice in the stomach, bringing forth his stomach contents and slashing the ankles of the guard.  The guard scream in mortal agony as his lifeforce ebbs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just then, a second guard shows up and casts a spell.  The wound on his stomach closes and the guard staggers back up.  He then swings at Fenrizar, his sword glancing off harmlessly due to the magic shield that protects him. A third guard jumps from behind and slips a shiv-dagger between Fen's breastplate and belt, causing Fenrizar to shout.  Knowing he's outnumbered, Fenrizar begins running for the city gates, he could lose them in the blinding sands of the desert.<br />
<br />
He passes guard after guard each one joining the pursuit.  They throw rocks, shoot arrows, and get some lucky hits in, but knowing the landscape well, Fen's able to lose them in the sandstorm just outside of town.<br />
<br />
&quot;The things I do for friends.&quot;<br />
