<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Countt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail friends, <br />
<br />
Until as of late, I have known myself as a only child. However, my mother recently revealed her dark secret to my father and I. While she was away in Erudin, she found comfort in the arms of tall dark skin man, by the name of Argovian. <br />
<br />
My mother being to ashamed to tell my father and I of her distasteful acts while she was away studing in the mighty city of Erudin, left her child with Argovian who to my disdain was one of the heretics who follow'd the ways of Cazic Thule. <br />
<br />
Although the path to understand my sister's dark ways and evil past, is a long one. I have begun to Aid her in her quest to discover her place in the world.  <br />
<br />

<br />
My thanks for thy time and farewell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Argiviana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail all.<br />
<br />
Because I prefer my solitude and company of my minions I shall make my presence with you short.<br />
<br />
Although my bother is of High Elf Blood, he as I, has been transformed through the blood of hate. His thoughts are occasionally guided by the will of Mayong mistmoore, and Mine by the Hand of the mighty Cazic Thule. <br />
<br />
I wish not to meet ye Daydwellers, nor should you myself. Until the morrow, adew.<br />
<br />
Argiviana</div></div><hr />
