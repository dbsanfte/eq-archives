<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Krual laid on the cold rocky floor of his cave near the swamps of Innothule. Pains torn through his body causing him to spasm and shake. He tried to stand but his legs were too weak to support his massive bulk. Staring at the wall that held his weapons, Krual gave up hope. His desire to Kill in the name of Hate, gone. His pain and agony were too great. His body, once a finely honed killing machine, now weak and frail. The pain in his limbs, the pain of not wanting to kill, was an eternity of Hell he wished not for.<br />
<br />
His once great companions, gone. His troll brothers, gone. His one true Orge friend, gone. His smaller Teir'dal friends, hidden, regrouping, but nonetheless, gone from him.<br />
He was filled with a sadness he knew not before.<br />
<br />
Slowly Krual crawled to his weapons hanging on the wall.<br />
He eyed his favorite axe.<br />
Kleevur.<br />
A great weapon that slayed many of his foes. This would be the weapon to receive the honor of felling the troll once known as Krual Haytebreenur.<br />
<br />
As Krual gripped the handle, memories surged through his mind. <br />
Ah, the memories. <br />
The battles. <br />
The victories. <br />
The death.<br />
The Hate.<br />
<br />
Krual grabbed the axe with all the might he could muster, he closed his eye, and prepared to end his once happy and death-filled life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Innruk, akcep Krualz sol en yu nam.&quot; Krual prayed.<br />
<br />
As Krual brought down the axe an immense amount of pain surged through his body. Unable to hold onto his axe, Krual dropped it to the ground as a blackness filled his head.<br />
<br />
Convulsing, Krual slipped into a dark hole of darkness.<br />
Images of death and hate swarmed around Krual.<br />
Krual tried to reach out, but the waves of insanity pulled his far from the reaches of safety.<br />
<br />
Silently, Krual died.<br />
<br />
Krual woke standing infront of a powerfully built Teir'dal warrior. Sitting on a throne of bleached bone, a background of crimson and black swirling with an eriee life.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you were once the great troll shadownight, Krual.&quot; the figure said knowingly.<br />
<br />
Krual knew not what to say, he only nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finished I am with you I am not.&quot; the Teir'dal spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bud Krual nawan tu liff aneemur. Krual hav enuff basheen, Krual juz wan tu seep.&quot;<br />
<br />
A fire of blue flashed in the darkelf's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU WHAT!&quot; the elf screamed.<br />
<br />
The elf slapped Krual across the face. &quot;You stupid troll, I should feed your rotting corpse to the maggots and use you insides to feed my slaves.&quot; The dark elf assulted Krual again. Mercilessly the enraged Teir'dal beat down on Krual, his strength suprisingly more than the average Teir'dal warrior that Krual knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not fit to join your long lost brothers, you snivelling weakling! They speak of you fondly but they will pay for your cowardice!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Teir'dal moved to strike Krual again, but a gleam of Hate flashed across Krual's eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;NEBUR SPEEK UV KRUAL'Z NAFOZ DAT WAE!&quot; Krual yelled and landed a solid blow to the startled Teir'dal's throat. &quot;Krual sho yu wot Hayte ar!&quot;<br />
<br />
With newfound energy and determination Krual barraged the dark elf with unsounding resolve. The onslaught continued til Krual's arms, bloodied and gore-filled grew tired of beating on the torn and deformed body of the elf.<br />
<br />
Heaving, Krual stood over the broken body, his eye filled with Hate. Blood poured from the cuts of Krual's fists, drool poured from his mouth, he lost all sense of where he was, he knew only one thing.<br />
<br />
He Hated.<br />
<br />
The Teir'dal looked up at the towering troll and laughed. The laugh peirced Krual's heart and soul. It was a laugh of pure evil. It was the laugh of Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
The dark elf stood up and smiled upon Krual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knew I did that the fires of Hate burned strong still, troll. Finished you are not. Go back into the world and spread My Word.&quot;<br />
<br />
With those words Innoruuk waved Krual away, and slowly the world around Krual dissapated into nothingness.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The chirping of frogloks filled Innothule. A small rainstorm had past through the region, causing the animals to come out of hiding and enjoy the damp and muggy air.<br />
The rain brought more out of hiding as well.<br />
A large bronze mass emerged from an opening in the side of the mountain. Weilding a large axe, the figure headed towards Grobb. Standing outside the gate, two troll guards demanded the unknown stranger to identify himself. <br />
<br />
The large troll flashed them a toothy grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Id Krual, Krual bak.&quot;</div></div><hr />
