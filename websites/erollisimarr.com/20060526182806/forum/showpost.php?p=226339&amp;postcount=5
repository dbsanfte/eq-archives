		<div>Chapter 4: Moonlight Musings, Dark Encounters <br />
<br />
<br />
Nasu awoke with a start, and quickly scanned her surroundings. She was in a small room below decks on the boat from Freeport to Butcherblock Mountains. Everyone else in their small group was sleeping nearby, all except Relik, who was standing watch. She stretched her slender frame, trying to relieve the stiffness and tension she felt. She closed her eyes again, hoping for a bit more sleep. After just a few moments she realized there would be no more sleep for her this night. Her mind kept replaying the events of the last twelve hours…. <br />
<br />
After Lady Erissa’s shocking news, there was a flurry of activity as everyone prepared to depart. Word was sent to all the cities of the good races, requesting immediate assistance in defending Antonica’s western border. Within the hour replies were received that help was already on the way. Every druid and wizard with the skills to teleport would tirelessly dedicate themselves to the task of getting the armies to their final destination. <br />
<br />
When the group was ready to leave, Erissa addressed them once more. “We cannot risk teleporting directly into Faydwer, it could be too easily detected. With all full groups ‘porting out to the west, our group ‘porting in would arouse the suspicions of those watching our destination. The enemy seeks to draw as many of our defenses to the west as they can, thereby weakening the defenses around the Paragon. We must allow them to think they are succeeding. We will ‘port no closer than the West Commonlands. From there we must make our way to the docks in East Freeport. We will take the boat to Butcherblock Mountains and from there… <br />
<br />
Gurundel interrupted impatiently, “But that will take far too long! What if we arrive too late? We must make haste!” <br />
<br />
Arenth agreed. “Yes! I would see the stone secured as soon as possible. I am eager to return and avenge my brethren slain in Erudin!” <br />
<br />
“No, Lady Erissa is right,” declared Calera. “I am a master at controlling the elements, but once control of the element of surprise is lost, it can never be regained!” <br />
<br />
The argument grew more and more heated as others joined in the debate. Finally Relik bellowed, “Enough!” <br />
<br />
Everyone stopped speaking and turned to the big barbarian. “The lady knows more of these matters than any of us. We waste even more time with useless arguments since it is clear she knows best. Let her lead and concern yourselves with following!” he shouted, glaring at the others. <br />
<br />
Erissa smiled at the warrior and said, “Thank you Relik. Truvan, Laoden, we are ready to depart.” <br />
<br />
Once in the West Commonlands, they saw many troops on the move, all headed west. Not wishing to draw attention to themselves by heading east against the flow, they left the road and were lead by Truvan, with Nasu keeping them away from any unwanted encounters with her superior tracking ability. With everyone using their special talents to benefit all, they were able to make their way swiftly and secretly to Freeport. After getting settled on the boat, Erissa instructed them to get some sleep, as they would need their wits about them at the end of the voyage. <br />
<br />
This brought Nasu back to the present. She stood up, stretched again and made her way silently to the door. It would soon be time for her to relieve Relik so he could get some sleep as well. As she stepped out onto the moonlit deck of the ship, she spotted Relik leaning on the railing, staring broodingly out at the ocean. He turned at the sound of her step and his face brightened with a smile as he saw who approached. <br />
<br />
The moon shone brightly and the beams that emanated from the glow seemed to hit the ocean and scatter. It was unusual to see such a night in the Ocean of Tears, it was named thus because of the frequent showers which paraded across its scattered islands and waters. Tunare had a reason to weep that night, Odus was lost. Relik had plenty of time to think of the last couple of hours and its events. He liked sailing, as much as he hated to admit it. He loved the smell of the cool ocean breeze as it slid gently across the deck of the Sirensbane. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to have some company,” Relik said as he smiled at Nasu. His smile quickly faded, he didn’t want to seem like he was enjoying himself. &quot;The ocean isn't much to look at.&quot; <br />
<br />
He turned back to the water and leaned over the railing, gazing out into the ocean. Nasu moved to his side and joined him in his silent gaze. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a bit more relaxing than running across the plains don't you think?&quot; said Nasu as she rubbed her legs sorely. Relik's muscles had ached a little as well, but he did not dare seem weak. He nodded in reply. <br />
<br />
The two sat and watched the ocean pass beneath the hull. The calm rocking of the boat to and fro made the passing sea seem mesmerizing. Relik couldn't help but glance over to Nasu every once and a while to admire her beauty. The way her fiery red hair blew in her face, and the way she slowly returned it behind her pointed ears. &quot;Pull yourself together,&quot; He thought to himself &quot;We've got more important things to worry about.&quot; His eyes wandered back into the silvery glow of the water. When suddenly a bright flash flickered in the distance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trouble on the Sister Isle Cap'!&quot; shouted a man from the Crows nest up above. Telescope in hand he gazed through it to the direction where the flash came. The deck was now alive with crewmen gathering and adjusting masts and pulling ropes. &quot;Land Hooooooooooo!&quot; shouted the man. <br />
<br />
In an instant the passengers from below deck sprung to life and gathered at the railing where Relik and Nasu stood. Many rubbed sleep from their eyes as they gazed at what lay in the distance. There were a few more flashes then all was quiet. The group looked at one another nervously. <br />
<br />
“What could this mean?” Nasu wondered to herself. She was sure it would be nothing good. She closed her eyes and murmured a prayer that her friends, the Sisters of Erollisi would be safe. There would be no way to know until they docked at the island. <br />
<br />
As Nasu liked out over the water, she suddenly felt very helpless and lonely. She had been trained to be self-sufficient, to rely on no one but herself and be ready to come to the aid of those in need. She loved her calling, but tonight, facing a danger greater than she ever thought possible, she had a sudden longing for the type of close companionship that had always been denied her before. <br />
<br />
She glanced over at Relik. She was feeling a growing attraction to the warrior and from the way he looked at her when he thought she did not see, she could tell he was aware of the developing bond between them as well. She could read the signs on his face as easily as she could the ones on the trail when she was tracking. As she studied his profile, he turned and met her gaze. As she looked into his eyes, she felt her pulse quicken. She saw the same hope and wonder that she was feeling mirrored there as well. For one long moment, the rest of the world and all its trouble faded away, leaving just the two of them standing together in the moonlight. <br />
<br />
The moment ended abruptly when they heard a faint cry for help coming from the water below.</div>
