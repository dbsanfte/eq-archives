<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wilerili</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This guy was at VL ledge the other day when SCHW dropped, claimed need and though the group said no roll to all, he didn't roll the item. A few minutes later he was gone from the group and on to buy some &quot;uber&quot; Tae Ew(something or other) maul. He likes to hang around Narandi's corpse during guild wars that he is not associated with, and likes to hang at VL, wanting to join groups at spots that are higher than his level. Miikke is a monk that doesn't FD, not only is he a loot whore and ninja, he can't understand the fact that a cleric's mana is not all just to be used on him, and I'm posting this from a cleric's point of view, which I was playing at the time. I say avoid at all costs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Deadscale Dreadcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, I remember Miikke from Lower Guk.  We had a full group going at the Frenzy camp and well he wanted in the group.  After saying the group was full he would continue to hang around hoping someone would leave so he could join. He was lvl 35 I believe at that time, what considerable damage could he do to the dar ghoul mobs if he could even hit them (which of course have a ton of hp).  The cleric's mana never concerned him as well.  His nagging got to me eventually and I took clear pleasure seeing him die when he was allowed in group:D <br />
