Bravo, m'lady :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, I was on one of those hitler raids...it was fun! Too bad I caught the tail end of the 3 day raid, so saw no purple drops :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jexielia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hitler has nothing on me...<br />
<br />
FYI, added some more, going to post a few more chapters by the weekend Im sure, Im kinda stumped as to how to write the two perspective tale without too many flaws but so far so good... any feedback is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I hope it continues! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jexielia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thanks guys :) <br />
<br />
Makes it a little tougher when I know so many people have been reading it, I get a lot of tells and I appreciate all the support that I've gotten.<br />
<br />
I guess you can say Im a lot more shy than I'd like anyone to know and its given me a bit of writers block :( <br />
<br />
However... I will write more, lots probably, Im just struggling right now with where to take the story next.  I've got a few ideas I just need to pick one and roll with it :P<br />
<br />
But seriously, thank you, I was really hesitant on posting it here but Im pretty glad I did.</div></div><hr />

&lt;-----looking forward to next chapter. <br />
<br />
Take your time, with your talent I seriously doubt you can do any wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sashia Soulslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We have been fortunate to be able to read this story from the beginning.  I can't tell you how gald I am that Syldra is sharring this with everyone.  I think she has an amazing talent.  It's the best EQ story I have every read.  I'm not just saying that because it happens to have a sexy DE warrior named Sashia in it.  <br />
<br />
I read this story at work.  It makes me laugh out loud &amp; my co-workers glare at me.  Syldra has a great talent to nail down player's quirks and likenesses.  She describes landscapes and places to perfection.  You can really see the story in your head.  Anyways, we're awefully proud of Syldra.  <br />
<br />
Syldra - Can't thank you enough for writing this &amp; sharing it with everyone!</div></div><hr />
