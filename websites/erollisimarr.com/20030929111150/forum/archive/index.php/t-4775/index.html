<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drunkard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the lowest level of Befallen, a barbarian warrior, bloody and torn was chained to the wall. The sorceress opened new wounds, physically and mentally, and made the burn and fester. Blood mixed with the tears of his pain and suffering, Finnbarr went limp. Suddenly, the sorceress began a long spell. Her hands turned into what appeared to be liquid fire and this she threw at the dead body which was wrapped in flames and began to burn.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what happens to those who threaten my family!&quot;, cried the dark elven sorceress.<br />
<br />
&quot;AaaARhrrgghghghhaARrrrhgggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!&quot;<br />
The head under the flames rose, and  they died away, leaving...a dark elf in place of the barbarian...<br />
<br />
&quot;Six hammers! What in Halas's name has happened to me! I'm a bloody inkie!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside he was Finnbarr, but outside he was a dark elven necromancer, revered by dark elven society, shunned by the light.<br />
<br />
He left, clothed in black. Shuddering ever so often, Finnbarr began a new life...after death.</div></div><hr />
