<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogmuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please follow these rules or your post will be deleted, continue breaking the rules and you will get banned from the Erollisi Marr message board:<br />
<br />
- This forum is meant for roleplay, and only roleplay. Non-RP posts will be deleted.<br />
- If you post out of character, OOC (e.g. to tell someone you liked the story) please mark it with OOC.<br />
- Please do not post violence or adult material in this forum. This is a public forum and thus kids are reading this too.<br />
- Do not flame or fight with someone OOC, those posts will be deleted.<br />
- 'Roleplaying' an asshole is not allowed. You are meant to roleplay and not be yourself :P<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a few moderators:<br />
- They'll delete threads and posts that should not belong here.<br />
- I hope they encourage roleplaying by posting stories themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're interested in being a moderator, please leave a post here or in the general forum. Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arikel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sweet, this rocks.  Thanks for setting this up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Benalan Windsong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's a role playing? :p  Sounds good bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zariel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oops...I hate it when I double post.  Many apologies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zariel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey, all,<br />
     I think this is a great idea!  I hope it will encourage roleplay, maybe even interest a few people who want to RP but don't exactly know how to go about it.  With any luck, it will make Erollisi Marr a more connected community.<br />
     Anyway, you asked for a couple other volunteers to moderate.  I've been more of a lurker on this board than anything, but I'd be glad to help out.  I'm a moderator for the Fist of the Five Winds message board, and I created and maintain our site.  &lt;www.geocities.com/fistofthefivewinds&gt;<br />
    I post a lot of RP stuff to our board, and I've been known to pester the KHS board as this character and one other.  So if you still need another moderator, please let me know.  Thanks for setting this up!<br />
          Love,<br />
          Sister Zariel Callistrae<br />
          Ambassador, Fist of the Five Winds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ogmuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you Zariel! You are moderator too :)</div></div><hr />

I want to thank you for setting this up friend.  I think not only will this give a lot of us roleplayers a centralized place to share stories (instead on guildboards), but at the same time it gives the rest of the people on Norrath a taste of what we do outside of camp/leveling.  It is always fun reading stories, and I am sure this will be relaxing entertainment for everyone that reads the board, and doesn't want to read the daily flames =)<br />
<br />
Thank you once again, this is ane excellent idea and it will flourish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mistress Ezra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OOC just a note to anyone who feels intimidated by the possiblility that their post might get deleted just because a moderator was in a foul mood.  The moderators, the ones listed are all solid RPers.  Ogmuk Rarely deletes post even when it is very negative about his own guild.  It is not likely any of these people will delete any post that they feel follow the rules of the forum, not becuase of their personal oppinion of the story or person who posted it.  <br />
<br />
This forum will NEED several moderators.  I logged into this forum yesterday morning and found 1 post.  I posted a story at that time.  I log back in and find after 1 day 35 posts.  RP texts are wonderful, but also lengthy.  No way one person can keep on top of EVERY story posted here to be sure they are not to graphic. i am tickled by this forum and think it is a great idea to have.  and judging by the number of responces in the last 28 hours... so are many of you.<br />
 <br />
/em has to do some editing before she can post any of her other stories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ogmuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thank you Solstaar and Mistress Ezra! :)<br />
<br />
Yes, Ezra made very good points. I don't feel the need to repeat her, I'll quote her instead :)<br />
<br />

Let's try to keep it fun for everyone :) If there are more people who want to become Moderator please leave a post. I cannot promise that you _can_ be moderator, but I appreciate all replies :)<br />
<br />
Thank you all for the very appreciated feedbacks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Solstaar Darkfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Being on the &quot;evilish&quot; end of the RP spectrum (not saying you arent evil Ezra.../em shivers at the thought of messing with Ezra)....I am interested in also becoming a moderator if that is possible.  I have been roleplaying as this character and an_evil_druid00 since June of last year, and still prioritize roleplaying above all else.<br />
<br />
/em looks around for Mistress Ezra<br />
Mistress Ezra begins to cast a spell<br />
/em has been struck down by Wrath!<br />
/em has been slain by Mistress Ezra!<br />

I'm _currently_ not looking for more moderators, thanks everyone for their input :)</div></div><hr />
