<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zurla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, i am naeas's brother. I was not on his character. I do not know his password. I would never use his warrior anyway. I called him as soon as I read that post and he said he &quot;thought&quot; it was me. I am very pissed of at him for doing this to my chars name. I have NEVER ninja looted anything in my life. I have even at times been quite when i am getting screwed a new one. Anyone who has grouped or done anything in game with me knows that I am fair and i never take more than i give. I hope this new guild helps him out and he finds out what its really like to PLAY EQ. Thanks for your time.<br />

<br />
In my opinion, Naeas looted the items and then though better of it, after he was called on it.<br />
<br />
I was not there at the time, but the evidence would seem to point in this direction.<br />
