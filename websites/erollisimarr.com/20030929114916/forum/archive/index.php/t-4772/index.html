<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nallae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a series of stories I wrote in a RP theme for character advancement but I think you may enjoy reading them as they explore the earliest days of E marr and the people I met back then.<br />
<br />
Nall<br />
<br />
<br />
Nallae was born in Neriak Commons. Her mother was a poor enchantress, one of the scorned in Neriak society, her father she never knew. Her mother would not speak of him and only refered to him as The<br />
Shadowknight. <br />
<br />
She and her mother lived in a tenement in the commons, they barely scratched out a living making small pieces of jewelry which her mother enchanted and sold to adventurers leaving the city. Nallae would look upon these men and women with awe, their bright swords and polished armor gleaming in the light of the torches in<br />
small shop her mother ran. <br />
<br />
One day when Nallae was about 8 her world fell apart, a man came into the  shop. She<br />
recognized him as one of her mothers friends who would often go with her to  Lavastorm to gather gems. His name was Ravenheart, a veteran warrior, once a member of the kings guard before he had been badly wounded in a battle with a human paladin. <br />
<br />
He looked down at the small girl behind the counter and said “I have bad  news little one, your mother...” <br />
<br />
Nallae’s eye’s looked down to a backpack in his hand, her mothers backpack, she noticed the dark red stains covering it, the drips of red blood leaving a tiny trail behind the grizzled warrior. <br />
<br />
Nallae stood there stock still, staring at the blood, Ravenheart frowned and looked away. <br />
“there was nothing I could do, three fire elementals came over the ridge and  attacked  us, we tried to run into Nejena to find shelter, but your mother...did..not.......I am sorry little one” <br />
<br />
He tossed the backpack onto a nearby table and turned to go “I brought back anything of value she had and buried her under a cairn of rock just outside of Nejena, in case you ever want to visit her” With that he left closing the door of the shop behind him <br />
<br />
Nallae still stood, staring at the backpack the on the table the blood slowly pooling and dripping on the floor. <br />
<br />
The money was soon gone and once the landlord realized no more rent would be coming kicked the young girl out into the sreets of Neriak. Nallae soon fell into a bad crowd that fequented the foreign quarter of the city. She soon found herself  working as a child prostitute selling herself to the returning Adventurers looking for a<br />
good time after many day’s exploring the depth’s of Norrath’s dungeons. She did very well in the<br />
trade and made a decent living. She grew tall and stong, maturing into a winsome young woman. <br />
<br />
(dont look for Ravenheart on E marr he was a nice person on Fennin Ro who took a total newbie by the hand and spend hours showing her around Neriak, I would have spent days lost in there if it wasn't for him :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nallae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nallae seemed destined to live out her life as a prostitute in Neriak’s brothel’s until the day of the gathering. The Church of Innoruuk performed this gathering once a year, moving through the poorest sections of Neriak they would sweep the streets of the urchins and beggars who gather there. Nallae had been able to avoid these sweeps in the past, her young strong body easily able to outdistance the Church Guards who did the gathering, but this time she had been trapped in a blind alley and was not able to escape. <br />
<br />
The young and strong amongst those gathered were impressed into being  servants for the church, the weak and sick were used as Sacrifices to Innoruuk. <br />
<br />
Nallae was placed in the kitchens of the Church guild hall in Neriak 3rd Gate,  but soon  her other talents were discovered by the old men of the church and she was warming the beds of many of the High Priest’s of the order. The old men saw in her a quick intelligent girl and made it a project of there’s to tutor her. She did not let an<br />
opportunity pass and soon was able to read and write, she learned the basics of spell casting from them and she was also allowed to spar with the guild combat instructor. <br />
<br />
The old men were impressed with Nallae’s advancement and about a year later came to her and told her they would sponsor her to become a Freewoman of the church, a full cleric of Innoruuk. <br />
<br />
After the ceremony that made Nallae a freewoman, she called all the old men  who had  aided her in gaining her freedom to her room. She smiled as each entered and handed them a glass of wine.<br />
<br />
“So, Nallae what is the first thing your going to do now that your free?” one of then asked. <br />
<br />
Nallae beamed a wicked smile and made a toast “I’m going to kill all the men who abused me growing up” she said. The old men looked in shock at Nallae, then the effect of the poison wine grabbed their throats. Nallae's<br />
laughter was the last thing they heard as they died at her feet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nallae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Standing in the entrance to Neriak Nallae was awed, the bustle of adventurers coming and going, the shouts ringing through the forest filled her with wonder. This is what the outside world looked like she thought, it was her first time outside of the city. <br />
<br />
She looked down at the old wooden club and tattered tunic she had been given by the church guild, hefting it the felt the weight and balance in her hand. she had been told to look for snakes and decaying skeletons, as they would present easy prey for her. As she wandering away from the entrance to town the forest grew quieter,<br />
except for the occasional shout she may well have been the only person in the forest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Off to the left she spied movement in the grass, Aha! a snake! Quickly she ran over and brought her club down on the beast, and missed, the snake hissed angrily at her and struck back, nallae felt it’s bite right through the pitiful tunic, it Hurt! Desperately she swung again and again raining blows down on the snake till it lay dead.<br />
panting from the exertion and thrill of getting her first kill, Nallae bent down to inspect the corpse finding only a few small fangs worth recovering but it was her first kill and she was proud of it. <br />
<br />
There was no stopping her now, and Nallae quickly grew more skilled in the use of the club and staff and with the cash she received from the recovered parts of  the  beasts she slew, she was soon outfitted in a new set of Patchwork armour, and was wielding a cracked staff she had recovered off a skeletons corpse. <br />
<br />
A week or so later she was standing by the old pyramid she waited for a skeleton to appear, this spot  had a<br />
reputation as an area that the undead frequented, other adventures often  camped this spot but today she was the only one there. Glancing over to the pyramid she was shocked to see not a skeleton sitting there, but a much more powerful zombie. It was far too powerful for her to attack so she got up to leave and look for easier prey. In her ear she heard “Don’t leave, we can take it” she spun around to see a young necromancer there with<br />
her pet standing beside her. “Are you speaking to me” asked Nallae. The necromancer beamed a smile at Nallae and nodded her head. This was a most strange person Nallae thought, most necromancers were dour and brooding,  but this one appeared to take great joy in her craft and had a air of a happy rogue about her.<br />
<br />
The thing that Nallae noticed right away was the fact that she refused to wear her guild robes and was walking around the forest in her underclothes! <br />
<br />
“My names Wydow, what’s yours?” the upstart Necromancer inquired. “Nallae, Cleric of Innoruuk” replied Nallae. “Oh, don’t be stuffy with titles, out here we are wild adventurers, fighting the forces of good to bring them to their knees” Wydow punctuated her remarks with wild swings of her dagger. Nallae stepped back “Um, ok,<br />
wild adventurers if that’s what....” she was sure the necro was insane. <br />
<br />
“Do you need some money to buy a robe” She asked. Wydow spun around in a  piroete and said “What and cover up my beautiful taught body, just look at these abbs.” she pointed at her stomach with her dagger. Nallae was sure she was insane now. “Lets group and take down that nasty zombie” before Nallae could run, Wydow<br />
began casting a spell. Oh well she thought it was a short life as an adventurer and began casting one herself. <br />
<br />
After a tough fight with the zombie the creature was destroyed and the two  Teir’Dal women sat down in the grass exhausted from the fight. “Now wasn’t that fun”  Wydow exclaimed with a big smile while wiping off the gore from the zombie. Nallae fell over backwards and just lay in the grass panting “Y-y-y-ess...funnnn.....” <br />
<br />
From that day forth the two women were inseparable and the best of friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nallae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nallae looked at the bridge with a mix of fear and wonder. Tall Teir’Dal guards were posted on all four corners “Wh-What’s on the other side?” she asked the guard. A passing Shadowknight stopped “The guards<br />
never speak while on duty my dark lady” he said with a dour grimace.<br />
<br />
Nallae looked upon the knight, he was obviously a man of great  experience and wealth, he was even wearing the new banded armor everyone was talking about. Nallae’s eye’s widened at the sight of the fine suit of armor “Where did you get your armor from” she asked. the  young knight stood up straight and looked proud “I made it myself” he boasted “I am studying to be a smith in my spare time”<br />
<br />
“Do you know what lies on the other side of the bridge?” she asked him.<br />
<br />
“Yes my lady, the path leads to the East commons” he replied Nallae looked in horror at the path “E-e-east <br />
C-c-c-commons” she quaked “I-is that not where the human’s come from”<br />
<br />
“Aye” said the man looking worldly “their town of Freeport is nearby”<br />
<br />
Nallae swallowed and said “Take me there”<br />
<br />
The knight for the first time looked a little nervous “Very well M’lady, follow  me, and stay on the path, dont wander off” he drew his sword and marched off across the bridge.<br />
<br />
They soon reached a narrow pass “it is through here, shade your eye’s”  She followed him into the pass.<br />
<br />
A short time later they emerged on the other side, now she knew why he had warned her,<br />
it was so bright! the sky was a strange blue! and a huge ball of fire was in the sky!<br />
<br />
Nallae fell to her knee’s sure the world was coming to an end. The shadowknight looked at her with understanding but she also heard the twitter of laughter.<br />
<br />
“Another little Teir’dal making her first journey to east commons?” she heard a voice say.<br />
<br />
The Shadowknight spun around his sword at the ready. what stood there stunned Nallae It looked like a Tier’Dal, but was a ghastly pale colour. “Are you sick?” blurted Nallae<br />
<br />
&quot;Me” the elf laughed again “No silly one. I am a wood elf” <br />
<br />
“Do not mock her lesser one” the Shadowknight hissed waving his sword.<br />
<br />
“Oh put up your weapon dark one, I’m not going to fight you” she giggled<br />
<br />
“are you a cleric? Nallae asked “I see you carry a staff”<br />
<br />
The wood elf laughed again “No little one, I am a Druid”<br />
<br />
Nallae’s brow furrowed “a druid? what is a druid?<br />
<br />
The young Druid laughed again and began to cast a spell....and changed into a wolf!<br />
Nallae was amazed, but the shadowknight put his hand on her shoulder and said “come away from her, she is not our kind”<br />
<br />
At the touch Nallae knew this was true, she could feel the hatred boiling just under her surface, it was mute but it was there and for a reason she could not understand the hatred was aimed at the wood elf. She had never met her before, a wood elf had never hurt her, why was she suddenly feeling this buiding of rage and<br />
hate in her heart towards this Druid. <br />
<br />
She frowned at the druid “begone foul creature” she spat. <br />
<br />
The druid, now returned to her wood elf form frowned too, looking serious for the first time “Do not cross me little one” she said “for Fyyre does not forget her friends or her enemies”<br />
<br />
Nallae and the Shadowknight turned and walked back into the cool shade of Nektulos forest, they walked back down the path to the bridge. <br />
<br />
Standing there the Knight turned and said “Goodbye dark sister, I must take my leave, good hunting to you”<br />
<br />
“Wait” cried Nallae “will I ever see you again, I don’t even know your name”<br />
<br />
The Shadowknight stopped and slowly turned back toward Nallae “You will know my name soon as will every Teir’Dal I will command vast armies and wield supreme power in Neriak” He shook his fist’s at the heavens, as if to challenge the gods themselves. <br />
<br />
He glanced over at Nallae and she saw a small smile break his face “But until then, just ask for Maugrim and I will be at your service M’Lady” he said with a deep bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nallae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Origins 5 One day in North Ro <br />
<br />
A gaggle of young Teir'Dal women sat on the crest of the dune, down below was the object of their attention, a tall handsome Dark Elf by the name of Dorn d'Bynn. Nallae sat there too watching the antics below &quot;Oh look, here comes another high elf, and he's getting close...&quot; she whispered. <br />
<br />
Dorn pretended not to notice all the dark skinned girls sitting there on the dune and instead stood around chatting with the Dervish Cutthroats he shared his camp with. <br />
Sure enough the foolish High Elf wandered to close. Dorn uttered a threat and charged the hapless elf and started to pummel him with his bare fists. The elf ran up the hill trying to escape the beating, but he didn't get far as Dorn easily slew him just feet past the girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;He winked at me&quot; Wydow squealed as Dorn strolled past them on his way back down  to his camp. <br />
&quot;What a hunk&quot; Justicia sighed. <br />
Zhenya jumped to her feet and said &quot;Watch this, I'll get his attention&quot; the  young rogue raced down the hill to the camp, she ran around the back of the tent and ran up the support pole, reaching the top she did a flying leap into the air, performed several somersaults and landed on her feet then ran around the back of the other tent and<br />
repeated the feat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Show off&quot; Nallae muttered. &quot;I could do that if I wasn't wearing 50 lbs of banded armor&quot; <br />
<br />
Wydow snorted &quot;Sure sis and you'd end up doing a face plant right in front of Dorn&quot; <br />
<br />
Zhenya came trotting back up to the top of the dune, barely panting from her exertion<br />
&quot;He said he would marry me when I got old enough&quot; She swooned. <br />
<br />
Justicia laughed out loud &quot;Dorn marry a rogue? I think he has better taste&quot; <br />
<br />
Zhenya spun on the cleric and spat &quot;At least I don't fraternize with lesser races, really Justicia, sometime I think you forget you're a Teir'Dal&quot; <br />
<br />
The two women glowered at each other, hoisting their weapons ready to fight when they were distracted by a hail. The women turned to see who was calling  them and  were amazed to see Elisio and her brother trot up to them. What caused them to drop  their jaws was that the two of them were clad in shining bronze armor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get that armor&quot; Nallae asked in amazement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lake Rathe&quot; Elisio replied tuning around to show off the gleaming armor &quot;There is a camp where dry bone skeletons frequent, the skeletons hoard this armor for some  reason&quot; <br />
<br />
The four women were shocked again &quot;Lake Rathe..&quot; Wydow said in  amazement &quot;I  have seen it on maps, it is clear across the continent&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aye&quot; said Elisio &quot;My brother and I joined a troop of wanderers and found our  way  there, we have not been back to Neriak for weeks, and look at this shield&quot; she pulled the shield from her pack and showed it to them &quot;It is the Shield of a Guard of Qeynos&quot; <br />
<br />
Nallae turned to Wydow and said in wonder &quot;This world is full of amazing things, I wonder what they will find next&quot; <br />
<br />
Zhenya interupted the women and pointed down to the camp &quot;Look, there's a half elf and he's getting too close again&quot; She whispered with an evil grin as the group turned to watch the show...</div></div><hr />

<br />
loved the story!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nallae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Origins 6 Coming of the Storm<br />
<br />
Nallae was in Inothule swamp when she heard the cries, someone was in trouble deep in the swamp, she started toward the cries for help but stopped up short when she heard the laughter of a Troll coming from the same local. <br />
<br />
The cries were moving towards Grobb, city of the trolls. Nallae followed them  out of  curiosity about what was happening. By the tone and sound of the whimpers the troll had captured a wood elf female. <br />
<br />
Suddenly she heard a sound behind her that struck terror into her heart. “The Storm is Coming” The terrible Knight’s of the Holy Storm were in the swamp, these  beasts had  a reputation of slaughtering poor Teir’Dal and Trolls on sight, putting them to the sword just because they were different. <br />
<br />
Nallae felt a surge of hatred towards these cutthroat Feir’Dal and human paladins.<br />
Killers of babies and children. She had to fight down an urge to charge them and fight, but she knew if she did would be a feutile death for by the sound of the thrashing and cries coming from their direction there must be at least a dozen of them. Instead she turned and fled for the safety of Grobb. <br />
<br />
As she reached the entrance of the city she spied a huge Troll Shaman dragging a small wood elf female behind him, she was constantly falling in the muck but the troll did not slow down he just continued to drag her behind him. <br />
<br />
Nallae followed them into the city, relieved to be in the relative safety of the troll city,  knowing the guards would prevent any of the Storm from entering. She sat down on a rock panting from the exertion of the run. <br />
<br />
While sitting there she again heard the whimpers and cries for aid, they were coming from a building just down the alley from where she sat. Some force seemed to pull Nallae and she entered the dimly lit building, following the cries she came upon a pit of horror, there across the room was the Wood elf, chained to a slab of rock, the huge troll laughing and giggling to himself as her stoked up a brazier in the corner of the room. <br />
<br />
The wood elf thrashed on the slab but her iron shackles would not allow her to be free. <br />
<br />
Nallae felt horrible confusion in her soul, she felt a wave of hatred towards this elf, for she wore the badge of a member of the Holy Storm, but at the same time she felt other emotions, this was a female in trouble and Nallae felt an urge to save her from the Troll. <br />
<br />
The Elf suddenly stopped thrashing as she spotted Nallae standing in the doorway, She said nothing but their eye’s locked the look of pain, anguish and terror almost overwhelmed Nallae. She took a step forward but the Troll spotted her too “Ahh, little Dark Elf, come to watch the show?” he drooled as he hoisted a  red hot poker <br />
<br />
Nallae shook her head “No, why are you doing this to her” <br />
<br />
The troll grinned and said “Because Maugrim told me too” with that he applied the poker to the elf’s bare skin. Nallae covered her ear’s and turned away, but the screams bore through her skull like nails. She turned back to see the poor wood elf withering, horrible blisters forming on her skin. <br />
<br />
The huge troll shook his head “Oh ya, Maugrim said no permanent scars” He waved his  hands and cast a healing spell, the burns disappeared “lucky there is no spell to remove the memory of the pain” Grinning evilly he picked up another red hot poker.  “Let’s start again little one” The wood elf screamed again and looked pleadingly at Nallae. <br />
<br />
Nallae could take no more she turned and ran from the building She felt another wave of hate, but this time it was self directed, how could she be so weak, how could she allow that poor wood elf to be tortured in such an insidious manner and not try to stop it.<br />
<br />
This was a female in trouble and she had promised herself to be a defender of all females<br />
after she had endured a lifetime of abuse in Neriak. <br />
<br />
The screams of the elf followed her, she could not escape them, weeping she ran out of the city, the horror of what she had witnessed making her retch. As she emptied her stomach into the swamp she heard another sound, soft weeping coming from the other side of the small island she was on, creeping forward through<br />
the bushes she spied three members of the hated Storm. but these did not appear to be the terrible monsters everyone decried them as just small high elves and one was weeping openly while the other two tried to comfort him <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we will rescue your wife, you have Setis’s word on that” The crying elf looked up “I fear she will be lost to me forever, if Shoguk kills her I do not know if I can go on. It was my fault, I could not protect her” The elf barried his head in his hands and cried “Shaz, oh Shaz I love you so...”<br />
<br />
Nallae was shocked, this male had persued the troll all the way to the gates of Grobb to try to rescue a female? He wanted to try to protect her instead of just using her and discarding her? and what was this “love” he spoke of... Nallae sat for many hours watching this elf, she must study him, she must know more of this one the<br />
other’s called Eltherion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donnast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was me!  Actually might have led the rag tag group we had left out of there if I'd kept my big mouth shut too.<br />
<br />
At that given time there was me and about 4 other Knights left alive at the battle site.  The Shadow Guard had around 3 or 4 casters left alive that were using a geurilla tactic to REAL good use against us.<br />
<br />
Mlar shouts, something along these lines anyways, &quot;Your leader has fallen give up now and know the mercy of Innoruuk.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shout back, again something along the lines of, &quot;Come for me Dark Cleric and make it so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well at this point I had something like a bbl and a half of health big words and nothing but a empty mana bar and about 100 hp's to back them up with hehe.  I think that's one of the most memoriable moments of Donnast Morlanth's activities as Templar of the Flames of Justice.  Sure enough Mlar slew me but moments after the challenge.  What happened to the rest of them I'm not sure.<br />
