<br />
&quot;Enter&quot;<br />
<br />
The rogue entered the room,glancing fearfully at the bloodstained ceremonial robes that hung in the corner.Trembling slightly he spoke<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Priest, i have news for you&quot;<br />
<br />
The priest looked up from the reports he had been studying,focusing his cold hard eyes upon the rogue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my son,what is this news that is so important that you must disturb me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the calm friendly tone of the voice,the rogue could feel his heart pounding,fear rising within himself<br />
<br />
&quot;L.llord Priest...the the Knights of the Storm..have issued a call to arms for their battle with the brothers&quot;<br />
<br />
The Priest leans back in his chair contemplating the situation before beginning to write a note.<br />
<br />
      To all allies of the Knights,<br />
       Should you bother to intefere in matters which are of no concern to you,then it will be a matter to concern the Guard and you shall be eradicated from Norrath.<br />

The priest hands the note to the rogue,<br />
<br />
&quot; Make a few copies of this and have it posted to a few Paladins&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes Lord&quot; With and inaudible sigh of relief the rogue turns to leave..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mistress Ezra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ezra sipped at the fine red wine.  She was ever cautious of the eyes on her from around the table and never took a sip unless someone was watching.  She drank tiny amounts, more concerned with the way she displayed the “kissing” of the glass than the flavor of the wine.  (Though she did think it was an excellent choice)  With this particular drink, she seemed to have finally snared Edwrin Obsidian’s focus causing him to stumble slightly over his words. <br />
<br />
“Well Dark Lord.” Ezra finally said, putting the glass back on the table at the exact 1 O’clock position it was supposed to be presented.  Aware that a serving man was close enough to see, she placed her fork and knife side by side diagonally across the plate signifying that she was finished and the servant should remove the plate.  This had been second nature to her as she had grown up as a member of the Noble class in Neriak.  Though she knew not all people were so well trained in proper etiquette it annoyed her when the servant hadn’t bothered to remove the plate and chose to instead ogle her.  She broke custom and shot the servant a wicked look.  He didn’t notice.  <br />
<br />
However, Sarkam did notice and whether he knew proper etiquette or not had at least figured out what Ezra had wanted.  Having given the servant a few seconds to respond, Sarkam stood from his seat and strode menacingly to the man.  In a swift, almost graceful motion, Sarkam removed the plate from before Ezra and simultaneously grabbed the offending servant by the collar, never breaking stride.  Once out side the dining room a muffled yelp came from the man as the sound of a porcelain plate shattered over his head.  From the sound of the commotion, Ezra suspected the powerful warrior had beaten the man within an inch of his life. <br />
<br />
Ezra smiled at Edwrin.  The dark bard, leader of the Brothers of Obsidian, was not attempting to hide his rage at the insult to his guest.  Edwrin picked up Ezra’s unspoken acceptance of the apology Sarkam had extended with his actions, and calmed himself slightly.  Ezra suspected that Sarkam left the servant alive for only one reason.  She wondered if Edwrin would like her to heal the man for him before she left. <br />
<br />
“Forgive me, Dark Angel, please, go on.” He said to her, regaining his bardic charm.  <br />
<br />
Ezra would not insult the man further by pretending the she had not been offended, she simply nodded, telling the man she had accepted the retribution as satisfactory compensation.  “I have told you that I am not so convinced about your god, Obsidian, and will continue to follow the ways of my people and my father, Innoruuk.  The Children of Darkness are about filling this world with the dark powers and dreams of the gods of the greater races,” Ezra paused, throwing a soft, innocent smile at Edwrin.  “I mean, the races of Trolls, Ogres and the Teir’Dal.  Your heart, dear Edwrin beats of the same desires as mine and we share a common enemy.  The Children of Darkness is proud to be the first to show our dedication to our alliance with you and support the Brothers completely.”<br />
<br />
Edwrin stood and bowed slightly to the Teir’Dal woman.  Then strode purposefully to where Ezra was sitting.  He offered his arm and she accepted it.  “Thank you Dark Angel.  Eltherion’s army is large and powerful.  He has many allies as well.  He has laid out a strong threat to bring his storm down upon all who oppose him.  Our way is true and I am certain of victory.  However, casualties will be numerous.”  He said as he led her down the hall to the ballroom for the evening’s entertainment. <br />
<br />
Ezra smiled warmly at Edwrin and snuggled closer to his body.  “Then I shall simply have to remember to keep my umbrella with me.”<br />
<br />
OOC incase anyone is following &quot;The Story of Katiana&quot; on my message board, this is the dinner Ezra was at in the more recent posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fyndolyn Faefyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*a lone figure, clad in shiny golden armor sits at a table in a darkened room, the flickering candlelight bouncing reflective golden motes of light about the room..*<br />
<br />
The priest of Tunare was currently putting quill to parchment.  The letter reads, the glow of the candlelight illuminating his script...<br />
<br />
Hail and well met again Holy Champion,<br />
<br />
The Mother of our Mothers has gifted me with the vision of your current struggle and She has foretold victory for the Righteous...that we must fight the endless battle against the tides of the evil, revolting sons and daughters.  She assures us that tis the way, as it shall be throughout our times.  <br />
Thusly, in this fight of yours and in doing Her will, I offer up my support and that of my brothers and sisters.  Call upon us should the need arise...<br />
<br />
The love of Tunare be with you, my brother.<br />
<br />
In Her name,<br />
Fyndolyn Faefyre<br />
Priest of Tunare<br />
Order of Ascension<br />
<br />
The priest stands and walks slowly to the window, looking out into the dusky evening sky.  A flash of energy erupts in the center of the room, brilliant colorful light.  It slowly dissipates into the tall form of a human male, dressed in flowing green robes.<br />
&quot;Greetings friend.&quot; spoke the wizard.  &quot;You sent for me?&quot; asked the dark haired, mustachioed caster with a smile.<br />
&quot;That I did, Stargazer...Seems the Prophecy is not the only matter we must find ourselves attending to these days.  Please gather up the parchment on the table and deliver it to Storm Hall with all haste.  See it makes it's way into the hands of the Holy Champion himself.&quot;<br />
&quot;Understood, friend.  I can be there quickly.  Be well.&quot; spoke the wizard, as he spoke mystic words of power to disappear in a flash, a crackle of ozone in the air.<br />
<br />
The priest sighed and looked back out the window, darkness now blanketed the land...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arikel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brother Aganerral Pardus aimed an inquiring look at his guildmaster.  &quot;What do you think, Brother?&quot;<br />
Arikel read the parchment his friend had brought to him and thought for a moment.  &quot;So, peace has been declared between the Knights and Obsidian.  As I suspected.  I've battled one of Obisdians' best several times, and won more often than lost.  The Storm have many fighters among them who are more skilled than I.  I think that this is a good thing.  Have they released the captive knight?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the older monk answered.  &quot;Radius is still in the hands of the Brothers.  He has not been returned, nor has Zenlathon been released by the Knights.&quot;<br />
Arikel's brow furrowed a little.  &quot;I see.  What to do, what to do...&quot; Aganerral frowned.  &quot;I know what you think of open conflict, Brother, &quot;Arikel said,&quot;and we are in agreement.&quot;  Arikel spread the parchement out across the plain wooden table between them.  &quot;Even so, I don't like the idea of Radius rotting in a cell somewhere.  He has been a good friend to many of our order, he deserves his freedom.  Gods know he has earned it.&quot;<br />
Arikel took a deep breath and continued.  &quot;You know, there are rumors among the young Teir'Dal of a new organization among their number.  I ran into a dark elf yesterday, who ranted about something called the Children of Darkness.  Does that name mean anything to you, Ag?&quot;<br />
&quot;I've heard the name, I think.  I don't spend as much time in Nektulos these days as I used to, really.  The trip to the mountains is quick if you know the best path.&quot;  Aganerral leaned back against the monastery's cold stone wall and crossed his arms.  &quot;You think they're something to worry about?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know.  One of the youngsters called her 'Mistress Ezra'.  I took it upon myself to interrupt his beetle hunting and ask a few questions.  I didn't get much, other than that the Children would crush all lightdwellers, together with Obsidian.  Strange, since most of the Brothers of Obisidan are human.  I didn't really know what to make of it.&quot;  The young guildmaster rubbed his temples with his fingertips.  <br />
&quot;What do you suggest we do, then?&quot; asked Aganerral.<br />
Arikel sighed.  &quot;I'm not suggesting we do anything, at least not right now.&quot;  He got up from his little wooden chair and started toward the door.  He paused for a moment and turned to Aganerral.  &quot;I guess I'm just presenting a question.  How far do we let things escalate before we take action?  And then, what is our best course?&quot;  He opened the door to walk out.  &quot;We need strength these days, Brother,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;Strength of arm, of course, but also the strength of restraint, to know when to act and when to let events unfold without our interference.  It is growing more and more difficult to tell which is needed most, and when.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keslear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On a quiet night Keslear was meditating at the pass to Kithicor forest when Keslear's reverie was broken by a clang of metal on stone.<br />
<br />
Eyes focusing and ears straining he picked out a gasp and groan from around a bend in the pass.  As Kes sat up he unsheathed his falchion and pulled his shield off his back and onto his arm.<br />
<br />
Rounding the bend caustiously he came upon a fallen human in full plate armour struggling valiantly to get up.<br />
<br />
At this point Kes moved with haste as he could see the man was in horrendous pain.  <br />
<br />
Upon hearing someone approach the man or should I say young man for he could be a lad of no more than 16 gritted his teeth and pushed himself erect drawing forth a bloody dagger and exclaiming &quot;You'll not get me without a fight vermin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing that the human could not see him in the night Keslear spoke in calming tones &quot;I am not here to harm you lad I am Keslear Raener and I will help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
It must have been to much for him for when he finally was able to focus on the wood elf his face lost all sign of tension and he stumbled three steps and pushed a ragged and bloody parchment into the druids hand saying &quot;I command you in the name of Karana to see this message delivered into the hands of Eltherion De'Lorme of the Knights of the Holy Storm!&quot;  before Keslear could state he knew whom Eltherion was, the Paladin for now close up Kes could see that is what he was collapsed against his shoulder and would have fell to the ground if Kes had not caught him.<br />
<br />
Lowering him to the ground Keslear saw an arrow protruding from the small of his back.<br />
<br />
Working quickly he broke off the tip of the arrow and removed his breast plate surveying the wound.<br />
<br />
Hissing softly when he saw the festering wound Keslear quickly called forth his most powerfull healing magic sending it streaming into the paladin.  Next he sent purifying magics cleansing the poisons and disease and invigorating him.<br />
<br />
Now that he was at least stable Keslear turned to other matter.  Like what could be so important that the boy was willing to die to get to Eltherion.<br />
<br />
Pulling out the letter and reading it Keslear began to understand.<br />
<br />
Strife was apparently gripping the land again and as usual the Knights of the Holy Storm appeared to be amidst it.<br />
<br />
Reading the letter again,<br />
 <br />
To all allies of the Knights,<br />
Should you bother to intefere in matters which are of no concern to you,then it will be a matter to concern the Guard and you shall be eradicated from Norrath.<br />
<br />
Mlar D'Kath<br />
Priest of Innoruuk<br />
Shadow Guard<br />
<br />
Apparently everyone was taking sides and a great battle would soon take place.  <br />
<br />
Picking up the young paladin with some effort Keslear Opened a mystical portal and stepped across the world into the Butcher Block mountains.  <br />
<br />
Heading to Storm Keep aided by his magics Keslear approached the gates in a short time.<br />
<br />
The guards wary with the news of war accousted Keslear at a distance &quot;Halt and state your buisness&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising his voice &quot;I have an injured warrior here that needs rest and care.  There is also a message for Eltherion De'Lorme&quot;<br />
<br />
A small side door opened and several knights approached cautiously.  <br />
<br />
Striding upto them he handed over the note and paladin and then turned to walk away.<br />
<br />
The leader of the guards said &quot;Good sir I think the Holy Champion would like to speak with you and thank you for saving this man and delivering this message&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking over the guards &quot;I am part of the Raenore I do not get involved with politics the message was meant to be delivered I just hastened it.....and about the boy well i do my part to help any in need I need no thanks from a Holy Champion&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuckling at the affronted expressions on the guards faces at that Keslear whispered a few short words and dissappeared......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Katiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Katiana had been running through the tunnel attending an errand when she heard the shouts.  She turned her head to see a large mass of people, obviously filled with discontent.  She recognized the bard, Edwrin, with which it was rumored Mistress had made an alliance.  He was talking with a tall and handsome high elf, who seemed to be the leader of the other faction.<br />
<br />
As Katiana assessed the situation things were becoming more violent as the high elf demanded the return of someone they obviously cared for and Edwrin held firm.  Not long ago Katiana would have been swept up in the zeal for righteousness.  Things had changed now, and ideology meant little to her.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted as she heard a crackling.  The first spells erupted and screams of pain followed.  Both sides fought valiantly, the sounds of clanking metal echoing through the tunnel.  Katiana knew her duty was simple.  She ran from the tunnel towards the darkness of Nektulos.  Her mistress must be notified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarantazsh D aerlar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">*The darkness surrounding the house D'aerlar slowly parted as the figure strode towards the house, dressed in ceremonial black robe with the silver encrested skull embroidered upon it*<br />
<br />
Tis better be important the figure mumbled to himself, he did not appreciate the fact the messenger had interrupted a ceremony to Innoruuk, nor that he had to drag the body of him out of the room since no slaves was allowed near it.<br />
<br />
*The figure dismissed the thoughts of this message beeing anything of the outmost importance, but as he entered the halls he quickly realised that he had made that asumption a tad to quickly... Everywhere armor was beeing polished, swords sharpened and the occasional slave beaten into a pulp for not being quick enough*<br />
<br />
MASTER AT ARMS!, the figure shouted tapping his foot impaitently. The Master at arms came running, fell to his knee and greated his Lord. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is tis all about&quot;, the figure asked sternly<br />
<br />
&quot;The Knights has declared war upon ye allies, The Brothers of Obsidian&quot;, the master at arms spoke<br />
<br />
&quot;Send a messenger to Lord Maugrim and High Priest Numdar, the council must conviene&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have allready done so M'lord, but Knight Commander Maugrim is not to be found, we have heard that High Priest Numdar is in the region of Innothule and a messenger left not more than 1/2 a day ago to deliver a summoning&quot;, the master at arms could not help smile a bit as he had foreseen the orders that his lord had given him, nor did the figure hide his smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then so be it, send a slave to Eltherion with tis message... Knights Of The Holy Storm. As Priest Mlar allready has stated to ye allies, The Guard shall strike down upon thoose aiding ye feeble creatures of light, beware for there shall be no further indication of our intentions, but thoose that shall be written in the blood we spill from ye allies. I offer ye this last chance, by the power invested in me by Innoruuk and Lord Maugrim, I shall accept ye capitulation no later than 3 sunsets from now. Signed High Sorceror of The Dead, Lord Tarantazsh D'aerlar.<br />
<br />
*The Figure giggled as he wrote the limit for the capitulation, &quot;Who knows the might realise their gods feeble powers and bow to Innoruuk&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Master at arms, send words to the troops, tonight we march for Feltwhite&quot;<br />
<br />
The master at arms looked suprised &quot;But M'Lord should we not be on the field of battle aiding our allies&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but we will, after we have send the message of our superiorty, by torching the gates of Feltwhite&quot;<br />
<br />
*The figure strode to his chambers thinking.. The Brothers of Obsidian better show their worth, or else we shall be running to defend our gates*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eltherion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eltherion Reads the message.. <br />
<br />
Although the war with the brothers have ended in a stalemate neither side releasing the prisoner and innoncent being wounded I will not stand down if the guard wish to invade my home land.. Many times we have rushed into the city of the Tier'dal and we will again if we have to , but this time I venture to my home.. If the guard want to get into a shoving match, I will give them the chance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mistress Ezra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The mystic portal was open and Ezra could see Edwrin Obsidian on the other side, just as he could see her.  Asreell stood beside Edwrin so she knew this was no small proposal.  <br />
<br />
Ezra lounged on a comfortable basin where an array of pets knelt beside her bathing her naked body and massaging in the scented oils of her choice.  &quot;So you... are going to give him to us?&quot;  Ezra said as she took the leash of her newest pet, Katiana, and positioned her body more to Ezra's liking.  Katiana thanked Ezra and continued in her work.  <br />
<br />
Ezra's mind raced now.  If she took the captive off the hands of the Brothers of Obsidian, it would certainly speed up her plans.  She would not have to organize her own raid, and... &quot;A most generous offer, luv.&quot; she said.  She wondered why Edwrin was willing to abandon this course of action.  She knew Edwrin had long ago accomplished his primary goals and was simply playing and holding his cards.  Perhaps he had simply grown bored of the chess match with the noble Eltherion.  Perhaps he was passing a trump card to her freeing himself up to peruse another path.  Perhaps it was a trap.  <br />
<br />
She doubted Edwrin was looking to trap her just yet, it was much too early in the game, their enemies too strong yet for the alliance to begin their jockeying for final control.  However, she could not rule out the possibility. <br />
<br />
&quot;Edwrin, i thank you for your offer, but i must decline at this time.&quot; Ezra said with a nod to one of her slaves who bowed and moved behind Ezra, allowing a less obstructed view of her body.  &quot;I would like to organize our own raid, exercise the troops, so to speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwrin bowed and the portal was closed.  She hoped she hadn't disappointed the dark bard too much, she did so enjoy his conversations.  But this was definitely right.  Ezra preferred the more subtle approach, despite Nastur and the others virtually begging for some one to kill.  It was not yet time to fully reveal themselves, not yet time to come out of the shadows and draw unwanted attention to Ezra's delicate and sophisticated plans.  <br />
<br />
That damn monk, Chide she believed her name was, had already drawn unwanted attention to Arikel when she attempted to poison Under, Caprice and Cindal in the Oasis.  The Children of Darkness could not stand by and let this happen.  Retaliation was required.  This would force Ezra to play her had out a bit sooner than anticipated.  It was a tempting offer Edwrin had made.  But had chance not conspired against her, she would have taken his offer.  She could afford to push the plan a little but not after that damn monk had already forced her to play her hand.  <br />
<br />
Ezra growled and grabbed the closest slave to her hand by the hair and yanked her head to a position with which she could deliver a powerful strike to the slave girl’s face.  The girl fell to the ground, a dark bruise forming rapidly.  The girl was panic stricken and scurried into a kneeling position.  <br />
<br />
&quot;i am sorry Mistress did i press too hard while i massaged You?&quot; the girl said, fear in her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;No My pet, you were doing wonderfully, you may continue.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank You Mistress, thank You.&quot; the girl responded and hurried back to her work rubbing in the rich oils.  <br />
<br />
Ezra lay back and closed her eyes.  She rolled her plans around in her head working out every conceivable angle.  She smiled knowing the Children of Darkness could not fail.  And it would all begin this weekend with those foolish Children of Erollisi.<br />
<br />
/ooc how fun it is when this really was what was happeneing when i received Edwrin's tells.  hehe.  So i just had to post this.</div></div><hr />
