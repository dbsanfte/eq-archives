<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solstaar Darkfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Solstaar stormed into hall of the Indigo Brotherhood, barging into the war room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?!&quot; the magician scowled as he slammed a pile of parchment onto the table.  &quot;Why wasn't the Guard, or Lord Serpentous for that matter, contacted about this development?&quot;<br />
<br />
The high members of the Brotherhood stared blankly at the dark magician's face.  After a moment of silence, they stumbled for some words.<br />
<br />
Dragoon Punox replied, &quot;We...we had thought that Lord Maugrim, or Lord Tarantazsh had already been approached about...about this....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blasphemy!&quot;  Solstaar threw his mystical Broom of Trilon into the wall of the war room, knocking over several documents pinned up.<br />
<br />
The five Dragoons didn't dare speak back to the magician.<br />
<br />
Solstaar grabbed a chair he had unknowningly knocked over, and took a seat.  His hot temper drifted away as he rested for a few minutes, then he began to speak again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew of this Iksar, and this lost continent for a while now.....but did not know of this Firiona Vie.  So, the lizardmen have succeeded in a task we have been attempting for so long?  Princess of Felwithe, now within their hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solstaar breathed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know better then to speak down upon your ranks, as the King and Queen would have my head for it.  However, I would expect you would know better then to keep the Guard out of the Dark.&quot;  Solstaar reached for the papers he dropped earlier, and flipped through them one-by-one.  &quot;The Danak Shipyard, and appointed front-man Ventril Sathir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solstaar stood up and began to pace.  &quot;Do you know of this Sathir?  Is he to be trusted?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the Dragoon's stood up and stuttered, &quot;He was appointed by the King and Queen, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
The magician turned toward him.  &quot;Then I would like to catch the next ship to Kunark, Dragoon.  I will travel there with High Priest Numdar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
As the magician reached the Oasis of Marr, he found himself greeted by High Priest Numdar Ra`malza, Ambassasdor of Oggok Horgo Splendis, and High Shaman Umbrac Brainbiter.<br />
<br />
A magically bound shuttle of sorts arrived at the dock, with no shipmate.  The Guard gathered onto the vessel as it began on its magical journey to an island in the Timourous Deep.  The 4 were greeted by raiders of Oggok whom have been living there for quite some time.  When asked about the lizardmen by Solstaar, they shook their head.  Only behind them, did the Guard see the slain bodies of three-halfbreeds, a human, and a dwarf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, I imagine this has provided some good food over the past few weeks?....&quot;<br />
<br />
One whom calls herself an &quot;Ogre Wise One,&quot; nodded and laughed boisterously.  Horgo did not waste any time in collecting some meat for his own hunger.<br />
<br />
Soon, a large ship that seemed to be a fix-up approached the docks.  The Guard boarded the ship, and nodded at the shipmates.<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
After a full day of travel, the ship finally approached land.  What Solstaar saw was a massive wall, buildings standing, and countless clockworks being tuned and built by gnomish slave tinkerers.  The four exited the ship and made their presence be known.<br />
