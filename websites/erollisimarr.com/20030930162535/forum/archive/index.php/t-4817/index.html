<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aCDemise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A young dark elf peered into the darkness around him... he rubbed his head and groand.<br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot; He said to the darkness. He slowly Stood up and winced at each movement his body was sore.<br />
He slowly scanned the darkness letting his vision slowly slip Ultra Vision. He looked down examining himself for further injury. He was wearing torn rags of cloth. He stood straight and shook his head to clear the last few spots from his eyes. He looked around the strange cave. He had never been here before... or maybe he had... he shook his head and searched his mind for who he was and what he was doing in this strange place. He Grunted and began limpy slowly down a tunnel.. One direction seemed as good as another he thought. As he walked he noticed a slight incline in the tunnel the stuffy air was becoming cooler and more open. He slowly turned each bend in the long tunnel praying to see something besides the dull gray of the rocks. He suddenly found himself looking at darkness.. but not the stuffy pitch black of the tunnels.. it was a much lighter darkness for the young Drow was staring out of a cave  into the night lit by the stars... a night of the surface world. &quot;Where am I?&quot; He said again but, this time it was awe inspired. He stumbled out of the cave and onto a rocky path. He groaned loudly as a rock jabbed into his bruised leg. He stood up and shook it off. He began to walk under the trees  keeping the wall to his left. He walked into a large crevice. A heavily armed Drow approched him. &quot;Who are you?&quot; The Guard picked his sword up in  a threat. The boy stuttered &quot;I.. I... D..ddd..on't know who I am...&quot; The Guard looked confused. &quot;Stay here boy I shall be right back...&quot; The guard promptly turned around and looked for a Dragoon he had no idea what to do hopefully the higher ranking officer did. <br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
                         The drow watched the guard disappear into the night. He had no intention of staying around he decided to take his chances alone. He ran down the crevice through the canyon as fast as his feat would carry him. He turned a sharp corner and tripped over a rock. He was in luck though for the fall had saved him from a trip into the lava that was mearly inches from his face. The boy stood up and surveyed the area before him. It was a bright place the heat was intense lava surrounded him with thin walkways through the lava pulls prodvided his only way across. The drow was curious as he walked across the paths. He looked around and noted other people around him fighting strange creatures. He decided to stay hidden among the rocks as he passed them. He began a tedious trek across a large rimmed crater. Lava sizzled and bubbled below him. He looked around and saw three caves. He eyed the cave on his side of the crater and began to walk towards it. Just as he approached it a Goblin spotted him and began Loud Gibbering Taunts and threats at him widly running towards the drow. The young Dark Elf Turned and fled towards the tunnel praying that somone would help him the spindly legged goblin continued its hoots and curses as the drow turned into the tunnel and ran for all he was worth. He stumbled into a cave and fell before to large doors with all he had left he pushed with all his might but the door despite their large size they moved easily under the slightest touch. The drow fell into the cavern to the feet of to very surprised eurdites. They looked at the drow and then saw a fire goblin chasing after him. Both of the Wizards fell with in themselves and began to chant their hands going through Unique motions as the words of power climaxed and fired. The stunned goblin looked at it's feet it was only a foot away from its intended target. It then looked up and saw the wizards one with a grin and the other deep in the throes of casting. Then the goblin looked at its feet they were entiwned with roots. It new its doom and it went to its knees as a bolt of pure ice slammed into its heart spilling the pathetic creatures blood to the ground. <br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
          The Eurdites grinned as a vile creature fell to its doom. Then one turned to the curious drow at his feet. He looked to his sister in concern the drow was unconsicence. They each picked one end up of the dark elf and brought him before the of soulsek ro paladin. The paladin smiled and chanted a few words and layed his hands on the drow elf's Back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aCDemise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">(I was on vaca for a week =P sorry to be late)...<br />
The Young Drow slowly woke up his head was spinning his mind whirled. He looked around the room to make out a fuzzy form standing in the corner his vision slowly Returned to normal. The female eurdite notced his movement and walked over to his side. &quot;Hello there.&quot; She said with a with a slight smile. The Drow sat up his head pounded. He managed to look up to the women dressed in a unremarkable red robe with a hood. He shook his head once his stark white hair shook though it was in a tight pony tail. &quot;How long have I been out?&quot; He managed to ask. The women thought a moment and replied &quot;It has been 2 days since you fell at my feet.&quot; She grinned and stood up. &quot;Whats your name?&quot; she asked as she looked into his emerlad green eyes. He looked around for the first time with no fuzzyness he laid in a flat unadorned bed with a soft pillow at his back with the exception of a small table and a chair the room was plain. He suddenly thought about the question he was asked. &quot;I really don't know... I don't know who I am or where i am From...&quot; The Women looked at him curiosly she bit her lip in thought. &quot;Well that won't do will it...&quot; She looked around the room and remained in deep thought. &quot;Well...&quot; She was thinking of a name that would suit this young drow. A name entered her mind above all the others. A name of a great Human Mage with incredible power. &quot;How about... Gribb...&quot; She looked at the young drow for a response. He thought about and had no better suggestions so he nodded his accord. &quot;There now that thats settled follow me I'm sure you are hungry.&quot; She Started out the door and as if on cue Gribb's Stomach growled and he quickly got up and chased after her.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Gribb stood up after his meal of mutton and glanced around the little room they sat at a polished oak round table. A desk and art work adorned the walls. &quot;Well.. let us see what kind of career you might have here in the temple of fire.&quot; The eurdite Gribb had come to know as Lyzath smiled. Gribb looked confused. &quot;Am I to learn Magic in this great temple?&quot; He asked watching the woman for a response. &quot;If that is what the fates deem appropriate.&quot; Without another word she led him off down the windy corridors of the temple of soulsek ro. She brought Gribb before a aged man in silken robes. &quot;Greetings Sage of Ro.&quot; She bowed low. Gribb Not knowing what to do bowed also never taking his eyes off the old man. &quot;Greetings good Lyzath.&quot; He said with a smile. &quot;And who is your freind?&quot; Gribb straightened and smiled finally able to answer the question that he not before. &quot;I am Gribb.&quot; But somehow the name seemed incomplete to him. The old sage smiled at the contemplative face of the drow. &quot;You wish to know what career in magic would suit you best i assume?&quot; Lyzath nodded her accord. The old Sage came forward chanting and attuning his thoughts to Gribb's. At first the Drow looked surprised and slowly he eased into a more comfortable posture when he realized he was not being threatned. The old Sage fell within himself probing the drows mind to seek what career this intellgent drow should Persue.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;A Mage!?!&quot; Gribb looked confused at the old mans final decsion he assumed he would end up following the wizardly arts. The old Sage nodded. &quot;I sense within you a deep affinty with the elements. You shall start on your search for power of the elementals. Here you shall find the power of fire. The old Sage chanted a few quick words and a door to the left of him opened. He handed Gribb a Black robe with green fringes, dagger, some rations and a packet of parchments. &quot;Read thoes spell and commit them to memory. They shall aid your journey greatly.&quot; Gribb sat down and began to memorize the parchments before him. <br />
----(Yeah this is to signfy the 5 hours it takes to bloody scribe and memorize a spells at level 1)-----<br />
Finally Gribb sat up and looked at the door the old sage had indicated. He took a deep breath and steady'd himself for the coming battles he new he would face. He looked into the first adjoining room a large deep caveren filled with rivers of lava the heat was intense. He took yet another deep breath to steady himself and he entered  'The trial of Fire'<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Do you think he will make it?&quot; Lyzthan asked her voice full of concern. The old sage looked through the door at the slow moving drow. &quot;I do not know but i would hope he makes it back I saw great promise in him otherwise I would not of so willing handed that expensive robe.&quot; He chuckled but only to mask his concern for the drow himself. He had truly seen great promise in the boy but, the trials ahead of him would be great indeed and not even the old sage was not certain of the boys future...<br />
