<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Januas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">((OOC: Ok..Brief Preface here...I know everyone has been asking for an Event...Something to get things started...This is something I've been considering for a long time..and have discussed with a few others of my guild...We think it could be what everyone needs..Let's see what you all think hmm? Also for those of you interested in where I got the Teir Dal Phrases for the Chant, Its posted on the OOC Board..the Cimmerii Guide to Teir Dal))<br />
<br />
<br />
He woke Panting, sheathed in a cold sweat as his candle flared with blue fire. &quot;M'lord...is it finally time?&quot; Estatically Januas rose from his bed in the keep of the Cimmerii, and quickly donned his robe. For 21 seasons he had waited to heed the call of his Lord and Father, and finally it was time. He headed to the ground level of the keep and removed the ancient text from it's hiding place. It seemed so long ago that he stole it from Innoruuk's Temple in a fit of rage, and yet as if it were only yesterday.<br />
<br />
He almost left immediately, but something told him to stop. His blood sang to him and he entered the room of his most trusted friend and Blood Brother. &quot;Mawg..Come...I will need you to stand guard for me for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is time&quot; Gathering the instruments he would need for his ritual, he headed into the temple and began mounting the stairs, ignoring the surprised cries of the priests. For their part they seemed to know what was coming, for they let him pass with a revereance they reserved only for those truly touched. <br />
<br />
As he reached the highest point of the temple and looked out over all of Neriak, he took a moment to reflect upon what was yet to come. So much work had yet to be accomplished, and yet the Father called him now, he worried, but only for a moment. Then with a flick of his wrist he opened the black altar-cloth, and spread it along the floor, the silver sigils and runes of power carefully stiched by his own hand. From his bag he removed the goblet he forged himself, and poured into it the finest vintage of wine he could brew. A bit of meat from each of the Ssussun Mrannd'ssinssex, the Light Lovers, cooked and seasoned with care by his own hand, were placed next to the goblet. Januas then began to painstakingly don all of the ritual garments and jewelery, all of his work coming to a head in this one night, although he knew not how this would end.<br />
<br />
   &quot;So it is time my son?&quot; Januas turned his eyes flaring blue and faced the Patriarch, and then smiled. &quot;Yes Father, my destiny awaits me.&quot; The Patriarch uttered a blessing over Januas and left quickly, knowing it was not his place to witness what was yet to come.<br />
<br />
Encouraged by this, Januas began his ritual, his voice lilting in the high tones of ancient Teir Dal Speech.<br />
<br />
Vel'uss zhaun Alur taga lil INNORUUK? Who Knows Better Than Inoruuk.<br />
<br />
As he chanted a blue, flickering flame began to gather around him, filling the entire room with a blueish cast, the pure flames of hatred.<br />
<br />
Uk phlithe He hates Uk zhah phlithuss He is hated <br />
<br />
Something began to change inside the room, a weight becoming more and more oppressive and yet strangely desireable. His body moving of its own accord, Januas cut his wrist with the self same dagger that had taken his fathers life, letting his lifesblood fall into the goblet of wine. He then drank a deep draught from the goblet, and consumed each of the pieces of meat in turn, his body shaking as he shouted the last invocation to complete his dark ritual.<br />
<br />
INNORUUK TLU MALLA; JAL ULTRINNAN ZHAH XUNDUS!!!  Innoruuk be praised; all victory is his doing  <br />
<br />
The Blue Flames burst forth from the temple, flowing over the entirety of Neriak, and causing the city to be lit up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jaaaannuassss!&quot; By now the voice of the Lord of Hate was as familiar to him as his own, and Januas welcomed him. &quot;My Lord! My Father! You have called me and I have answered. You have Commanded me and I have done. See how I have learned. How would you use me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Lord of Hate's flickering image appeared from the flames, looking down upon Januas as one might look upon a treasured son. &quot;Ahhhh....grown you haavvee....Noowwww iss the time Jannnuassss....now...You...Become...Mine!&quot; Pain Arched through his body, as Januas began to scream. Not out of Fear or even the Pain, but from pure ecstacy as all the other pains of his life were blotted from him in this one excruciating moment. Innoruuk pounded around him, through him...INTO him. His voice fell from Januas' lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be my Oracle Januas, My Power Made Flesh...You are My tool..and My Son...Bring forth the Darkness&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes turned towards the door, and the wide eyed Ogre that stood there. Innoruuk spoke, his presence falling upon Ghuarboktumawg &quot;Loyal one, bonded in blood to my Son you are..though unexpected this is guard him well you shall I know, as will all of my Honor Guard...Cimmerii Ulith!&quot;<br />
<br />
Januas' eyes were two bright pricks of blue flame as he looked out across Neriak, but it was Innoruuk that spoke, his voice and his power carrying to all of his children, assuring them that indeed the Eve of Hate was upon them. &quot;Come my flock...my chosen ones...let the spread of hate begin...I am with you in flesh now...come to me...Let it begin here.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Januas Uss`Del`Oloth De`Nuit<br />
Innoruuk's Chosen Oracle<br />
Enchanter of the Cimmerii</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ghuarboktumawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mawg felt the brief tingling in his veins, alerting him to the presence of his Blud Brudder, Januas, a few moments before the Januas stepped into view.  It wasn't a bad little place he had here, a decent cave which Mawg had dug for himself where the wall of the Keep butted up against the solid stone of the city's edge.  The cave was perhaps a bit musty though.  Unlike his home in Oggok the Keep was buried deep in the so-called Third Gate, far from the fresh clean air of the open world.  As Mawg sniffed at the air he caught Januas's scent and remember to pull his mind back to the present and away from its wanderings.<br />
<br />
Januas spoke &quot;Mawg.. Come..&quot; and the words were accompanied by that familiar slight sting which accompanied any order from Januas, inciting obedience.<br />
<br />
Mawg rose from his bed of bear pelts and trotted along happily after Januas, wrapped up in the usual happy feeling that his Barshin' Buddee's presence brought.  &quot;You're quite looky to have met Januas, old Chap,&quot; Mawg thought to himself.  &quot;He's quite charming for a Tier'dal, if still perhaps still a bit on the squeamish side.  No matter though, we'll straighten him out soon enough, get him eating a bit more, and toughen him up for battle.  Oooh, look at that scrumptious little bit would you,&quot; Mawg's attention was drawn away by a silvery fish swimming about in the water to his left.  It kept his attention as they rounded the moat and crossed the bridge into the Temple of Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
As they mounted the stairs, Mawg did his best to swell up and look threatening.  There was no love lost between himself and the residents of the Third Gate, who only barely tolerated him now.  &quot;Good show, lad,&quot; Mawg thought to himself, &quot;You seem to be scaring them out of the way quite nicely.  That'll teach those heartless little buggers to stand in your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a bit of a climb they reached the room of the Temple's Big Boss.  &quot;My my, it certainly seems that he likes to play dress-up, doesn't it,&quot; Mawg snickered to himself.  &quot;And this place, it's no good for a home, all cluttered with stuff that certainly doesn't appear to be edible in any way.&quot;  Mawg let his attention wander about the room as Januas and the priest babbled at each other, the politics and scheming of the Tier'dal held little interest for Mawg.<br />
<br />
Mawg's attention swung back quickly to the two Tier'dal as Januas produced several snack sized pieces of meat from amongst his belongings.  &quot;Oh goody, it seems that you've done a good job scaring off those other priests on the way over here and now you're going to get a treat for this, you clever devil you,&quot; Mawg was so excited by this thought he could barely sit still.  But Januas didn't hand Mawg any of the meat, so Mawg returned to staring at the walls.  &quot;Oh wait, that's right,&quot; Mawg thought, &quot;I'm here to act as a guard.&quot;  Mawg drew himself up to attention, banging his head on the ceiling, and then positioned himself near the door in as strategic a spot as he could find, stooping this time.<br />
<br />
Januas continued about his preparations, lighting candles and the like.  &quot;Hmm, perhaps he's gone batty,&quot; Mawg thought, &quot;He'll never be able to cook the meat over such small flames as those.&quot;<br />
<br />
After what seemed an excruciatingly long and boring wait, Januas finally began to speak, using some foreign tongue which Mawg had never heard before from his friend's lips.  He winced as the words rolled over him, burning in his ears.  &quot;Ow, those words are like fire in my ears, I hope Januas doesn't burn his tongue speaking them,&quot; Mawg thought.  &quot;Last time I burned my tongue I couldn't taste my food for a week, that was one of the most wretched times I've ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Januas continued to speak, a glow slowly grew around him.  Mawg marvelled at the pretty colors swirling about his friend, then quickly remembered his purpose and yanked his attention back to guarding the doorway.  The ceremony continued and then a voice spoke calling to Januas.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the name of Zek is that voice?  Oh wait wait, that's riiight, silly me I forgot Januas had some silly meeting with Innoruuk today,&quot; Mawg recalled.  &quot;Now what was the word he used, oh bother I never can quite understand all those silly extra words that Januas uses, all they do is serve to confuse the issue.&quot;  A semi-transparent figure appeared before Januas.  &quot;So that's Innoruuk, eh?  Not much to look at I should think.  No wonder this scrawny little guy is so spiteful, why I'd wager Zek trounced him on a daily basis when they were in God school together.  Hmmph, Now Zek showing up all clad in plate and carrying a monstrous sword, that's awe-inspiring, but this guy, he's just not that impressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mawg watched on, Januas and the glowing figure conversed and then the figure actually stepped into Januas, melding with him in some fashion.  Then Januas turned to Mawg and in and spoke in an odd voice, asking for his help.  &quot;I've already promised him once, it seems silly to have to make such a promise again, but I suppose I'd best comply.  These Tier'dal are crazy,&quot; Mawg thought before he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yar Janee, uv cors me's gunna barsh' yuu's meeneez.  It no liik yuu's gotsta ask me's agen,&quot;  Mawg said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This certainly had been an interesting day,&quot; Mawg thought to himself as he followed Januas back to the Keep.  &quot;I wonder what I shall have for lunch today.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lord Naos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh my faith!  Doubt him I did, low.. how very wrong I was.. In my pride to the vessel of our Lord I did challenge.. only to watch in sheer horror as my spells, cast I could not!  In pure disbelief I was.. that I, an esteemed wizard of forty seasons could not cast a single spell upon this young enchanter! *shakes his head slowly* .. 'tis truly a sad thing, and how only now I have come to see the error of my ways, and how I do pity those who would dare question his divine will.. as it has become manifest in full force.. only to this night my faith I did see, as the life drained from my shell.. I watched.. I watched it all. *balls his hands into fists and screams, turning into mad laughter*<br />
<br />
Yet all was not lost. .  For he did speak to me, and a mission he did grant.  Of this I shall speak no more,. for it would be heresy.  Only this do know friends, now I am his servant .. and my dear friend has become his vessel. . and now he is the bringer of a new aeon .. one that shall transform all of Norrath ..<br />

In the service of his Lord and Vessel,<br />
