<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dundridge DweomerDoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dundridge, leader of the League of Non-Aligned Wizards floated in his tower slightly above his seat, looking out the window when a knock on the door diverted his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in&quot;, he stated and watched as a young wizard entered the room. &quot;Not another one&quot; he murmered as he noticed the wizard was walking and began casting.<br />
<br />
&quot;The latest intelligence reports for you Sir, whoah, errr, ok, cool !&quot; said the youngster as he floated up into the air on a circle of light, and quietly floated out the room, a little disorientated.<br />
<br />
The wizard concentrated slightly, and the reports floated over to his location. He placed his glass in mid air, and started to read. He paused, as one report seemed to startle him, and then another. He took a drink from his glass, and replaced it on mid air. The glass simply hung in mid air, much in the same way that bricks don't.<br />
<br />
Looking out the window he spotted another wizard in the courtyard firing spells at a target. Dundridge waved his hands and muttered something as his target erupted in light and sound and disapeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a message for me would you please.&quot; he asked, as the wizard from outside suddenly materialised in the room looking a little startled.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It has come to my attention that certain guilds have been a little careless with their statements. The League of Non-Aligned Wizards are not your enemy unless you choose to make them your enemy. <br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that declaring &quot;everyone else&quot; as your enemies includes the League of Non-Aligned Wizards, presumably an simple oversight. We take this as a slur on our abilities, and seek a mutual non-agression treaty.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to declare us your enemy, your life expectancy will be shorter than you can possibly imagine. <br />
<br />
Know also this, it has also come to my attention that certain wizards may have been &quot;mistreated&quot; by other guilds. Should this be the case, the League of Non-Aligned Wizards WILL investigate AND intervene on behalf of the wizard, be the wizard one of our members or not.<br />
<br />
Our doors are always open to wizards seeking shelter or sanctuary.&quot;</div></div><hr />

 Long have I been away from the power of our home, and I have missed ye in the vast expanse of time.  While traveling the worlds I have learned much, and gain knowledge and power with every passing minute.  Everyone one journeys, one finds an unwanted wizard.  People have been led to believe we have inferior power, the day shall come when that mentality shall devour those who oppose our magic.  Be it known that I back and feel a bond toward the Non-Aligned, and am rdy at a moments notice when called upon.<br />
