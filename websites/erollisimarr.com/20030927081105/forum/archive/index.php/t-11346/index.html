<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nattik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is some of my log. Sadly I turned on after I hear the beginning of the scam, but I got most of it. I was sitting in the bazaar so I had to edit a ton of text out. He told me that a friend of his would trade a fungi for the book I was selling and that he would take my book to his friend and then bring the fungi to me. After he said this I got very suspicious. Anyway after a few minutes of talking, he said he would have me hold some of his items to make sure that he would not steal my book. Of course all the items were not near the value of either the fungi or my book. This is where my log starts.<br />

Brilliant Idea Rinak. That would kick ass.<br />

Get caught scamming and be sent to the deadlands server instead of being banned.<br />
A server plumb full of criminals.<br />

Ok, now I'm ticked.  Just for the record, Teretulus was as ranger of mine that this punk ripped off on the Druzzil Ro server.  Even though he does not exist anymore, I hate to see his name being used by this lowlife.<br />
