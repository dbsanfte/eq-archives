<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TieroEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A high elf stared blankly into the darkness surrounding him, a line of blood he could feel trickling down the side of his mouth.  He didn't care, he knew that if he turned around he'd see that taunting speck of light that was his eternal torment.<br />
<br />
At first he'd attempted to reach this speck...days on end he'd walk.  Surprisingly as long as he was attempting to reach this small bit of hope the torturers generally didn't come to flay his skin to the point of agonizing death only to be returned to life to recieve it again.  Unfortunately the despair that descended upon realizing this light was only a further torture placed upon his head was worse than the physical torment.<br />
<br />
Time lost all meaning in the enveloping darkness.  Hunger and thirst stopped losing it's meaning after the first year or so of his incarceration.  How much more he could bear before losing what little bit of sanity he still possessed was questionable and he knew it.  A day not long in coming will see this simple servant of Tunare becoming a mindless toy of another power.</div></div><hr />

~Strykker 22nd Ranger of Karana<br />
<br />
&quot;When the Dark comes rising, six shall turn it back;<br />
Three from the circle, three from the track;<br />
Wood, bronze, iron; fire, water, stone;<br />
Five will return and one go alone.<br />
<br />
Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long;<br />
Wood from the burning, stone out of song;<br />
Fire from the candle-ring, water from the thaw;<br />
Six signs the circle and the grail gone before.<br />
<br />
Fire on the mountain, shall find the harp of gold<br />
Played to wake the Sleepers, oldest of the old;<br />
Power from the green witch, lost beneath the sea;<br />
All shall find the light at last, silver on the tree.&quot;</div></div><hr />
