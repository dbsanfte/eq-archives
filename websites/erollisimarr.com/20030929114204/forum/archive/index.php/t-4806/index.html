--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Walking with confidence through the night, Shadowlyth leads a figure to the Monolith just through the hills from the East Commons into Nektulos. Their presence so close to the ancient stone causes the piles of bones to animate and rush the intruders. With a smile on his face he strikes down each of the guards with the magic granted to him by Innoruuk. With the sentries gone, Shadowlyth approaches the stone and places his hand on the cold surface. Blackness seems to seep from his skin and into the rock, then spreads out to cover an area about the size of a door. He motions his guest to follow him as he steps through the doorway he created. For the guest, there is a cold feeling passing through the doorway, then nothing. A small flame comes to life revealing a chamber dedicated to the Lord of Hate. Shadowlyth is standing on the opposite side of a pool of water from his guest. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can take off the robes now. You are safe from the rest of the Teir'dal in here.&quot; <br />
<br />
A quick, graceful motion sends the heavy robes to the ground to reveal the lady Bard Tyria, giving Shadowlyth a suspicious look. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is not a trap. There would be no sport in this chase if it was. You do not need to fear an ambush either. Of those that know it is here, I am the only one that can open the door. Seeing as you are uncomfortable with your surroundings, I will get to the point. Your guild has aligned with the Sisters of Erollisi. Since I have made a habit of hunting the sisters, I am sure you want me dead, as well as the others of my guild that practice this as well. So I have brought you here to give you that chance. Using the RL calendar, on April 8th, at 7pm EST I am going to begin my hunt on the sisters of that island. I will proceed to kill every last one I can find. I extend to you and your guild an invitation to stop me.&quot; <br />
<br />
With disgust, Tyria glares at Shadowlyth. &quot;We will be there and all of you will pay for your crimes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shadowlyth turns his back as he removes his Barbute and puts it under his arm. He looks back at her with a childish smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, I look forward to the chase. The door is open for you to leave. I would do so with haste though. Many Teir'dal hunt the dead at the monolyth and they might not be as...nice as I am.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tyria steps away from the water's edge and walks out the doorway. From inside she hears Shadowlyth speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to tell your lover you won't be home that night. I might want to keep you as a trophy.&quot; <br />
<br />
The last thing she sees as the blackness covers the doorway then turns to stone, is Shadowlyth smiling. She shakes off the chill the place left her with and leaves the forrest the same way she was brought in. She sensed a few eyes watching her, but she knew they wouldn't dare attack her. Not because of the Teir'dal she had just left, but because she wasn't as defensless as he suggested she was.<br />
<br />
With Lady Tyria gone, Shadowlyth kneels down to the water and drags his fingers through the water. The same darkness that made the door, slithers from his hands and covers the surface of the pool. From the darkness the image of a beautiful Teir'dal forms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress, the challenge has been issued.&quot;</div></div><hr />
