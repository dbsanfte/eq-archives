<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrolf Forgefaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't believe it!!<br />
<br />
I check me email and I find this in my inbox headed MAKE PLATINUM IN EVERQUEST.<br />
<br />
So I open it up to see what sam hill this is all about, low and behold is the biggest load of scamming bull I have ever read!!<br />
<br />
  Hail and well met friends and fellow Norrathians! <br />
<br />
  Why do i come to you by e-mail? A person who you do not know, a stranger if you will. Well to tell you of a method I have found. Guides that give you like 1k per hour in EQ? That you have to PAY for!? Pshsdojuk, and half of them aren't even good at all! Why pay for EverQuest knowledge! It's everyone's game isn't it? EverQuest knowledge belongs to all who play. <br />
<br />
  Anyways, I can get you 500-600 platinum per every two hours as long as you are over level 25. Now, yes this will sound like a scam, but first off, I will give you two things (I will give you other things later that should convince you I'm not trying to scam you). First, my EverQuest account username, it is Chairlift. Next, my full name in real life, which is Dan Friends. <br />
<br />
  Now just here me out before jumping the gun and assuming it's a scam right off the bat. Yes it will sound extremely like one, but I beg of you to please read the letter out. =) <br />
<br />
  If you wish to get this platinum, I can get it for you. You will need to e-mail me with several things. Your EverQuest account username (yes I know it sounds bad, your EverQuest account password (yes I know it sounds even worse lol), and the date(s) and time(s) which I can log onto your account and get you the money. I will also need the name of the character(s) you wish to get platinum on, and the server(s) they are on. Also, I can get you items, but that requires more time so if you want items we can work it out via e-mail. If you wish, I can arrange in-game meetings between you and up to 3 other EverQuest players who can tell you about the glories of my service. =) <br />
<br />
  Ok then. Reasons for you to trust me, and yes I'll admit there are few. <br />
<br />
  1. If I steal your account, YOU have the former password AND your CD account keys so you can get your password restored at the EverQuest site and then change it. <br />
<br />
  2. Now what if I don't steal your account, but just steal your items and money? Well just petition saying your items were taken by a hacker, give them the date and time that I was on, and they can have the GMs check your account logs and reimburse you. <br />
<br />
  3. I gave you my EverQuest username so you can report me immediately to the GMs if I scam you, which I won't <br />
<br />
  4. I gave you my full name in RL <br />
<br />
  5. You can speak in-game with players whom I've helped in the past <br />
<br />
  I will need the time set (I.E. from 12 PM to 2 PM) because I will need to log off your account immediately after the time you have specified is up. The reason I request dates and times is because I have requests flying in from all over the place and the time you request may be booked. If the time you request is booked, I will work out a better time with you via e-mail. Also, don't worry about your character being contacted in-game via tells by EQ friends etc. I ALWAYS do the platinum getting work on other people's chars with my AFK flag on (as well as /anon if you are in a guild). <br />
<br />
  So get those e-mails rolling if you wish. NOTE: If you want to arrange in-game meetings with players I have helped, please e-mail me and we can work out a date and time for that =) <br />
<br />
<br />
So I thought I would post it here as a warning if you ever find this sitting in your inbox.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No but they will require your birth certificate and all credit information as well - including bank account numbers and holding companies for any stocks and bonds.<br />
<br />
You know the scarey thing - there are idiots out there who would fall for this....   /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TheClericBanton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I told him i would send him my first born but i have yet to recieve a response &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valleycrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So this guy gets me platinum out of the goodness of his heart??  No where did it discuss a fee or any type of retribution.  If this is true, why on earth is this guy doing this?  Why can't you make the platinum on your own character and simply give it to me?  Why do you need to use my character?  Same with items...if you found a way to get items for people, why exactly do you need my character to do it.  If it's no drop than I can see, but there's no way I'd give up my station name and password to get a chance at some no drop item.  I can't believe that this guy says he has a lot of requests.  Are there really that many people that cannot see this as a scam?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Treage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not just alot of requests, but   I have requests flying in from all over the place  ;) <br />
