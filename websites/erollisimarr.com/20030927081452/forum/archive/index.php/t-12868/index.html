The cloak was randomed... went to wrong person... he refused to give it back.... if anyone sees him trying to sell PLEASE dont buy...

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nannwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OK I will post here to dispell all the rumors about a friend of mine who has been the target of IDIOTS<br />
<br />
   First of all ARG was listed in the roll for the CoF at number 13 and number 20. IF and I repeat IF, any number were to have been dropped, it would have been the number 20. Correct? HE won the roll on the number 13. So FINE take him off the roll for the stoopid CoF, he drops the number 20 from his llisting in the roll,  and he still wins :) <br />
   The raid leader put himself in the roll three times.  Now Zul im not gonna say that was wrong or right..but I will say that alot did't hear that part when they came along on the raid. This doesn't make it wrong.....but neither does accidentaly adding Args name in twice ESPECIALLY since one of the times it was the last number in the roll. This is no ones fault and I am not pointing a finger at anyone &lt;unlike Zarthic&gt;.  He was told by the raid leader he won and accepted his prize and got a tl to nexus from a nice wizzy there and went about his business. We were all told to get a TL  and start heading out.<br />
   What does all of this mean? It means that a good guy got lucky and got a nice haste item and there are some people out there that are pissed at him  for winning it. He did NOT steal it. He did NOT get greedy. He was going to give it back untill a few raid people started sending him in game tells threatening him I.E. train him, keep sending tells, report him ect ect ect.... This was very childish behaviour. <br />
   I mean get a grip! You want a CoF ? then go set up your own raid and go get it yourself. Ixialibit fer , Talendor, Gorenaire and more have the means to drop one so you dont have to wait for naggy.<br />
   Bottom line is the raid leader gave it to him after he rolled the item to everyone and he said Argowin won the item. That should be the end of the story.<br />
   Please feel free to agree or disagree with me here, but as to Zarthic saying he got greedy and stole it is outright stupidity. AND  by the way Zarthic.....if you read the above post you will notice it did NOT go to the wrong person. He was told he won it, he was handed it by the raid leader, and now proudly wears it on his back.<br />
   End this stupid crap and lets go play the game !<br />

Funny how that wasnt' his raid. Secondly not giving it back means he stole it. For the issue of him about to give it back, he was told not to leave when he was still in zone and gues wat? he left. It was an accident he got it and that was not his fault, but even tho it wasn't goin to end up a roll on 20 it is still unfair and should have been rolled again...learn probability if you dont' know it. Seems to me he got greedy cuz lets see....he went to nexus stood there for 10 min while we waited for a response so we go there he ignores us for a couple of minute then start saying we treaten him. Even if we did we apologize and asked for it back and he still didn't give it back. So like you said nannwin he is your friend but stop protecting your friend and open up your eyes, he took it period. If anyone know his guild plz post</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nannwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He was TP'd to the nexus by a wizard standing in the same zone as everyone else. We were told to start getting out of the zone, which he did.  And yes he did stand in the nexus for 10 minutes listening to all the threats from idiots such as yourselves who were pissed they came away with nothing from the raid.  And yes he did threaten to destroy the damn thing because people such as Zarthic were threatening to train him in the future, Blacklist him from the game ect....Yav you say even if you did threaten him,  that you apologized...hmmm if you threaten me,  I wont just take an apology that you concoct right off the bat.  I mean come on folks this is a game right?  If I am not mistaken, later Zul said in a chat channel to two other friends &lt;Jete from Raven Wolves and Garwulf from Nomads &lt;the original raid leader by the way&gt;&gt; that he did make a mistake and that the CoF was Arg's to keep. So let it rest but dont flame someone for taking something that was given to them. You are right it wasn't Arg's raid but he did participate and he won a CoF. It was given to him by the raid leader and he admits that he made a mistake.<br />
   I would like to hear from Zul on this matter, and I hope he posts here soon. Did he admitt to a mistake and say Arg could keep the CoF? And if he did, then why are all of you trying to bash a good guy?  Argowin is NOT a thief.  He is a highly respected member of Nomads, and we love him for being who he is.<br />
   And as to his logging off, he did log onto an alt of his to get away from the threatening tells he was receiving &lt;which continued by the way Yav, he was still being threatened with all sorts of stuff 10 minutes after the fact, NO apologies were given&gt; and came back about 10 minutes after that. The last thing I will say is that we will be watching our brother, and will report any signs of trains and threats ect to the GM's. <br />

2 i never ranted him out &lt;PERIOD&gt; in game.... as a fact i was really nice to him trying to get people to shut up and i tried being nice... <br />
3 im almost positive zul never said that, even so the random wasn't right... someone who has 1/10th of a chance VS everyones 1/20 isnt right... get rid of the 20th roll... things would have been different. <br />
4 *From what i remember* Argowin told me Urchun TLed him saying &quot;RUN&quot;... now if my memory is correct... Urchun was pissed because Zulnick didnt let him roll on CoF and something else (dont remember what).<br />
<br />
Please nannwin... you dont just take a CoF, disobay the raid leaders orders, and then ignore anyone who tries to help you, then most of all threaten to destroy a COF... its called /ignore ... learn how to use it...<br />
<br />
if you all respect a guy who grabs a COF and runs... then wtf...</div></div><hr />

BTW. what did Zul do with that healing scroll thing? dont think that was ever randomed off.... and you know, even if it was his raid, he should say he gets three rolls before hand.

I know I will get bashed for this but I dont care, we're entitled to our opinions...  <br />
<br />
I dont know... Much less care... not many realy care about those anymore. Im sure if you /tell him about the scrolls he would probably give ya one. I do agree Zul shoulda told us before hand the 3 spots he gets, but *no offence* after leading a raid of a bunch of inexperienced noobs.. he deserved it (wtf what kind of cleric GATES on a naggy raid?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urchun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">btw im the wiz that ported him out, and i did it on purpose to spite the crappy looter. Garwulf did a perfect job leading until somehow solurnis and zulnick got in control.<br />
<br />
So the events that led me to do this<br />
<br />
1.Naggy was taken down<br />
2.Started randoming loot<br />
3.Zulnick skipped me on roll for 2 items (it was for orb of tishan which doesn't mean much to me at all, but the point was he skipped me in roll twice and ignored me the whole time when i asked him why he skipped me on the roll)<br />
4.Zulnick tried to reserve the scale for himself before raid started, and then ppl got seriously pissed and threatened to leave, so then he said no reserve on scale and ALL LOOT WILL BE RANDOMED OFF EQUALLY. Yet he gave himself 3 numbers for the cof.<br />
<br />
I am sitting in naggy room pissed off for being ignored, so when zulnick told argo to not go, i gave him a tl to nexus, and i told him to run his ass off and camp. And yes , he threatened to destroy the CoF CAUSE YOU PPL WERE BEING DICKWADS AND THREATENING HIM. No i am not friends with argo and i've never met him before and actually i found his ooc's during raid fuckign annoying but it still didnt match how pissed i was about the crappy loot splitting. So i'm glad he got the cof cause he probably deserved it for zulnicks mistakes. So don't ban the guy from raids, if you had a cof in your hands that you just rightfully won, would u just freakin hand it back for rerolll cause a dip made a mistake? I think not. it was like winning the lotto for him, jesus. I think rightfully garwulf should've gotten the cof.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just a silly question.  If Zul had accidently put say four numbers in on the COF and won...Do you honestly think that he would have brought that to the attention of the entire raid and rerolled?  I doubt it.  Zul will of course come on now and say &quot;Yes, I would have done a reroll.&quot;  I wouldn't believe that just like I don't believe the CoF was stolen.  The man won on a roll of 13, not the extra number of 20.  You gave the CoF to the appropriate winner and that is final...<br />
My honest opinion is if you were the raid leader and were unable to check your own random information prior to rolling, your mistake not his.  Expecting somebody to give back something that he won on a chance roll is completely wrong.  You said that all would be evenly randomed yet Zul had 3 numbers in??? Where is even in that?  Perhaps he should not be in on raids?  Can't accept the same chances as the rest of the melee classes, then don't go on the raids yourself.<br />
I guess my point is if he had not won, would you have rerolled??  My guess would be no you wouldn't have...Prove my point?<br />
<br />
Raid leader own up to your mistake and admit that he won and you were wrong.<br />

<br />
No sympathy for the way this turned out.  Why?<br />
<br />
1) The lower level limit on this raid was either 44 or 45.  Enough said.<br />
<br />
2) The raid leader did not take the time to check the roll before proceeding.  Believe me if it was me I'd do a /who on each person before typing that /random.  Mistakes are made, but ...<br />
<br />
3) Once you /random, give the item up and declare Person A the winner, they are the winner.  You can't take it back after that.  Don't call the person a thief when it is entirely - 100% - the raid leader's responsibility for what happened.<br />
<br />
I heard a 44 paladin won the CoF, I heard he's wearing it, I heard he went right to the bazaar and sold it.  None of that makes a difference because the leader is the one who screwed up, nothing personal against him because again mistakes happen, but if you are going to blame someone then blame the leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow 3 Rolls on the CoF, I should have thought of that when I was leading Naggy raid, then maybee I would have actually gotten one, (That is just Bull).  I would personally have to agree with the people that said they would have left if they had know he was gonna have 3 rolls, I would have also, why not be fair and have the same chance as everybody else.<br />
<br />
And about someone stealing it, the only way you can steal it is if you loot it and run, if the raid leader made a mistake and gave it to him, then that is the Raid Leaders fault not the person who won it.<br />
<br />
Grats to the CoF Winner....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Soxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hi.<br />
<br />
Normally I just read these posts, giggle a bit and let it end there. Never once have I posted here. But, after reading this whole 'scammer alert' I wanted to say this.<br />
<br />
About a month ago, maybe more, Zulnick led a raid for Naggy. It was a NAK raid (norrathian alliance of kindness) and quite a few people came to help out. Without going into too much detail it was a long long night. But, in the end naggy dropped and the 'nbg' loot was being randomed. <br />
<br />
Zulnick stated we were allowed to pick 2 things to roll on. When he announced the loot one by one and you were to shoot him a tell letting him know you wanted in on it. <br />
<br />
CoF comes up and I send him a tell. Along with approximately 15 or so others. <br />
<br />
Long story short, he leaves my name of the roll. He says ok these people are in for the CoF. blah blah blah naming all the names and saying &quot;did I miss anyone&quot;? Not only did I /say and /t him yea, you forgot meIt was already too late, he already rolled and declared a winner. It was about 3 seconds after he asked if he forgot anyone. <br />
<br />
Now, people were talking in /say telling him, in lamens terms, dumbass you forgot soxx. Did he care? not at that point. Did he re roll? No sir. Did he throw a fit? sure didn't. and neither did I.<br />
<br />
I guess at that point, I figured, Oh well. It wasn't meant to be. I got over it. But, to come here and flame someone for being a so called 'scammer' over HIS mistake is a joke. <br />
<br />
Its over and done with. Grats to the pally :-) let it go.</div></div><hr />

Odd how nobody informs the raiders that the Fire Giant respawn rate is 8 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Taevitus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If the Paladin in question knew that his/her name was added twice, and said nothing, without a doubt, the Pally is at fault and needs to cough up the Cloak.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if my name was added twice on a roll without my knowledge, and I won, you bet your ass that the only way you are going to get that cloak from me is by prying it from my cold - dead hands. No devious action took place, if anyone should step up to the plate and take responsibility, it is the leader for making the error...after all, being a raid leader isn't just about getting to have your name on a roll 3 times, it also means when something during the raid fucks up, you take the heat.

Bad form Zarthic, shame on you... shame shame shame on you.<br />
<br />
Presti Digitateur<br />
<br />
PS Also shame on Yavamia and all those other raiders that didn't realize this was Zarthics fault and that the roll is valid even though Zarthic can't roll right. picture this scenario, you are betting on a horse through a bookie, lets call him &quot;Zarthic&quot;. Zarthic gave you 20 to one odds, when he should have given you 19 to 1 odds. Do you think Zarthic will give you your money back because the horse lost? Hell no, he will break you f*cking legs if you so much as peeped. This time the better won against the odds and the bookie, a happy ending if you think about it.<br />
<br />
PSS I used to lead a shit load of Naggy and Vox Raid with my character Ealin, I never once put myself in on randoms with a couple entries. I suggest you stop that kind of behavior. Somebody might break your legs. And by that. I mean blacklist you from speed and KEI.</div></div><hr />
