A reward of 500 pieces of platinum will be awarded to any group or individual who can deliver Cimmiric Northstar, alive, to the custody of Brother Arikel Callistrae, Brother Aganerral Pardus, or Sister Laoke Spiritweaver. He is a thief and a traitor, and should be considered quite dangerous. He has been known to travel with an eldery barbarian man of unknown identity. Cimmiric is a former student of the Fist of the Five Winds; please use caution when approaching or apprehending him, as he needs no weapon to defend himself and possibly take another's life.<br />
<br />
*Below the text are drawings of both men; the drawing of Cimmiric is very detailed and realistic, while that of the barbarian is not so detailed. Each picture has the word &quot;WANTED&quot; below it.*</div></div><hr />
