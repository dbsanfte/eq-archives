<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mayteira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Attention all those cast out from society, for deeds unspeakable and crimes so unforgivable that even your dark bretheren shun you. I offer you a brotherhood made up of such like you.  Non shall ask of your past, nor would you be condemed if it were know. Only one thing I ask of you, to be willing to work for anyone for a price. This shall be a brotherhood of mercenaries, and we shall be like brothers, protecting eachother from all others.  You will owe no one, not even gods allegience, but you cannot betray your brothers, for you will be punished for that and only that.  If you would like to be apart of this please inform me here or if you happen to see me in your town.<br />

/ooc  I have tried many RP guilds, and to me they do not roleplay enough.  I would like to start my own guild.  The basis is off a series and anybody who reconizes the title of this post knows what I am talking about. The guils would be a mercenary guild. We would be hired for anything for the right amount.  We would accept all evil characters, and every one must have a background. It is not nessasary to tell us this backgraound, but your character must  throw out hints and clues and have a behavior that fits with their background.  Any non-evil races must do this especially well.  This is very demanding  and probably won't work, but I want to try.<br />
<br />
Please if you would like to help make this guild possible post here or send me an email at mystful@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
