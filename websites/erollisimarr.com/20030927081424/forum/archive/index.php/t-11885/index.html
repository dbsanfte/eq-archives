Many lives were sacrificed in getting this note in our hands...<br />

As dicussed in the meeting held last eve, in The Third Gate, many of the communinty are still outraged with the opening of our gates to the Trolls. I for one, am in full favor of this as it only strengthens our forces.<br />
<br />
Recent developments have arisen that have widened the rift between Teir'Dal for and against. Mainly the dwindling supply of food and fresh game. True that the addition of the Troll population has seriously effected food supplies, we need to find a way to support all that now make Neriak their home. Not just point fingers and toss our friends and allies to the forest.<br />
<br />
My Family has constructed a plan to answer the growing need for food here in Neriak. There are  remote farms in the Karanas. These farms provide enough food through the spring and summer to feed all of Neriak.<br />
These farms are far from the reach of Antonious Bale. Even if he was to attempt to protect them he couldn't begin to drag a reasonable force that far from Qeynos without risking the cities safety.<br />
<br />
The Darkness will sweep into the Karanas and solve to problem with food supplies. I leave the other matters of our city in your hands.<br />

This evil clan has to be stopped. Is there no one left to stand in the way of Darkness? This clan has stormed the gates of Qeynos in the past and I know they have no fear of Bale.<br />
<br />
Knights of the Holy Storm? Circle of Dreams? Legion of Kithakor? Holy Guard?  <br />
Someone has to stop them...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not personally sure I can Welcome these Trolls With Open Arms, When Venturing into my Home of Neriak Yesterday, I stumbled across something very unsettling to me.  There are Rodents in our City now,  after years of being inhabbited by Dark Elves mainly with a few Ogres and Trolls here and there, it now seems since inviting the Trolls in more numbers, our Food supplies are dwindling now and they have brought rodents with them.<br />
<br />
Not sure about how any of my other Dark Brothers and Sisters feel but I dont like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As much as I would wish a plague on Neriak, there are rodents in most, if not all Antonican cities these days.  Sadly, as adventurers spend greater portions of their time far from home, the cities fall into disrepair.<br />
<br />
That said, you have my offer to help rid Neriak of rodents.  I hear people have had good results with fire-bombing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
The worst of the rodents in Neriak walk on two legs and not four.<br />
I have exterminated some of them before, and will do so again in the future.  <br />
<br />
If the Teir`dal do not have enough food to feed themselves, it is only because the Tribunal has judged them unworthy.  Repent your evil ways or die hungry with trolls nibbling on your softer parts.<br />
<br />
Keep your thieving kind away from the produce of the hard-working farmers of the Karanas or you shall find yourselves on the receiving end of a Justice harsher than your worse nightmares.<br />

How will you know whether we have been there or not?  Your minds are so easily clouded and confused.  Is what you see really what you think it is?  Could that chair be something other than a chair?<br />
<br />
Foolish barbarian.  Neriak will take what it will.  You can do nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have you seen the damage a careless barbarian can do to the furniture?  If I were you, I'd consider myself safer on the battlefield than in the way of a wayward club.</div></div><hr />

This from a puny sniveling cleric who depends on a god for power.  Neriak's power is greater than you can know, and not all of us are so weak that we must whine to gods for strength.<br />
<br />
You will know our power when you find yourself in battle with the mighty Grummus with no fellows around you.  And you will have no idea how you got there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kalrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So the priests of Neriak &quot;whine&quot; to Innoruuk for strength?  If that's the case it's a wonder that he hasn't cleansed Neriak of its weakness already.<br />
<br />
I chose to be a cleric of Bristlebane to spread his message to the less enlightened.  Its not my fault you don't get the joke.</div></div><hr />
