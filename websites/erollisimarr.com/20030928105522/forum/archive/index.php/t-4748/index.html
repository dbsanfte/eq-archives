<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BanishofInnoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today like most days, Acuse, son of Acurse Dsoul, was with his hoodlum friends, that called themselves rogues. He knew that his father and the rest of the family-Dsoul did not approve of them or his aquainting himself with them. But the thrill of theft was always on his mind.<br />
<br />
Daily, one of the gang would challenge another to sneak into the Halfling village in Nektolus Forest and lift a trinket or a Leatherfoot cap from the pasty invaiders. Today it was Acuse that was challenged. He had been practicing on his neighbors in The Third Gate and had never been caught. This was different, if he was seen, the Leatherfoot Deputy would surely kill him.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Gang was nearing the path, close to the passage to East Commons, Acuse sporting his new cap. When they heard a cry from the shadows, of the dimmly lit forest. It was a teen-age Teir'dal, like themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help! Help!..&quot; he gasped. &quot; The Knights are right behind me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Acuse caught him, as he fell into the group. He was battered and bleeding, dressed in what looked like a Human peasants tunic. <br />
Thru the trees they could hear metal amror, clanking. Then a torches light flashed over a rise and two Knights came into view. <br />
<br />
&quot;Grenexx!..You cannot run from the Holy Storm!&quot; one shouted.<br />
<br />
Terror struck the Teir'Dals. Franticly scrambling onto the path, they were off. The Knights were close behind as they neared the bridge.<br />
Acuse knew that they would be safe on the far side of the bridge, as the mighty Bridge Guards had never been defeated, in his lifetime. He was young still though and had never seen Knights such as these.<br />
<br />
They rushed past the guards, and heard one shout &quot;Halt!, Infidels, Humans have no place here!&quot; The other shouted, &quot;You have ruined your own lands, You will not ruin ours !&quot;<br />
<br />
Acuse stopped at the far side of the bridge and turned just in time to see the Knights cut the first guard down. Terror again struck the gang, these Knights were the most skilled men they had ever seen. It was obvious that the other guard had no chance to stop them either.<br />
<br />
Over his shoulder,Acuse heard, &quot;You dare interfere with The Knights of The Holy Storm ?!!&quot;, as he again, was running for his life.<br />
<br />
He did not have to see the guard, to know he was brutally slain. He gave a blood-curdling cry, that Acuse could never have even imagined, as he died.<br />
<br />
&quot;No where is safe! Inkies!...The Holy Storm is upon you!&quot; the knight shouted.<br />
<br />
Out of breath and driven only by sheer terror, they ran. Dashing past the Guards to the city and they never looked back.<br />
<br />
Once in the Foreign Quarter, the rogues all sprinted in different directions, leaving Acuse standing before the cold stone walls, with Grenexx under one arm. He knew that his Aunt, Banish Dsoul could help, if anyone could.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Acuse finally felt safe, as he slammed the door to the House of Dsoul.<br />
Instantly catching the attention of everyone home.<br />
<br />
With a few words, Banish waived her hand and Grenexx was healed ..refreshed and breathing freely again. <br />
<br />
He sat up quickly and shouted &quot;You all are in terrible danger!&quot;... &quot;They will stop at nothing to get me back to the Keep!<br />
I am the only one that can break the curse that has been cast upon them..&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I am connected to it by magic that I can not understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you speak of, young one?&quot; Banish inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Knights of The Holy Storm !&quot; He cried.<br />
<br />
Acuse had never seen his aunt, look so conserned.<br />
 <br />
&quot;If I know the Knights, they will not stop at the front gates..We have little time to prepare..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bolt the door behind me ..and arm yourselves!&quot; She ordered. She grabbed her cloak and rushed out through arches towards the Captain of the Guard's quarters.<br />
 <br />
&quot;By bringing this child here, you may have started a WAR!&quot; Her words echoed in the courtyard. &quot;WAR!..War..war...<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
  The Children of Darkness and The Knights of the Holy Storm will be at war. Travelers beware..!<br />
<br />
All of Norrath could be the battlefield....<br />
<br />
&quot;Storm clouds gather...An eery Darkness looms... The Children step from the Shadows...&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BanishofInnoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My messengers have arrived just in time.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;The Knights have left their cursed Keep and have boarded a ship sailing towards Freeport.&quot; The weathered fisherman whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot; They come for Grenexx....&quot; I replied, tossing a gold piece on the table.<br />
<br />
The old sea dog, quickly snacthed it up and cautiously glanced around, to see if anyone saw the transaction.<br />
<br />
I turned and walked out of the filthy tavern, out onto the, rat infested, docks of East Freeport.<br />
<br />
With a wave of my hand, I was back in Neriak....<br />
Only one though on my mind...Today we go to WAR ...<br />
