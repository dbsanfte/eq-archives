<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sparemeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So today, I'm embarassed to say I was the victim of the good old &quot;the cash is on my main - I'll be right back&quot; routine.<br />
<br />
Was selling off an AMYGDALAN WAR STAFF ( that's right....kick me ) ...the buyer was, if memory serves, one &quot;Lithyat&quot;, unguilded - claimed her main was one &quot;Azurin&quot; of the Inner Circle of Norrath, but that info's probably dubious at best - particularly since there was also one &quot;Lithya&quot; standing very nearby - guilded, but I don't seem to recall with whom.<br />
<br />
Normally, I'd actually give a hoot about this sort of thing, but since I'm on my way out the door anyway, all I can say is &quot;good for you...enjoy&quot;.<br />
<br />
There you have it....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PhinderZkeeperz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure if that person is in ICoN or not. name doesn't look familiar, but I haven't been playing for awhile. I'll check on that tonight for you, and if they are the guilty party, I will see about getting this item returned to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
checked our guild roster, and that person does not appear on the list. Sorry bout your situation, I too have been scammed in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seanchans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Azurin is not nor has ever been a member of the Inner Circle of Norrath, as far as I know. But keep in mind we are a 200+ active member guild with probably nearly a 1000 different members over our 3+ year history, many of whom have had multiple alternates in the guild. That means we have had a few thousand names pass through our guild. Since we are primarily a social guild, you'll find a LOT of former ICoNers in the major raiding guilds today.<br />
<br />
I am sorry you were scammed. I will be the first to guildremove any guild member who is ever found to do such a thing to anyone. The foundation of our guild is quality. Quality people and quality rules of behavior. I view scammers as the bottom feeders of the cess pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zarthic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its Lithya and she is very sneaky. she promised a druid loot of his choice if he ported for a naggy raid. also its Azurin... there is an actual azurin, he is a frog warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sparemeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do we know if Lithya/Lithyat and Azurin are actually one and the same, or if she's just got it in for him? She seemed like she wanted to be REALLY sure I remembered the name Azurin before she camped out and failed to return, which looking back on it seems odd, like maybe she was trying to engineer a situation where I would keep a lookout for him and start hassling him when he showed up, while she sat in a corner snickering about the whole thing....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rawr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Sparemeister, i know who your talking about I meet this person once before in the bazaar.  The person wanted to buy something and said Azurin my main has the money, that if i gave her the item and let her log on her main she would give me the money.  Of course being me, My number ONE rule is MONEY UP FRONT.  Then I ran across her in person in the game, she was a barbarian with nothing on.  I don't remember the name of the characters name, but she tried to talk me into trading it for half of the money and then saying she would get on her main and give me the rest.  Of course being me, i said money up front.  Then she said nm. I was like ok.  <br />
<br />
Lesson to be learned people.....MONEY UP FRONT!<br />
If you need to buy something buy it on your main or get someone to transfer for you that you know well.  Don't accept offers like...oh ill log on my main, just give me the item and ill go get him/her.  I know there is a lot of good people on this server, but there is quite a bit of scammers/theifs/liers out there.<br />
<br />
Thats just my philosophy any ways.<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dirgrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know this may be a bit old, but could anyone verify that the name of this toon is Lithya that is running this scam?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sparemeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can't honestly say with one-HUNDRED percent certainty that Lithya was the offender, as the toon that actually dealt with me was  one &quot;Lithyat&quot; with a &quot;t&quot; on the end - however, when one considers that &quot;Lithyat&quot; was level 1 and nekkid, and &quot;Lithya&quot; (no &quot;t&quot;) was standing within arm's reach and staring blanky into space for the duration of the transactions, odds are better-than-average.<br />
<br />
My analysis of the situtation was that the person was a 2-boxer, with Azurin as main, Lithya as a twink on a second account, and Lithyat as a bazaar-mule on the main account, but again, all conjecture at this point, as Azurin has been conveniently unavailable for comment....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kyanion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can say with 100% accuracy, unlike the poster of this supposed scam. That Lithya is not some person to just scam someone. They are above level 50, and I've grouped with them on many times, and I know the persons relatives that play. I know this person would not be apt to pull some cheap scam.<br />
<br />
<br />
To the person that wrote this, Get the facts straight before tossing around names. Just dragging someones name across the mud because you got cheated, and frankly falling for a scam that lame is pretty bad. But you just need to calm down, make a log next time, or write down the names involved, so you can accuratly post them. I dont know about this other l char, or the guy suppsedly in icon. But please dont drag Lithya into this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sparemeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Easy there chief - I said myself I'm not 100% certain, just thought that getting scammed by somebody named &quot;Lithyat&quot; with somebody named &quot;Lithya&quot; standing around idle within arm's reach is too interesting a coincidence not to mention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LithyaVI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First of all  this is Lithya, as said before if you not 100% sure that i did plz do not post against i had no clue about nothing till a guild officer  /t me about this. now this was a complete surprise to me i would never do anything like that i was framed by someone which is completly disgusting, but however if you guys seem different about it then plz i am not pushing thoguhts into any of your heads.<br />
<br />
Now to the person thinkin i being sneaky in the bazaar you can ask any of my friends  if i could spend all the day  in the bazaar and still lvl i would its my home i enjoy watching really good items go by hoping some day  i can afford them. Half the time i am sitting there staring in to space where else do i go unless i am buying something right?? right so plz before blaming someone get facts straight how about you petition about this you might get your real criminal.<br />
<br />
Ty)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sparemeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Honestly, it's dang nice to actually hear from YOU on this - I don't think I've actually out-and-out accused YOU of being the perpetrator at any point here - just stating what I experienced and how it looked from my end...any connections between yourself the perpetrator, &quot;Lithyat&quot; who ripped me off are, as I've said, pure conjecture.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd just like to say that I think if anybody is REALLY responsible for any damage to reputations here, it's not so much ME as whoever it was that walked off with a 35K item of mine using a knock-off of your name and right under your nose. I just HOPE you find that at least half as disturbing as I do....<br />
<br />
Sorry for any inconvenience, and may whoever has the staff now find themselves sitting on it in the most uncomfortable way conceivable....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LithyaVI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If i may  add one more thing trust me i am just as POed as you are at this guy i hope you find him and can give him  a ear-full<br />
<br />
<br />
GL on your journeys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sparemeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Believe me, I've added both &quot;Lithyat&quot; and &quot;Azurin&quot; to my friends list so I can keep an eye out for 'em, and have seen neither since....  =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dazzler Twodirks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmm now is THIS strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jinamena&quot; tried to pull the same scam on me in Bazaar a month ago.<br />
Nekid barbarian anon of course.<br />
<br />
&quot;You give me the Bracelet of Quickness and i'll log in AZURIN my high level main and give you 14k pp.&quot;<br />
<br />
She ALMOST got away with it too.<br />
<br />
Claimed she was linkdead and popped on Azurin and noticed she didn't have enough cash and returned  the bracelet.<br />
<br />
Funnier still i kept doing /who Azurin all and that char NEVER LOGGED IN.<br />
<br />
If i hadn't let the Bazaar know i was one of the players that helped Verant now SOE with debugging and could have asked a GM to track that account and BAN it post haste she might not have jumped back on that fast and return it after.<br />
<br />
Appearently this person has a mule in the Bazaar that is being used as a fence to offload the stolen goods.<br />
<br />
Someone should find Azurin and let him know his rep is being destroyed like this.<br />
<br />
I'm going to send an email to my dev team contacts for them to pass on to CS reps so we can have these chars tracked and finally banned.<br />
<br />
Even a deleted char leaves a name mark on an account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kiliara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Um, regardless of your &quot;friends&quot;, there is nothing to cause someone to be banned if they were given and item and the trade button was hit.  It sucks that they are going around ripping people off, but handing a stranger a valuable item with no recompense isn't exactly a wise course of action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sparemeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So, does anybody actually known a character named &quot;Azurin&quot; to exist? just a point of curiosity...<br />
<br />
On an extreme tangent:<br />
I played a game a while back called Planescape: Torment, in which the toon you controlled was a sort of immortal with a persistent case of amnesia...occasionally in conversations, somebody would ask you who you were, and though you had no idea, one of your options was always to lie and give them a made-up name, &quot;Adahn&quot;. If you were to perpetually pass yourself off as the fictional &quot;Adahn&quot;, community's belief in the existence of said individual would eventually cause him to manifest out of thin air, hunt you down, and call you on it. Best to just apologize and let him go back to being a figment of the imagination. A thing of beauty.</div></div><hr />
