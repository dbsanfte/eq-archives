<br />
Perhaps there is a new Shrubs, and Tumyeto is trying to stress that this is not him?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fvisker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I recently had an encounter with Shrubs, here is the low down.  I was going to buy an item from him (cant remember what), but the value of it was about 3k, and his selling price was 2k.  He said that he had the item on an alt parked in EC also.  He said he had to have the cash on Shrubs though and he would give me the item with his alt (which he gave me the name).  Smelling a scam, I demanded he give me the item first then I would give him the money.  I told him I was level 54, in a reputable guild and I would even yell to the zone that I promised to pay if he like.  Well he said ok and then said he would log to his alt.<br />
<br />
He never came back.  I saw the name of the alt he told me, and asked what was up.  This person had no idea what I was talking about, so I am sure it was a scam at that point, but glad I didn't fall for it.  I shouted to the whole zone, my guild and auction channel that Shrubs = Scammer, so hopefully everyone will know now.<br />
