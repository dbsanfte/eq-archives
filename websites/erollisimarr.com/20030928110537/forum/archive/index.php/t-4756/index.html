<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Breetai Tull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Iffn i must tell ye  then here tis...(<br />
First off, i need no be explainin meself ta any of ye.<br />
Who i choose as me friends innt any of yer consern. <br />
....<br />
AYE! Aye he was a damned lizard i was seen with.<br />
And a damned good one he is...bett'r'n any o you beer drinking stay at home mommies....hell ive not seen but 4 or 5 o ye ever past halas main gate! where were ye went i were gettin the beatin of me life as a wee lad of 16 years by the damned goblins?!!<br />
<br />
anyway here is the story ye want...ye wanna know how and ye wanna know why ..well here it goes...aye im telling it now get of me back...and give me annuder frost ale for i shrink yer head and make ye grow a tail.... yeah ye cringed back on that didnt ye... ye know ive grown out of yer bullin reach aye?<br />
<br />
well here is yer damned story to tell at the camp about how breetai is a crazy one<br />
<br />
i was far off inta the lands o that blasted kunark. i was passin a lake i was and the i seen the mountins and was gonta climb em a bit ta see iffn it got a bit cooler....the blasted heat there enough ta choke a goat i tell ye....well along me way i see one uglt bastard sarnak...and this one had the necklace o a shaman he did...so i decided i was gonta have to clear gim outta norrath...i followed him fer a bit til he stopped....i was gonta get him then but i see's he is watching something...another damned lizard...but this one is one of nasty kinds...them icksoars...ye know the ones wit the houses there...the ones were at war with ye damned idiots....ok so this sarmak is lookin at him like he is a beefstick and i realize...im not gonna let this sarnak kill the lizard....im gonna kill and eat that lizard meself! so then the sarnak goes in fer the kill abd that damned lizard was fast he and that sarnak start going head to head like they was barbarians i tell ye....but that damned lizard was one up on the sarnak and he takes and cuts its damned arm off...then i finds out why the sarnak was wearing that necklace...he is soem sort of idiot shaman can cast like the damned gobbies in permafrost... he poisoned that lizard something fierce in seconds...but not before that scaley bastard lizard took his head off. ok so now i decide to go in for the lizard and get his tail offa him so i can start supper...he was weak after that fight and was just layin there stinkin of poison and disease....so i sit next to him and poke him a bit and he puts his head up...weak like....and stares at me with those dumb eyes....then i realize i cant eat this stinkin lizard.....cause the sarnak went and poisoned the meat....so im about to just crush his head when out the blue a god damned kunark goblin jumps on me head! and lemme tell ye these boys aint like the goblins round these parts....these boys are fast...dorty lil bastard dungeater they are...he caught me off guard and knocked me cold on me face and then his whole damned clan shows up...30 goblins i tell ye...maybe 50....i gotta think fast so i call jobn, me wolf compainion from the spirit realm, to me side....well you know that wolf he just laid into em like no tomorrow while i start calling for a rain of the poison ...HA that made them goblins take a few steps back....i knew i didnt have long before they decided to come get me though...but no way does Breetai run from a goblin....then i hear from the ground the strangest accent i ever did hear...that god damned lizard was speakin to me....and not in the common ...i mean he was speakin barbarian tongue ...he said<br />
and ill always remember &quot; god damned goblins smell worse then barbarians&quot;...well i bout pissed me totem plated drawers at that but then he says &quot; you and me and get out of this alive pink man...or we can die to goblins&quot;<br />
<br />
well i know that the poison storm is gonna die down anytime and me dog was covered with the goblins anyway so i figures ill use this lizard to distract em then ill get em all after they are a lil seperated.....im a brave one aye but wise too....so i throw the lizard one of me anti venom jars and i didn even know offn he had the right make up for it to work fer him but i guess it did cause he took a sip and was up in seconds....and god damned if yer cuts werent healin soon as that poison was knocked out....then the poison storm faded<br />
<br />
<br />
NEVER has there been a more glorious battle<br />
<br />
he fought like 5 of you fat bastards<br />
and i decided i best stay on his friendly side least til the goblins were done for.....he was cutting goblin arms off then using em to beat the armless goblin over the head...i seen him do it.....i decided to make it a wee bit colder and asked the spirits for help...well i got the help i beeded and i was holdin a blizzard in me fist and giving the goblins a lil take of everfrost...now the 30 goblins turn to 15 then 10 then i can only count 3 or so still dumb enough to not see thier buddies dead or ran.....but i couldnt hold the blizzard a minute longer and right when it fades i see one goblin just throw his axe at me and i tell ye it was headed fer me one good eye...then that iksar jumps chest forst in front of it and takes in the gut...woulda killed any man i ever seen but he pulls it oh with a grimace...seems like they always grimace...and throws it back at that goblin and  takes his head clean off....well the other 2 go to run and me pet jobn takes care of them in short order....they always expose their backs.....now its just me and this damned lizard and i see that gut wound is gone already<br />
<br />
i aint got a thing left in me and before i try and call the blizzard i better let me body rest or im apt to just crack in 2<br />
<br />
so that means im gonna have to stab the hell outta this lizard or run...and Breetai doesnt run<br />
<br />
then he does something i ne'er woulda expected<br />
<br />
he salutes me and pets me dog<br />
<br />
well i know ye all think that im wrong but iffn a damned spirit wolf thought he was ok enough to let him scratch hos ear then that was enough for me<br />
<br />
BAH ye all are looking at me like ive gone mad....well yer all unseein fools ye are<br />
<br />
truth be told yer all still fumin cause when ye attacked him while we were  headed to permafrost he had ye on a 10 count and only reason he didnt kill yers was on accounta i asked him not ta. <br />
<br />
but ye all needed a lil time on yer rumps i think<br />
<br />
tis not all about yer ideas of good and evils.<br />
there are things out in the world ye dont see with the naked eye there are things stronger then tradition...<br />
there is justice<br />
its no so clean cut and ye dont understand me or why i didnt learn to use a sword so why am i talkin to ye anyway<br />
bunch of apes ye are sometimes....now here are yer potions i made as per yer request and before ye ask aye there is a load of anti-ale in there so drink all ye want of yer beers then take a sip before yer patrol and yer right as rain<br />
<br />
oh great someone fell down the well again. i can hear  the splashin from outside...get the damned rope so we can fish him out ore he freezes to death</div></div><hr />
