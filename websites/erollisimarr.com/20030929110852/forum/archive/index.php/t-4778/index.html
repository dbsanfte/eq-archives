<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kinzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OOC: This is the beginning of a plot The Cimmerii had with the KHS a long long time ago that resulted in Eltherion becoming a ghost, Setis and Laocoon going mad, and Arikel becoming a bad monk. (bad monk, bad monk, whatcha gonna do). Well...Arikel was always a bad monk, he turned evil. ;) <br />
J/K Ari.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cimmerii congregated inside the Temple that honored Innoruuk. Gathering quietly, each member looked at the others, they were all steadfast in their desire. They were about to commit an unholy ceremony, an ancient rite long since dead, revived by a vision and spread amongst Innoruuk’s most faithful followers. With a shared look the ritual began. <br />
<br />
The members of The Semai approached the Altar of Desecration, a large jet-black tome in hand. Ceremoniously, they set the massive book on the Altar and whispered a prayer. This was The Tome of Hate, the Bible of Innoruuk. The midnight runes warded the Temple from those that dared to bring harm. The Ritual would not be disturbed, powerful magiks of a God shielded their work from the eyes of mortals. <br />
<br />
Next, the soldiers of The Bloody Hand walked to the Altar. With them they carried the shroud of a freshly slain specter, many of them still wore the wounds of the battle. They placed the robe on the Altar, each saying a prayer and took their positions next to The Semai. <br />
<br />
Finally, The Shield made their way to the Altar. They carried the final ingredient of their ritual. The Hate Stone. The Hate Stone was a key, a key to the Plane of Hate, a link between the mortal world and the splendor of Eternal Hate, the Home of Innoruuk. Setting it on the Altar, they said their prayers in turn and took their positions as well. <br />
<br />
With all the items in place, Archmage Tzimisce and his Semai brother, Shaile, began the incantations. The members of the Hand and the Shield prayed to Innoruuk, strengthening the bond between them and Innoruuk. <br />
A blue flame appeared above the Altar, slowly growing larger and deeper in hue. They knew if they were weak in their Hatred, they would not survive the Ritual. Such is the whim of Innoruuk. <br />
<br />
Those not pure in their Hatred must, and will, perish.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching a deep indigo color, the flame burst forth with a black light, a moan drifted from the flame, a sound more horrible than any death imaginable. <br />
<br />
It was the tormented scream of a thousand lives, it was the sound of pure Hatred. <br />
<br />
The Ritual was a succuss and Innoruuk had blessed The Cimmerii with His Hate. He had sent them The Harvester to help them with their vile and corrupt deeds. The Harvester was a void in the darkness, a pit of incomprehensible horror, a festering pool of evil and hatred. The dark form shifted slightly in the gloom, barely detectable. It opened its gaping maw in a silent scream as its form twisted in the candlelight. A mass of disfigured body parts and captured souls, The Harvester eyed its masters, hungry for their lives. The Hate of the members of The Cimmerii held The Harvester away, for they were Pure in their Hate, and no harm would come to them.<br />
<br />
The thoughts of his masters reached the “mind” of The Harvester; evil deeds, cruel and wicked.<br />
<br />
Others, yes, he would feed on others. <br />
<br />
“You know your duty . . . Go!” the Archmage ordered. <br />
<br />
The apparition shifted slightly and disappeared into the dead of the night seeking its prey, hungry for their souls.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinzix<br />
a.k.a.<br />
Krual Haytebreenur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The howling wind blew through the trees as the moonlight reflected off the Storm Keep moat. The guards stood their duty the same as any night, however, these past nights were different from the rest. The sounds. The feel. The air was alive, but somehow...it wasn't. <br />
<br />
The guards were unaware of what hellish demons lay awake, what horde of corruption rested in the shadows. HE was upon them. The plague, the reaper, the unholy champion of Innoruuk. HE was the Harvester of Souls and HE had come to seek his prizes. <br />
<br />
Like a chill the Harvester crawled into the safety of Storm Keep, detected only by the shivers that were passed off as drafts. Deep into Strom Keep HE went. Searching. Looking. HE had touched the ones HE seeked before. A matter of time til the madness sets in forever. From Pure to Soiled to Unholy Pure they will be. <br />
<br />
In the lowest reaches of Storm Keep, the Harvester found one of his prizes. He layed there, slowly breathing, his fists white knuckeled from the strain. His jaw was clenched in a deathlock, a stern look of discontent upon his brow. Setis layed there, sleeping, but what haunted him while he was awake had followed him into his slumber. <br />
<br />
The Harvester approached the sleeping man, its ever shifting form enveloping the cell. <br />
<br />
The Harvester spoke in a low painful moan, &gt;&gt;sseettiiss&gt;sseettiiss...hhhaaattteee...pppoowwweeerrr..ssseettiisss....hhhaaattteee&gt;pppoowweerr wwwee ggiivvee ssseettiisss, ppoowweerrr wwee ggiivvee&gt;ssseettiiisss&lt;&lt;&quot; the Harvester wailed repeatedly. <br />
<br />
Setis slumped to the floor, a broken man, his training and strength had left him. The Harvester approached the figure, enveloping him in its inky darkness, surrounding him. Setis closed his eyes and prayed for a quick and merciful death, anything than to be the plaything to this demonspawn of Innoruuk. <br />
<br />
Setis cracked his eyes and peered at himself. Was he going mad! He was slowing evaporating! Thoughts raced through his mind faster than a spirited druid. Merciful Gods, I'm being disintegrated! Frantically Setis tried to free himself from the wraithlike prison of the Harvester. Try as he might, Setis was trapped. Head hung low, Setis accepted his fate like a man, a soldier, a leader.<br />
<br />
The last thing he saw was the image of a giant hand as he lost control of his mind. <br />
<br />
Scrambling to his feet Setis looked about his surroundings. Where on Norrath was he? His head ached and his body was sore, but he was free. Free from the damnable cell. Out of the corner of Setis's eye he saw a flash of movement. Quickly he turned to face his guest. The Harvester stood before him again, but this time Setis did not shrink away. <br />
The Harvester floated towards Setis, disfigured limbs flailing blindly, its grotesque maw open in a silent scream. Suddenly, Setis laughed. Not a laugh of merriment or joy, but a sinister laugh. &quot;The Harvester is right!&quot; Setis thought, &quot;It speaks to me!&quot; Setis listened to the mute spectre's telepathic words, his mind dissolving the abominations commands. An evil sneer spread across Setis's chisled features, distorting them. <br />
<br />
With one last motion the Harvester of Souls disappeared, vanishing from sight. Setis turned to journey to his final destination, but found himself being watched by a familiar face. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do we have here! A spy!&quot; Setis exclaimed, a evil smile on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Setis&quot;, the dark elf female said,&quot; I've waited for this day to come.&quot; <br />
<br />
Setis reached over and grabbed Nallae by the arms and drew her close. He breathed her in. Ah, she smelled of battle, of a fresh kill, of a fighter. The scent drove Setis insane, he felt a thirst that could not be quenched. <br />
Setis gazed hard into Nallae's eyes, the coldness reflecting off of his. <br />
&quot;Let us be gone of this place, to one more . . . comfortable&quot;, he said flatly as he led her from the clearing and into the darkening night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Laocoon sat in the corner of the room, staring blankly at a spider that had started to build it’s home there.<br />
<br />
“Muffins, muffins,” he grumbled to the spider. <br />
“Muffins everywhere. Muffins coming to get me.”<br />
<br />
He glared at the spider, expecting a response.<br />
“Ahh!,” he screamed, “You’re a muffin too!.”<br />
<br />
Lao ran about the room whipping his arms around without thought. He picked up at chair and threw it into the corner with the silent spider. The chair broke with a crash, missing the spider easily, which quickly retreated out of sight.<br />
<br />
“MUFFINS!” Laocoon yelled at the top of his lungs. “MUFFINS!” <br />
<br />
Outside his door there was a commotion. “Sir, are you alright?”<br />
<br />
Laocoon ran into the door, using his head as a battering ram. “Muffins!” he chanted as his head thudded against the reinforced oak door.<br />
<br />
The guards mumbled to each other, discussing whether they should let him pass out or stop him before he severely hurts himself.<br />
<br />
“When he passes out, he will be safe. We leave it at that,” a guard suggested. <br />
<br />
Laocoon continued to beat upon the door, ranting and screaming. <br />
<br />
“&gt;&gt;mmmaaalllkkkkaaaavvvv&lt;&lt;” a voice moaned.<br />
<br />
Laocoon stopped his assault on the door and turned to face the voice. He stood there, an expressionless look on his face. His pupils were dilated to pinpoints, and drool started to leak from his open mouth as he slowly made a gurgling sound. <br />
<br />
With one warped hand, The Harvester reached into Laocoon’s head and invaded his mind feeding him images, thoughts, and commands. <br />
<br />
Laocoon stood at the entrance to Halas, the cold wind biting at his tanned skin. He paid it no mind, he had a cloak. <br />
<br />
“Warm,” he said like a child as he pulled the cloak around his bare shoulders. <br />
<br />
Laocoon stepped through the gates to Halas and marveled at what he saw. Halas had been violated. A group of children ran along playing. The children, horrible disfigured and scarred, were bouncing the head of a dog in the street, laugh and joking. The trees bore no leaves or needles, they were bare, except for the countless boils that bulges with a sickly unknown fluid. The walls and streets writhed, alive with floundering human parts and gasping human faces. Corpses laid in the streets, some rotting and crawling with maggots, others freshly deposited. Laocoon ripped off an arm of a nearby cadaver and tossed it to the group of children. Amused, they began using the arm as a stick and batted the bloodied head around. With every step Laocoon took inside Halas, the world he saw shifted. What was once there, would be gone in an instant, only to appear again in a slightly different location. <br />
<br />
A faceless little girl approached Laocoon, a gift in her 3 fingered hand, offering it to Laocoon. He stared in amazement at the object. It was a cookie, decorated to resemble Laocoon. He reached out for the cookie, but the girl vanished from his sight. <br />
<br />
Laocoon laughed, totally delirious. <br />
He liked games now. <br />
He liked these fun games. <br />
<br />
“Seek out the muffins I must. Never forget the muffins!” he yelled at the misshapen villagers of Halas. <br />
<br />
Quickly, he retreated from the town, cursing muffins as he went.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kinzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slowly HE drifted through the darkness...searching. Searching for the ones HE had tainted not too long ago. He had found two of them with relative ease, but the last two were difficult, much more difficult. <br />
<br />
This one is of strong spirit, The Harvester thought to himself. Focused he is. Ah, but young. Young and eager to make hs mark on the world. Yes, make a mark he shall...a scar he will etch into the lives of his loved ones. The Harvester's hideous mouth curled into a cruel sneer. Sensing his target, the Harvester made his way towards Lake Rathetear. <br />
<br />
Arikel and Zariel were sparring in the Arena, Arikel teaching his little sister the proper technique of the &quot;Eagle Strike&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Zariel. Arch your hand like this!&quot; Arikel yelled.<br />
&quot;Ari, I'm trying,&quot; Zariel said, defending herself.<br />
&quot;Try it again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zariel took her stance and in one blindingly quick movement, performed the manuever.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did it, Ari!&quot; she shouted with glee.<br />
<br />
Arikel didn't look impressed, &quot;I expect nothing less Zariel, from a monk and from my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
The joy in Zariel's face faded. &quot;Ari...&quot;<br />
<br />
A cold chill shook the two monks bodies making the hair on their arms stand on end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you feel that Ari?&quot; Zariel asked with a shiver.<br />
<br />
Arikel glared at her. &quot;A monk must remain focused from the inconviences of the outside world Zariel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ari, what's wro..&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;FOCUS!&quot; Arikel shouted. <br />
&quot;We must be stronger than our enemies, stronger then our friends!&quot; <br />
Arikel circled his sister as he spoke. &quot;The elves, the dwarves, the gnomes, the halflings, all of them lack the discipline that we have! Where they have failed, we have strived! We've spread across Norrath uniting the good races, while they were busy argueing. We are what's right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zariel was stunned, why was her brother so angry? <br />
&quot;Arikel, they are our friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends! They care NOTHING for us!&quot; Arikel exploded. <br />
&quot;They are weak, they need us to survive Zariel! We are the power!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you're wrong, acting together has made our races strive.&quot; she meekly replied.<br />
<br />
Arikel's face went red with rage, his hands balling up into fists as he approached his sibling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dare stand to correct me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zariel backed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have tried to teach you the way. I have been patient up until now.&quot; A dark light flashed in Arikel's eyes. &quot;I will not guide you through life anymore, Zariel&quot;, he said flatly as he started to exit the arena. &quot;You're on your own now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zariel stood there, bewildered at what had happened in an instant. She slumped to the ground as her brother stormed out of the arena.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; she thought. &quot;Setis and Laocoon have gone mad, Eltherion has died, and now my brother has been changed.&quot;<br />
Zariel laid on the arena floor, trying to hold together her world as it crumbled apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kinzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As pleased as any hate-filled being could be, the Harvester made his way back the Storm Keep. His final prize awaited him in sleep. This final one would be the shining jewel in Innoruuk's twisted crown of souls. Quickly, he swept across the land. <br />
<br />
As easily as before, the Harvester stole his way into Storm Keep. The mortals, the felt so secure behind their walls and defenses. How foolish of them, how could they stop the tidal wave of Hate? Soon, soon they will drown in pools of their own sorrow. <br />
<br />
The Harvester made his way to Eltherion and Shaz's chamber. The Harvester could feel the hate inside Shaz, regardless of the amount, it drew HIM to her. As easily as breeze blowing through the trees, the Harvester slipped into their chambers. <br />
<br />
Shaz laid sleeping soundly in the large bed, Eltherion sitting by her side. Eltherion looked up from his sleeping wife, rage and justice flaring in his eyes. He stood up defiantly and took postition against he unholy intruder. The Harvester's body grew to enfold Eltherion and Shaz, ready to absorb their life force, to create slaves from them, to bring them pain. <br />
<br />
A blood-curdling scream pierced the dead of the night, but not from Shaz or Eltheion. It was the Harvester that was screaming. A soft glow radiated from Eltherion, causing the Harvester to retreat a few steps. Enraged, the Harvester howled in confusion and frustration. Shaz shifted in her sleep. <br />
<br />
How could this mere mortal stand against HIM, an immortal, a daemon, Innoruuk's choosen one? <br />
<br />
Eltherion spoke, conviction ringing clear in his voice,&quot; Foul demonseed, begone from my sight! Her you can not have, will not have! I swear by Tunare you will not take this one!&quot; <br />
<br />
The Harvester, hate glaring in its soulless eyes, lurched for Eltherion. Eltherion slowly closed his eyes, the glow that surrounded him, brightened, washing the walls with a bright blue light. <br />
The Harvester recoiled, NO! The figure, it was HER! Curse this infernal being he had summoned HER! Sensing defeat, the Harvester fled from the chamber, disappearing into the blackness of the night. <br />
<br />
Eltherion went back and sat by his sleeping wife's side, staring lovingly at her slumbering form. <br />
Stirring from sleep, Shaz woke. <br />
&quot;Eltherion,&quot; she whispered. <br />
As she had done a million times before, she reached out for Eltherion as he laid beside her. Her hand passed through Eltherion's form, touching nothing but an empty spot where Eltherion should be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eltherion,&quot; she whispered again, tears brimming in her eyes. Shaz slowly cried herself back to sleep as Eltherion watched from her side. <br />
<br />
Eltherion put his hand on her head, stroking her flowing hair. &quot;Sleep love, no harm will befall you this night. Not now, not ever again, I swear as Tunare as my witness.&quot;</div></div><hr />
