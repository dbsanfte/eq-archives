		<div>--Chapter 5 The “Story” in “History” <br />
<br />
Relik's eyes slowly slid open and around him was darkness. He could tell he was on a boat from the constant swaying and the sound of the waters rushing against the hull. How did he get here? The last thing he remembered were those people in the towns... in a hasty sweat Relik shouted at the top of his lungs. <br />
<br />
&quot;ARE THE PEOPLE SAFE? ARE THEY SAFE?&quot; <br />
<br />
Relik attempted to leap out of his bed but all of his muscles seemed to have locked and every bone in his body creaked and ached. Those people, he was there and he couldn't stop them from dying. He was JUST there, how did he get on this boat? He MUST get back to help those people! <br />
<br />
Relik struggled against his pains to try and get up but a few people who had heard his shouts came in to restrain him. Some men who appeared to be ship hands pressed against him to hold him down as two elven women walked towards him speaking in an unknown tongue, even the ship hands were shouting in a language he wasn't familiar with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you and what has happened to those people? What has happened to the world?&quot; The red haired wood elf looked as confused as the very regal high elf. They looked familiar but so out of place in his memories. They looked like he had not met them before but he was supposed to sometime in his future. They exchanged glances at each other and tried to speak to him but all Relik heard was babble. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you understand me? Speak common!&quot; he said to them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Relik...&quot; he heard his name, how did they know his name. <br />
&quot;Speak.&quot; he recognized that word, and then some more words. <br />
&quot;Understand.. ancient tongue.. ages long ago&quot; He understood those words. They continued to speak to him slowly. <br />
&quot;Battle.. Dark elf.. magic..&quot; those words, what battle? What magic? <br />
<br />
Memory crashed into him like a tidal wave. He remembered them now; he remembered that he had been with these people for a week now: beautiful Nasu, Lady Erissa, and the deckhands Jonah and Maddick. He remembered the Dark Elven woman that he had fought, he remembered everything. The towns and people dying seemed a distant memory now. He gaped at Nasu and Erissa. <br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; he said, startling them.<br />
<br />
Erissa tried to gather herself quickly; she did not look like someone who liked being surprised. The ship hands rose slowly, realizing that Relik no longer struggled against them. After a moment of hesitation Erissa nodded to them and they departed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nasu, I must speak to Relik alone,” said Erissa quietly. <br />
<br />
Relik didn't want Nasu to leave, her presence felt comforting. Nasu stared back into his eyes as if unsure of what she was seeing and left with a small frown on her face. <br />
<br />
Erissa seemed to glide across the room as she sat down on the bed near Relik’s legs. She gave him a smile and the worried look that had been on her face before washed away. <br />
<br />
&quot;You had quite the day yesterday, how are you feeling?&quot; she asked. His bones ached again as she reminded him of his pains. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very sore, I can feel every bone in my body ache.&quot; As he replied Lady Erissa laid her hands upon him and chanted words in Elvish tongue. A cool chill tingled through his body that originated from where her hands touched his legs. He felt the aches being pushed out of his body through his fingertips and quickly they were gone. Erissa opened her eyes to speak again. <br />
<br />
&quot;What I saw yesterday was something that I would have never expected. I trust you remember everything now?&quot; he nodded and she continued &quot;That kind of magic has not touched Norrath in over a thousand years if it is what I think it is. There is a little known piece of Barbarian history that you may not know about Relik because early Barbarian culture was never written in any books and most of your race chose to dismiss this part of history for mere fiction. I'm not too sure of many details but there was rumor among books that a Barbarian tribe long ago discovered a hidden magic that ebbed and flowed from the very ices of Antonica. This rumor says that the line that found this magic went in to seclusion and told their women to have no more children. They eventually died out without sharing what they had found with any other being outside of their tribe. My ancestors had tried to find out what they were trying to hide but came to nothing. I think you may be a descendant from that line but it is too early to tell. I must research more about it in our great library in Felwithe.&quot; <br />
<br />
Relik sat wide-eyed, descendant from an ancient magic bloodline? That was almost hard to imagine, but then again, so was the fact of what he had done to that dark elf. Things were changing inside of him and he felt it in his blood, maybe it was true. But what about the images, what about the strange tongue that they were speaking? <br />
<br />
&quot;What of the strange language you were speaking? I couldn't understand you before you started speaking common again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Erissa looked befuddled &quot;My dear warrior it was you who was speaking strange tongues. Nasu and I never spoke a word of anything but common.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened? What was I saying?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not positive Relik, it is something I will have to look in to.&quot; Erissa stood up and politely nodded to Relik. &quot;I'm glad the healing finally worked on you but it took a lot of my strength for me to handle it. I must rest now and regain my strength. I suggest you do the same.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you my lady.&quot; said Relik as Erissa made her way out the door.</div>
