<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Githnaur Ainaroquen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The creature’s hot, stinking breath in his lungs, it’s snarls, and its teeth snapping at his face the Elf fought on with grim resolve. The footing here was bad. Weathered rock, caked in ice slippery as glass, no more a tended pathway, now a mesa of broken squares and weeds seeking escape from the hard packed earth underneath.<br />
<br />
Lunging to one side the dire wolf narrowly missed having it’s head swept from its shoulders from the wicked curved blade the Elf held. Off balance from the swing, the Elf stumbled to regain his footing; the wolf saw it’s chance and barrelled into its foe, bringing them both crashing into the ground. As the teeth of the wolf closed around his shield arm he felt something give a sickening crack and a wave of pain made him choke on his cry. With the Elf pinned to the ground the dire wolf let out a howl of victory, planning to tear out its enemy’s throat.<br />
<br />
The pause was all the Elf needed, focusing his thoughts the armour he wore immediately glowed brightly, unleashing a stunning spell that blasted the wolf off him, it came to ground hard, smashing it’s skull onto the ice covered causeway and was knocked out.<br />
<br />
Crawling to his feet, the Elf approached the unconscious dire wolf, uttering some words in an ancient tongue. His hands sprang into light that extended the length of his blade, which he raised to strike the fallen beast..<br />
<br />
“No”<br />
<br />
He stood, stunned, the sword raised above his head, looking like a mannequin in a blacksmiths shop windows, bedecked in a suit of armour to tempt some passing trade. He remained motionless, unable to move. Anger rose in his belly, there had not been a spell caster here to weave such enchantments before, and now he was in trouble, rooted to the spot.<br />
<br />
Forcing his jaws to move he incanted a spell of cancellation to remove the magicks that held him. He spoke the final word and prepared himself to wheel around to face this new threat, but nothing happened. He remained, held in place.<br />
<br />
“Who are you!” he shouted.<br />
<br />
Again the voice spoke, “Githnaur, what you do here is wrong, that which I will not allow”.<br />
<br />
The voice sounded familiar, it was that of a woman, the tongue was perfect high elven, that which he had not heard since his last journey to the high temple in Felwithe.<br />
<br />
“Who are you to dictate what is right or wrong to a servant of Tunare? Kill me now or let me alone” he spat.<br />
<br />
He heard a sigh. “When did you become so lost my child.” The voice said.<br />
<br />
The stunning spell suddenly broke and the Elf wheeled around to face the owner of the voice, but save for the unconscious droll and himself, nobody was there.<br />
<br />
He turned and looked at the fallen wolf. It was still breathing, but out cold.<br />
<br />
‘Never harm the defenceless’. The words Tynkale spoke to him during his training now rang in his head like a judgement. The bitter wind howling around him, he choking with sudden emotion, falling to one knee and cried like a newborn. “Lady, forgive me”.<br />
<br />
The woman’s voice again spoke, “I forgive you, Githnaur”.<br />
<br />
A sudden calm overcame him. He was no longer knelt on the ice blasted plains of Velious. The air smelled sweet, richer that his memories of the Faydark, He was knelt on a wooden floor, but living wood, not dead. His armour, battered from his fight had gone, the wounds on his body had vanished.<br />
<br />
Looking up he saw a high elf woman standing before him. Their eyes met, and he immediately knew her name.<br />
<br />
“Stand, child”. The voice echoed through his head, although her lips did not move.<br />
<br />
Raising himself from the floor, he stood and faced her.<br />
<br />
“How could one of my calling set aside that which I hold most dear?”<br />
<br />
“I am lost, Lady. That which I know to be your truth I lost.” his gaze fell to his feet. “I have tried to spread your message in act and deed, but they do not listen.” Warm tears fell from his cheeks, “The frustration of years overtook me, they would not listen, I have failed you”.<br />
<br />
Once more he turned his gaze to the Lady, who returned it impassively.<br />
<br />
“All will not heed the calling Githnaur, you have not failed me.”<br />
<br />
“But what of them now? What should I do?”<br />
<br />
“Their care is in one of the path, that in which you placed it. This was not by accident”.<br />
<br />
Before his departure he had sent word to a recent member of the Guild, a priestess of his own faith, and entrusted her with it’s future. He did not realise until now why he had done this when older serving comrades would have also been fit for the task.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and sighed. “What of me now, Lady?”<br />
<br />
“As of all my children, Paladin. The path”.<br />
<br />
A chill wind hit him, shocking him awake. He shook his head, confused. A light dusting of snow covered him where he lay. Starting to his feet he looked around for the dire wolf, but it was not to be seen, save for a trail of deep footprints off into the east.<br />
<br />
Brushing himself down, he collected his fallen blade, wiping the snow from it and resheathing it at his belt. The wind picked up again and made him shiver, this was not the kind of weather he was used to. <br />
He chuckled to himself that the years of working in towns and villages with the others, or on the road in the relative safety of a travelling party had made him grow soft. <br />
<br />
As he started out those decades ago from Felwithe with one companion on his journey, as he was now. Perhaps time and trial had dulled his focus, his purpose, his relationship with what he was. <br />
<br />
Tightening his cloak for the coming journey, he took one final look around him and noticed a tiny sprig of green poking through the snow. He smiled and bowed his head once in salute, and started off to the west.</div></div><hr />
