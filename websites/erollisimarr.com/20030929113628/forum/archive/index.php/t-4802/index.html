<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lenuvien Thistlebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lenuvien leaned back against one of the four giant wooden pegs used to hold up the span of the great bridge. He wondered to himself of the marvelous workmanship this bridge was. He had seen it support the weight of a giant without even a creak<br />
<br />
As he sat and pondered, his keen senses told of somebody hastily approaching the bridge from the northern plains of the rain god, Karana. He sat forward, and look towards the west. There, in the distance he saw a young ranger running towards the bridge. The wood elf looked injured, and there was true fear in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Lenuvien jumped to his feet, and yelled to the ranger to come towards him. The ranger, seeing a friendly face, ran with renewed vigor towards the druid. He yelled out, &quot;A griffenne! I was jumped! He is coming!! We must run!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lenuvien, freshly rested, knew he could defeat such a beast. He had fought many in the past, as their feathers hold magical properties that can be unlocked by shaman's to make magical armor.<br />
<br />
Lenuvien spoke in a soft, even tone. &quot;Do not fear, young ranger. I will slay the beast that has attacked you. Rest here. I shall return shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ranger, a look of relief on his face, all but fell to the ground. Seeing no fear on Lenuvien's face, he did not doubt the druid's abilities.<br />
<br />
The ranger looked on as Lenuvien stepped out from the bridge. The great winged beast was flying a straight path towards the ranger, scowling at him the entire time. Lenuvien began to call upon the trees, grasses, and all things living on the plains. As if brought to a sentient state, thorny bushes started reaching up from the ground to grasp at the creature's clawed feet. The griffenne winced in pain as the sharp thorns dug into it's flesh. A great oak tree reached out it's long branches to grasp the creature's neck. The monsterous bird choked at the tree's grasp. But, the creature was too powerful for the plants to hold it long, and it began breaking free faster than the plants could gain hold.<br />
<br />
Lenuvien, seeing that the plants would not last long against such a creature, decided to try a different approach to defeating the beast. Being already blessed with the spirit of the wolves, he knew he could outrun the creature if need be. He called upon the wasps and hornets from all around to attack the griffenne with all of their stinging swarms. The insects, sensing the druid's devotion to Tunare, were compelled to follow his command. They attacked from all sides, stinging the beast's eyes, and when swallowed, stinging from within.<br />
<br />
The griffenne reeled in pain, as the insects slowly built up enough poison to begin to weaken it. Lenuvien began calling upon the skies themselves. And suddenly, a bolt of lightning shot out from the sky and struck the great beast right on the head. The bird fell limp for a second, allowing the trees to tighten their grasp on it. Lenuvien wasted no time and begun casting another spell. Suddenly, a great ball of fire enveloped the beast, singing every part of it's body. The creature could no longer stand against the vast assault being sent against it. It began to attempt a retreat.<br />
<br />
But, Lenuvien knew the beast, if allowed to live, would eventually attack other unweary travellers. He could not allow that to happen. As much as he loved all life, he knew some was destined to be destroyed for the benefit of all of Norrath. Lenuvien called forth another ball of fire to end the creature's life without prolonging the pain it was enduring. The beast fell limp to the ground, and the trees released their grasp on the corpse.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I ever thank you, friend! You saved my life!&quot;, the ranger said to Lenuvien as he walked back to his resting spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did as I am commanded by the mother, Tunare. No thanks is needed. It is the path I have chosen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lenuvien saw that the ranger was still in pain. Although able to heal himself, his healing magic was very weak compared to that of the druid. Lenuvien called upon Tunare to restore the health of this young ranger so that he may further the cause. Energies flowed through the druid, and into  the ranger, instantly restoring the health of the young elf. He then, with the last of his magic, bestowed the spirit of the wolves upon the ranger so he could safely complete his journey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take care, young ranger. I must rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ranger stood up, and looked at the druid. He looked exhausted. The ranger understood, having some magic himself. He could only imagine the great strain put upon the druid calling forth so much magic.<br />
<br />
The ranger bowed before Lenuvien, and without another word, headed across the bridge for his destination.<br />
<br />
Lenuvien managed a smile across his face. This is what he was here for, he thought. This is what the mother has planned for him. To further the cause, not only in battle, but by helping those less fortunate and of less experience.<br />
<br />
Lenuvien drifted off to sleep.</div></div><hr />
