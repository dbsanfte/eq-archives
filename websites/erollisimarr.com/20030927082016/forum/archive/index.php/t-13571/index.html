<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Purescale today got scammed out of 25k for a RBG. Grisley was the supposed seller with the RBG on  dif char. <br />
Purescale niavely gave Grisley the cash upfront and lo and behold the wanker does a runner.<br />
<br />
Purescale was told to petition and hopefully a GM can sort something out about this. Another case of never part with your cash without seeing what you're buying first.<br />
<br />
Congratulations Grisley, you've got a rep that hopeflly will follow you around permanently. Was the measily 25k worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keysha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am very sorry that this happened to Purescale, and hope it's fixed... but... <br />
<br />
I cannot BELIEVE that people are STILL falling for the &quot;give me the money, and soandso will hand over the item&quot;. scam!  I mean, I know for a fact that I'm pretty naive, but I wouldn't fall for this one... I don't think...  ;)  Altho I'm usually so poor that if I were to have 25k in my grubby little paws you'd have to pry it from my cold, dead fingers before I'd let it go without anything in return.<br />
<br />
*snatches back her 2 coppers and runs away, giggling*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KareieWoodangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With shared bank space this should no longer be a problem, tell him/her to log on the account and put it in bank space get it out and there you go.  I really wish you could share money with your other accounts tho!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Huksh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most likely Grisley is the same person mentioned a few posts down -- Gressley.<br />
<br />
Anyway, he asked me to borrow one of my weapons to see how it looked on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>myzterys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone in our guild today got taken by this also, But the funny thing is the thief used a friends name saying he was on alt aand wanted to buy the item but he was on a seperate account to where the funds were and wanted the weapon for this character( No the victim didnt tell the stealer his friends name, the thief just knew it! ). <br />
<br />
Our member knowing this person for a long time ( well thought it was him when he knew the friends name) trusted him and well got burned big time. <br />
<br />
Anyways Thanks to Team Evil and a few other people the victim was able to get most of the money for the item back the guy stoled when after a bunch of people put the fear into him.. <br />
<br />
Here is some of his alts and a cross server alt as posted on our forums \<br />
<br />
<br />
:)Yayaya, Grisly a monk name Susk something he's level 1 and he has an alt on stromm names Zatlibus, he sent me a tell using him cross server <br />
<br />
<br />
Moral of story NEVER NEVER Trade something when they contact u, If they want to buy make them pay first and then trade item on alt if that is what they choose, if they him and haw about it, contact a officer of your guild or thiers to mediate the transaction or just tell them to figure out  a way to get you your money or item first time around .<br />
<br />
Thank you again Team Evil for your help with one of our members</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seriously...<br />
<br />
For those that give an item / cash without seeing the appropriate item / cash in the traders window, my &quot;friend&quot; wants to buy your car for like 50grand dude, all you gotta do is give me the keys and I'll go get your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hailee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree that the shared bank account will limit this picticular scam, but not the scammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>solarise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/chuckle jaidin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vespay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, there is definitely no excuse for this type of thing to still be going on, with the shared bank space nowadays.  Still sorry that it happened though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maltoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok...yes I agree that scammers are amongst the lowliest of Norrath's denizens.  I also agree that what they do, taking advantage of the ingnorant, is wrong.  <br />
<br />
<br />
HOWEVER.... (this is where you can start getting angry)<br />
<br />
I feel that anyone that falls for a scam like that....the &quot;give me the item and I'll pay you with my alt&quot; bit...deserves to lose whatever they lost.  Sorry.  You were dumb...THEY EVEN WARN YOU IN THE MOTD FROM TIME TO TIME.  Jesus, people.  I suppose I could just be paranoid..but unless I know someone IRL, or have known them IG for a LONG time (and there are very few people that fit this bill well enough for me to trust..and they already have my accnt info &gt;&lt;)....then no deal without the money/item up front.  It's that simple...there's no hmm'ing and haw'ing about it.  If they don't..they can go about their merry way..or get an earful of tells they'd probably rather go without seeing.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BronzAloy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How to help the GM's help you.<br />
<br />
1st, listen to people above, Trust no one.<br />
<br />
When you think you are being scammed, if you want to &quot;out&quot; them and have time, go along with it by draw it out as much as possible.<br />
<br />
1. /peition I think &quot;xyz&quot; is a possible scammer. He / Her con is:<br />
a.) let me see what the item looks like on me. <br />
b.) for a hamburger today I will gladly pay you Tuesday<br />
c.) &quot;Hey you! Guess who this is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Get print screens, /report, etc...<br />
<br />
Even if you do all this right, the GM may respond with, &quot;The logs do not show enough information.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I found when reporting a ninja looter... the GM saw that the person had looted the Spectral but had no proof it was from our group's mob, etc. Grrrrrrrr.....<br />
<br />
Be safe... continue to post scammers here and on your own guild's boards ASAP.</div></div><hr />
