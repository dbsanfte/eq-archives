<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ninnin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ninnin stood in his dark and cold anti-chamber within the halls of the crumbling and decaying keep. The table he had once researched over, tutored over, and bleed over was now cracked down it's center and covered in dust.. the central pool of water within it's surface was now empty and dry.  Tell tale signs of aged ruin and decay were all around the once mighty Shadow Keep.<br />
<br />
The wizard wrapped his robes about him and moved past the table into a room that contained several boxes which had housed his components for his spell research and magical tomes that held many secrets from ages long since passed.  He kneeled down before the shelves and removed a piece of floorboard exposing a hidden compartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh there it is..&quot; he muttered<br />
<br />
He reached in and brought forth a small box.  He stood and swiftly turned and paced into the main chamber. Reaching from within his robes he brought forth a pinch of silver powder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Velium ta postak&quot; he spoke as he sprinkled the powder over the destroyed table.<br />
<br />
With a flash of light the table lifted it's two halves from the ground and swirled in the air fusing it's damage surface and central stand into one, freezing over with ice so clear it gave the appearance of glass and finally, gently, rested itself in perfect repair upon the ground.  The wizard looked amused by the effectiveness of the magic secrets he had stolen from the Thurgadinian dwarves.<br />
<br />
He gently sat the box upon the surface and slowly opened it's gem inlaid lid.<br />
<br />
A thin smile appeared on the wizards aged face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.. as I had left it.&quot; he spoke aloud as he drew forth a piece of cloth.<br />
<br />
He gently opened the cloth which revealed the emblem.. that of the Shadow Guard..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazinthas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kazinthas sat upon the frozen tundra, resting his back against one of the massive arches that made, what the locals called, the Great Span. His wounds from his latest battle with one of the fearsome Tundra Kodiaks, were all but closed thanks to his innate regeneration. <br />
<br />
Pulling a muffin out of his pack, the hulking troll sighed, almost imperceptibly, lamenting the loss of elf in his diet. He had to admit, the force he had attached himself to were dependable allies, even if some of them were dwarves and elves. Eh, the pay was good, and he was more powerful than before, so he endured it.<br />
<br />
Stuffing the muffin into his maw, Kazinthas noted a salty flavor, long denied him. . blood. . .Looking down into his palm, he noted the symbol of the Shadow Guard, branded there of his own accord. . .Well-scarred, and long since healed, oozing blood as if the wound were fresh.<br />
<br />
Scratching his head, Kazinthas pulled himself to his feet. Thinking something must be afoot, he loped off over the span, towards that wretched gnomish ship that would take him back to Antonica. . .back to Shadow Keep. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nandayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The cunning assassin grined to himself as he bled the last ounce of life from the Coldain Guardian.  How Nandayar loved the kill, the warm rush of life blood flowing over the hungry blade of Innoruuk's hate Ragebringer.  The silent look of surprise and horror as he whispered into the ear of his unsuspecting victim.  He was beginning to enjoy his employment from the Storm Giants of Kael.<br />
<br />
      Suddenly the assassin's chest begun to burn.  Nandayar fought the urge to cry out in pain, but the centuries of training with-in the Ebon Mask of Neriak held true.  Nandayar leapt from the top of the Coldain lookout tower. *a good eight stories from the tundra floor* A quick routine of elegant turns and flips found the assassin on the ground and with unprecedented speed was lost in the shadows.<br />
<br />
<br />
       Nandayar tore at his armor pulling away the fine silk under his armor reached into a small hidden flap and produced the source of the intense pain.  Nandayar's eyes widened in disbelief.  The ancient symbol he could not bare to part with was pulsing.  &quot;This is impossible!!&quot; <br />
Nandyar remembered back to his days with the only family he had ever truly known.  Could it be true had the dark seed of Norrath returned from its sleep.  The blackest of Innoruuk's hate the pure rage of Ralloz Zek could it be THE SHADOW GUARD returns......???</div></div><hr />
