<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aithe sighed as she slipped into the tub, the warm water welcoming her tired body.  She arched her back, leaning back and stretching, sighing once more.  Long had it been since she had felt this kind of luxury, prefering to keep to herself, to live a life of solitude and dedication to her art.  Many a night she had chosen to sleep on a simple bed of leaves, choosing the form of the wolf over her own, savoring the freedom it provided to move about and avoid the stares that always seemed to come when she tried to return to Kelethin.  It bothered her little these days though, it had never seemed like home to her.  Well, never since the war with the Orcs began.  The warriors became the heroes of the time, and druids became hated for the peacefulness and harmony of their existance.  Her mind drifted back as her body sank into the water, skin reddening  with the warmth, a pink glow spreading along her flesh.  It seemed odd to her, and slightly ironic now that she thought of it.  She felt as though she had wasted so much of her life in the feelings she once allowed herself.  The one man she let herself care for had slipped his cold hands around her heart, and she loved it.  She loved the feelings he gave her, she loved being wanted by someone, feeling as though somewhere, somehow she held a place.  Now though, he was gone.. and here she was, basking in the luxury she had deprived herself for so long.  Emerald eyes glance about the room provided for her... the house D'Venier certainly seemed to live up to it's reputation.  Fine silks adorned the many furnishings.. a fire burned lazily in the fireplace, and somewhere.. from some hidden source, her senses could detect a faint trace of cinnamon floating about the room.  She never in her life felt her experiences with the Tier`Dal would lead her to this, yet here she was.  Her mind drifted once more.. floating back to times past, times when she still roamed the Faydark...<br />
<br />
The young druidess ran swiftly through the woods of the lesser Faydark, footsteps falling softly on the forest floor.  Her body moved instinctly, darting between the trees with the speed of a wolf and nimbless of the doe.  She was headed for the dark castle Mistmoore, intent on her course till a voice from her left sounded through the trees, piercing the calm of the wood.  Her eyes whirled to the source of the sound, though no one  could be seen.. the confusion this caused distracted her mind and she slip on a patch of  fallen leaves, whirling and falling to the forest floor, staring up at the sky.  Her consciousness faded, senses failing her as the world around her faded..<br />
<br />
The ranger Palthos scratched his head a few times as he stared at the unconscious wood elf before him.  The green links of his chainmail armor tinkled softly with the movement.  &quot;What in the...  Not again.&quot;  The seasoned ranger was quite confused by all this, just last year he had found another young elf lying unconscious on the forest floor.. though that one had been a child, and now his daughter.  This one though was a woman, a young woman, but a woman nonetheless.  &quot;I dun think Beth would like me bringin her home.. &quot; The ranger glanced around for a moment then back down at the ground.  &quot;Well.. I can't jes leave her here..&quot; He shrugged to himself and picked her up, heading home.<br />
<br />
Palthos and his wife Bethanie nursed the young druidess back to health, Bethanie cleaning the wound on her head with a wet cloth.  The hands felt warm against her skin, and she opened her eyes slowly.. blinking a few times as she took in her surroundings.  &quot;Rest friend.. there's time for that later.&quot;  Aithe shifted her eyes to gaze up at the human woman smiling down at her and smiled a bit in return, nodding slightly then drifting back to sleep.<br />
 <br />
The three went on to become great friends, growing closer to one another as they journied together into the depths of the eerie castle of Mayong.  The warmth that seemed to flow from Bethanie helped to fill Aithe's mind with wisdom, aiding her magics in their battles with the Tier'dal guards of the castle.  They watched as eached grew in strength, advancing in their own unique ways.. and the Forestwalker's young daughter Aishen coming of age and seeming to follow in the footsteps of her father.  As she grew she seemed to look more and more like the sister Aithe had lost touch with long ago as a child.  Her mind started to drift further still...<br />
<br />
A knock at the door broke her from her reverie, the sound of a hand against the door booming through the room.  Aithe startled awake, shivering at the water she lay in, now cold as the night and just as bitter.  She rose quickly from the tub, water cascading from her body in tiny streams.  The knock came once more, though this time with it a voice.  &quot;M'lady.. t'is time for dinner..&quot; came the Tier'dal voice of a young servant girl.  &quot;Aye, indeed it is.. come in and help me to dress.&quot; Aithe stepped from the tub and into the cloth the girl provided, dark skinned has shaking nervously at upsetting the Fier`dal guest of her master.  Aithe closed her eyes slowly, a bit of a grin creeping across her lips.<br />
<br />
OOC: well, my first story.. if you don't like it, bah, don't read it.. if you do like it, thanks and hugs and I'll post s'more later =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The young druidess returned quietly to her chambers, the dark servant following closely behind her.. footsteps gingerly placed, careful not to step upon the flowing robes of green velvet the Fier`dal woman wore.  The fabric moved about her form gracefully, trailing behind her as she moved as if caught by some unfelt breeze.  The young servant girl who followed wondered about this fair skinned version of herself, wondered how a life of woodland solitude could possibly result in the woman she saw before her.  She envied that solitude.. that freedom.  Her eyes began to water as she thought of it, though of the freedom such a life would provide.. the freedom to think and do as she pleased.  The servant girl caught herself as a single tear slid down her cheek, a faint sigh escaping her lips.  She glanced ahead of the Fier'dal, eyeing the large oaken doors to the room of splendor this woman would once again be free to enjoy while she herself would be forced to return to a bed of straw and bitter cold.  She bit her lip, rushing ahead of the druidess and opening the doors for her.  &quot;Your chamber awaits m'lady...&quot;  The words came faint, breath failing her as she mouthed the words in her own tongue.  The Fier'dal understood and nodding slightly to the servant girl, she gathered her robes about her, stepping into the room.  Glancing over her shoulder at the Tier'dal she said simply &quot;Come.&quot; and continued on her way into the room.<br />
<br />
The room remained as she had left it, the window partly cracked.. a faint trace of Neriak's sounds seeping through the opening provided to them.  With the sounds came the distant chanting of the clerics across town, somber voices carrying through the night.  Aithe sighed to herself and waved a hand idly at the fireplace, the wood igniting and a small fire soon forming.  As the warmth of the fire filled the room, the glow did as well.. light glinting off a few pieces of silver left about the room.  Her hands gently tugged at the cords holding the robes around her, pulling it free and dropping it to the floor.  The deep green robes split down the center of her body, opening like a flowering bud, ready to face the world and show their hidden beauty.  The druidess moved to the fireplace in silence, ignoring the servant girl as she kneeled before the flames, light dancing in her emerald eyes.. mischief twinking within them as always.  Her eyes drift slowly closed as she takes a deep breath, body relaxing from the nights events.  Dinner had gone quite smoothly, though the conversation which had ensued afterwards left many questions floating about the young Feir'dal's mind.  There would be time to think on those questions later though.. now was a time for comfort, for solace.  Her mind turned inward, falling deeper and deeper within itself as she gathered her strength.  Images came and went, and with them a thousand memories as well.. then, silence.  She sighed deeply... and was home.<br />
<br />
The Tier'dal servant watched this woman quietly, unsure about what she was seeing.. though curious as well.  She tiptoed over to the druidess, curiousity overcoming her better judgement.  What was she doing?  Why was she smiling? There was nothing here to cause happiness that hadn't been here but a moment before.. but now, now this woman was smiling.  It scared her.  She could not feel that happiness, could not understand it, and could not attain it... and so, it scared her.  She shivered slightly as she inched closer still, watching the face of this silent creature.  So pristine she did seem in this state, so... so...<br />
<br />
&quot;Take off these robes..&quot;  Aithe's voice spoke quietly, lips scarcely moving.  The young Tier'dal gasped, jumping to her feet to back away.  Aithe's eyes slowly opened as she giggled at the girl.  &quot;Nevermind that then, I didn't mean to frighten you... come, let us sleep.&quot;  Aithe rose to her feet, shrugging the robe off her shoulders to fall and gather around her feet.  She moved over to the bed gracefully, slipping onto it and stretching out.. pale flesh glowing in the firelight.  &quot;Come child... join me.&quot;  The servant girl shook with nervousness, slowly moving to join the druidess on the bed.  &quot;Yes.. yes m'lady&quot;  She slowly climbed onto the bed with cautious movements, already afraid of what punishment might come.. certain she was doing something wrong.  She lied her body next to that of the Fier'dal, stiffening a moment as pale skinned arms came around her, holding her against the womans body.  The warmth of the druidess flowed into her body, and her shaking slowly subsided as she drifted to sleep.  &quot;Aye child, sleep now... rest.&quot; the druidess said quietly as she held the girl to her.  Soft lips placed a gentle kiss on the back of the Tier'dal's head, then she too began to drift to sleep.. peace once again coming to her mind.<br />
