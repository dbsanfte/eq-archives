<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ninnin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The High Magus spent the next several weeks researching the incantations and components needed to open the rift between this world and the others to which his comrades and brethren had long ago been taken.  What were the words.. “damn the Magi” he thought to himself.. “how dare they hide their arts in a way that prevents me from obtaining that which is rightfully mine!”<br />
<br />
His eyes gleamed with madness.. the weeks of sleepless and relentless research had wracked the Magus’s body.  He had barley taken time away to eat and drink, let alone get the rest needed with such a massive undertaking in research.<br />
<br />
The magus began his chants and the intricate hand motions as he began to open the portal to shift reality and time.. a portal that would open the rift and displace that which was.. that which is.. and even that which would be.<br />
<br />
“This shall return us to our rightful state! … I WILL display the power with which I have come to know!! “  The magus screamed with Rage and Madness.. the floor, the ground.. the caverns of Neriak shook from the force that was being driven into one magical location.<br />
<br />
… “And the Feir’Dal nations shall fall beneath the might of the Shadow Guard once again… doubt it not.. he gasped – his breath coming to him in only short takes.<br />
<br />
The Magus’ eye’s opened wide in Horror.. he gazed into his creation and saw the flesh stripped carcasses of his brethren.. he saw the fall of the kingdom of Neriak… he saw the banner of the Guard torn and destroyed.  He writhed in pain as his body struggled to hold the force of the mystic portal open.<br />
<br />
He began the second phase of the spell.. the magus muttered the incantations and began to contort his body.<br />
The portal began to shift and turn .. clockwise at first.. and then suddenly, violently it reversed.  The Magus looked on horrified.  The portal began spinning in a counterclockwise motion.<br />
<br />
“N..n.no.. this can’t be!” Ninnin screamed.<br />
<br />
Was it possible?  Could he really have deciphered the parchment from the Magicians incorrectly?  The portal began to cone backwards.. as if being sucked from the middle out via a straw dragging the wizard’s body, twisted and gnarled, into it’s center.  The wizard had lost control.<br />
<br />
With a blinding flash of brilliant white gold and violet light the portal was gone.. along with the wizard.</div></div><hr />
