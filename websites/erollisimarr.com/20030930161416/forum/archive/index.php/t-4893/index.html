<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>user987654</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">he sold marlaxx for 110,000pp to a friend of mine.  then a couple of weeks later he reset the password so he can get the account back.<br />
<br />
BEWARE of this person, he's a SCAMMER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarney Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its your first post - i dont believe you<br />
whats your ig name and lvl plz<br />
and if your friend bought plat how could someone reset the account, did he keep the plat on the account he bought ? <br />
you said nothing about him buying an account, give us some more details and you might be believed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MilanderTruewield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Zarney, if you think that someone shouldn't be believed just because of his/her post count, you are a dumbass. Just thought you should know.<br />
<br />
I don't believe Zarney, cuz he only has 74 posts! Hrhrhrhr.<br />
<br />
Just a little stupid, aye?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sancta Nox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This happens often (read previous posts and threads)  you shouldent buy/sell accounts at least with people you dont know in RL. hope you learned a good lesson from that 110k pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bumblefumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, I dont believe you Sancta Nox, because you have only 57 posts and you, like me are not to be trusted! Because, you know, both of us have less than 100 posts...<br />
It is 100, right.....?<br />
<br />
Oh yea, im only 27th level too, so I absoloutely don't know anything...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure what the whole debate is with the posts.  I would think that someone is just trying to remain anonymous, which is fine.<br />
<br />
The warning regarding MARLAXX is indeed valid.  REGNIS sold the account to for 110k plat.  You give him the plat and he gives you the login info.  He even lets you check on another computer.  Once you pay him you then go in and change the password and billing info, thinking that this is enough to make it permanently yours.  He even gives you a phony account key.  Problem is that, as others have mentioned on this board, it is extremely easy for the original owner of an account to get password information from Sony.  They keep the name, zip code, and birthdate of the first person to register an account on file and with that information they will give you the current password.  So it was that about a week after Marlaxx was sold the original owner (or someone they know) took the account back along with a few items that had been acquired for Marlaxx.<br />
<br />
Yes, it was naive to buy the account in the first place.  But not everyone has such a wicked and sick mind.  And if you don't, this kind of thing may not even enter your mind in the first place.  It has nothing to do with how long you play for either as the person this happened to has been playing since 1999.  I guess they've been sheltered from these freaks and thieves throughout their EQ life.  At least until now.<br />
<br />
I hope that someday, somehow this scumbag gets what he deserves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arrgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">trust me, i have a few hundred posts..... this is true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darkbindress1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First, let me start by saying that I've played on this server, off and on, for 3 + years and have known the REAL Marlaxx from day one (in RL too).<br />
<br />
This a bunch of bullshit and if anyone believes this story then they need to have their heads examined.  <br />
<br />
I say this, with the assumption, that only the FIRST owner can change PW's.  If a second owen can then THEY are the ones to blame...not the FIRST Marlaxx.<br />
<br />
The REAL Marlaxx, the one who played Marlaxx for 3 years, is NOT a scammer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AzulMininec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well regardless of its the first, second or even tenth Marlaxx, whoever is playing him now is the scammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dauragon CMikado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You're all gay...<br />
<br />
and... well... look...<br />
<br />
see.. it's obviously true..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colmillo Icelander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok guys, Dauragon just called you all gay, and being the authority on homo's and all, he's damn right.<br />
<br />
Fook all you gay people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Euge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well if this is true, better watch out for rynkar too since that's his twink...I've grouped with him a couple times, seems like a cool guy but didn't know he was a scammer. I'll watch out for him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>brollydarkchilde9000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the guy that is playing marlaxx atm is not the one that scammed REGNIS outta 110k, the guy that is playing him now i know personally in RL for many years, from what Rynkar has told me is that he traded the account for a Horn of Hsagra straight up less than a month ago, only to find out that after a few hours and many tell's later that the account had been scammed before, after the trade had already been made.  So what is he to do now, he has had the account for less than a month and could lose it at any time no matter how many password changes he makes and is out a 90k-100k item, that is the risk that is taken with selling and trading accounts, its a sad state of affairs in which people screw either other over in a video game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gojirra Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, I guess now that word is out, whoever is scamming people now is taking a huge risk that the next time he sells the account, he'll get it back without any items and deleveled to 6, huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Alethia or Celoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Now that is something I would love to see if someone had the balls to do. If they delevel the char to 10(lowest a char can be deleveled to) and the guy never scammed they would still be out of a valuable char. It would be a difficult choice for someone who had the possibility being scammed held over their head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blessing Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rynkar is an SK right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faeeldora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Man and I have never even seen 110k...EVER =(<br />
<br />
on a side note why delevel, just delete *eg*<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll teach you to interfere with me, soandso!<br />
<br />
OH one more edit! Delevel THEN delete =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>euge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yes rynkar is a shadow knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rynkar Vin`Kiyera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">DUH, Only the baddest SK in the GD WORLD, :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Siene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Soooo cant see the real Marl doing this at all!  However, Marl did sell when he quit and um, did you all ever consider that maybe, just maybe. the second owner could be doing this?</div></div><hr />
