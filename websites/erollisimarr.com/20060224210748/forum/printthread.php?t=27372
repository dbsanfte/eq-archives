This is EXACTLY what they did in eq1, and why I wont go near another SOE<br />
game.<br />
Another thing you can look forward to is 8 expansions, and being left behind<br />
the mudflation if you dont buy them.<br />
<br />
Im just amazed that so many people have bought eq2 in spite of soe's past<br />
record.<br />

&gt;Could someone tell me if SOE actual take players opinions into account?</font><br />
<br />
During the summer of 2004, SOE held a player/developer summit, wherein they discussed the<br />
direction of EQL at length and took suggestions for improving the game.  Many of those<br />
player suggestions have since appeared in the gameworld, always clearly marked in the<br />
relevant patch message.  In my experience, these customer-driven changes have typically<br />
been positive enhancements.<br />
<br />
(I do not know if the farming of opinions and suggestions is an ongoing process.)<br />
<br />
SoE has established an official account on at least my class website, and that the owner<br />
checks in occasionally with the community.  I can only assume (or !hope!) that the same<br />
activity is taking place on other class websites.<br />

I solo and it's tough a lot of the time, but that's how the game was<br />

<br />
It was also clearly stated that you could play the game solo, which is<br />
simply rubbish. Here's a quote from SOE before the game was released:<br />
<br />
Q.Will I be able to solo whenever I want to?<br />
<br />
A. Yes. We want players to enjoy themselves regardless of their preferred<br />
play style or how many hours a day they can log in. Our game has significant<br />
amounts of content designed for all classes to be able to solo at all<br />
levels, including quests, jobs assigned by NPCs, and areas where opponents<br />
can be fought solo rather than in a group.<br />
<br />
That is basically a pack of lies.<br />
<br />
Bizzarely with the latest 'patch' they have made it even more difficult to<br />
solo. They have increased the damage done by mobs. Basically only mobs drop<br />
chests which means it is getting pretty much impossible to get chest drops<br />
and further your character without grouping.<br />
<br />
When you reach lvl 20 there is a HUGE drop in the amount of solo quests. By<br />
the time you are at lvl 30 you might as well forget it.<br />
<br />
I've got nothing against people who want to group, it's SOE forcing players<br />
to play a certain way and nerfing the game to make solo play even more<br />
difficult than it should be.<br />
<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt;The same thing with EQ1, in that case they pushed it even<br />
&gt; more in the beginning as a group oriented game when it came out, yet<br />
&gt; people to this day are still complaining that it's a group oriented game<br />
&gt; and it's tough soloing. Double duh!<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; I solo and it's tough a lot of the time, but that's how the game was<br />

&gt; according to their own wants and needs. But that sure doesn't stop them<br />
&gt; from trying over and over and over and over for years.</font><br />
<br />
I never played EQ1 so I cant comment on that.<br />
<br />
It may not be a democracy but I am a paying customer and believe it or not<br />
my views should matter to SOE. I wouldnt be surprised if they simply think<br />
they can simply ignore the major complaints by customers and carry on as<br />
normal like you stated they did with EQ1.<br />
<br />
This time however EQ1 is not the only MMORPG, the market is getting very<br />
competitive and customers do now have other options.<br />
<br />
Personally I am waiting for WoW's europe release. If the 'Major Patch' that<br />
SOE has been promising for the last few weeks doesnt fix the gameplay<br />
problem for solo players then i'm out. SOE has stated that including a lot<br />
more single player content is at the top of their list but the lastest patch<br />
that nerfed solo play even more doesnt fill me with hope.<br />
<br />

<br />
My complaint really lies with the structure of the game rather than the<br />
classes. I can understand how these can take a while to tweak etc.<br />
<br />
It's basically the major areas of the gameplay that seem to have problems,<br />
such as crafting, selling and the obvious forced grouping that SOE seem<br />
obsessed with.<br />

<br />
I gotta agree. I'm glad SoE is sticking to their original design and<br />
philosophy. I would feel that way about any game, regardless of which<br />
route it took, soloable, groupable or both. I think it's a bad idea to<br />
design the core of a game with one philosophy in mind and then try to<br />
bend it to satisfy another. It is what it is. Play it if it's your bag,<br />
don't if it's not.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it's no secret that people will tend to beg for things<br />
that aren't necessarily good for them or the game in the long run.<br />
Instant gratification rules the day far too often.<br />

&gt;&gt; more in the beginning as a group oriented game when it came out, yet<br />
&gt;&gt; people to this day are still complaining that it's a group oriented<br />
&gt;&gt; game and it's tough soloing. Double duh!<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; I solo and it's tough a lot of the time, but that's how the game was<br />
&gt;&gt; written.  It's not a democracy where people playing it get to design<br />
&gt;&gt; it according to their own wants and needs. But that sure doesn't stop<br />
&gt;&gt; them from trying over and over and over and over for years.</font><br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; I never played EQ1 so I cant comment on that.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; It may not be a democracy but I am a paying customer and believe it or<br />
&gt; not my views should matter to SOE. I wouldnt be surprised if they<br />
&gt; simply think they can simply ignore the major complaints by customers<br />
&gt; and carry on as normal like you stated they did with EQ1.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; This time however EQ1 is not the only MMORPG, the market is getting<br />
&gt; very competitive and customers do now have other options.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Personally I am waiting for WoW's europe release. If the 'Major Patch'<br />
&gt; that SOE has been promising for the last few weeks doesnt fix the<br />
&gt; gameplay problem for solo players then i'm out. SOE has stated that<br />
&gt; including a lot more single player content is at the top of their list<br />
&gt; but the lastest patch that nerfed solo play even more doesnt fill me<br />
&gt; with hope.<br />
&gt;</font><br />
<br />
Still soloing at 20...<br />
<br />
Sure I group too, and it's much better xp, but, soloing has not been hard<br />
to do.<br />

&gt;&gt;Could someone tell me if SOE actual take players opinions into<br />
&gt;&gt;account?</font><br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; During the summer of 2004, SOE held a player/developer summit, wherein<br />
&gt; they discussed the direction of EQL at length and took suggestions for<br />
&gt; improving the game.  Many of those player suggestions have since<br />
&gt; appeared in the gameworld, always clearly marked in the relevant patch<br />
&gt; message.  In my experience, these customer-driven changes have<br />
&gt; typically been positive enhancements.</font><br />
<br />
During the summer of 2004, SoE held an uber guild player/developer<br />
summit...<br />
<br />
Many of the suggestions from that summit were not particularly beneficial<br />
to the run of the mill players.<br />
<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; (I do not know if the farming of opinions and suggestions is an<br />
&gt; ongoing process.)<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; SoE has established an official account on at least my class website,<br />
&gt; and that the owner checks in occasionally with the community.  I can<br />
&gt; only assume (or !hope!) that the same activity is taking place on<br />
&gt; other class websites.</font><br />
<br />
They are certainly doing better in regards to listening to customers than<br />
they did prior to 2004.  My favorite one is loads of players complaining<br />
that alchemy is broken, SoE (or was it still Verant?) replying, no it's<br />
not.  Eventually after many months, they finally admitted, oh, yeah, it<br />
is...<br />

<br />
Well the latest patch has made it even more difficult to solo mob groups.<br />
This coupled with the fact that it's very rare that a solo creature will<br />
drop a chest makes it very difficult to improve your character at higher<br />
levels.<br />
<br />
Also the lack of solo quests at higher levels also forces people to group as<br />
there's no other way of ganing experience.<br />

<br />
I'm not asking for them to be made easier, though I think it's taking the<br />
piss that they made them harder. I'm simply asking for more solo quests that<br />
can be completed on your own. There are way to many quests that are supposed<br />
to be solo yet it turns out are impossible to complete on your own.<br />

If you want to solo, solo *solo* mobs.  Duh.  There's<br />
plenty out there.   They do have the same loot tables,<br />
it'll just take more kills.   Which is appropriate -- after<br />

Oops, I missed the quests part of your complaint.  So far, I've seen<br />
quite a few quests that you can complete in EL solo - including Blood<br />
of the Bears Two and Three, Sir Tatters, etc.  Some of the best<br />
soloable quests are collection and category quests, also.<br />

<br />
Chances of getting chests seem to be about equal, per actual mob killed<br />
of getting a chest from group or solo mobs.  It seems rare soloing, but<br />
consider, in a group there are up to 6 people who are sharing those<br />
chests, while soloing there is just one person getting the chest.  My<br />
experience up to level 20 anyway, seems to show that I get about the same<br />
number of chest drops where I get something from it whether grouped or<br />
soloing.<br />

&gt; &gt; There is a lot more grouped mobs, but there are solo ones also.<br />
&gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; Once you hit 25 and get EL access (which will require a group), the<br />
&gt; &gt; area near the docks are loaded with soloable creatures.  Even after</font></font><br />
the<font color="#7F7FFF"><font color="#7FBF7F"><br />
&gt; &gt; patch that beefed critters up yesterday I am able to solo pretty<br />
&gt; &gt; readily there, and I get ripped to shreds in a toe-to-toe fight.<br />
&gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; There are plenty of places to solo, at least up as far as 36 so</font></font><br />
far,<font color="#7F7FFF"><font color="#7FBF7F"><br />
&gt; &gt; you just need to keep your eyes open and look for them.<br />
&gt; &gt;</font><br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; I disagree. Solo monsters rarely drop chests which is why solo quests</font><br />
are<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt; desperately needed for the solo player.</font><br />
<br />
Rarely compared to groups, yes.  But my feeling is that it is about 1/5<br />
to 1/6 as rare, which is about the same for one person to score<br />
something from a group dropped chest.  I worked on my disarm by soloing<br />
green and blue orcs because the chests dropped often enough that I<br />
wouldn't have to risk killing any groups trying to work on that skill.<br />

<br />
No, they aren't.  The best drop I've gotten so far (level 29<br />
Fury Adept) came from a solo mob, as did the Bootstrutter's<br />
quest drop and tons of other ones.   No, they're not as<br />
common.  But you're not competing for five other players<br />
for the actual drop, either...<br />
<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt; Without solo quests that give rewards, the solo players are stuck in terms<br />
&gt; of advancement.</font><br />
<br />
No, it's just slower.   Welcome to Everquest...<br />
<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt; Even some of the supposedly solo<br />
&gt; quests in the game already cannot be completed on your own.</font><br />
<br />
I've yet to find a solo quest I couldn't solo.  Certain quests<br />
are GROUP quests even though they're for your character.<br />
The entire AQ series, for example.  Just because the reward<br />
is for your character doesn't mean it's designed to be done<br />
solo...<br />

&gt;</font><br />
They had a summit, but I think it was more people from the high end guilds<br />
that were in on it.<br />
A few ideas from the summit were implemented.<br />
<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt; I'm amazed that with all the annoyed solo players out there complaining<br />
&gt; about the lack of solo content and forced grouping that SOE have</font><br />
introduced<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt; a patch to make it more difficult to solo. It's a really bizzare way to<br />
&gt; treat paying customers and I simply cant work it out.</font><br />
<br />
They have more solo content coming up in the big patch.  It probably would<br />
have been up and running by now if not for the big crash.<br />
It is expected some time in January.<br />

&gt;<br />
&gt;A. Yes. We want players to enjoy themselves regardless of their preferred<br />
&gt;play style or how many hours a day they can log in. Our game has significant<br />
&gt;amounts of content designed for all classes to be able to solo at all<br />
&gt;levels, including quests, jobs assigned by NPCs, and areas where opponents<br />
&gt;can be fought solo rather than in a group.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;That is basically a pack of lies.</font><br />
<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
There's not one word in it not true.<br />
<br />
There are solo regions in the outdoor zones, and solo quests to take<br />
advantage of them. The wholesaler tasks assigned by NPCs (the 'jobs')<br />
are all soloable.<br />
<br />
There are:<br />
Solo quests (with more coming).<br />
Solo jobs assigned by NPCs.<br />
Areas where oppoenents can be fought solo.<br />
<br />
All of those things exist. Every last one of them. Nothing in the<br />
paragraph is a lie.<br />
<br />
What it doesn't say -- and which people like to imagine it says -- is<br />
'You will be able to experience the entire game if you solo'. You<br />
won't. It says there's &quot;significant content&quot; -- not &quot;ALL content&quot;.<br />
('significant' is, of course, a weasel word, with no fixed meaning,<br />
but I've seen plenty of solo areas in Antonica and the Steppes, and<br />
ditto solo quests)<br />

I disagree, the quests for solo players putside the city are few and far<br />
between.<br />
<br />
Name me ten solo quests a mid level player (15) can do on his own in<br />
Antonica, then name another ten a mid-high (17+) solo player can do in<br />
Antonica on his own.<br />

&gt; &gt;&gt;It's basically the major areas of the gameplay that seem to have problems,<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;such as crafting, selling and the obvious forced grouping that SOE seem<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;obsessed with.</font><br />
&gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; I cannot speak knowledgeably about complaints #1 and #2, but what's this<br />
&gt; &gt; about &quot;obvious<br />
&gt; &gt; forced grouping?&quot;</font><br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Well the latest patch has made it even more difficult to solo mob groups.<br />
&gt; This coupled with the fact that it's very rare that a solo creature will<br />
&gt; drop a chest makes it very difficult to improve your character at higher<br />
&gt; levels.</font><br />
<br />
Timothy is talking about Everquest, you are talking about Everquest 2.<br />
I think this will lead to confusion...<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want to improve your character, there are lots of<br />
crafters who will be happy to sell you equipment, as well as groupers<br />
who have gotten nice drops they don't need.  As a soloer you will<br />
never get as good equipment as someone who groups, but in my<br />
experience the big money is to be made from harvesting and selling the<br />
results, which is a solo endeavour, so it should be possible to do<br />
fairly well.<br />
<br />
<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt; Also the lack of solo quests at higher levels also forces people to group as<br />
&gt; there's no other way of ganing experience.</font><br />
<br />
Except, of course, killing solo mobs and doing solo quests...  I can't<br />
speak for above level 26, but so far there are quite a few quests to<br />
do solo, a number of them even repeatable.  Also quests never grey<br />
out, so you can do quests that involve grey encounters once they<br />
become soloable and still get the reward, though they may no longer be<br />
worth the effort.<br />
<br />
<font color="#7F7FFF"><br />
&gt; I'm not asking for them to be made easier, though I think it's taking the<br />
&gt; piss that they made them harder. I'm simply asking for more solo quests that<br />
&gt; can be completed on your own. There are way to many quests that are supposed<br />
&gt; to be solo yet it turns out are impossible to complete on your own.</font><br />
<br />
I haven't seen many quests that started out as obviously solo quests<br />
and then turned out to require a group - the only one that comes to<br />
mind is Tinkerer Spindlecog's quest, which starts with killing two<br />
kinds of solo mobs and then turns out to require kill tide octopi,<br />
which are group mobs.  It would be nice if quests were marked group or<br />
solo though, so one could tell in advance.<br />
