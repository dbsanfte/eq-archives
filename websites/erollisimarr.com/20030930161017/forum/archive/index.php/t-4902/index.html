<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kavaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some jackass was trying to sell/trade a 56 warrior on here.  Don't buy Steell.  He's already sold and reverted once, and you'd have to be a moron to think he wouldn't do it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Alethia Stardust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Steel Reins(sp?)? That's interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kavaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Steell Reins, but yeah.  I'm obviously not 100% sure who was trying to sell here, but both things are good advice.. buying/trading an acct from somebody anonymously spamming the board is idiotic, and buying Steell would be even more so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Leldari Luthiniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kavaren could you please post a link to the offer to sell Steell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tormentcia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kavaren, unless you have proof, please don't try to trash someone's rep.  You emailed me weeks ago with this, yet never followed through, so until you do, please don't continue.   However, if you have proof, I'm well aware that you have my email.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kavaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sale post was deleted before I posted here. Torm- you never responded, so why would I have mailed you again?</div></div><hr />

I would ignore you without proof too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kavaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nogem- thanks for putting your massive intellect on display for us all to see.  We're graced by its awesome presence.  Really.  When you decide to lower yourself to interacting with mere mortals again, you might learn of something called &quot;polite conversation&quot;.  If you study that hard enough, or interact with someone who hasn't mastered the principles yet, you'll understand the reason for the principal tenet: STFU if the person isn't displaying any interest in what you're saying.  Why? well, they might be deaf, or they might have their ezboard mail set to an account they never check, in which case you're wasting your time.  Or they might not care, in which case you're wasting your time and theirs.<br />
<br />
I sent Torm an ezboard PM informing her that guildmember Steell was a thief and asking her a question.  If she read that email and cared, well.. I would have expected a response, and I would have said more.  When I didn't get one, I didn't say another word until some anon retard tried to sell Steell or a very similar character in the item bazaar, at which point I posted here.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ignore whatever I have to say.  If you want to associate with scum, despite being warned, I'll just laugh when you finally get burned.  If you make an unsecured trade after being told you're dealing with a thief, don't expect pity when you get ripped off.  Some people might consider my post a public service announcement, and even *gasp* appreciate the heads-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nogem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont cosider polite conversation acusing a guild member of being a thief....at all. You have yet to provide proof. All we have to go on is your 'missing' auction or whatever. <br />
<br />
 Nogem- thanks for putting your massive intellect on display for us all to see. <br />
Anytime. Continue worshiping me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kavaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bzzt.  Since Torm posted indicating she actually was interested, she now has more than enough proof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just testing something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The post was there, I nuked it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dalamarn Darkgem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh Nuldar.. bet some people feel like ass now huh?  On one hand, you've got to defend your guildies cause they're your family.  On the other hand, people aren't necessarily POS because they say something you dont want to believe about your friends.  <br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, I appreciate all public service announcements on scammers.  I dont deal in the buy/sell/trade characters business, but there's plenty of other scams people run IG.  The wise would keep a heads up when there's questionable rumors concerning your friends. (Even though it sucks sometimes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Job99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To try and in some way clear my name and TOF from this, I have sent the following to Torm and Kav, the explenation and step to amends, i am not a theif, but that is for you to judge.<br />
I will do what is needed to make amends to kav including returning his property.   My sinceriest appoligies to everyone in anyway involved .<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Kavaren,<br />
 <br />
      I appoliguise for how this has turned out, and it is of corse my fault. I in no way intended to renig on the sale of the account and am not a &quot;thief&quot;, but instead made a bad judgment call that brought this all about.<br />
 <br />
With the posting of steell for sale, i have not tried to sell him a second time, i posted &quot;56 warrior&quot; at the same time i sent you the first email from your post on Ebay, and have not posted again, this explanition will prob mean nothing to you after a renig sale but an explenation you deserve.<br />
 <br />
About 2 weeks after the sale i had quite abit more free time, and begain playing my original account, and thought id give you a holler and see how you were doin.<br />
 <br />
After im guessing 1 1/2 months of not being able to contact you on any of the chars from the account and nolonger having your email address, i had guessed that steel had just been stripped, i let curiosity get the best of me, reset the password and saw the account was expired, and then logged him on and began regearing, i had no idea that it had escalated to this point, Tormentcia had never mentioned any thing nor was she or TOF in anyway aware of the situation, and i had never received any tells concerning this.<br />
 <br />
I happened across your post today, and im sending you this in hopes of making amends, i am not a thief and admit openly that what i did was not the proper thing to do, if you wish to leave the account to rot, well you bought it and its yours to do as you wish, <br />
 Please Email me at    &lt;Priviate&gt;   and i'll send you the password, and we can discuss the matter further.<br />
 <br />
Again i appoliguse for the mess, in no way intended for this to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PrincessRazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How come every account you are involved with Kav has a problem with being ript off???? Just a question<br />
<br />
Razzmataz 1.0<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kavaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What the hell crawled up your ass and died?  When Phalnor got reverted awhile back, it wasn't even my problem, and I didn't like the guy who owned him, but I helped him get the account back anyway.  The tard in this thread has admitted to ripping me off and has offered up some half-assed apology full of blatant lies so pathetic that I refuse to even dignify them with a response.<br />
<br />
You also know from personal experience that there aren't problems with every account I've dealt with.  If you have an issue with me, spit it out, here or in email, because I don't appreciate the insinuation you made, and you know damn well it's false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PrincessRazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was just asking a question just have seen a lot of @#%$ with your name involved, as for you getting dude back Phalnor i dont recall that at all. Not saying you had any thing to do with any of this just wonderd why your name gets involved with so much @#%$ regarding buying and selling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kavaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I emailed you guys to give you the address of the legitimate owner.  Check the pro..@yahoo.com address around 5/16/02. Other than this thread, I've never posted about a problem with an account, and for the simple reason that there hasn't been one.  Everybody else I've bought one from has dealt straight with me.  My name may have come up a few times, but it wasn't about any problems I've had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ginghar Swiftpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think the answer here is a simple one:<br />
<br />
Lets just let Verant handle issues such as this regarding Ebayed accounts.  I am sure in their infinite wisdom and years of experience they have come across this a time or two and would be more than willing to lend some advice and provide as much procedural information to you as they see fit!  After all, nobody likes a scammer!  :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Devla Shadowsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, go ask Verant to sort it out :D <br />
