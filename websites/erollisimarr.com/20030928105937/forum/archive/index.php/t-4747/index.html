<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xarith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Xarien was tired, Xarien was angry.<br />
<br />
And it all can be blamed on that damn Clan McMarrin.<br />
<br />
After giving her heart's life and blood to the Wolves of the North for countless seasons and even more countless battles, she returned home, to Halas, in order to rest. With her then-husband at her side, she set about living what she considered to be a &quot;normal&quot; life. Taking care of house and home, as well as their newborn daughter Severina, she settled into the role of wife and mother.<br />
<br />
Then everything came crashing down.<br />
<br />
Her husband was charged of trying to smuggle contraband into Halas from Qeynos, convicted, and executed in the barest mockeries of a trial. Never mind the fact that there was proof he not only never left Halas, but had nothing to do with it! Xarien herself avoided the same fate when she proved that while she had not been active in the life of an adventurer, she was still a damn sight better with the sword! Having won her challenge, Clan McMarrin whined like the dogs they are to the Clan Council, claiming that her victory was invalid, seeing as her equipment was obviously superior to theirs.<br />
<br />
She watched in horror as the Clan Council, unwilling to lose the support of the McMarrins, sided with them against her. However, Clan Felligan proposed that, rather than execute her, to exile her to the frozen tundra of Everfrost. A punishment Xarien sadly accepted.<br />
<br />
After being escorted to her home to pack their belongings, and then to the pier leading from Halas, she addressed the four people that served as escorts. To Walthor Felligan, she gave thanks, and promised not to forget what he did. To Hetie McDonald, she thanked for the extra supplies. To Kylan O`Danos, she thanked for being her trainer for so many years.<br />
<br />
However, to Andres McMarrin, she spat in his face and vowed the Vengeance of the Warlord upon him, and that justice truly would prevail, upon him and his arrogant Clan. She then stepped onto the platform and left Halas.<br />
<br />
That was fifteen years ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xarith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The current day...<br />
<br />
Severina was now 17, and already a shaman of rising power. Her service to The Tribunal was being noticed, and the quests she performed and completed only added to her growing ability. However, she still remembered her mother's instructions from years ago:<br />
<br />
Find the truth, and let it be known to all.<br />
<br />
Slowly she began poking around in what served as a library in Halas (books really aren't a Northman's idea of entertainment), and asking questions that seemingly served no real purpose, yet gave a faint glimmer of an idea. She followed up on each and every one of these leads, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Until she talked to one of the newest merchants in Halas, Becka McGuzzler. After having helped Becka unload some crates of supplies brought from Erudin, Becka let slip a vague reference to a person that seemed to slip in and out of the shadows, and whose very form seemed to change. Severina mentally noted this, and made like she heard nothing.<br />
<br />
That night, however, she slipped outside the walls of Halas and began looking around cautiously, the ring given to her by a friend providing her with night vision. For hours she searched, looking for tracks, or some other unexplained phenomenon.<br />
<br />
This day, however, she drew a blank.<br />
<br />
However, that doesn't mean that someone wasn't there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Strykker45</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">....Wow, its weird you have an unexplainable way with words that makes it hard to understand yet still unbelievably captivateing, especially for such a short installment, I look forward to the next part..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xarith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">(OOC: *chuckle* Thanks... got a lot of Byron and Shelley in my prose, I think. :)  )<br />
<br />
The hidden person took note of who it was that was attempting to track him, where she came from, who she answered to... then left as quietly as she came.<br />
<br />
Severina, meanwhile, went back into Halas, trying to observe anything unusual from the cloak of invisibility. For days she kept trying, all without success. With a sigh, she headed back to her books, and her studies.<br />
<br />
In the library, the shadows moved to watch her.<br />
<br />
More days of research and observation followed, all of them drawing a blank. Her leads were getting fewer and farther between, and ending in dead ends more rapidly. Even the regular townsfolk, from O`Danos to Rose McDowell, were growing more and more silent each day, as though her searching was becoming obvious...<br />
<br />
...or, she thought, they were being told to stay silent. And who, amongst all of Halas, would not only have the ability to say something to that effect, but to enforce it?<br />
<br />
Clan McMarrin.<br />
<br />
(Edit: couple typos.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xarith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How was she to go about it? On the one hand, she was certain that someone inside might know something. On the other hand, their sheer size precluded directly asking anyone.<br />
<br />
And Barbarians aren't known for subtlety.<br />
<br />
So she'd have to keep doing what she was doing, in being as discreet as possible. Patrol patterns of the guards gave no clues, nor did invisibly eavesdropping on merchants. Silent frustration began to mount as her investigation began to wind down, with no leads and no evidence.<br />
<br />
All the while, the person that watched her since the first day kept to the shadows, except for rare occasions when things like food were needed. However, that's what the illusory arts were for. Which is fortunate that the safe spots were known, else things could be a little more interesting.<br />
<br />
Especially if the true nature of the McMarrin's support were known...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xarith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For days Severina searched, with the city growing more and more silent and distrustful of her. Even the few friends she had made were growing cold and distant, as though they knew what she was doing. Daily the baleful stares continued.<br />
<br />
Then one day, during a blinding snowstorm, she caught a break.<br />
<br />
A gloved hand stuck out of the snow that had piled in drifts in Everfrost Peaks. Approaching it, she saw that it belonged to a Teir`Dal.  What was one doing so far from home? she wondered. Carefully clearing the snow away, she saw it belonged to a warrior-type. Inspecting closer, she saw a locket around his neck.<br />
<br />
A pulse!<br />
<br />
Mortal enemies be damned, she had enough conscience to do something. Putting him over her shoulder, she dropped a shroud of invisibility over the two of them, and carried him to an igloo, rudely evicting the goblin tenant of it with the blunt end of her staff. Setting him down, she began to chant a healing mantra, in hope of reviving him.<br />
<br />
She felt a touch on her ankle, an intense pain... then all went black.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Strykker45</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What is there really to say, I think its looking great, I hope you continue to keep writing this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xarith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Severina awoke in complete darkness. No, that wasn't true, for it was still lit from some strange source. The air was cool and damp around her, and smelled vaguely of a cavern, eerily similar to the one she discovered as a youth. She ran from that cavern in stark terror, after seeing the creature that resided within.<br />
<br />
However, it didn't look like she could run anywhere this time, a fact further reinforced by the iron bars that were the door.<br />
<br />
Slowly assuming a sitting position, her first thought was how to get rid of the massive headache she had. However, the sound of metallic footsteps quickly brought that to a close, especially when she realized that her weapon and her spellbook were missing.<br />
<br />
The door opened, and two Teir`Dal guards entered, wearing full plate armor and carrying their weapons in hand. A third person approached, wearing the garments of a priest. What the priest said shocked and chilled her to the bone:<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father wishes to speak to you.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xarith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Her head spun as the shock and confusion set in.  My father?, she thought.  He's dead... or is he? Knowing of the Teir`Dal's power of necromancy, the thought of seeing her father as a walking corpse made her feel a touch on the ill side. With a shove in the back, she was led out of her cell.<br />
<br />
Flanked by the two guards, and trailed by the cleric, she was escorted deeper into Neriak, where both patrolling guards and stationary ones glared at her as she was led past. She couldn't help but glance around at her surroundings a bit, with the occasional chill breeze blowing forth from the caverns. The buildings were a little small for her, but that could be easily fixed with more experience.<br />
<br />
That is, if she ever got out of here.<br />
<br />
She was led into a large, very elegant estate deep in the interior of Neriak, far from the entrance, and even farther from prying eyes. Brought into the main ballroom, she was told to wait until the lord of the manor arrived. Seeing four guards guarding the two doors, each of them decked out in Neriak's finest (and two of them with skeleton companions), she decided that escaping was futile.<br />
<br />
About ten minutes later, the far door opened, and a gentleman entered the chamber. Dressed up in what could only be the adornments of an enchanter, he was very regal and dignified in his walk and look.  Rather handsome, too. she thought, then mentally kicked herself for it. After all, was she not being held captive in this city by them, and brought here under duplicity and guile?<br />
<br />
All that melted away when he looked at her and said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Neriak, Severina, daughter of Xarien... and myself.&quot;</div></div><hr />
