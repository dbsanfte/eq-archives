        the quest turn-ins while using Form of the Great Bear.
        This quest will only trigger with proper TRUE SPIRIT
        FACTION is detected by the quest NPCs. Reports have been
        received that being in Bear Form during epic-item
        turn-ins may BUG the quest NPCs to misread your True
        Spirit faction and cause the quest trigger to FAIL!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">There are several methods
        for beginning the quest, among which have been reported
        are:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p align="left">Ocean of Tears, loc +800, -5400, <strong>Capt
            Surestout</strong><br>

        </blockquote>
        <p align="left">While the information here is gleened
        from conversations with Capt. Surestout, it is reported
        that any of the above will yield the same information and
        &quot;tiny gem&quot;. Here is the Surestout method of
        beginning the quest:</p>
        <p><strong>Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800,
        -5400, kill Capt Surestout (green con at level 54, one
        ebolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where he's
        killed, hail the spirit. </strong></p>
        <p>Capt Surestout died.<br>
        Your faction standing with PiratesOfGunthak got worse<br>
        Your faction standing with FirionaVie got better<br>
        Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the
        Pirates of Gunthak.. They will avenge me.. Unngh!! <br>
        a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
        a lesser spirit's body pulses with energy.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail a lesser spirit'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life,
        shaman? <br>
        a lesser spirit regards you indifferently -- You could
        probably win this fight.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Yes'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's
        life? Did he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or
        was his death a profit to you in some way? </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'He threatened my life'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to
        see another die, but his heart was black and a great
        nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank
        you for what you have done, shaman. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Who are you?'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as
        important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know
        more, shaman? </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'I wish to know more'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. It
        is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a
        wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to
        where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some
        call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman
        like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell
        you more of the spirits.</p>
