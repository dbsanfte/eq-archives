        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'So, the truth is found! Rak
        mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing
        the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the
        High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that
        was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his
        back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the
        child to rest, Rak may repent of what he has done and the
        mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at
        hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to
        Rak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now,
        go! <br>

                <p><strong>2) Move the rest of the raiding party
                to the opposite side of the room.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>3) Questing shaman hands Lord Rak the
                Tear. Rak will </strong><em><strong>AGRO
                IMMEDIATELY</strong></em><strong>, use his AOE on
                you (likely killing you), but also agroing the
                Fire Pets on him.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>4) Have party stay back and watch the
                show while healers keep the Fire Pets healthy. If
                other mobs pop, the party can attack them, but be
                sure you DO NOT use AOE on those mob pops to
                avoid agroing Rak on the party.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>5) The quest shaman should not move
                toward raid party, but rather stand there and try
                to heal yourself. You'll probably die quickly
                from the AOE. Have a cleric resurrect you back as
                soon as possible, loot the &quot;Iksar
                Scale&quot; and get party out. We fought our way
                back to zone, but evac works as well of course.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>NOTE: The following conversation is not
            necessary. You may, if you wish, simply hand the

        </blockquote>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of
        Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake?
        But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has
        repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he
        was the one who initiated its construction. But is its
        initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn
        said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands
        but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that
        would lead them to destruction. It was the people who
        chose to follow.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What is lost?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of
        thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud
        we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all
        eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a
        sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of
        this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this
        matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at
        the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty
        rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis
        and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child
        from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward
        you with our greatest treasure, the <strong>[Spear of
        Fate]. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of the Spear of Fate?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed
        millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of
        the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he
        is known, had been traveling the world searching out all
        known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and
        experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of
        the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer
        was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to
        directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy
        similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into
        existence one of these <strong>[black holes]</strong>. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of these Black Holes?</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the
        frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here
        that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small
        tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this
        new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but
        their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not
        only drained the spiritual energy of everything within
        its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The
        tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But
        one <strong>[powerful shaman]</strong> stepped forward
        and struck against Miragul's mantle. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What powerful shaman?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to
        pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We
        supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon
        that could pierce the very fabric of the <strong>[cosmos]</strong>.
        First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient
        lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for
        the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using
        nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the
        flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound
        them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally,
        he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an
        aviak elder. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of the cosmos?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but
        it was a force brought into existence. This force was
        positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even
        though it worked like a void, it was still created by an
        imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture
        the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or
        non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger
        volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no
        spirits could even get close to it. In one act of
        devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far
        above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a <strong>[breach]</strong>
        across the planes. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of the breach?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of
        existence created enough negative material to cancel out
        Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect
        that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the
        mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself
        was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear
        that fell from the heavens to the ground where we
        recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish
        you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have
        the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he
        defeated Miragul's mantle. <font size="3">Thank you,
