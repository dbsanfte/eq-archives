        Canibalize II Quest*</font></p>
        <p align="left">Canibalize II, also known as McMerin's
        Feast, is a 39th level shaman spell allowing the shaman
        to &quot;canibalize&quot; their hit points in exhange for
        mana.</p>
        <p align="left">The Canibalize II Quest can be started
        with either &quot;Marlyn McMerin&quot;, the female
        barbarian that sells the alchemy herbs on the docks in
        Firiona Vie, or &quot;Great Oowomp&quot;, the Ogre shaman
        at the ogre raider camp in Timorous Deep for evil
        shamans.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left"><u>Starting the Quest (ogres, trolls and
        iksars)</u></p>
        <p align="left">Ogres and Trolls: Once you hail Great
        Oowomp at the ogre camp in Timorous Deep, he talks of
        having spent time with a great barbarian shaman family
        (The McMerins) and he stole... errr came away with the
        spell McMerin's Feast when he left them. He wants the
        same four components as noted in the barbarian version of
        the quest below. </p>

            <p align="left">Iksar Tip from Fomori: <font size="2"
            face="Verdana,Arial">Ok, just do the quest like you
            see in the web Pages, Never started it with anyone
            just went and done the quest. Now turn in, yes you
            can turn into the ogre in Timerous Deep But i should
            repeat this *BUT* there is an ogre that is in that
            building next to the quest ogre, the quest ogre is
            indifferent to you but when you get close the ogre in
            that hut will attack you and the Quest ogre (Oombaah
            the great or something) will jump in and attack you
            also so you have been warned. you will have to kill
            the ogre in that hut first and there is usually a
            Necro or Druid there killing Oombaah, just wait for
            him/her to kill oombah, wait a couple, then kill the
            Ogre and ask whoever is camping OomBaah to wait for
            you to turn the items in, he will not talk to you so
            just turn the items in, it worked for me, nice chunk
            of exp to!<br>

        <p align="left"><u>Starting the Quest (barbarians)</u></p>
        <p align="left">To start the quest in Firiona Vie, find
        Marlyn McMerin in the barbarian hut on the docks
        (location: <strong>-</strong> 3820 + 1660) and hail her.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'hail Marlyn McMerin' </p>
            <p>Marlyn McMerin says 'Greetings hearty adventurer.
            Searching for the components necessary for fine
            shaman spells are we? I have come to Kunark in
            [search of rare alchemist components], but I have
            found the dangers of Kunark are far too great for me.

            components' </p>
            <p>Marlyn McMerin says 'Grand!! I have heard word of
            four rare components. Clay of Ghiosk, Crushed Dread
            Diamonds and Powder of Yun. Most rare are chips from
            the bones of one who has touched the Bath of Obulus. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><u>Getting the Items</u></p>
        <p>In the simplest terms, the items you need are:</p>
        <p>1) Crushed Dread Diamond, currently obtainable in one
        of two ways:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Method One (difficult):</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Step One: Obtain a Dread Diamond by giving a
                Dufrenite to the Gemcutter Skeleton in the
                Combine City Ruins (city full of pyramids near
                the wizard spire and druid ring in the Autumn or
                Lost Valley - Dreadlands). The Gemcutter must be
                charmed by a high level enchanter/necro as he is
                normally KoS. The Gemcutter will in return give
                you a Dread Diamond, which is tradeable.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Step Two: Obtain a Spectral Pestle from any
                Spectral-type mob in Kaesora, a
                &quot;one-way&quot; dungeon in the Field of
                Bones. They won't give it to you, so you'll have
                to kill them for it. The spawn spot close to the
                zone-in is sometimes the Spectral Guardian,
                reportedly tough but solo-able in early 40's.</p>
                <p><font size="3">Player Tips:</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">&quot;The ghost-type spectrals
                in Kaesora can also drop the Dusty Ransackers
                Pack a 20% weight reducing bag for medium-sized
                items.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">&quot;Spectral pestles can also
                be obtained in trakanon's teeth off of the
                Spectral Iksar ghosts. One has been reportedly
                obtained off of a Spectral Footman. Much easier
                to get there than in Kaesora since it is an
                outdoor zone&quot;</font></p>
                <p>Step Three: Combine the Dread Diamond and the
                Spectral Pestle in your Medicine bag which will
                either</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>1) give you the Crushed Dread Diamond if
                    you succeed, or</p>
                    <p>2) will return the Dread Diamond to you if
                    you fail, </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>requiring you to kill yet another Spectral
                Guardian to gain another Spectral Pestle and make
                another attempt at combining. Not sure of the
                trivial level to combine these items, but I seem
                to recall someone reporting it trivial at 85
                alchemy skill or less, and someone else saying
                two attempts around 50 skill yielded the prize.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Method Two (cakewalk):</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Proceed to Timorous Deep by whatever method
                you prefer. </p>
                <p>Fire up sow and levitation.</p>
                <p>Run to the ice-covered Gorla Island (location:
                -8840, -6080)</p>
                <p>There, fairly close to the shoreline, you'll
                see a bag on the snow-covered ground. Pick it up.
                You'll have a pile of white powder called Crushed
                Diamonds, but which identifies at Crushed Dread
                Diamonds. Others have confirmed that this item
                works for the quest. Some have reported the
                re-spawn time on the bag to be 8 hours. Note, you
                might have to kill the Gorla (white ape) that
                stands near the bag, so cons him first.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>2) Clay of Ghiosk (or strange ochre clay) drops from
        Army Behemoths in the City of Mist - Emerald Jungle.
        Reluctant to part with their clay, you'll likely need to
        get a group to &quot;convince him&quot; to give it up.
        Player Tip: &quot;Go in, cross the bridge, stay to the
        right until you get to the right courtyard. Clear the
        area, then work your way to the top of the small pyramid
        there. He's in the upper deck, which you can't walk to,
        but can aggro pull him from there. Least that's how I've
        done it 3 times now.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>3) Bones of Obulus (or greyish bones) drops from the
        Skeletal Warlord in Karnor's Castle - Dreadlands. Note,
        he also drops the Jarsath Bracer (ac 8, wis +4).
        Sometimes, one can simply shout for looting rights on the
        bones since they are of zero use to anyone but a shaman
        doing this quest. This is a very tough dungeon, however,
        considering Canibalize II is a level 39 spell, so use
        extreme caution or have a powerful, well-balanced,
        mid-forties or higher group. Some shamans have been known
        to simply wait near the relative safety of the zone for a
        &quot;train-kill&quot; and ask to loot the Warlord.</p>
        <p>4) Powder of Yun (or shaman powder) can be obtained
        from Yun Shamans in Trakanon's Teeth. Note that the
        powder is black in color, not white! Accept no
        substitutes. The correct powder must be obtained from Yun
        Shamans in particular (not other shamans), in Trakanon's
        Teeth (not Firiona Vie) and must be black! He won't give
        it to you? Smack that froggie down!</p>
        <p><u>Completing the Quest</u></p>
        <p>Return the 4 items to either Marlyn McMerin on the
        docks in Firiona Vie, or Great Oowomp at the ogre camp in
        Timorous Deep, and you will be rewarded with the scroll
        McMerin's Feast (Canibalize II), a 39th level spell that
        is less efficient than Canibalize I in terms of hit point
        to mana tradeoff, but that can be a faster way to regain
        mana in groups, especially if there's a healer with you
        willing to pass along a few heals in the process.</p>
