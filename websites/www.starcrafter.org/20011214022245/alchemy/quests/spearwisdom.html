            <p><strong>TIP: You can stand at neg 500 neg 5300 in
            West Karana and he will path by you. I've now done
            this twice and never waited more than 20 - 30 min
            tops. He will also path by Tower 2, actually
            colliding with it on his journey. Just keep looking
            around so he doesn't slip by you. . . . - Belgar</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Once spotted, run up to him and Hail him
            repeatedly at close range to get him to stop moving.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail a wandering spirit'</strong></p>
        <p>a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a
        moment. It seems to be regarding you with interest. </p>

        <p>a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good!
        You must hurry before it's too late. Go now to the
        Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your
        help quickly! They will know you when they see you and
        instruct you on how you can help, but you must hurry!<br>

        You gain experience!! </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Head to Rathe Mountains. You'll find
            Tabien the Goodly (approx level 32) at loc pos 6300,
            pos 1550. If you talk to him, the conversation is as
            follows:</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail Tabien the Goodly'</strong></p>
        <p>Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here,
        Waring . I was beginning to think I would be abandoned in
        my time of need. I have a [<strong>task</strong>] for you
        to complete in the name of my patron Mithaniel Marr. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What task?'</strong></p>
        <p>Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once
        have been shining and regal but is now scoured in cuts,
        dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is known
        as Marr's Promise. It is a sacred relic that was actually
        used by one of Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor.
        Its value to our church is immeasurable and I have been
        charged with the protection of it. However, a patriarch
        of the false god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and
        me. He must be stopped! Please, destroy him and bring me
        proof of his death. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>The other one is Glaron the Wicked (approx
            level 32), his loc is pos 2900, neg 1900. If you talk
            to him, the conversation is as follows:</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail Glaron the Wicked'</strong></p>
        <p>Glaron the Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to
        help our cause? I should have known they would send a
        green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and myself. Very
        well, you will have to suffice. I have a [<strong>task</strong>]
        you must fulfill if you wish to know the blessing of my
        god and impress your masters.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What task?'</strong></p>
        <p>Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking
        bone dagger and there is a horrid, diseased stench as
        soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade, shorter
        and wider than the first, of blackened bone with a larger
        than normal hilt, obviously for defense. He says, 'This
        festering blade is called Woe, and this scorched one is
        called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay by
        Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the
        protection of such holy relics. However, there is one in
        these very mountains who seeks to destroy these relics.
        End this idiot follower of Marr's life and bring me
        proof.' </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Now both these guys are fools, what do we
            do with fools? We kill them. Take their items (Envy,
            Woe and Marr's Promise) back to West Karana and give
            all three to the wandering spirit at the same time.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>NOTE: Marr's Promise will not fit into any
            bag, except either a Tinker's Bag or a Large Sewing
            Kit, for it's huge size.</strong></p>

        a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the
        test, keep up the good work.<br>
        a wandering spirit says 'It is unfortunate that it came
        to this, but nothing else was to be done. Both paragons
        had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items
        given to them. The mere protection of these material
        belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or
        Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in
        their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and
        acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the
        three treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood
        of possession, the [<strong>Shield of Falsehood</strong>].
        You have walked the path and now, as your final test, we
        must set you along one [<strong>last path</strong>].<br>
        Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
        You gain experience!!</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What shield of falsehood?'</strong></p>
        <p>a wandering spirit says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's
        Promise along with Woe and Envy and fashioned them
        together to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this in
        defense of possession and the weakness that comes with
        hoarding treasure instead of using it to accomplish your
        goals. May it serve you well, Barbarian.</p>
        <p><strong>Congratulations. You have now received ...</strong></p>

        <p><strong>You say, 'What last path?'</strong></p>
        <p>a wandering spirit says 'You have trusted us along the
        paths we have set before you. You have been known to be
        patient and await the right moment. And now, you have
        learned the wisdom to act in our best interest. However,
        one last path awaits, to determine if you have the
        ability to act out what must be done. There are many
        troubles about the world we try to rub out but none is
        more serious than the curse on what the wasichu call the
        Emerald Jungle. Go there and find one of our spirits.
        Show them the gem you have been given and follow the path
        they set you on.</p>
