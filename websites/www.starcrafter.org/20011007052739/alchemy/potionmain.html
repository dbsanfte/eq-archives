        <p align="left">In order to take full advantage of this
        intriguing aspect to Everquest, a complete understanding
        of exactly what each potion will do is crucial.</p>
        <p align="left">When Verant first revamped the old
        alchemy into the new alchemy, many shamans on many
        servers spent untold hours and many thousands of platinum
        discovering its secrets by trial and error. Many potions
        have been discovered, and there are likely others still
        to be discovered. For the time being, we do have quite a
        few potions (59 at last count) to work with. </p>
        <p align="left">The following information will be vital
        in determining which potions you might need, and which
        you do not.</p>

            melee battle since the negative charisma won't effect
            combat outcome. If you're fighting a poisoning mob,
            so much the better Purity becomes.</p>

            Null or Antibody for battles against necromancers or
            other disease-riddled mobs. It's all about having an

                <p><strong><u>Kilva's Blistering Flesh</u></strong>

                damage shield lasting <u>approximately</u> (level
                of the drinker/4) minutes. Damage is equivalent
                to the (level of the drinker/4) + 1. Hence, a
                level 40 drinker would benefit from an
                approximate 10 minute (40 / 4) <font
                color="#80FF80">damage shield doing 11 points of
                damage</font> ( 40 / 4 + 1). At an average price
                of 17 pp, this potion is more popular with higher
                level drinkers due to the increased damage and
                duration. Also note that <font color="#80FF80">this

                damage shield lasting <u>approximately</u> (level
                of the drinker/4). Damage is equivalent to the
                (level of the drinker/2) + 1. Hence, a level 40
                drinker would benefit from a approximate 10

                shield doing 21 points of damage</font> ( 40 / 2
                + 1). At an average price of 30 pp, this potion
                is more popular with higher level drinkers due to
                the increased damage and duration. Also note that
                <font color="#80FF80">this damage shield WILL

                and works instantly. At an average price of 12 pp
                5 gp, a very handy potion to keep around for mid
                to high level players. <font color="#FFFF80">Stronger

                potion for Barbarians, Humans and Erudites that
                have no &quot;night-sight&quot; spells and, to
                many, worth the 18 pp average price per potion to

                duration of approximately 27 minutes. A fairly

                Swamp with exactly a 30 second

                non-gating, non-porting, non-evacing classes and
                well worth the pricy 375 pp average cost to

                for approximately 3 minutes. While a very popular
                effect for melee'ers, a fairly expensive potion
                at 55 pp average price considering the short
                duration.</p>

                creatures. Like most invisible spells, duration
                may fluctuate. Very useful in the areas like
                Lower Guk (dead side), Combine City (Dreadlands),
                Keasora, and elsewhere. Worth the 20 pp average
                price in many instances when you'd like to enter
                or leave an area without agro'ing everything in
                your path.</p>

            <p><strong>TIP: </strong>Whether you need a utility
            potion for some specific mission or raid, or whether
            you just want to keep a few around for emergency
            purposes (the most likely reason), these utility
            potions can give you the edge you need to survive,
            conquer or escape death and the xp loss that death
            conjurs. Ask yourself, &quot;Is it worth a half
            bubble of lost xp to gobble down a potion at the
            right moment?&quot; The answer is academic. A tank
            walking out of the Frenzied room in Guk would find an
            Unlife Awareness potion handy. Being stuck alone deep
            in a dungeon or on the planes after going link dead
            could be disastrous without a gate potion. There are
            a thousand different situations where you may find
            yourself needing a potion.</p>
