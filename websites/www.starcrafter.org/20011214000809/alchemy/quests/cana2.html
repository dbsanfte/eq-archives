            color="#F0C664" size="2" face="Verdana,Arial">Ok,
            just do the quest like you see in the web Pages,
            Never started it with anyone just went and done the
            quest. Now turn in, yes you can turn into the ogre in
            Timerous Deep But i should repeat this *BUT* there is
            an ogre that is in that building next to the quest
            ogre, the quest ogre is indifferent to you but when
            you get close the ogre in that hut will attack you
            and the Quest ogre (Oombaah the great or something)
            will jump in and attack you also so you have been
            warned. you will have to kill the ogre in that hut
            first and there is usually a Necro or Druid there
            killing Oombaah, just wait for him/her to kill
            oombah, wait a couple, then kill the Ogre and ask
            whoever is camping OomBaah to wait for you to turn
            the items in, he will not talk to you so just turn
            the items in, it worked for me, nice chunk of exp to!<br>

                the Field of Bones. They won't give it to you, so
                you'll have to kill them for it. The spawn spot
                close to the zone-in is sometimes the Spectral
