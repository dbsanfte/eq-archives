            <p><font size="3"><em><strong>From the Ruins of
            Kunark Players Manual (</strong></em><em><strong><u>emphasis
            added</u></strong></em><em><strong>):</strong></em></font></p>
            <p><font size="4">Strength:</font> Physical strength;
            affects how much you can carry, <em><u>how much melee
            damage you deliver to a target</u></em>, and how fast
            you learn some skills.</p>
            <p><font size="4">Stamina:</font> Health and
            constitution; <em><u>affects your maximum number of
            hit points</u></em> at each level.</p>
            <p><font size="4">Dexterity:</font> Coordination;
            affects <em><u>how much damage you deliver with a bow
            or thrown weapon</u></em> and <em><u>time between
            attacks</u></em>, how fast you learn certain skills,
            and <em><u>how often certain spells and weapons hit
            their mark</u></em>. Also affects some skills and <em><u>Bard
            songs</u></em>.</p>
            <p><font size="4">Agility: </font>Physical ability;
            affects <em><u>your probability of being hit in
            combat</u></em> and <em><u>how much damage you take
            per hit</u></em>, and how fast you learn some skills.</p>
            <p><font size="4">Intelligence:</font> Affects how
            fast you learn many skills. For a Necromancer,
            Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Shadow Knight or Bard,
            it also affects maximum mana at each level.</p>
            <p><font size="4">Wisdom:</font> Affects how fast you
            learn specific skills. For a Ranger, Paladin, Cleric,
            Shaman or Druid, it also affects maximum mana at each
            level.</p>
            <p><font size="4">Charisma: </font><em><u>How various
            factions react </u></em>to you; <em><u>affects prices</u></em>
            for some merchants. Also <em><u>affects spell effects
            for Enchanters and Bards</u></em>, and <em><u>helps
            Bards successfully play more notes</u></em>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em><strong><u>And then, from Brad
            &quot;Aradune&quot; McQuaid:</u></strong></em></p>
            <p>In working with the people doing the strategy
            guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with
            general information as to what the stats do. </p>
            <p>I'm going to post them here. </p>
            <p>This is a change in the sense that we were not
            going to discuss them or release more info. We
            changed our minds. </p>
            <p>That said, we're not posting any formulas, and
            it's absolutely true that some stats have
            considerably more direct impact on gameplay than
            others. </p>
            <p>We're posting this for clarification, and because
            previous explanations have not been accurate (manual,
            etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our
            stance on how much some stats affect game play is
            that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of
            twinking. Are there better attribute systems out
            there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something
            as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the
            game's been out for more than a year. </p>
            <p>Anyway, here you go: </p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>DEX:</strong></font> how
            quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon
            will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how
            hard you hit with bows </p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>STR:</strong></font><strong>
            </strong>determines how much you can carry;
            influences maximum and average damage; influences how
            quickly you learn many offensive skills </p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>STA: </strong></font>affects
            how many hit points you have, how long you can hold
            your breath </p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>INT:</strong></font>
            directly affects how quickly you can learn most
            skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all
            mages, as well as shadow knights </p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>WIS:</strong></font>
            affects the amount of mana the priest classes have,
            also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn
            many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT. </p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>CHA:</strong></font>
            affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC
            merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects
            the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells
            (charms in particular) </p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>AGI:</strong></font>
            affects how quickly you can learn some defensive
            skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how
            much damage you take when you are hit </p>
