        to All Shamans</font></h3>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Fellow Shamans,</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Our new, revamped alchemy
        has been around for about six months now, and due to the
        hard, diligent work of many shamans, we are finally
        getting some good numbers on trivial levels put together.
        Yet, we know that some of these numbers may be off a few
        digits or more. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">As each of us increases
        our skill, we attempt to discover the exact point where a
        potion goes trivial, but we cannot always be successful.
        Sometimes we have only been able to establish a range of
        &quot;greater than&quot; or &quot;less than&quot;
        numbers. Other times a report from a shaman has been
        relied upon, but not necessarily confirmed, creating the
        possibility of incorrect trivial numbers.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">For this reason, and in
        order to get our alchemy information as accurate as other
        trade skills, we would like to ask all shamans,
        especially the younger ones who are just starting out, to
        fill in missing information, or correct mistakes, on the
        trivial chart as they advance their skill.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">To help us out, print the
        latest trivial chart (the printable version might be
        easier) and as you practive your craft for skill
        increases, attempt to confirm or disaffirm the trivial
        numbers listed. When you are <em>absolutely positive</em>
        you have <u>discovered a mistake</u> <em>or</em> <u>confirmed
        a correct trivial number</u>, mark your trivial chart
        accordingly.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Note that in order to
        actually <em>confirm the accuracy of a trivial number</em>,
        you must:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font size="3">1) make <u>at least
            one</u> of a given potion when it <u>wasn't trivial</u>,
            </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font size="3">2) attempt to <u>make
            one more</u> of the same potion (success or failure)
            that <u>raised your skill by one</u>,</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font size="3">3) and finally, <u>make
            one more</u> of the same potion that gives you the
            message <em>&quot;You can no longer advance in skill
            from making this item&quot;</em>, </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">thereby indicated that the
        given potion did, in fact, <u>become trivial at that
        number</u>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Then, post your finding(s)
        on </font><a

        information about our unique craft.</font></p>
