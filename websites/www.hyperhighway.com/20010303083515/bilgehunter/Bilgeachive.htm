Bilge News 05/19/00 : Quick Update</font></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
      Added a few Kunark Shots...will update again this weekend.
      <br>
<br>
<span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 05/15/00 : Ho, Hum</span><br>
      A few shots from the &quot;old&quot; lands, one from the new.
      Besides that nothing to report, except I'm going though the old files and
      I have alot of &quot;semi&quot; rare shots I'm going to add. Should be
      about 45-50 pictures.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 05/6/00 : Got a few shots</span><br>
      I think you will like today's update, I have a pretty
      good idea what it took to get into the area to take a lot of these. Its not
      easy....Once again, please submit shots in a windowed form, as you see the
      shots to the left. I will not, and do not post full screen shots. Simple
      reason is this, I get a lot of fakes. Its harder to fake a shot in window
      mode. Also, I personally finding a lot of named stuff is not dropping any
      items. There are several named mobs that my guild has killed many times
      that I'm not adding here because they don't drop JACK. Froglok01 and
      Billtoad are pretty much that same thing if Bill doesn't have
      anything...get it? :) Because of this I have removed Knight Dragol for the
      time being.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In other news...You will not I have separated Kunark,
      and GM events out of the main gallery. I think this makes the page
      cleaner.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The other night a few of my guildmates were camping Ogre Guards in Freerot
      for XP, and they got attacked by a few GM's posing as Brown Lizards. My
      group was in Trak's Teeth so we gated to help out. Needless to say they
      didn't expect the 51st lvl enchanter we had with us. Dariys (the
      enchanter) had fun mesing the GM's so we could taunt them verbally. We
      took out 2 of the 4 with no losses on our side. Nothing fancy on them, but
      my new twink will get himself a Bibs. All and all it was just HUGE
      fun.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Got a GM event story? Send it with the best shot you
      have...I'll try and post it.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 05/5/00 : Fun in Trak's Teeth</span><br>
      My guild and I spent some time in good ol'TT last
      night. Found a few rare mobs and a couple of nice items. Meanwhile, I
      still haven't gotten a single shot from anyone in Kunark. Shame on you all
      :P<br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 04/30/00 : Fast Update</span><br>
      4 rare/semi rares, that I have seen in Kunark. I have not received ANY
      Kunark shots yet. WTF??!?!?!? Someone start taking shots please.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 04/23/00 : Rules, Thoughts, and ROK.</span><br>
      Alright, first off I'm going to restate the submission
      rules for the Bilge Hunter:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1. ALL files must be submitted in .JPEG form. Any and
      all Bitmaps get trashed instantly. They take a week to get through my mail
      and clog it all up.<br>
      <br>
      2. Must be a spawn not already listed on the
      page.<br>
      <br>
      3. Please try and keep all shots in fight window form, I don't want full
      screens as I like to know who took the shot. I get a lot of fake shots,
      its harder to fake a shot in with text etc.<br>
      <br>
      4. Until we can determine what is rare and non rare in ROK, any spawn that
      drops a MAGIC item we will consider it rare, for this page. If you can
      submit a shot of what it dropped.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      On an other thought, ROK is something we have been looking forward to a
      long time, please try and make everyone's trip fun and exciting. Let toss
      aside the BS for this people, and just try and have fun.<br>
<br>

Bilge News 04/17/00 : Bad, BAD DORF.</span><br>
      Ok, I've been a bad page update man. I know, I know. You
      all hate me, right?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To be honest I took about a month off EQ, and then
      fell back into it. I have been spending most of my time working on my
      Dwarf Cleric, my AEGIS wearing dorf cleric:)<br>
      <br>
      So here's a few rares I have in the files, and I hope to update again as
      soon as we get ROK going !</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also you will note:&nbsp; I removed the spawn info.
      This is NOT a spoiler site, I never wanted it to be. I'm going back to my
      old ways, because plain and simple I wasn't happy with the spoiler idea.
      This will help me update the site more. If you don't like it, umm, tough
      :P.<br>
<br>
<span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 02/26/00 : Yes, I'm still alive...</span><br>
      I know, I know...I haven't been updating the page. To be
      honest I haven't been playing a lot of EQ either. I'm at a weird point in
      the game, not to interested in hunting the same crap, and therefore not to
      interested in playing. Needless to say my guild is a bit upset, and this
      page has suffered for it.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In other news I have been playing a lot of Sony's ChronX, a collectible
      online card game. Its pretty cool, check it out <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/chronx/index.jhtml">here</a>.
      If you happen to get into it let me know, as they have a &quot;buddy&quot;
      program which gives cards to people who get others into the game. If you
      so register for the game, and use my # for a reference, I get a free pack
      of cards. My player number is 39200. In return I'll give all these cards
      to you, minus the rare. Its a good way to get alot of uncommon/common
      cards to get you started.<br>
      <br>
      I will be updating the page more, so keep dropping by.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 01/31/00 : Not much going on but...</span><br>
      Ok, here's the deal, I'm not posting anymore shots
      in &quot;full screen&quot; mode. I have mentioned this before and this is
      why. First off I like to know if the person sending me the shot actually
      took the shot. Secondly its much simpler to &quot;fake&quot; a shot in
      full screen mode. I get about 12 fakes a weeks, you wouldn't believe it. I
      have to pretty much open every named spawn I don't know with several
      editing programs and check the shot. Its pretty easy to tell the fakes.
      Also Gary Coleman faces on gnoll bodies tend to give it away :)<br>
      <br>
      I'd like to get more shots from the Planes - I really don't care if its
      rare or not, 90% of the people out there haven't seen the planes, and some
      of the cool mobs there...SEND ME SHOTS.<br>
      <br>
      My twink Cabbot made 20th level.../surname Ancostello. I hope someone gets
      that....<br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 01/25/00 : Little Update...Part Deux</span><br>
      Tonight's update is shots I've taken either with Arturum my Cleric, or my twink Cabbot. Hope you like them.
      They are special to me as my guildmates are named in a couple.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 01/24/00 : Little Update...</span><br>
      Added a few new shots, going to update again in the next few
      days...

Bilge News 01/21/00 : BIG UPDATE! New Look, New BP, Winner!</span><br>
      Ok, first off I have to thank someone. Tonight I was
      hunting in Lguk, and started taking to a druid named Durinn that I had
      grouped with a few nights before. He informed me that he had acquired a
      Cleric Quest BP, and wanted to know if I was interested in it. We worked
      out what I felt was a good deal, 200pp , a Mammoth Cloak, and a set of Paw
      Gloves. I've been looking for this thing since November, I think I look
      cool, <a href="images/Hunter/used/eq000086.jpg">heh check me out</a>. Durinn
      will be added to the Hall of Fame Hunters for this great feat.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Next you will notice the lack of frames on the page anymore. I'm trying to
      speed things up a bit. Let me know if it seems faster. ALSO I'm still
      looking for a new server, anyone out there want to help The Hunter find a
      new home?&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Last week the Xegony Prize for 800pp for a live shot of Bilge was won.
      Congrats to Ceylin of Xegony! You will be added to the Hall of Fame
      Hunters also, send me a shot of your druidness.<br>
      <br>
      I have about 60 rare spawns to add to the page. I'll try to get 10 a week
      up, shouldn't be a problem. I also trashed a few pictures that didn't
      follow the basic rules...once again they can be <a href="#rules" target="_self">found
      here</a>.<br>
      <br>
      To the guy that Ninja Looted the FBSS from my group tonight and then did a
      really quick /quit, I know who you are. I USED to trust you. You ticked of
      a 41 and 2 50th lvl Clerics....VERY VERY DUMB.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 01/14/00 : Info is gathering...</span><br>
      I have the basics of the spawn info submission form done,
and its live and working. Please feel free to use it, or send me more ideas for
it. I'm going to do pull downs etc for the zones when I get the chance to get to
it. Some info has been collected and can be viewed but clicking the link to the
right of the spawn link. Until Later...<br>
<br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 01/12/00 : Yea, Yea, I hate rules too, but....</span><br>
      Alright, I've been getting info collected, and will be placing it all
into a Database this week. IF you have sent in a Rare Spawn Shot, and it has not
yet reached the page, there maybe several reasons for this:</font>
      </p>
<p><a name="Rules"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) </font> </a> <font size="2" face="Arial"> The Shot was sent to me as a bitmap file, I have said before I will not
post bitmaps, and just getting them equals the mail going into the TRASH. WHY?
They clog the mail, and slow the whole thing down, and really piss me off.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) I have just yet to get to the submission, I have about 30 shots I have yet
to get to. Please don't send me the shots again unless I request it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3) Hated the shot...Yea, some of these screenshots I have gotten are really
really poor, I'd rather wait until someone else sends in the same spawn.<br>
<br>
4) You didn't take the shot yourself. I'm not trying to get shots out of
EQvaults Archives or the many other sites out there. I want original shots, new
angles people haven't seen etc. I'm also more willing to put a up a shot if I
can see the persons name in the picture.<br>
<br>
5) I already have a shot up of that spawn, or have one in my archives yet to hit
the page. I try to put the best shot on the site. You would not believe the
number of shots I get of the same spawn, or the famous &quot;this is really
really rare&quot; spawn, and to be honest its not rare at all. I can set my
watch by Dr. Dvinn in Crushbone, he is NOT rare.<br>
<br>
I hate playing the rules game, its total BS I know, but on the other hand I
gotta have some sort of rules, if I don't things get ugly. Feel free to send me
HATE mail, I haven't gotten any in a while...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Please keep sending in that info on the spawns....Will work on Database
tonight after dinner.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 01/10/00 : Part 2</span><br>
Ok, got the submission form going, please feel free to try
it out, I'm beta testing the whole thing myself tonight. Click that button up
top left.<br>
<br>
      <span style="background-color: #00CC66">
Bilge News 01/10/00 : Yea, Yea, I'm still alive...</span><br>
Ok, lots on new things going on here. First, I'm going to be getting my
own URL and switching servers here in the VERY near future. I need more
bandwidth and speed to really make things work on the site like I want to.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Secondly, I will be changing the format of the page a bit. As many of you
requested I will be adding more info on where these rare spawns can be found. As
I am not the Oracle of &quot;All things EQ&quot;, I'm going to set up a
submission section for the site. Basically you guys get to help me out here.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I've been playing a lot of EQ, both with my Warrior Twink (now 18th) and my
Cleric (almost 41st), so I'm sorry about the lack of updates. Of course I see
all my rare spawn sighting while playing the Warrior, and needless to say he
gets worked attacking those 30 - 40th lvl mobs that have the cool toys....</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That's about it for now...off to play some EQ.</font></p>

      <p><span style="background-color: #00CC66">
<font size="2" face="Arial">
Bilge News 01/03/00 : Fast update. Oh and Happy B-day to us!</font></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
      <font color="#000000">Today is 2 months since I started the
Bilge Hunter, thank you all for the support, 18k hits is just insane. I will
keep up the page as long as you all keep dropping by!</font><br>
<br>
      I've been playing alot of EQ, and not had the time to
update. This is going to change I promise. I was playing my 14th lvl Warrior
tonight, and saw a rare spawn, funny that I didn't have a Lockjaw shot yet...The
picture was taken right before : Loading...Please Wait. - Needless to say a 14th
warrior, druid and cleric (both oom) can't take LJ easy...but we did buy the
stick from the warrior that killed him after I died.<br>
<br>
I got the following letter, and am considering the ideas in it...give me your
thoughts on this folks...is this what I should do with the Hunter? :<br>
      <br>
      Conceptually (sp?), the web page is great. To my knowledge, there are no other websites out there focusing on rare spawns. I
humbly suggest, that a way to really improve your site is to add more background info on each spawn, rather than just having a collection of
pictures.<br>
<br>
Each spawn should at least have the basic info: What zone is the spawn in? What is the lvl of the spawn? is it a place-held spawn, random, timed, or triggered spawn (If known). What does it drop? Is the drop a quest item? Which quest? Is the quest class specific? Even if it is class-specific reward, can anyone do the quest? (Why bother to kill a rare spawn if it drops something only a cleric can use and ruin the chances for a cleric of getting a no drop item he/she needs when your some other class). Most people only play EQ for a few hours a week and are not in a position to ever see most rare spawns. Also, some where between lvl 25-30 people start seriously
pursuing quest items to get the treasured items they are looking for and to break up the monotony of hunting for exp. The information can be presented in a way that would encourage more
cooperative role-playing (&quot;Lets see if we can find x spawn today, and kill x and pick up x, y, and z items for character x, y, and z along the way&quot;). This info would be really useful to everyone that plays EQ.<br>
<br>
It would also be nice to hear the stories of the people submitting the spawns, I
know I get really excited when I trip across a rare spawn and want to tell every friend every detail. And
I've found that people get really excited for you (after the jealousy wear off :&gt;).<br>
<br>
Your site could really fill a niche.<br>
<br>

Bilge News 12/24/99 : Xmas Eve Update, Merry Christmas from The Hunter!<br>
Well I'm updating from my parents house and using some older

(ick).
Gotta love that 14.4 modem. This will prolly tweak the page some, but I'll fix it Sunday

Bilge News 12/21/99 : I'm back, and we got a new PR guy...<br>
So I'm back from the Pacific-Northwest. I had a great time and now
I'm really tempted to move up there.<br>
<br>
A few issues about the page:<br>
<br>
As you can see I've gone a bit more gray with the page, the green was really really ugly,
and needed a fix. You will also notice the new title bar from Arawn at <a href="http://www.studio-erebus.com/">Studio Erebus</a>.<br>
<br>
I know the load times are slow, I'm working on fixing this asap. The traffic is too high
not to fix this issue. I'll also be venturing into either Ads on the page or some kind of
Tee Shirt sales perhaps...I was thinking about &quot;Have you seen Bilge???&quot; shirts.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the screenshots I got while I was away...in the future try to send
JPEGs,
we web geeks hate bitmaps over the mail....takes forever. Also if I get 3 or four shots of
the same spawn, I'm going to post the best one. I'm also more likely to post a shot with
not in full screen mode, as I like to have a name to go with the spawn. This is for future
contests etc. For example I got about 12 Quillmane shots this weekend, the one on the left
is really clear, and from the best angle. I wish I could post them all trust me, but I
don't have the time or the room to do so. There is also a fine line between rare spawns
and something not rare...I got several shots of things this weekend that spawn pretty much
every 6 mins. Most of the spawns I have posted here are damn hard to find.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I haven' t been taking my usual &quot;shots&quot; at Ol'Verant as of late, BUT tonight I
was thinking about Gordon &quot;Abashi&quot; Wrinn the new PR guy at Verant. Now I like a
good spin as far as the next guy, and while I think having a full time PR man is needed
for EQ, some of Gordy's posts make me laugh. It also cracks me up how every news site out
there is using his posts for filler. Therefore not to fall behind the times the
Bilgehunter has hired our own PR man to answer questions of the EQ sort. Let me introduce
you all to Ogre Warrior and GM, Gor-duh-n, feel free to send those light hearted questions
to him. Tonight he will answer 3 questions sent in from our readers.<br>
<br>
Question 1: When are the Plane of Air and new Erud zones going to go live? I really would
like to hunt there with my 5th lvl Twink.<br>
<br>
Da Plane of Air and dem other places you talk 'bout are already open dum
hummie.
Gor-duh-n goes der all de time. Me barsh up big mobbys and gets big armors and fightin
toys. Me go to Plane of Fur too and me brash da ghoul pimps and hag ho. Me get da blow up
doll of de woodelf, me like dat toy alot.<br>
<br>
Question 2: Why don't we see more of Brad's Aradune on the servers? I think he should be
more active in the game. Does Brad even play EQ anymore?<br>
<br>

Bilge News 12/16/99 : Away for the weekend...<br>
I'm heading off to Seattle for the weekend to visit some long term
guildmates, we have known each other through 3 games and every few months we have a get
together somewhere. If you ever have the chance to meet your online friends, I would do
it.<br>
<br>
In other news, I get alot of mail asking me where these rare spawns appear and why I don't
post more info on them. To be honest, I usually just get the shot alone and get little
info, I also think that any info on where these spawn kind of ruins the whole idea of
hunting for something.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Have a good weekend, see you Tuesday.<br>
<br>
Bilge News 12/13/99 : I'd like feedback on this Rant - Vendors and EQ<br>
I was thinking tonight about the extra gear I tend to pack around in EQ with me. I
call it my &quot;adventurers pack&quot;, and I refill it at the end of the night if I use
any of the items:<br>
<br>
4 Enduring Breath Potions<br>
4 Invisibility Potions<br>
20 Bandages<br>
40 Jasper - The component for Cleric Symbol<br>
A pumice stone - 5 charges of Enchantment Removal<br>
My Mask of the Deceiver<br>
20 Food - Summoned<br>
20 Water - Summoned</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Every single one of these items has been very useful to me while playing EQ. Nothing
like uncharming a 46th level Ranger with 2 SSOY's and a Haste Sash while he is wacking on
me. Now I figure most of you carry some items at all times such as these, and I'm
interested in what they are. Drop me a line, I'd like to see what you carry around.<br>
<br>
Now it wouldn't be right to have a nice little intro like that and not have a RANT to
follow it so....<br>
<br>
I'd like to see Verant put more useful items for sale on Vendors, I have tried all the
potions out there, except the over priced GATE, and found most of them WORTHLESS. I have
played several MUDs and spent to much time playing UO, and I have yet to see a CRPG have a
working economy.<br>
<br>
This is what happens: Player A finds something, if its good he either keeps it (which can
lead to Hoarding of Items) or sells/trades it to another player. Good items do not go back
to vendors. In EQ these items are found again and again, flooding the market with them and
decreasing their value.<br>
<br>
If the found item is basically worthless it is sold to a vendor, priced up by the vendor,
and usually never goes back into the economy. Once bronze plate had value in trade or sale
to others, now its given away or sold to vendors.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Players gather huge bank accounts of cash, selling these worthless items, and little of
that cash goes back into the Economy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">IMHO Verant should revamp the items sold on vendors, giving us perhaps such options as:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A Weak Clarity Potion<br>
A Better Healing Potion<br>
A SOW Potion<br>
More bags worth a damn, such as the Tinkers Bag<br>
Stones with Charges of Certain Spells:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such as a stone with 2 casts of Valor<br>
<br>
Now I can hear the panic from Druids, Enchanters and Clerics already, &quot;but those are
our spells, whine, whine...&quot; but to be honest I'd rather have a tank buy a rock
somewhere then have me: sit down, mem Valor, stand, cast, sit, forget valor, mem my stun
again, and lose the mana.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 copper....</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bilge News 12/11/99 : Ode to Old Paw<br>
Oh Paw, Oh Paw<br>
Will I miss thee?<br>

I'm running out of rare spawn picts again! I have 8 I have yet to post. Please if
you have any not on the page already: <a href="mailto:Arturum@neteze.com">SEND THEM</a>.<br>
<br>
Bilge News 12/10/99 : Sorry had to level...Thanks...Rumors...<br>
First off I'm working on a new layout, let me know what you think.<br>
<br>
I've been spending alot of nights working on getting to my next
spell level, 39th. I want to thank a few folks for the help in the last few
nights...EVERYONE in my guild for support, and Atropos, Kell, and Mod from Sol B. If you
read the page you know I spent a really really long time in 35th, and making 39th in about
a 11 days really felt great.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I have to give credit where credit is due. Tenian Thorongil on the Bristlebane
server has been sending me rare spawns right and left, many of the shots you see here are
his. He and Dragan of Xegony have both earned the title of &quot;Bilge Hunter&quot;. I
hope they continue to send in those great shots. Tenain and Dragan will become
&quot;rare&quot; spawns themselves as I am adding shots of them to the files. At least as
soon as they both send me a picture of themselves.<br>
<br>
Stole this off EQvault:<br>
Gordon &quot;Abashi&quot; Wrinn, Verant's Internet Relations Manager, made a few posts
recently on the official EQ forums on two different subjects. Here's the first bit on
class specific armor:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are aware of some disparities regarding the difficulty of obtaining some of the
  class specific armor. You should start to see improvement with the next patch.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Notice here that it doesn't say anything about changing the REALLY BAD STATS on the
Armor...I'd rather have the Warrior helm on my level 1 Twink, then the Cleric BP...sigh<br>
<br>
Rumor Mill: Expect Paw to go live Friday or Saturday...There is no replacement for the
manastone on the EE in Lguk, therefore if you hunt this mob and don't get a bag, it should
have been a manastone...nah nah :P, bet that would make ya feel great...The Plane of Fur
should be getting a Revamp in the next few days, included are quests for items so
unbalanced that they will be removed from the game as you loot them, unfortunately the
spawns that drop these items are all named Bilge, Hadden, and Aradune.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I'm running out of rare spawn picts again! I have 10 I have yet to post. Please if you
have any not on the page already: <a href="mailto:Arturum@neteze.com">SEND THEM</a>.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bilge News 12/07/99 : The Good, the Bad, and the Dead Horse.<br>
First off I want to thank all the GOOD people out there for the support, got our
10k hit and I really happy about it. As you can see from the new title bar, some things
are changing here at The Hunter. I've been working with Arawn from <a href="http://www.studio-erebus.com/">Studio Erebus</a> on this new graphic, he does some
really amazing stuff and I'll be showcasing some of his work here at The Hunter. I am
willing to change the title graphic once a month for any of you Artists out there who want
a place to display your wares.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3 new rare spawns on the left -- FYI Chani Lohn&nbsp; is obviously a play on Lon Chaney
who played the werewolf in all those cheesy 50's &quot;Werewolf Vs. Frankenstein&quot;
type movies.<br>
<br>
Let me clear something up here, The Hunter is a web site for really 2 things. First off,
we poke a bit of fun at Verant. Secondly we talk about rare spawns, and have some cool
shots of them. I'm not going to change the site to some other name because some guy
doesn't think Bilge is news. I've been asked. Third this site is my forum to complain
about Cleric Quest Armor, that's how the site started and I'm not going to forget my roots
in the months to come.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I have a few special treats for this week I'm working on. Keep dropping by, you never know
what you will find...<br>
<br>
Now on to the BAD people:<br>
You guys know me, I LOVE HATE MAIL. Got this gem tonight, thought Justin Taylor would like
it if I put his letter on the page. Feel free to send him love mail back at: <a href="mailto:jtorange@hotmail.com">jtorange@hotmail.com<br>

wah wah wah i cant get my armor<br>
give me a break...if you dont want to waste time getting it...DONT GET<br>
IT...<br>
its the best armor in the game..why should it be easy to obtain?<br>
you want every cleric and their mothers having the armor?<br>
Instead of wasting time with a sit in..how bout you go camp that NPC you<br>

a month and decide to post an ingame protest.<br>
<br>
You think Verant actually cares?<br>
<br>
Like any business, yes Verant is a company out to make<br>
profits the only way to hurt them to make them make<br>
changes is to click on the 'cancel account' button.<br>
<br>
I as well as many others simply cannot understand the<br>
stupidity of ingame protests such as yours.<br>

Some people just don't get it I guess. I'm not going to beat a DEAD HORSE, don't send
me anymore mail on this, take it to Rayne's cleric page and post it on the boards.</font></p>

I just spent about an hour on Rayne's boards reading Sit In vs. Anti
Sit In threads. Its really depressing to me, all that energy spent arguing and really no
real answer from Verant on this. I left UO because I got tired of the lies, with Verant it
seems we just get ignored until we shut up ourselves. Either way we still are getting the
shaft in the end. Gang I hate to say this, but I don't think we are going to win this
one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I will tell you no one, I mean NO ONE, hates these quests more then me. Look at this page
and tell me different, but I'm starting to lose hope that this will ever be fixed. We

Bilge News 12/03/99 : The Cleric Sit In: Aftermath<br>
Well I just logged off Fennin Ro. First off I'd like to thank all
the people who sent me /tells about the page. Your support of the Hunter means alot to me.
Please tell your friends about the site, I plan on only great things here for quite a
while.<br>
<br>
Ok about the Sit In: (Pictures Linked in Blue) --<br>
<br>
The Report: Just the Facts Lady!<br>
<br>
I logged in at about 5:15pm. I had made the Cleric last night before going to bed so I was
all ready. I was shocked <a href="images/Hunter/used/one.jpg">to see a few clerics sitting
on the wall already in West Freeport</a>. By 5:39 there were 43 Clerics in the zone.
Things were kind of crazy. People shouting, players flaming clerics, basically it was
really really Chaotic. I'm not talking Dark Elf Chaotic here, I'm talking pulling the Imp
Protector to the Zone in Sol B Chaotic (/shout out to my pal Ravhin there). I was really
amazed at Fennin Ro, I figured that the &quot;role playing&quot; server would have a few
nice people on it, boy was I wrong (more on that later). Anyway as time goes on more and
more clerics <a href="images/Hunter/used/two.jpg">enter the zone.</a> By 6:18 there are 103
clerics in West Freeport. Lag at this point is getting bad, people are getting angry, and
little is being said by the guys who put this all together. As you can see the zone is <a href="images/Hunter/used/three.jpg">thick with Clerics</a> at this point. At 6:21 I get my
high count of Clerics in NFP, 114. About this time we are asked to move into the other
zones to reduce lag (?!?!?). I moved over to East FP, and sat with the clerics there.
Dalofkarana one of the organizers of the event told us Brad of Verant had contacted them
this week, would look into the issue etc etc...Dalofkarana also told me he would try to
get me a copy of this letter to post here. If anything happened past 7:30 I missed it, as
I came here to update the page.<br>
<br>
My Impressions: Why you really read this page.<br>
<br>
The Thinktank: Ok, first off I'm a bit ticked that the guys who put this whole thing
together, had already heard from Brad, and didn't let us know at the start of the event.
Secondly they didn't control the crowd at all, and I barely heard a peep out of them the
whole event. I'm sorry, but damn what a great time for a speech that would have been! You
had the floor, use it! Make those clerics cheer! Ahhh, missed chance there. Also why move
us around, keep us in one spot and just keep the lag in a central area. MAKE VERANT
NOTICE.<br>
<br>
Verant: I'm not too pleased with Ol'Verant either. Come on, toss me a fricken bone here.
At least have some low level grunt drop by and say hello. Cowards all of you....<br>
<br>
Fennin Ro: Oh my, what can I say. BAD first impression. You guys got a real sweetheart
over there named, Hippos. Real punk. Hey Clerics of Fennin Ro, do me a favor, don't Res
this guy. I just expected more from the &quot;role play&quot; server that's all...someone
invite me to a real event I'd like to have my mind changed.<br>
<br>
The Clerics: Guys and Gals, you did great. Most of you remained calm and orderly. You
stated your points and kept clear heads. You made me proud to be a cleric. Check out the
left bar for RARE CLERICS of the day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All told it was a great event with a few minor problems
IMHO. Thanks
to all who came! -- Until Later, Arturum<br>
<br>
My RANT o'the day:<br>
Ok, so I'm in Sol B and I see this cute little Dark Elf Cleric in a Red Robe...I know this
is a robe of the seeker from the Temple of Ro, but I wanted a better look. Well I click on
her, and she just flips (you know who you are inkie!). Gives me the /gesture and bitches
me out. Well ok, gee you got something cool, and you don't want me to see it huh? Well
guess what? F you dear, I can look all day long and you can't do a thing about it. I'm
really tired of the &quot;you didn't ask, I will never exp res you now&quot; in the black
box thing. (Yes a Cleric has that on Xegony) - Verant can fix this whole problem in about
5 mins... Let us choose if others can inspect us. Give people a damn switch or something.
Now as far as I am conserned inspect me all day long, I don't care. If you are so damn
secretive about what gear you have, go play a solo game. Cause I'm inspecting, like it or
not :P<br>
<br>
Until Later -- Arturum&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/30/99 : Gee Hate Mail<br>
I get alot of mail, a few days ago I got another letter telling me
to, &quot;Give it up, you will never be EQvault.&quot; Blah Blah.&nbsp;<br>
I look at it like this, In EQ, and in gaming in general, there are 3 types of web sites:<br>
The Level 1 Site: This is a site that has all the cutting edge info about the game. Its a
site almost everyone knows about and visits regularly. EQliser, EQvault etc.<br>
The Level 2 Site: A site that has a following but isn't a major site. I consider the Bilge
Hunter one of these sites. Also sites like: <a href="http://www.graffe.com/">Graffe's
Wizard Compilation&nbsp;</a> for example. To me these are the best sites, they tend to be
the most personal and have the best ideas.&nbsp;<br>
The Level 3 Site: A small site usually for a guild or group, without a following. Many of
these sites are really cool.<br>
<br>
I'm not here to beat out the Vault for some grand prize. I am a small subset of
EQ, and
while I wish the larger sites would support the smaller sites more, ie getting a post on
the vault can be a pain after the first one, and I'd love to see links to other sites on
the BIG BOYS, I'm not going to lose any sleep 'cause I ain't the Vault. Also in the future
if you have a site with a following, please send me the URL and info about updates, I'd be
happy to post them. I'll support the Level 2 sites all day long. Rant OVER.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I've been though all this before, during my stay in UO, I ran a site called <a href="http://www.tahoebasin.com/guildreview/">The Ultima Online Guild Review</a> . This
site was dedicated to doing reviews of web sites of guilds. Check it out, it was a great
site, and I have been thinking about bringing the whole idea over to EQ. Be this the case,
I'd be looking for people who would want to run the site, do reviews, and basically switch
it over to EQ. I'm not looking to run the site myself, just mainly be an editor. The Bilge
Hunter is enough of a project for me right now.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In other news:<br>
Please try to support the cleric sit in if you feel its a good cause. I'd really like to
see Verant wake the hell up about these issues.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Kedge Keep: if yer in the low 40's and high 30's man this place is just great exp. My
guild has been hunting there alot in the last few nights, and have yet to see anyone else
in the zone. Lguk and SolB well have been ummm CROWDED...the other night our ranger did a
track in SolB and saw 80+ people and ZERO mobs...heh. KKeep, Check it out its a cool
place...Just not on Xegony, cause we own the deed to it...<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/29/99 : The Cleric Sit In!<br>
I tossed this idea around a while ago, and as great minds think
alike, Norin Grimsbane of the Tribunal Server and Pirmin Nimblefoot of the Karana Server
put this event together. I just learned of it. Here are the details:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thank you all for coming.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You are here most likely because you either support our cause or are
curious as to the basis of our cause.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We, the Clerics of all Norrath, feel that an injustice has occured that
adversely affects us.&nbsp; This injustice involves the recent additions into Everquest to
replace Rubicite.&nbsp; When Rubicite armor was removed from the game, all Rubicite
wearers recieved replacement armor, that for the most part is obtained through various
quests.&nbsp; This decision to remove Rubicite and to add new and exciting quests to the
game was and still is well-supported among most, if not all communities of
Everquest.&nbsp; The idea that a particular class can make itself unique just by the armor
it wears adds an interesting aspect to the game of Everquest.&nbsp; This would under
normal circumstances make the game of Everquest even more enjoyable and playable than
before.&nbsp; Although, this has not entirely been the case.</font> </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When players began to investigate the new quests that were implemented
into Everquest, one problem became apparent:&nbsp; The Cleric-only quest armor was
extremely hard to obtain even to the point that the armor became worthless and a waste of
good time.&nbsp; Clerics discovered that two of the items they needed for their quests
appeared every seven hours on a tree stump and in a burned down cabin in the now
dangerous Kithicor Forest (These two camps were aptly named StumpWatch '99 and CabinWatch
'99).&nbsp; As well the NPCs which carry the items the Clerics need to complete their
quests spawn even more rarely.&nbsp; One NPC spawns every seven hours, but yet has
a
chance that a place-holder will instead appear meaning that the NPC only has a
slight chance of spawing every seven hours.&nbsp; This continues also as one of the
NPCs spawns (and rarely as well) in the near direct path that a band of NPC werewolf
hunters wander; given that the NPC the Clerics seek is evil, the werewolf hunters tend
to quickly kill the NPC leaving no chance that the Cleric may retrieve the item he is
after.&nbsp; One of the sought-after Cleric items appears on an NPC who happens to drop<br>
two powerful items that many Druids wish to obtain; this results in Clerics
competing with Druids for the NPC's loot.&nbsp; The competition does not end there
either, Clerics also share a rare spawn with the Shamans in the quests for the
class-specific armors.&nbsp; The list of difficulties that a Cleric most wade through to
obtain thier armor goes on for quite some length. Also, the new Cleric quest armor has a
lower
armor class than the Rubicite is was supposed to replace.&nbsp; But to
present only the complaints, is to cast the cause in a negative light.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The new armor has been exciting to acquire as it provides a sense of
uniqueness to one's character (and adds to the looks as well).&nbsp; Many Clerics would be
thrilled to seek out the NPCs they must find to complete their quests in order to obtain
this new armor, if only it were feasible to do such a thing.&nbsp; The essential problem
lies in the fact that the armor is possible to obtain only through many mindless, boring,
unenjoyable, and anti-social hours of camping a single spot in all of Everquest.&nbsp;
This leaves one seeking the armor full of despair and hopelessness, and might eventually
result in an overall dislike to the game itself.&nbsp;<br>
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Clerics of Norrath wish to band together and show that they believe
all of these problems can be remedied, and that the solutions do exist.&nbsp; By staging a
sit-in, we are opening the opportunity for our interest in this matter to be shown and to
hopefully find a reasonable solution.&nbsp; The Clerics across Norrath wish to see two
events occur.&nbsp; One, the Cleric-only armor quest should have the frequency of certain
key NPCs increased as well as making the items more interesting to obtain, and two, the
armor class on the armor should be increased to an appropriate level for a plate-wearing
class (which Clerics are).&nbsp; We, as the Clerics of Norrath, hope that all will
participate in the Cleric Sit-In to show that they too believe Everquest should be fun and
sociable.</font> </p>

Bilge News 11/25/99 : The X Files<br>
Well I haven't been updating because I was captured by Alien Verant
Programmers again this week. Actually I've been sick as a dog, and haven't turned on the
CPU hardly at all. I'm going to try and get back here and update tonight after Turkey, if
I can stay awake...Later all, Have a good one.<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/18/99 : Ok Update Central Here!<br>
As you can see I have been playing with the page some, just not
updating the news in the last few days. I decided that I needed 3 rare spawns of the day,
at least until I get through some of the picts I have...Please keep them coming, there are
hundreds of rare spawns in EQ, and I'd really like shots of them all.&nbsp; Even shots of
&quot;non-named&quot; spawns is good, as long as the spawn is rare. Example: The Kobold
King in Sol B would be fine, even though his name isn't Bob Nosepicker.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Deluin of Fennin Ro is helping me out with the graphics for the page, although I'd love to
have monthy Artists shown...If anyone has anything creative feel free to send it to
me.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I got a mail the other day that kind of bothered me, basically the author told me I should
just give up the Bilge Hunter because of the other &quot;good&quot; sites out there. His
logic was I couldn't compete with The EQ Vault or Eqliser. Well first of I'm not trying
to, second I think I've got my own nitch going here with the Rare Spawns, and a bit of
humor. I'm not going anywhere :P...BUT tell yer friends about The Hunter gang...I'd like
to get a bigger following, would help me get more picts.<br>
<br>
No Heal '99 -- I got no mail about this at all...WTF no one even flamed me! You guys are
slipping.<br>
<br>
Arturum's Wisdom - We got a whiner, errr winner...Dakaminy of Rallos Zek figured out my
wisdom by actually THINKING about it...189 at that time btw, for all you who guessed :)
Its now at 192, I'm still going for that 200 wisdom for some silly reason. Anyway thanks
to everyone who tryed, I'll do more stupid games in the future. Dakaminy gets for his
logical mind: a picture of himself in the rare spawns of the day. Therefore becoming a
&quot;rare&quot; spawn himself...Told ya, I'll make a famous !<br>
<br>
I'm redoing the rules of the contest...or I may dump it, anyone have any input?&nbsp;
Don't you love a page where you can send in input? Do you think the web master actually
takes any mail under consideration? heh...I read it all, if its a good idea that doesn't
piss me off I sometimes use it...<br>
<br>
I'm running out of stuff to add here...I'm going to actually go play EQ some...<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/13/99 : Wow DING...No Heal '99..and a (Ve)Rant.<br>
I've been level 35 since August. Yea, I know its just embarrassing.
Died a lot, didn't gain much. Camped Stumps, Huts, Gulls and all that other NO EXP stuff.
Just for info sake the Cleric quests not only just are hell camps, but when you turn the
stuff in you don't even get exp. This is part of Verant's master plan to drive all Clerics
insane with rage. Now, being the crazy guy I am, I had a really sick sick idea. I know a
lot of clerics read this page, and I was wondering what you would think of this: On
December 31st, 1999 (in the flavor that is pure Y2K chaos), I would have one full day
where all the Clerics of EQ gather together and just give a big thumbs down to these
quests. How can we really really let them know how we feel? Do this: on 12/31/99 <font color="#FF0000">DON'T HEAL, DON'T RES, DON'T BUFF</font>. Wow, imagine the total chaos.
I'd like to see all healers do this, but I know this will never happen. If you can swear
off all the above for one night, I'll mail the list of us to Verant, and just show them
the support we have for the Cleric class. Email me your name and server if you plan in
taking a part in &quot;No Heal '99&quot;. Druids, and Shaman are more then welcome to take
part also.<br>
<br>
I just would like to see 3 things: Move the quest items to spawns that are not camped
24/7/356, give us some exp for doing these quests, and finally make the AC of the items
better then the chain wearing class quest armor. Is that really to much to ask?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In other news...Still no correct guess at Arturum's Wisdom...got a guess of 198, heh I
wish. Its not that hard is it?<br>
<br>
I want to thank Dragan of Xegony, he has sent me by far the most rare spawns. He is a true
hunter of the unseen and odd of EQ. Now if I can just get him to wave. I'll be posting his
shots in the next few days. But they include the following:&nbsp;</font></p>

Bilge News 11/13/99 : Looking for Art... Arturum's Wisdom...<br>
Well had 2 guesses at my wisdom from the picture below. Both are <span style="background-color: #00CC66"><font color="#FFFF00">WRONG</font></span> (heh), anyone
else wanna try? I will say this the other guesses are :153 and 184.<br>

you have no soul (or soulfire even). Anyway my guild - The Order of the Jade Dragon -

Bilge News 11/12/99:&nbsp; Mail Quotes of the Week and a Game!<br>
I get some cool mail, some is praise, such as:<br>
&quot;<font color="#000000">ROFLMAO, Great Site Great Idea Great Great Great. Its almost a
fart in the collective face of Verant and their sadistic pleasure they receive from making
these camps so LONG&quot;<br>
<br>
Some is just amazingly stupid, like:<br>
&quot;I noticed you mention the Plane of Fur on your web page, can you tell me more about
the plane? What spawns there? Can a 15th lvl Necromancer get there?....&quot;<br>
<br>
Some is just makes me happy the Bilge Hunter is here for ya:<br>
&quot;Hello fellow Everquest addict! I never have E-mailed any EQ site about anything but
I just found your site too enjoyable. I was thinking of doing the quests for one of my
secondary characters (I have a lvl 50 wizard on Veeshan who serves as a quest doer now)
and I'm not so sure I want to go through the trouble now that I have seen this page! LOL.
If I can find any information out you will be the first to know. I have quite a few high
lvl friends on Veeshan (upwards of 50 lvl 50 friends) who might be able to help you in
your endeavor. Long Live the EQ Addicts!&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the mail everyone! (BTW please note I didn't print anyone's name, figure
I'll keep that private.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Ok, the game of the week is this:<br>
From the following picture guess Arturum's (my cleric) Current Wisdom. Winner gets a
screen shot of himself posted here and much praise for being mighty smart :) Here's the

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bilge News 11/11/99:&nbsp; The list is coming, and a few ideas<br>
Ok, I still need more rare NPCs to finish the list, please please
send me more.<br>
<br>
On a different tangent or rant as it were, I have had a few ideas for while that I think
would make EQ a more interesting game.<br>
<br>
1) At say 50th lvl, let players pick a new facial skin. These would be older versions of
the existing skins out there. For example: A gray haired dwarf with a longer beard, or a
wood elf with battle scars.<br>
Granted this would involve an expansion, I still think it would be a great idea. I hate
looking like every other dwarf cleric in the world.<br>
<br>
2) Give out titles instead of gear for some GM quests. Wouldn't it be great to be Lord
Ravhin Stormwind, instead of just plain old Ravhin Stormwind?<br>
<br>
3) King Server : This one has been kicking around my mind for a while, since Race War
anyway. The idea is this: Set up some sort of voting system where players can vote for a
leader for each race, that leader would elect a council of say 10 others to be his
generals. Monthly the &quot;King&quot; would have to face reelection, basically a player
would have to keep his faction up with other players to keep the title. We could have
coups, huge Race Wars etc. Could a high elf be named King of the Dwarves? hey why not?
Could one man lead all the forces of Evil? why not?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Feel free to mail me any ideas along these lines, if I can flesh out details I'll mail it
off to Brad and see what he says.<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/10/99:&nbsp; I was playing a
game....<br>
Sorry about the lack of updates, I bought AOE2 (Age of Empires 2)
and kinda got hooked on it for the weekend. Great game, Not EQ. Anyway so I'm back with
several things to post tonight, including I hope the start of the list. Until then check
out these shots of Babbinshort I was sent by Yohm on Xegony. <a href="images/Hunter/used/bab1.jpg" target="_blank">Alive</a> and <a href="images/Hunter/used/bab2.jpg" target="_blank">Dead</a>. Nice job Yohm! Oh yea just
so the rest of you know, he camped it 84 hours.<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/06/99:&nbsp; Wow, all I can say
is wow.&nbsp;<br>
I want to thank everyone for the support I'm getting for this page.
I've got a ton of things to post but first, I got alot of mail asking about other spawns,
other rare and missing mobs. So today I'm at work and I came up with an idea. This page is
going to be dedicated to images of those rare and unseen NPC's that some of us may either
never see, or don't have the level to survive around them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now I figure how do I get you all to send me shots of the odd, rare, and noteworthy of
Norrath?<br>
<br>
I bribe you. YES, CASH. Big fat rolls of Bills (real money too!) So here are the rules
for:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Bilge Hunter Contest of Champions<br>
Rule 1: All submitted photos must be of live NPC's and/or Monsters.<br>
Rule 2: Your character must been in the picture.<br>
Rule 3: You must have your back to the NPC. (ie face the camera)<br>
Rule 4: Here's the kicker...You must be waving. (Gotta make it tough somehow)<br>
Rule 5: A list of required photos will be posted, each one having a different point value.
As photos are sent in the name of the npc will be removed from the list. Example - Aradune
is going to be worth 200 points, Gull will be worth 50.<br>
Rule 6: Contest starts Sunday November 5th, 1999 and ends Friday December 31st, 1999
Midnight<br>
Rule 7: Submit Photos in JPEG please. If its not JPEG its not getting posted.<br>
Rule 8: I will add/change rules as needed to make this fun for everyone. <br>
Right now the cash prize is a $25.00 Money Order, this may (and probably will) go
up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Until Sunday I'll be taking ideas for NPC's for the list, please
feel free to submit anything you would enjoy seeing a photo of.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
More news: I got 2 photo's of Bilge (1 from Xegony!) unfortunatly the poor
guy was dead. I'd really like a live shot of him, I am going to contact the Xegony player
and see if he feels alright continuing the quest for the plat. You can see both shots <a href="images/Hunter/used/bilge1.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="images/Hunter/used/bilge2.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
<br>
I was watching the hit counter today, man did it just soar up...197 last night at 4 am,
2440 as I type this. Thanks for all the support, also thanks to the <a href="http://www.eqvault.com/">EQVault</a> for the post. That is all I have for now, going
to get some play time in and get back here later.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/05/99: I take a day off...<br>
Well I said I was going to update, but like Bilge, I took a day
off. I unlike Bilge have returned.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I looked up Bilge in an online dictionary:<br>
Main Entry: <sup>1</sup>bilge<br>
Pronunciation: <tt>'bilj</tt><br>
Function: noun<br>
1 : the bulging part of a cask or barrel<br>
2 a : the part of the underwater body of a ship between the flat of the bottom and the
vertical topsides b : the lowest point of a ship's inner hull<br>
3 : stale or worthless remarks or ideas<br>
<br>
I think #3 is really a fitting name for our missing goblin. I hope to add some nice
graphics to the page in the next few days. Please someone send me a shot of Bilge...If any
out there exist, which I'm starting to doubt.<br>
<br>
<a name="Xmas"></a>I couldn't sleep tonight because this was stuck in my head:<br>
<br>
'Twas the night before Patching, when all through the house<br>
Not a computer was stirring, not even my mouse;<br>
The party had logged in the Cauldron with care,<br>
In hopes that upon login Bilge would be there;<br>
<br>
The players were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
While visions of reed belts danced in their heads;<br>
And Bethanor in his plate, and I in my steel cap,<br>
Had just settled down for a long winter's camp,<br>
<br>
When out on the screen there arose such a clatter,<br>
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to the CPU I flew like a flash,<br>
Tore open the shutters and threw up a haste sash (ick).<br>
<br>
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
But a miniature slayer (gnome), and eight tiny reindeer,<br>
<br>
This little old KSer, so lively and quick,<br>
I knew in a moment it must be a pri*k<br>
More rapid than eagles his spells they came,<br>
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Gravity Flux! now, Rend! now, Super Nova and Clash!<br>
On, (ICE)COMET! on Lightning Strike! on, Conflaguration and BLITZEN!<br>
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br>
Now burn away! burn away! burn away all!&quot; (muhahahaha)<br>
<br>
He was dressed all in fur (from plane of fur), from his head to his foot,<br>
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br>
A bundle of stolen toys he had flung on his back,<br>
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br>
<br>
His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br>
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br>
(someone tell me this guy ain't a Gnome)<br>
<br>
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.<br>
<br>
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old dark elf (mask of the deceiver),<br>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, (/emote wink)<br>
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br>
<br>
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
And filled all the packs; god what a jerk,<br>
And laying his finger aside of his nose, (/emote nose)<br>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br>
<br>
He sprang to his JBoots, to his Guild gave a whistle,<br>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
But I heard him /shout, ere he ran out of sight,<br>
<br>
&quot;HAPPY CAMPING TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!&quot;<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/04/99: No Info Yet<br>
Been getting alot of traffic on the page, but have yet to get
any info on Bilge (or Gull, Babbinshort). I'll been working here all day on and off since
I called in sick to work.<br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/03/99: The Hunter is Born <br>
<br>
Bilge News 11/03/99: The Hunter is Born <br>
Tonight I was spending some time looking at <a href="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/" target="_blank">Raynes Cleric Web Page</a>, browsing
the message boards, and looking for some info on the elusive Goblin of Dagnor's Cauldron,
when it I came to the understanding that this goblin is soooo rare that he warrants having
his own web page. So here's the deal:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I will give 100pp to anyone who sends me a picture of Bilge and themselves on
Xegony.&nbsp;<br>
This reward will increase 10pp a day starting tomorrow.<br>
<br>
If you spot Bilge on another Server, you are more then welcome to send in Shots of him,
they will be posted here and you will gain the title of &quot;Bilge Spotter&quot;. The
same goes for any shots of Gull or Babbinshort the Necro. This may someday be an elite
club of rare spawn spotters.&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I will also post here all the Bilge rumors I hear, such as:<br>
&quot;Where exactly does Bilge spawn?&quot;<br>
&quot;What level is Bilge?&quot;<br>
&quot;Is Bilge a timed spawn or do I have to kill every goblin I see to get him to
appear?&quot;<br>
&quot;If Bilge was a flower what kind of flower would he be?&quot;<br>
<br>
The History of Bilge:<br>
According the Gavel in the Temple:<br>
<br>
&quot;Althuryn the Constant was brutally slain by two aqua goblins. The one called Sludge
fled to Runnyeye, the one called Bilge lives in Dagnors Cauldron. Bring me the Ingot of
the Constant, the Icon of the Constant, and 2 Galvanized Platinum Bars and I will forge
them into a reward for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
How weak was this Althuryn the Constant, to be slain by 2 aqua gobs? He didn't deserve the
icon and ingot in my opinion! I just wish he could have been slain by something that
spawns with some regular timing, or for that matter, something that spawns at all.</font></p>
