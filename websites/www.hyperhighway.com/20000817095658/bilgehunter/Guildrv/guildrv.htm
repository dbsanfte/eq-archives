    <td width="66%" valign="top" align="left">&nbsp;<b>Welcome to the EQ guild
      review! This is actually the third time I have worked on a guild review
      page. The Original Guild Review (<a href="http://www.tahoebasin.com/guildreview/">found
      here</a>) was founded by Slyfeind, an avid player of
      UO. He needed some help along the way as the number of reviews was getting
      out of hand. He held an open contest to pick a reviewer that looked at
      guilds as he did, in the end I was picked and we worked together for
      several months. Later he turned over the page to me for personal reasons.<br>
      <br>
      After leaving UO, I had a brief time with Tribes. I brought the guild
      review into that game also, continuing the work, and letting the great
      idea live on. <br>
      <br>
      Then came EQ, and as many of you know I started and continue to update
      (although not enough) The Bilge Hunter. <br>
      <br>
      So what is a guild review page? I think Slyfeind summed it up the best in
      the following, which I lifted from the original page (note this is written
      from the UO point of view, some things will change for EQ, but the idea
      stays the same):</b>
      <p><b><i>&quot;I just thought I'd write a few words on the nature of
      reviews, what we're looking for, why we rate guilds the way we do, and so
      on.</i></b></p>
      <p><b><i>Whether you're reviewing music, theatre, art, games, or anything
      else, it comes to question exactly what you're writing about. Most sources
      say the same things: What is the intention? And does it accomplish this
      intention? Now, depending on the medium reviewed, there are additional
      criteria to make things interesting. With books, the question is, &quot;Is
      it literature?&quot; Or at least, &quot;Does it fit well within its
      genre?&quot; With games, one must decide if the playability and fun factor
      hold out. With guilds, I feel that this additional criteria is: &quot;What
      do they add to the UO experience?&quot;</i></b></p>
      <p><b><i>With that in mind, we're not revieing web pages. Quite frankly,
      we don't give a flying cow turd if you've got music and frames up the
      wazoo, cool animation, and whatever else. Yeah, you're pretty. But what
      are you doing in the game? Shadowclan has a simple web page, but they are
      contributing to UO in a way that nobody else is. There are all of a sudden
      40 more orcs to fight. And they keep coming back. Even better: forget the
      web pages. Ater Insidae is one of the best thieves guilds around, and I
      saw that back before they existed only on the bulletin boards. But they
      were doing things in the game that rivalled all the web-page wonders we
      see these days.</i></b></p>
      <p><b><i>So, there you have it. What does the guild wish to accomplish? Is
      it a PK guild? We judge it as a PK guild. Is it a guild that role plays
      polymorphed slime? We judge it by its own merits. Does the guild
      accomplish what it sets out to do? If it's a good guild, do they fight
      evil? Do they help newbies wisely? Or do they just give gold to beggars
      all day to increase their notoriety (or worse, run around and kill all the
      poor red-named newbies)? And, finally, what do they contribute to UO? Are
      the PKers exciting to fight? Are the evil guilds really role playing? Are
      the elves acting like elves?</i></b></p>
      <p><b><i>It is with these three things in mind that we judge guilds, by
      their own merits, as well as what they contribute to the community of
      Ultima Online.</i></b></p>
      <p><b><i>This brings up an important point: how to present yourselves. If
      you have a web page, it often helps to have these facts for all to see:</i></b>
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Goals and creed. Do you fight evil? Are you PKers? Do you just
          want to role play a certain type of person? Let people know from the
          start what kind of guild you are.</i></b>
        <li><b><i>Means and methods. It can be a shock for someone to join your
          guild, then find out they have to pay 5,000 gp a day to stay a member.
          And someone looking for a carefree adventuring company wouldn't be too
          happy to find he has to work his way through the Eighteen Ranks of the
          Elder Gods.</i></b>
        <li><b><i>Where are you? What server, town, and/or general area of
          Britannia do you inhabit? We get a lot of requests to print which
          servers each guild is on. I would love to, if only people would tell
          us.</i></b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><i>In the end, I always look forward to open communication. The
      Fuckheads' entry was updated several times during the beta, and The
      Syndicate is going through changes every day as new events and evidence
      manifest themselves. Keep in mind I get my information not only from the
      guildmaster or his web page, but also the allies and enemies, and any
      other sources I can find. And if things start to contradict themselves (or
      just sound &quot;fishy&quot;), I always try to find at least two sources
      of information, and present all sides of the story when possible. It's
      just bad journalism to do anything less.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </i>I'll start doing reviews once I have a few pages submitted for review.
      Please feel free to submit your guild to The Bilge Hunter Guild Review <a href="mailto:Arturum@neteze.com">HERE</a>.</b><br>
