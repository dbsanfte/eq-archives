      dat don't know, my name is Steven Segal. Star of action and adventure
      movies such as: Hard to Kill, Hard to Kill 2, and Marked for Death. What
      alot of people don't know about me is dat I'm a huge EQ player. Nothing
      gets my huge ego going like camping a phat lewt or kill stealing that SSOY
      from some 14 year old camper dats been there 14 hours. I've been following
      the &quot;Bilge Hunter&quot; for months and I contacted Arturum because I
      wanted to host my own Tactical Page on how to kill the hardest mobsters in
      EQ. </font></td>

<b><font color="#FFFFFF">News 8/14/2000:<br>
Steve has started with his first installment to &quot;Hard to Kill&quot;, taking
on the bad boy of Chardok - Korocust. He'll be adding more as the week goes on,
but he needs some input on some of the other Mobsters of EQ. Feel free to mail
any information to <a href="mailto:Arturum@neteze.com">Steve Segal</a>. He's
looking for solid tactics for Vox, Naggy, any of the new Dragons in Kunark,
Veshaans Peak, VS in Karnors, or any others Bad Boys.</font><br>

      him to death with my fists, or a pool cue.&quot;&nbsp;</font></td>
    <td width="72%"><font color="#FFFFFF">It seems the cleanest way to kill
      Korocust is this:</font>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Work down to the area with 12-18 people, although
      it could perhaps be done with less. Pull and clear the mobs around
      Korocust, without pulling him. Tanks of any sort are needed to take
      Korocust out, as there are some pathing problems in the area and damage
      spells are hard to land on him. Make sure that the clerics have remove
      blindness hotkeyed, and its usually go to have 1 cleric per 2 tanks. Start
      the fight with the tanks attacking him, but watch his health as he enrages
      with about 15% of life left. Landing DOTs (splurt) can be helpful when he
      is about to ENRAGE. When he Enrages have the tanks stop fighting as the
      effect only lasts a few seconds. Hopefully at this point any dots will get
      him low enough to begin his run, then attack him again to finish him off.
      He spawns again in about 18 mins, with no placeholder. </font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
