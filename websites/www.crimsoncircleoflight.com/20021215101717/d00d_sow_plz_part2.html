				This is a first hand account from a Dwarf Cleric who happened to see the dumba....sorry....Petitioner running by on his way to Felwithe.
<br><br>
Here comes some idiot Dark Elf running past me, running straight down <BR>
the road that is going to lead him to Felwithe. I scratch my head, and <BR>
being the nosey sort of Dwarf that I am...I send him a tell. <BR>
<BR>
I tell the DE, &quot;Wait&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE tells me, &quot;?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I sigh into my ale as I take another longt draught off of it before <BR>
running up to him and saying, &quot;Ye really don't wanna go messin around <BR>
over there with them High Elves' They look like pansies, but they aint.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The DE stands there with a vacant look on his face for a few minutes <BR>
before just running away. Do a /who on the DE and find out he's 31st <BR>
level. Ok, so maybe he knows what he's doing. I've seen Ogres in North <BR>
Freeport, after all. I go back to drinking my ale. <BR>
<BR>
Out of curiosity, I send him another tell a few minutes later. <BR>
<BR>
I tell the DE, &quot;Not gettin' into any trouble over there are ye?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE tells me, &quot;STFU !@#$% roleplayer&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I sigh into my ale again, finishing it off. Ah, tis the season of the <BR>
twit. I stand up and head towards Felwithe to resupply my ale. <BR>
<BR>
Just as I get to the gates of the ugliest city on Norrath, what do I <BR>
find but a dead dark elf and a pair of guards snickering and cleaning <BR>
their weapons. Now this is priceless. <BR>
<BR>
I do a /who on the poor soul and see he is in Burning Woods. Being the <BR>
sucker that I am, I feel compelled to rez the twit...after all, I am a <BR>
!@#$% roleplayer and I roleplay a !@#$% cleric...albeit a !@#$% grumpy <BR>
one. <BR>
<BR>
I sit down to mem Reviviscene and while I am waiting for it to refresh I <BR>
send the DE a tell. <BR>
<BR>
I tell the DE, &quot;Would ye like a rez?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE tells me, &quot;no i want a !@#$% sow dumbas i have to run south to get my <BR>
corpse back so dont be a dick and just sow me plz&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I look around for an ale but unfortunatly Brell hates me at this moment <BR>
in time, so I simply reply. &quot;If I rez ya, ye wont need to run south to <BR>
yer body. You will appear at yer body. I am not standing near you, I am <BR>
standing near yer corpse.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE tells me, &quot;d00d rez plz&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As I sigh I look at my Holy Symbol of Brell and sigh &quot;I'm gonna get a <BR>
stout named after me right?&quot; and I tell the DE &quot;Consent me so I can rez <BR>
ya&quot; but I get no reply. No reply at all. So I say it again &quot;Consent me <BR>
so I can rez ya&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE tells me, &quot;ok you can rez me&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I sit down again at this point. I have no ale and this is gonna take <BR>
awhile. I tell the DE, &quot;Type /consent and my name&quot; Being a smart dwarf I <BR>
tell the DE, &quot;/consent Cleric_01&quot; and say again &quot;Just like that&quot; before <BR>
he can make my head hurt more. <BR>
<BR>
Sure enough, I recieve consent to drag his corpse. So I stand up and get <BR>
ready to drag the corpse when suddenly I am denied permission to drag <BR>
his corpse. I begin to think like him and I think &quot;WTF?&quot; So I tell the <BR>
DE, &quot;No...just type it once. One more time. That's it. Dont type it <BR>
again&quot; thinking that as soon as I get this over with, I can go buy more <BR>
ale and my head will stop hurting. <BR>
<BR>
I recieve consent and I quickly drag it towards the zone since this is <BR>
the direction the guy was going anyway. I get the body by the zone and <BR>
cast Rez on it, comforted by the fact that I am one heal away from being <BR>
done with this guy. <BR>
<BR>
The naked DE appears in front of me and I stand up to cast my final <BR>
spell of this exchange when he says to me &quot;your that !@#%% roleplayer&quot; <BR>
and then a moment later, almost as an afterthought &quot;thx&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Compelled at this point, I ask &quot;Why were you running into Felwithe when <BR>
you are KoS?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;I was going to burned woods&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;Burning Woods?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;no dumbass i go there when i die i want to hunt burned woods&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;Who told you to go hunting in Burned Woods, inside Felwithe?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;some dick who wouldnt sow me&quot; and then &quot;will you sow me plz, <BR>
its for a CR&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I stand there drooling on myself for a moment, trying to catch up. I <BR>
havent had an ale in a good 20 minutes at this point, so I am starting <BR>
to see spots. <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;dont be a dick just sow me before they move the zone again&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I stare at the lad and ask &quot;Move Burned Woods? Again?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;yea&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I finally snap and say, &quot;They aren't going to move it again. Once they <BR>
moved it to Western Wastes, with all the snow, it stopped burning.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;i saw a burning tree&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;Exactly my point. Now if they would only move Burning Woods <BR>
there it would stop too and people wouldn't go there when they die.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;can you sow me, its for CR&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;sow doesnt work in IC until you get past EW and then it will <BR>
work for CR's only until you get to WW, then ask the first person you <BR>
see for sow there.&quot; I add as an afterthought &quot;Sometimes they look like <BR>
flying blue things but they can sow&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;wtf???&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;Allow me to use smaller words. You do not need a sow yet. Do <BR>
what I say and you'll get there right away.&quot; and then &quot;Sit down and mem <BR>
the spell Bind Affinity&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE is silent for a bit and finally says &quot;its red&quot; as he is standing up <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;I am glad they covered Colors this week. Now target yourself and <BR>
cast this spell. &quot; He just stands there for a minute, so I add &quot;it will <BR>
r0ck&quot; and he begins to cast the spell, binding himself behind the guards <BR>
at Felwithe. I feel somewhat better already, maybe I dont need ale. <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;it said bound&quot; and begins to giggle <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;Now sit down and mem the spell Iceclad Gate. This will r0ck even <BR>
more.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;this one is green&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;You're damn good at those colors man&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;thx&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When the DE stands up I say &quot;This is going to take you to Iceclad Ocean. <BR>
It's an ocean so that's why they moved Burned Woods there....to put it <BR>
out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;what about sow&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;Remember that sow wont work until you are on a CR in WW. In fact <BR>
you actually run faster in snow if you set the RUN button to WALK. Do <BR>
that now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE says, &quot;ok&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I say, &quot;Now cast Iceclad Gate....the Green one. Remember to run straight <BR>
out of where you appear and dont stop swimming until you hit Burned <BR>
Woods.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DE begins to cast a spell and I zone in to get my ale....remembering <BR>
that the Ignore list cures most headaches that ale cant and feeling <BR>
somewhat better about going back to Sebilis. <BR>
