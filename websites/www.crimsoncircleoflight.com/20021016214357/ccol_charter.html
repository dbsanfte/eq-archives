			<tr>
				<TD WIDTH="20">&nbsp;</TD>
				<td>
				<FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#FCE809" FACE="verdana, arial"><CENTER>Guild Charter</CENTER></FONT>		
				<P CLASS="pagetext">
				This is the charter for the Crimson Circle of Light. It is an excellent read and will give you an idea of what to expect (and not expect) from the guild and its members. Though it is quite long, it has all the information (I hope) that will answer all your questions.<br>
<br>
				All members will be required to register on the website and submit their email or contact information via an online form. This information is important for us to be in touch with one another. We are a guild of mature and responsible people and hence there is no other use of this information other than sharing guild event with each other. <br>
<br>
				The Guild web site will have important information about what we are doing, our raids, items we have etc. Everyone is requested to contribute to its content because you can surely expect to get as out of it .. as you put into it.<br>
<br>
				Below are specific topics that are discussed regarding events and our method of operation.<br>
				<br><HR WIDTH="60%" COLOR="#FCE809">
				<font SIZE="-2" CLASS="pagetext">
				<OL START="1" COMPACT>
				<OL TYPE="1">
	<LI><B>Guild Chats</B> : There will be <B>NO</B> complaints or negative feedback about an individual guild member in the Guild chat <B><I>unless an officer or myself deems it necessary to be public information for the entire guild</I></B>. In that case, either officers or myself will initiate the topic in public guild chat. In all other cases, you must use /tell to communicate with the guild member you have a problem with, including officers and myself.. and try and resolve the issue. At any time that we find slander or accusing or negative comments/ statements about <B>any</B> member of the CCOL in public guild chat, an immediate warning will be issued and consecutive warnings to cease the conversation in public chat. 3 such warnings will result in immediate removal of the member till he/she cools down and decided to address the issue in a mature manner. This procedure is to prevent slandering the reputation and integrity of another guild member in the "heat of the situation" when either person involved is extremely upset..</LI>
<br><br>
	<LI><B>Guild Raids</B>: Raids shall be scheduled events. If you have a suggestion for a raid, post it in the forums so people can see it and comment on it. Raids CAN be a way to get a quest item, however, it shall NOT be an item that must be camped for any period of time over an hour or two. Remember, you may request to work out an arrangement with guild members to camp a spot for an extended period of time to get an item for yourself provided you are willing to give the same investment of time to return the favor. In cases such as this, please ensure that myself or another officer is aware of the details of such a camp, with all the usual information of what item, MoB, time and place and guild members involved. Our being aware will help settle disputes later as to being fair or not. Also, for any item/quest you wish to perform, please make sure to inform your guildies, in your post, of what item you are looking for and the specifics on everything needed to be done to get it.  Do your own research! If you have an idea, look on the web or ask around to see if it is something we can even do. If it is a place that requires a lot of high levels that we just DO NOT have or do have but CANNOT attend, the idea is out. A raid is NOT a suicide mission under any circumstances. If a raid goes BAD for any reason, the officers will discuss amongst themselves to see if the problem was foreseeable. As an example, if you plan to take guild members to assist in a raid killing A certain MoB and you do all the research to find out that to get to the MoB, we have to fight MoBs of higer levels but neglect, omit to tell us and it results in a disaster… there will be a definite problem and will be the sole discretion of the officers and myself regarding the course of action. After you have posted your idea, if it gets enough interest and is something that we CAN do, we will try to set aside a date and time to do so.</LI>
<br><br>
	<LI><B>Power Leveling (PL) </B>: The guild shall NOT be seen as a means to PL your character. Every once in a while, guildies will help each other out in gaining a few levels here and there, but it should NOT be expected of them. If you have a request that a guild mate help you out, please be polite and send them a tell. If they tell you they are busy, they are busy. Don't keep on them every 10 minutes about it. Also, if someone DOES powerlevel you, be sure to thank them for it (which I HOPE you would do anyway) and remember it later. Who knows when you can help them out. </LI>
<br><br>
	<LI><B>Officers</B> : Officers shall be seen as mentors and guides, not as high levels who can PL you or help you finish a quest. Remember that officers have many duties aside from just being a PC in Norrath. As an example, this website was prepared with the help of officers. Respect any officer that tells you they are busy or need some time alone. If you have a "beef" or a "bone to pick" with an officer, please try to talk it out with them through tells not GUILD CHAT (read above). If you are unable to settle the dispute between the two of you, let me know immediately so that I may step in as a mediator. If you are afraid your word will not be taken over the officer's make sure to log your conversation with them. Basically, these matters will be handled by sitting down, the three of us, each person getting a chance to tell their side of the story and what they would like to see as a solution. I will step in only as needed. If you have a dispute or disagreement with a member you should, again, try to settle it between the 2 of you via tells, then enlist the help of an officer, and if the officer feels they are not getting anywhere, they may enlist MY help in the matter. Officers should NEVER go /anon. If you do not want to be accessible to your guild, then your guild shall not be accessible to you. If you have any specific circumstances on this matter, please send me an email regarding such.
<br>
Officership shall be given through nominations and votes from other officers. If you think you have been overlooked for this role and would like to say "Hey! What about me?!!" then send me an email telling me why you think you are best suited for the position. Do not be hurt if you are still not made an officer. We don't want too many chiefs and not enough Indians. We are going to try to maintain a good officer / player ratio. </LI>
	<LI><B>Simple Rules of Kindness</B> : There are no guidelines for this topic, only a request that you keep in following with the charter and do them. Run-by-buffings, advice to a newbie, an escort to a nearby city, selling something a little below cost, helping someone with a corpse retrieval. Be inventive and be kind! Remember.. in the CCOL, kindness will come around to you at some point.</LI>
<br><br>
	<LI><B>Roster</B> : The roster is there for a three reasons. One is for me to keep track of everyone and for guildies to do the same. Second is so that guildies can see your trades and what skill level you have reached in them. This way if they need to find a Blacksmith or a Tailor or a Jeweler or whatever, all they have to do is visit the roster instead of saying "/gu Do we have any Jewelers in the guild?" Finally, it is there so people who are looking to join our guild know who to talk to, or who to seek out for grouping purposes. This will help them get better acquainted with the guild and it's members. Please sign up for the roster and remember to update your characters. For more info on how to sign up, visit the site eq.guildmagic.com or email me. </LI>
<br><br>
	<LI><B>Guild Leaders Role</B> : I do spend a lot of time thinking what directions I would like to see the guild go, and what needs to be done to make things a little better for everyone. If you have any suggestions, come to me. Send me an email! (I sure get lonely with all that "No New Messages" stuff I keep seeing. I have to open my SPAM account just so I feel special again. ) I have, and will maintain, an open door policy about any and all things. A couple perks of this, however is my ability to delegate and (my personal favorite) the ever famous VETO that I DON'T like to USE but LIKE to HAVE. Basically, use your common sense. Come to me to settle any disputes (read the officer section about that), to ask any "guild" questions, or to request something for "guild" purposes. Or for anything related to the website. </LI>
</OL>
<br>
Have fun.<P>
