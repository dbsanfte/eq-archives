				<CENTER>HAVE YOU EVER MET SOMEONE LIKE THIS? A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A NECRO !!!!! </CENTER>
<br><br>
So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a 
sudden I see the message: "d00d sow 
plz". 
<br><br>
Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the 
clueless newb (hereafter referred to politely as 
"the petitioner") must have been poorly informed at best. 
<br><br>
Boy was I ever wrong. 
<br><br>
I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering 
eyes behold? Only myself and the 
petitioner. 
<br><br>
So I says to myself...."Self? You need to edumacate this fella!" 
<br><br>
(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton 
form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN 
MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown skeleton named 
"Gibober" standing behind me. 
Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.) 
<br><br>
I say "Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer." 
<br><br>
The Petitioner says, "$#*&@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr" 
<br><br>
Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a "/who all dumbass" 
(um..pardon..I meant "/who all petitioner") 
<br><br>
This is where I discovered the "/who all" bug. Certainly it must have been a 
bug, right? There's NO WAY IN CREATION 
the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31 Dark Elf Wizard, 
right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a 
little girl. 
<br><br>
Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet 
began dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly 
begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while deciding how best 
to deal with this tricky situation. 
<br><br>
I say, "Necromancer's can't cast SoW". 
<br><br>
Petitioner says, "Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you 
sped up! i couldn't catch you until you 
sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you dont have to be a 
dick about it a$$hole" 
<br><br>
Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence. 
<br><br>
I say, "I have JBoots." 
<br><br>
He says, "what are they" 
<br><br>
Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor.... 
<br><br>
Petitioner asks, "can you buff my hps my hp sux" 
<br><br>
I say, "I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that 
you would probably want." 
<br><br>
He says, "yeah the one you won't give me dick" 
<br><br>
Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless. 
<br><br>
I say, "Why do you need a sow?" 
<br><br>
He says, "i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for 
my level" 
<br><br>
Yep. That's what he said......"burned woods". 
<br><br>
I say, "man are you ever in the wrong place." 
<br><br>
He says, "?" 
<br><br>
Apparently he found the "question mark" key conveniently located nearby other 
various and sundry communication 
facilitators. 
<br><br>
I didn't answer him. 
<br><br>
He repeats, "??" 
<br><br>
Found it twice...good for him. 
<br><br>
He repeats, "???" 
<br><br>
Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming. 
<br><br>
I say, "You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods." 
<br><br>
He says, "my friend told me it was in kunark" 
<br><br>
I say, "Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a 
couple of months ago after a bunch of 
complaints were filed about 'static content'." 
<br><br>
He says, "?" 
<br><br>
I say, "!" 
<br><br>
He says, "?" 
<br><br>
I say, "," 
<br><br>
He says, "wtf" 
<br><br>
I say, "no, already have some." 
<br><br>
He says, "????" 
<br><br>
I don't respond. 
<br><br>
He says, "so where the @#$% is burned woods" 
<br><br>
He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was 
sniffing his feet. 
<br><br>
I say, "Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, 
since they began randomizing zone 
locations." 
<br><br>
My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE 
story yet. Just snippets. 
<br><br>
He says, "@#$% i just got off the boat" 
<br><br>
I say, "You don't need the boat." 
<br><br>
He says "why" 
<br><br>
I say, "You're a wizard!" 
<br><br>
He says, "how you know that" 
<br><br>
I say, "I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have 
teleportation spells." 
<br><br>
He says, "oh yeah the green ones" 
<br><br>
I nod. 
<br><br>
I say, "Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by 
color." 
<br><br>
He says, "thx" 
<br><br>
I say, "How'd you think about doing it that way?" 
<br><br>
He says, "they were all @#$%## up when i got this char" 
<br><br>
I say, "Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'." 
<br><br>
He says, "why" 
<br><br>
Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with 
your collection of boogers. 
<br><br>
I say, "It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods." 
<br><br>
He says, "how do you know" 
<br><br>
I say, "All patch messages come with a zone connection map." 
<br><br>
He says, "oh" 
<br><br>
I say, "Ok. You have it memmed now?" 
<br><br>
He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell 
book. 
<br><br>
He says, "yeah" 
<br><br>
I say, "Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there." 
<br><br>
Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. 
<br><br>
A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes 
I still haven't heard from him. 
<br><br>
Getting curious: 
<br><br>
I tell petitioner, "Are you there yet?" 
<br><br>
No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ] 
<br><br>
Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through. 
<br><br>
I tell petitioner, "Hit the 'r' key to reply to me." 
<br><br>
He replies, "i'm here now where do i go." 
<br><br>
Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. "C" for effort. 
<br><br>
I tell petitioner, "Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense 
Heading'?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "no" 
<br><br>
I reply, "Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one." 
<br><br>
It was a guess, but an educated one. 
<br><br>
He replies, "found it" 
<br><br>
I reply, "Click on it." 
<br><br>
He replies, "north" 
<br><br>
I reply, "Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path 
turns north. When it forks to the right, 
take the right fork." 
<br><br>
He replies, "ok" 
<br><br>
Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe 
faction up. 
<br><br>
He replies, "sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf" 
<br><br>
I reply, "They were roleplaying." 
<br><br>
He replies, "oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P" 
<br><br>
Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. 
<br><br>
I reply, "Where are you?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "i see something now. looks like a castle" 
<br><br>
I reply, "Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you 
some trouble, just keep running." 
<br><br>
Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in. 
<br><br>
A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was 
expecting. 
<br><br>
I tell petitioner, "What happened?" 
<br><br>
As if I didn't know.... 
<br><br>
He replies, "my spells are gone!" 
<br><br>
I reply, "What happened?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "i died why" 
<br><br>
I reply, "Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "east wtf???" 
<br><br>
I reply, "Yikes. My bad. You should have run west." 
<br><br>
He replies, "?" 
<br><br>
I reply, "So where are you now?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "how can i tell" 
<br><br>
I reply, "Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you 
'You have entered [zone]'." 
<br><br>
He replies "it doesnt say [zone] there." 
<br><br>
After smacking my head against my monitor.... 
<br><br>
I reply, "What does it say in place of [zone]?". 
<br><br>
Get this.... 
<br><br>
He replies, "Burning Woods" 
<br><br>
I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! 
<br><br>
He replies, "is that the same as burned woods" 
<br><br>
I reply, "No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your 
corpse back." 
<br><br>
He replies, "i have to get my corpse back?????" 
<br><br>
/ignore petitioner 
<br><br>

Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No! 
<br><br>
Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what 
happened. 
<br><br>
I tell petitioner, "How's it going?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "wtf? where you been" 
<br><br>
I reply, "been afk, sorry." 
<br><br>
He replies, "got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me." 
<br><br>
My conscience somewhat eased... 
<br><br>
I reply, "Really? Cool! Where are you now?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "iceclad ocean" 
<br><br>
I scratch my head a few times. 
<br><br>
I reply, "Why Velious?" 
<br><br>
He replies, "the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western 
wastes this week" 
<br><br>
I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped 
breathing shortly before my dog dialed 911. 
<br><br>
He replied, "@#$%&* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?" 
<br><br>
That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife.
