<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Fog rolling in off the river
always reminds me of the times I would make my way through the streets at night.
I would cross over a near empty bridge, mist rising from the waters, suspended
above the clouds. It was a petty illusion, one I afforded myself simply because
I could.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Dust and ashes.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">I remember the snow in a winter
night and getting lost within myself. All the things that now are as if they had
never existed. Sitting in the back seat, the city lights neon streaks against
the glass. Eyes fixed nowhere in particular, stars lost in the sky.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">The metal feels like flesh.
Warm, pitted, almost soft against my palm. It's just a door handle, but a line
and a half and I can taste the sounds around me. Black clad and stained with a
thousand and one little tragedies that don't mean anything at all, acting out in
a carnival atmosphere because, after all, it is what they do best.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Everything is chronic static, an
echo, and I wonder where to go next. Names and faces that promised the world and
delivered sweet shit all. It wasn't supposed to be a revolving door, but things
aren't what they used to be. I was me but now he's gone.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Mechanical angst.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Metronome forms against smoke
and the lights, static on the screens, and a hundred and one petty tragedies at
the centre of their own little universe. Standing alone before the dials and
switches attached to their strings, playing them all. No regrets or tears for
the time and space wasted on things best left unsaid, burning behind the eyes
reminding me of the things you can't take back.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">No one will ever see what you
did to me.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Looking up at the stars in the
sky, on my back in the snow. I never felt so warm in my life.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">I stand on the bridge, mist on
the river, lights behind me remind me of a time where I thought some things
mattered that never really mattered at all.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">I remember the snow.</font></p>
