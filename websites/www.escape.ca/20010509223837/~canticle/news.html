<p><b><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="5">April 25th, 2001:
Background Updates</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">Sorry for the lack of
updates, but currently most of the work being done on New Dawn is in the
planning and design stages. Without the editors, all we can really do is work on
story line and mission ideas. There are a few new things to report however.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">In the <a href="bg.htm">Background</a>
section we've updated some of the timeline/storyline issues. It's been decided
that Fallout Tactics: New Dawn will be taking place roughly five years after the
events depicted in Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel. We realize a lot of
folks are very unhappy with the storyline in BOS and have issues with how the
Brotherhood was portrayed. We feel we have come to a resolution which allows us
to follow Fallout 'canon' (the 'official' events of the Fallout universe as
depicted in the Interplay games) while also addressing some of the more glaring
plot holes evident in BOS. I'm afraid that's all I can really say at this point
other than 'trust us'.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="5">April 14th, 2001:
Fallout Tactics: A New Dawn page launched.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">The purpose of this
site is to support and maintain an ongoing campaign for the Fallout:Tactics
community. The campaign will be built using the Game Editors which are scheduled
to be released by Microforte. This campaign will consist of several files which
may be downloaded from this site, and the supporting storyline which will be
provided. This site is currently in the working stages, and even the title is a
work in progress. Until the actual editors are released, most of the work which
will be done on this site will consist of storyline updates and background
material for the campaign world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">The storyline,
obviously, is based on the 'official' timeline of the Fallout Universe, although
for obvious reasons anything which takes place during the campaign will not be
considered 'official' or 'canon' by any stretch of the imagination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">The Storyline of the
campaign is set about a decade after the events which take place in
Fallout:Tactics. As the game world the campaign will cover stretches from the
West Coast of California to the eastern borders covered in Fallout Tactics, and
from Canada to the Mexican border from North to South, this decision was made to
provide the maximum possible opportunities to explore the campaign world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">Please note that while
there are several community projects currently in the works and are open to
submissions from the Fallout:Tactics community, this particular site is set up
so that a local Fallout:Tactics campaign, designed and produced locally, can be
made available to the players in the community at large. We are not currently
accepting applications for artists or editors, and exist simply to provide our
works to the Fallout:Tactics players at large. While this may change in the
future, it is not currently in our plans.</font></p>
