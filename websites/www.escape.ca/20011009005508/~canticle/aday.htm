Franzmann</b></i></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="1"><i><b>illustration by

<p align="left"><img border="10" src="aday.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="390"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">It’s
dark, not the kind where you’re tripping over the pile of unwashed laundry, or
where you fumble desperately for a light switch. Or a bra strap, I guess it
depends where you’re sitting. It’s more that dark where the light from the
television is adequate to the tasks at hand.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Why do I play the
host? Some odd sense of responsibility, I expect. I pour a rum and coke, and
three vodkas. You would think there would be some variation, but I suppose that
the familiar is something comforting.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Into the living
room, vodka, rum and coke, vodka, and one for me. I think for a moment about
turning down the television, but what would be the point? Shattered glass and
crimson streaks of grime might be better than another round of Martha Stewart,
but anything gets tired after repeated viewing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Beautiful missile
shield there Dubya.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">So they don’t
want the drinks. Fucking ingrates.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Not much less than
I expected, though. No one’s been here for what seems forever and a half. It
just is not what it used to be. It never will be again, I expect.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Who will carry me?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I keep looking for
some sign, some indication that there is more to this than what lies before my
eyes. High minded intellectuals spent decades, centuries, even more, praising
the infinite capacity of man to outlive his own frail flesh.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Wouldn’t they be
disappointed to know that the sum total of human knowledge was spread out over
the stratosphere, or at least what was left up there. It’s hotter than it was
this time last…month? Year?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">When everything
was the way it was before, I could barely remember the it was in the middle of 2
weeks paid vacation. Permanent leave hasn’t exactly honed my timekeeping
skills to any great degree.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">It’s definitely
hotter. That much I can be sure of. Maybe it’s summer, or maybe it’s just
that much less of something this place needs. Ozone slowly baking off into space.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Well, if no one
else wants them, I am not about to let a few perfectly good drinks go to waste.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">A scratch,
something in the dust.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I spin on my
heels. Nothing has moved without the bidding of the wind in entirely too long.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Nothing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Imagination is
truly a dangerous thing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Now, standing here
where I am, it seems so long ago and far away. It did not seem so far away, when
I was young, climbing through a window as the moon grew ever more bright in the
night sky. The scent of the lawn, freshly cut, the stains on my knees as I rose
to my feet, looking up and catching the faint call of rain in the air. Every
sound amplified. Surrounded by the sighing of the wind in the leaves, and my
passage through the grass.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">When I finally
reached my destination, I would lie back and stare as the thoughts ran through
my mind, the prototype of perfection. Sounds of a name.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">The breeze picks
up, scatters dust over the makeshift boots covering my feet, and I look across
the surface of the river. It was here, so long ago it seems, that I found that
single moment in time I so longed to share. If she were here, now, would she
even remember?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Fetid waters fill
the pond, a stinking mire where once I saw reflected the hopes and dreams that
carried me through so very many nights. To hold in my arms one more time those
hopes and dreams, and know that they would be more than what they are.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">There is no coming
back.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">“Remember me to
the one who lives there, she once was a true love of mine…”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">There are those
who spend moments of their lives as I spend the entirety of my own, staring down
at the monuments of those who have passed before and wondering what it is they
can do to remember them.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The
living will envy the dead.</span></font>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">***</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">The taste of chalk in
my mouth, the swirling dust hypnotic, intoxicating. I pull the scarf over my
nose, hoping to keep the metallic tang at bay. Standing on the porch, one hand
on the rail, another inside the trench coat, the comforting leather on leather
whisper reminds me the holster is still there.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Isn’t it always?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I close my eyes,
and remember it as it was, the days before the shroud of the sky was blown off.
Looking up from this very spot, pinpricks in the velvet sheet, twinkling ever on
and off, moon full and bathing the world in faerie light. It was a long time
ago, and only a memory exists.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Now, toxins scud
across an angry red sky, chasing sickly green whispers. The stars are just a
memory, like so much else.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I pull the goggles
over my eyes, and step down to the street. This never gets any easier. Not when
the wind wails through the dead trees, kicking up the waste and litter. Never
easier, still required.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">The playground is
as empty as it ever is, the same scene I’ve seen what seems a thousand times
before. The roundabout spins lazily in the breeze, the little skeleton still
draped over its bars, overalls in tatters. I should really do something about
that, but I can’t really figure out what. Every day I step out, Winnie the
Pooh smiles at me, waving through a film of red dust and grime, and empty
sockets ask me why it had to be her.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I never have an
answer.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Boots sink into
the scorched wood chips and dust, kicking up a haze around my feet. Through the
goggles, peripheral vision has that eerie fishbowl effect, and the shadows seem
to dance at the edge of my eyes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I’m too scared
to close my eyes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Cars wait for
owners that aren’t coming back. I amuse myself drawing a happy face in a
Sunfire’s rear window. I wonder if it will still be there when the rest has
rusted away. I wonder if I care.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I step over the
cracked glass and twisted metal, empty aisles and shattered bottles on the floor
a testament to panic and the end of time. What else are you going to do when
you’re told to hold tight and take your last breath because the missiles are
on the way? Pull out the lawn chair and toast the apocalypse with the Captain,
of course.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I look up and
smile. I’m not sure why, I’ve been here a dozen times before, it never
changes. I pull a bottle free from the sticky residue, and feel it through the
leather gloves. Back home, a lawn chair awaits.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Across the street,
everything seems as it was, waiting the flick of a switch. The coffee shop
proclaims itself open, and that it is, the glass fronting blown out, inviting me
inside.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Why not?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I marvel at times
at what was spared.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I sweep shattered
porcelain off one of the shelves, and staring me at me is a faerie in relief.
Everything else blown to kingdom come, and this one coffee cup dares me to take
it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Who am I to argue
with good fortune?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I pull a chair out
front, and right one of the tables. The wind is dying down, the dust is
settling, and the sun will soon set. It always sets. There are some things you
can count on.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I look towards the
bridge, and wonder where everything went wrong.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Does it matter?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I put my feet up
on the table and watch the sun go down.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Tomorrow’s
another day.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">***</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">There's a low hum
in the back of my mind, that insistent electrical droning you feel when you've
spent entirely too much time watching TV, or sitting on the computer. The
silence always amplifies it, emphasizes the artificial nature of the company you
keep.<br>
<br>
Only this time, no one's left the TV set on, or forgotten to power down their
system. I stand before the empty pews, wiping a film of rust red dust from the
pulpit and wonder exactly what it is that I can say. I wonder if I'm the only
one who ever gave a eulogy for everything that ever lived, and the only answer
that makes sense is no. Everyone who ever stood here before me had the same
reason for doing so, and for so very many of them it must have seemed the end of
the world.<br>
<br>
It is the end of the world.<br>
<br>
That vacuum, that gnawing, aching reminder that something is no longer where it
should be. And still, nothing adequate comes to mind. Those who came before me,
their loss is something I will never understand, just as mine is something they
would not understand. How can you possible explain something that defies
explanation?<br>
<br>
The hand of God made manifest?<br>
<br>
Yes Lisa, there is a God. And he is a wrathful, vengeful one.<br>
<br>
Maybe the combined sins of Middle America's trailer parks proved just a little
too much for the big guy. Maybe it just happened because it needed to happen. I
could spend the rest of my life, whatever that might be worth, trying to fathom
the reasons for what took place, and the only thing I will ever really
understand is that I will never understand.<br>
<br>
So here I am. What do I say?<br>
<br>
That I should have spent less time watching Springer and more time appreciating
what was around me? That I should have known what I had, and spent less time
wishing for what I hadn't? That I should have worn more sunscreen for the
apocalypse?<br>
<br>
A person like me could go mad contemplating everything that wasn't. I could
probably spend the rest of my life wondering why I forgot to watch the last
episode of the Simpsons that anyone would ever have the chance to see. I could
easily spend as much time wondering why I never said hello to the woman who sat
next to me on the bus who wore the faint scent of lilac and so very much black.<br>
<br>
I look over my shoulder, and Jesus is crying. Rot runs under his eyes, twin
little rivers. I run my finger beneath the lids.<br>
<br>
It's not that red.<br>
<br>
So here I am, I stand before the empty pews, the son of God's tears between my
thumb and forefinger. You would think I would have a captive audience, but when
the missles landed, there were few who sought the solace of the Church. Maybe it
was the Rapture, and I was simply left behind. You would think if that were the
case, I would have a little more company. Or maybe it is a hell on earth. Maybe
the rest of the world is waiting for me to join them.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am just not supposed to know.<br>
<br>
What do I say, now that I am here? Why did I come here to begin with?<br>
<br>
Perhaps I simply do not want to forget. Perhaps I do not wish to get over it.
And perhaps I just wish to remind the empty world of what exactly it has lost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I was twelve when
I saw Jacob’s Ladder. Since that time I have climbed every step of the way,
and wondered when the child would arrive to take me into the light. While I am
lying on my back, staring at the ceiling, watching a broken bulb dangling from a
dead string, I find myself asking if I will ever wake up.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">***</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Point me to the
sky above.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I pull on my
boots, and for the first time in as long a time as I can remember, the lace
snaps. They used to do that all the time. I would pick up a package of four from
the Dollar Store, just because they were there, and I would go through them in a
week. Sometimes it was longer, if I were playing the part of a shut in for the
week. I guess at some point I finally got tired of dropping a dollar for black
laces, and I picked up a few that would last just a little bit longer. Or maybe
I just happened upon that lucky package that contained laces that were not
assembled in some South East Asian labour colony.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I can’t get
there on my own.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">No laces. At least
there are still a few rolls of electrical tape. Not like it’s useful for
anything else at this point. Round and round it goes. That dull, droning hum has
returned. I thought I would finally be rid of it, but I expect it will follow me
around until everything finally ends, the last living legacy of the species
mixed with that ever present bleeding dust, choking winds carrying the memories
six ways from Sunday. Will this be the last time?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Walk me to the
graveyard.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I suppose it was
inevitable. No one, not a one, can endure as I have. What am I doing? I used to
believe it was because there had to be others. How could I possibly be the only
one? Evidently, I am the answer to my own question, that elusive riddle I have
been chasing since that single day when I raised a bottle to the sky and said I
was sorry into a hail of fire.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I guess apologies
just do not mean all that much in the grand scheme of things when you’re
really not sure what it is you are sorry for.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">I never did walk
up to the casket. I sat in the back, looked down at my boots, and wondered if my
memories of her face would be enough to remind me that for a brief period in
time, she had been the most important thing in the world to me. That she saw the
world, even if only for a second through eyes not her own and had shared a
moment that was exclusive and unique.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Dig up her bones.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">The air is thick
with dust, thicker than it has been before. I expect it will be time, before
long. Will I be ready when it is? Will I ever be ready? When I have the answer,
I will be sure to the let the world know. Nothing ever ends, so long as I am
here to remember.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">One
day blurs into the next, an uninterrupted constant broken only by those periods
where I dream of all that is around me, shattered again on my waking soaked in
salt and dust.<br>
<br>
It was a long time past that I stopped wondering what day it was, or the time of
year. As a child, I used to turn my face into the rain and taste it on my
tongue, the scent that came with the fall of the drops filling my senses.<br>
<br>
These days, if I dare to play the part of that long ago child, it is as if I
have placed my tongue to the tip of a battery, and I recoil at what remains.<br>
<br>
I step outside once more, wondering what it that carries me through each day and
the next.<br>
<br>
I can't remember the last time I saw it snow. Flakes drifting down from the grey
skies above, touching the earth, melting in its warmth, followed close behind by
another, and still another. I pulled the goggles down around my neck, looked up
at the sky, and marvelled at how grey it really was. It wasn't orange, or green,
or the technicolour chemical stew which I had become accustomed to, but a grey
slate waiting for me to write patterns on it with my fingers, flakes falling and
melting on my face.<br>
<br>
I looked across the street, a smile playing at the edges of my lips as the snow
collected on the surface of rusted hulks sighing against the shattered curbs. I
remember, now, the last time I saw snow. Walking through the park, hand in hand,
flakes settling on the still surface of the pond. There was no ice, not yet, and
against the sheets of white covering the trees it seemed a sight to live for all
at once.<br>
<br>
I was the last man on earth.<br>
<br>
And I was no longer alone.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&quot;If
you are frightened of dying, and you find yourself holding on, you'll see devils
tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are
really angels, freeing you from the earth...&quot;<br>
<br>
I can never remember exactly what it was called, thinking back on those times so
far in my past, but it amused me nonetheless. It was hardly the greatest movie I
had ever seen, I wouldn't even call it anything close to a good movie. It was
the idea behind it that was fascinating.<br>
<br>
Living the same day, over and over again, and only your own frame of reference
remains the same. Perhaps one day you crawl out of bed on the left side rather
than the right, you step on a tack, and the entire course of your day is altered
by the consistent, constant, metronome pain shooting through your foot. You bed
down for the night, and awake to the same song, the same sun, the very same day,
and this time, this time you set foot on the right side of the bed. You walk
that much faster across the street, and you make the bus you missed. You sit
down where you hadn't been able to before, and the scent of lavendar drifts
across the aisle. By the end of the day, you had a phone number you didn't the
day before, but you can't bring yourself to call it. And as the day begins all
over again, you make that decision to call, or perhaps you dial the number fresh
in your memory before it has even been given to you.<br>
<br>
An endless series of possibilities in an ongoing cycle, without resolution.<br>
<br>
If only it were such a simple thing. One night in my past, from a pitch sky, the
rain began to fall. It seemed rain at first, and the scent was clean and fresh.
There was a winters chill in the air, and the rain mixed with heavy wet flakes
of snow fell to the earth, a damp slush forming on the concrete, the paving
stones, the streets. There was an audible crack in the silence as a branch laden
with the wet snow gave beneath the weight. I lay on my bed, staring out the
window, and I closed my eyes. I dreamt of someone I had not thought of in so
very long a time, and for the first time I can remember she did not seem
burdened. She stood beneath a dented stop sign, waiting for me to cross the
street. I sat with my back against a building, red brick harsh against my back,
looking up at a sky which promised rain and slush.<br>
<br>
She walked over to me, nervous smile on her face, and put her finger to my chin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you remember her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It couldn't be. She has another...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?<br>
<br>
&quot;Not every story has a happy ending.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was the sharp stereo crackle, a hiss, a pop, and her form broke into fuzzy
static lines.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe,<br>
you'll sit and sigh<br>
wishing that I were near<br>
Then, maybe,<br>
you'll ask me to come back again.<br>
And Maybe, I'll say, maybe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shattered glass and a thousand yard stare.<br>
<br>
There's a film of grime and dust over the lenses of the goggles, and I absently
bring up my hand to wipe it away. The wind has picked up again, ending the eerie
days on end of silence. The same day, playing over and over again. Left side,
right side, only the buses just don't run anymore. There is still no resolution.<br>
<br>
I reach inside the pocket of my coat and pull out the snapshot. Well worn, the
edges ragged after a thousand and one touches, tear stained edge blurring the
background. A lopsided smile, and those eyes. It was always her eyes. And I
smile. Despite everything, I smile. For so very long, I asked myself why I
continued going on, why I held so close to the anodyne of routine, why I made
myself the legacy of the world around me.<br>
<br>
Maybe I've found my reason.<br>
<br>
And maybe, I'll say maybe.</span></font><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
