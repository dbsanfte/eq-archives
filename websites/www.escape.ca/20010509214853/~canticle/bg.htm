<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">This section will
contain any necessary background information which you may require while playing
the New Dawn campaign. This includes any Weapons Statistics, new Perks, or
special rules which may be in effect during the course of the campaign. It will
also contain tips and hints for playing the New Dawn campaign if you are not
familiar with Computer Role Playing Games. </font></p>
<p><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3"><b>SPECIAL NOTE</b>: Please
bear in mind that while Fallout:Tactics placed a great deal of emphasis on
combat and squad tactics, the New Dawn Campaign will require the use of many
skills currently underutilized in the Fallout:Tactics- Brotherhood of Steel
missions. The missions in Fallout:Tactics- New Dawn will often require the use
of skills such as Barter and Outdoorsman to a far greater degree than in
Brotherhood of Steel. </font></p>

OF STEEL</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">In the
Western Wastes (the lands west of the Rocky Mountains, south of Canada), the
Brotherhood of Steel is a military/religious organization which is devoted to
the hoarding and preservation of technology. They aggressively seek out
repositories of tech left over from the great war, seeking not only to obtain it
for themselves, but to prevent it from falling into the hands of the wastelands
inhabitants. The Brotherhood believes that only through their efforts, guidance,
and technology can the world return to a state of grace. They are a secretive,
xenophobic organization which has no room within its ranks for those who would
consort with those who would return the world to chaos and anarchy. Their
battles against the Masters mutants have left them with a deep seated loathing
and mistrust of Super Mutants, and they have little love or sympathy for the
Ghouls, who they view as parasitic scavengers that serve only to remind the
world of the devastation mankind visited upon itself.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Gothic821 Cn BT" color="#00FF00" size="3">The
Brotherhood of Steel has come into conflict with its rebellious splinter faction
from across the Rockies, who they believe have violated the most sacred tenets
of the Brotherhood. In addition to their excesses in pacifying the wastelands,
the splinter faction of the Brotherhood is perceived as having aided the enemies
of mankind in their acceptance of Super Mutants and Ghouls within their ranks.
Their aggressive pursuit of recruits and willingness to trade technology is
viewed as anathema to what the Brotherhood is trying to accomplish. While there
is no open conflict, the two factions of the Brotherhood are hardly on the best
of terms.</font></p>
