he walked into the bathroom, razor in hand, Jason told Tina that he’d be right
back. That was just the way he was. He was always getting to something, about to
do it and he would be there right away, but when you got right down to it, he
never actually arrived at his destination. He had every intention of doing so,
it wasn’t as if he meant to live a long line of disappointments all in a row,
it was just that there was always something there to distract him.<br>
<br>
For now, it was sugar candy lines on a sheet of glass.<br>
<br>
Tina would strip before the altar, look up into sad eyes, and ask why it would
never rain. She never really got an answer, so she’d smile and nod as Jason
walked away from the table, say something under her breath about waiting as long
as it would take, and then she’d throw back a double rum and coke wondering
why things never seemed to change.<br>
<br>
While Jason was lying against the side of a urinal, pounding the tiles and
screaming, Tina walked up to the DJ and asked him to play something she’d
heard a thousand times before and would hear a thousand times again. Liquid
crystal movement, the same ones she’d done a thousand times before, eyes on
everything except what she wanted people to see the most, because that was
something she couldn’t spare.<br>
<br>
Jason stood up, wiping his nose and smiling. He had it all.<br>
<br>
Sirens under the stars, red and blue strobe lights in a quiet night sky, voices
indistinct. Tina opened her eyes and all she could see in front of her were
spider web patterns in the glass. She wanted to look over at her side, but she
couldn’t move, she was stuck fast, moth to the flame.<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes and remembered something she hadn’t thought of in forever.<br>
<br>
No one of consequence, no one to care, it didn’t matter as she lay back under
the stars beside him. No one really cared about him, or thought he was
important, but he was everything all at once. Candy apples and caramel corn.<br>
<br>
It was going to be too late.<br>
<br>
She always kept a photograph, she wasn’t sure why. Edges worn with worry,
water stain from the time she had watered the fern and just hadn’t been paying
attention, it wasn’t even anything special. He had walked in on his birthday
and she’d taken his picture, because it was just one of those things she
wanted to do.<br>
<br>
There was an echo now, the scream of steel on steel. Jason never liked that
picture.<br>
<br>
A hundred days and nights after the funeral, sitting in her room with a floppy
eared bunny clenched to her breast, she wanted to step back to a night under the
stars.<br>
<br>
She opened the door, and walked out into the park, and sat down on the swing.<br>
<br>
And for the first time in a thousand and one nights, that was when she began to
cry.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">She walked over to the
bar with the confident stride she had been born with a year ago. She was
everything everyone wanted and more and it didn’t matter nearly so much to her
as she thought it would. All that really mattered right now was getting a drink,
sitting back in a calico corner and wondering why it is she was always here at
the same time and the same place looking at things through the eyes she thought
people wanted to see.<br>
<br>
She walked over to me at one point and handed me a cigarette, and said she
remembered me from class. It’s half down to the edge of my fingers before I
take it back, I’m walking through her eyes and the half-answered questions
about why she’s talking to me don’t even register anymore.<br>
<br>
She is a samurai.<br>
<br>
I wonder if all angels are like me. Do we all have addictions?<br>
<br>
The heady scent of something I can’t remember around her and the sting of
smoke and mirrors. Music no one remembers and I can’t forget. Candy cane
dreams.<br>
<br>
I walked away without taking a breath, the red and black ash settling on my
fingers not burning nearly so much as the eyes the followed my retreat.<br>
<br>
She never came back.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Lucida Calligraphy">Jess was raised on
fairy tales and dreams of a candyfloss castle, and when she looked up into his
eyes she wondered why her knight in shining armour always left her behind.<br>
<br>
Sitting in the sand with a shovel clasped in her dainty little hand, looking up
at the clouds and wondering why she had to go inside.<br>
<br>
A thousand little knives and thorns on the stems of roses tore away, day by day
taking what little remained until she was broken words on broken glass with wine
soaked rags within.<br>
<br>
She lay back in the rain slicked grass and looked up into the sky. She wanted to
know if all she’d ever be was the image of something she never was and never
could hope to be, and if adventures ever came to an end.<br>
<br>
She walked along the interstate and stopped at the corner store where she used
to throw stones in the ditch. She wondered what happened to the dog that used to
lie in the sun and wag its tail when she came outside with an orange popsicle,
sticky fingers matting its hair and the rough tongue running over her face as
she giggled and flailed.<br>
<br>
Screen door askew, aisles empty, nothing ever seemed the same.<br>
<br>
She went home and looked in the mirror, thinking that all anyone would ever know
would be the sweet smelling flowers inside an empty shell. She never knew that
someone was on the other side, looking back, and wondering when she’d smile
again and wake up the world.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="3">Xia slides by with
rings on her fingers and a Cheshire grin, walking over the ghosts of a thousand
days and nights. I wanted to take a look behind those eyes and ask why the world
had to paint itself in shades that only she could see.<br>
<br>
It isn’t that her shoes are too tight, or even that she has forgotten how to
dance, it’s that no one ever plays the song she wants to hear, that one where
she would close her eyes and take the lead and circle across the t-shirts and
jeans that drift on the bedroom floor.<br>
<br>
No one saw what it was that set trails of fire across the sky.<br>
<br>
She use to wonder if there was anything more to it than days and nights
shattering themselves on the shore and wearing away on her memories of things
that would never be. She’d walk along the beach and pick up a shell, and she
wouldn’t listen for the ocean she’d call into it and ask the tide to wait
just a little bit longer, just this once.<br>
<br>
They all wanted her to be a ballerina but all she wanted was to stain her feet
green and climb a tree. All the boys wanted her to come down so they could take
her place.<br>
<br>
She took off her shoes and sat at the edge of her bed and wondered if airplanes
ever had dreams. She spread out her arms and spun in circles and thought that if
they did would they decide not to fly?<br>
<br>
I sat across from her in a tiny little coffee shop with a clapboard sign, and I
sipped away at something that still tingles somewhere back where I keep
everything locked away.<br>
<br>
I asked her if she wanted to climb a tree.</font></p>
