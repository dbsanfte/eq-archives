thing before i go to sleep, only to learn that Zlandicar was up and begging for a battle. Letters somewhat blurring as i type, the Zlandicar
fight was executed nicely. Buyers of the night was Septeternal on the frakadar talisman, expecting to see a shroud there soon /tap, Axem on the
cracked claw of Zlandicar, Dhouja on the heart of Zlandicar, Bank on the gauntlets of Mortality, could this be an item for YOU?? Last but not least
the Zlandicar talisman which has yet to be decided.

which sadly meant we had to clear fearplane yet again. Alot of us still remember the endless farming in this godforsaken zone
for the once ever so sought for planar armour, collected my 4th pair of carmine sleeves tonight, atleast some twinks are getting 
their general armour slots filled out. Nineweh (evil wiz twink) is levling like crazy for the broken golem and the carmine suit, we
all wish her the best :p Onward to the fight though, without doubt one of the better fights against Cazic Thule since they upgraded his loot table. 
The outcome was clear from the start, Cazic's health bar dropping rapidly, the turnout was also high, despite our guildleader still stuck in iceclad
waiting on a certain griffin to spawn. Speaking of Stormfeather, we decided to redo an old foh trick as it seemed rather funny at the time, a picture
would explain the situation better, thanks to Mohogany for making a crazy comment not suitable for viewing forcing me to edit out a part of the guildsay.
Quick explanation though, told a ranger in the zone to /ooc asking if stormfeather was for anything special, Ellise (Ziggen) replied fast, havnt been able
to get a hold of the ranger for the screenshot of the 10 tells he got within 30 seconds. Also brought along our lvl 1 paladin named Stormfeather which popped 
up on track every now and then.
<br>
<br>
<IMG border=0 SRC="bilder/stormfeather.jpg">

Cazic was killed according to plan, only setback was Jubilex who for some reason was trying to break the record of most deaths against a single mob, not sure
if he managed to pass Kold (Kold down) but it was a good attempt by the arcane one none the less. Drops of the night, hence the topic, was naturally another set 
of melee goodies. Prudance just couldnt keep the kps under wraps anymore and spent it all on a cloak. Two chokers were given to Talisen and Wwaan, while the cleric 
halo was given to Nida. Grats melee #"¤="#¤.

Arkinia the Wanderer was our dedicated fear puller for the night, and despite recently being crowned the best of the best of druids on Quellious, he met his match
against an apparantly buffed up glare lord pet within the fearplane today. Wwaan came up with a solution though

took notice of, but due to the hour, most of our members were no longer online, thus if he was still left alone by the time
we could gather people for saturday, Dain would be going down, and to our surprise noone seemed to even know that icewell was repopped.
Thus we visited the castle of the Dain, a friend of mine visiting for the weekend commented on the spelling of the dorf kings name, not too familiar 
with fantasy litterature, but it seems that the king of the dwarves in the previously mentioned litterature is Dane, in comparison to Dain, hehe not sure whether
this is a coincidence or not, but thought it would be worth mentioning atleast. Kill Points are currently active, meaning loot from now on will
be purchased based on lust and the size of your wallet. Without further adue, Dain belt (Alver), Ring of Winter (Nineveh) and a cloak (Sphyre).

Western Wastes was next stop where Klandicar was waiting patiently, to make a short battle reviewed short, Juzzam was given the key to sleepers. Derakor 
the Vindicator had managed to strole a total of 400 000 kilometers back and forth his bridge since the last time he was killed on Quellious. The battle
went very well, Vindicator down in a few minutes, and the loot of the night was a breastplate of vindification (Mohogany) and the head of derakor for the
druid plane of growth quest (Tache)

taken care of, whilst the guild on the other hand was very busy this late Thursday evening. Not being present most of the images below will be archived ones, 
but then again im quite sure most of you have seen a dead Cazic, Dain and similar by now. Fearplane was the first stop, Dracoliche this time being rather cheap on his
drops, Crimsom robe and the shield, he has yet to drop the shroud of protection for us, someday though.

Tonights fight against Cazic Thule went according to plan, yesterdays encounter taught us alot in how to execute our flurry of attacks on this spesific mob. Loot was 
a choker (Rostam), cloak (Thundax) and halo (Vorkun). The dain was surprisingly still up within Icewell, seeing as it was the 350 one spawned once again. Dain coughed up
two copies of crown (Jubilex & Faun) and this time the belt of dorfslaying was awarded to the dorf himself, Juzzam.

Velketor was the final stop of the day, in hopes of getting some bladecalling drops for our mages. Drops on Velketor sucked pretty much, Vermillion orb of torrefaction, silver sword of yalrik, 
and lastly the positive drop of the night, the enchanter hat (Dazzler).

seem to be taken out of the game as of yet, i for one was in a hurry yesterday getting rid of trak teeth and what not. We found ourselves
within the plane of fear today, for once clearing the plane quickly. Dracoliche dropped a Grotesque girdle (Aeuen) and Zombie flesh
bracer (Nineveh). We were somewhat unprepared for the Cazic Thule fight which put a damper on the rest of the evening meaning we had to engage
another round against the god who created the trolls. Was a long and intense fight but it turned out to be well worth it, Cloak of the fearsome (Krondath), 
Choker (Storaz), Shoulders (Ggan) and finally a Robe (Prizm)

Rest of the evening was spent in the Temple of Veeshan until the emergency patch notice was given, new patch day tomorrow, hopefully more mobs up to kill then. Comment
of the day goes to Jubilex as will be shown below, finally adding a picture of Ggan and Spalter wielding their epics, seem to have slipped my mind previously.

paladin Rostam, many a player found themselves helplessly lost both in the mountain maze, as well as the underwater tunnel passage. Once everyone had found
their way though, Miragul wasnt quite the adversary he used to be pre to Kunark, and Rostam got that epic quest part out of the way, dreading having to revisit
sky in the near future.
<br>
<br>
<IMG border=0 SRC="bilder/miragul.jpg">
<br>
<br>
Next stop was lake rathe where we finished a part of the necromancer epic for Aeuen, coincidentally also needing air for his completion of the hated duck. The road to the arena was
short where we had two Vis Maior members signed up for the Shadow Knight best of the best tournament. The turnout was surprisingly low, seven contestants total and a grandtotal of
two grave lords present. Obviously the two Vis shadow knights met to battle in the first round where Ggan came out victorious against his troll nemesis Grimblades. Ggan made his way 
rather impressive to the finals where he was put up against Kyrius of Shadows of the unseen. No third round was needed, Ggan swept the arena with ease and earned his title the reaver, which sadly
puts an end to his neverending flow of new surnames. During the event the conversation consisted mostly of the names of the people who were going down in the aftermath of the ceremony,
think most people were satisfied with the outcome :) Patch day tomorrow *shiver*

limited eyesight was given a chance to prove himself within the tomb of the sleeper. Upon translocating the heavily overdue for sleep americans one of our bards
happened to catch none other than Myga on track, the dragon we had been searching western wastes for the previous night.

Another dragon bane copy in the guild (Nineveh), one can almost notice a difference in this sentence.... After Mygas death to our great surprise we discovered two

Frostfeaver IV decided to pop for us today, again the 425 version, starting to wonder if they have removed the 350 one from the game. None the less,
our pull team discovered something new while pulling today and promised us a clean pull within half an hour, a promise they actually kept, thus it will be
very exiting to watch the progress on the next pull, beware, Bordamere is watching you.

Drops of the night was a head (Darkoor), 2 x frostreavers embroidered cloak (Alver & Dazzler) and an aegis of ice which i believe went to Resa, wife of Juzzam,
bribe, kidnapping or however he manages to keep her by his side.

After leaving the population of icewell keep in tears, our journey lead us towards WW in hopes of spawning the infamous Myga, after pretty much clearing WW 3-4 times without
a spawn i decided it was time to call it a night, hopefully a spawn will occur for the remaining ones. Patchday coming up soon and alot of other timers nearing their completion, so should be some
interesting updates here soon.

been quite active, Klandicar been killed a few times, Velketor in there somewhere too if i remember correctly, and the evergrowing Sleepers
crew gathered another primal, this time given to Greco. Onward to todays events, Dain finally showed himself in Icewell keep, his fiercer half. One of the
longer fights with the Dain that i can remember, had to kill off the three adds that came with him and still ended up victorious, unfortunately we cant
pull him solo each time, flawlessly with few casualties like some other guild(s) *wink* but he died in the end despite that. Loots of the night were a head (Ziggen), alot of interesting
jokes were uttered when he was about to turn it in, although they arnt suited for display on this page, hammer (Barrel), ring (Dhouja), crown (Talisen). 
<br>
<br>
<IMG border=0 SRC="bilder/dain425.jpg">

Next on the agenda was Klandicar, and for reasons left unknown to those of you not involved, this was an intense, hectic affair. Tanja ended up with the sleepers key
Corpse was looted before i got a chance to grab a screenshot, although there has been more than enough pictures of Klandicar here lately, so not bothering to put another up.
<br>
<br>
Zlandicar also graced us with his presence, thus the trip from ww was short. Zlandicar gave up a Sleepers key Talisman (Talisen), cowl of mortality (Malla), frakadars talisman (Clarissia).
<br>
<br>
<IMG border=0 SRC="bilder/zlandicar11.jpg">
<br>
<br>
Sontalak hadnt been given a serious attempt on Quellious yet, and we decided an attempt on him was way overdue, not knowing what to expect we setup and engaged, somewhat baffled by the immense
damage output he displayed. Held in there for a while but in the long run his damage outdid ours, a definte learning experience so despite the loss of this battle the war is far from over.

Sentinel. All in all this was a blast, quite satisfactory to kill these mobs flawlessly with few casualties, just kidding :)
Lots of drops only going to mention a few thats on top of my head right now; Grey Suede Boots (Kold), Cleric healing staff (Yallayenya), 2 x

The night before we set course for the plane of air in hopes of getting Septeternals final piece for his necromancer epic. Cleared up to isle
4 and the keeper of souls thankfully dropped the black silk cape, completing our first Reaperduck in the guild. Also got some nice items clearing up to
the horise, WoTG, quite a few pairs of fire resist gloves (white satin gloves) and a few treant tears. So far a very nice weekend, more to come as well im sure.
