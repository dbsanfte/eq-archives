EQ&nbsp;Info is freeware. With the usual disclaimer: This program might not reflect
the true information etc... Observe the current version of this program, it is in 
beta testing! Therefore I would very much like to have feedback about bugs, errors,
comments, suggestions etc. Send them to me at: <A HREF="mailto:pulsar@writeme.com">pulsar@writeme.com</A>.

<p>
EQ&nbsp;Info is a nice program for players of the very popular on-line game EverQuest.
Features: Skill information and monitoring, mana calculator, server monitor, class 
and race combination and starting cities, etc.
It all started as a mana calculator as the previously available ones did some minor 
things wrong (Intelligence over 200 not handled correctly and mana only for every 
5th int). But I kept adding more things I liked to have myself. I hope you find this 
useful too!<p>

This program is written using Java(TM) and therefore needs a Java Runtime Environment
to be installed on your system (available for most platforms). While most Windows users
already have this installed, a newer version is <em>required</em> for EQ Info!
At least version 1.3 of the Java 2 Platform is needed.<p>

Depending on your choice the download size of this Java Runtime Environment is about 5MB.
Note: Currently the only available platforms with this version (1.3) is: 
Windows, Linux (Beta) and Solaris (Beta)<p>

Beta 3. From this version on I will add the credits for
(the first one) finding bugs, ideas for new features etc. in these lists. I would 
like some more class specific and perhaps server links! I can find alot of them
but I only want to list the "good ones". Other links are of course welcome too!
I still need alot more info on errors on skill caps or info on unknown ones!

<UL>

<LI>Added: EQ Info can now parse log files with multiple characters! (Will not work if you have characters with the same name on different servers.)

<font size=3 color="#000080" face="sans-serif"><b>Version 0.4</b></font>
<p>
Beta 2. I saw some problems with the update feature:<p>
The Java interface is a bit clumsy in my opinion when you choose a 
directory. No change that too "very". The file dialog that pops up is set
to select directories only, this is ok... So no files etc will show.  
The problem is that if you double-click (go into to) the directory of your choosing it
will not work!<p>

<i>I have now (this verison and later) changed this to something simplier 
(now choose a file instead, with a preset name)</i>.
<p>
I still consider this software as beta, hence the version number (less than 1.0).
As always I appreciate all you comments and bug reports
sent to me and I try to answer all the email I get.

<UL>

Bug fixes to Beta 1. Thanks for all bug reports! The most often asked question 
is that about the log file. "What log file?" etc. So I added information about this
to the readme.html/about dialog and the tool tip text on the "Get From Log" button.
