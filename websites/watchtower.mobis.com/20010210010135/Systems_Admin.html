            <p class="paragraph">One of the more obvious differences between corporate 
              information systems and those of small businesses is the presence 
              of personnel trained and experienced in keeping the systems running 
              at peak performance. These Systems Administrators not only specify, 
              install and properly configure the systems, they provide the daily 
              maintenance and watch guard needed to insure that the systems are 
              available when needed; every business day. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">While it is true that many people are capable of installing 
        basic operating systems and possibly even setting up a network of computers, 
        the comparison between that situation and a proper corporate systems group 
        would be akin to the comparison of a weekend mechanic and the pit crew 
        for a high performance racing team. The weekend mechanic may well be a 
        highly intelligent individual who excels at his chosen profession during 
        the week and is capable of keeping his car running. However, the racing 
        team performs the tasks needed for normal operations on a daily basis 
        and has become extremely skilled at those operations. They have also developed 
        methods, skills, tools and procedures to take the vehicle well beyond 
        the capabilities of a normal car. Members of the team have specialized 
        in certain functional areas further than would be practical for one individual 
        and they have learned to rely on each other to provide solutions that 
        go beyond the obvious and mundane. The team's entire reason for existence 
        is the advancement of the common goal and, therefore, the work of the 
        members reflects that same position.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This comparison may seem a bit melodramatic, but its 
        basic tenants are truthful. Many small businesses are currently using 
        either self-managed systems or &quot;by the hour&quot; consulting services. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><b><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=4,0,2,0" width="185" height="185" align="right">

        </object></b>Due to changes in the Information Industry, both of these 
        solutions have become more expensive in both direct and opportunity costs 
        than is practical. In the case of the self-managed systems, unexpected 
        down time and lack of advanced services build costs that many businesses 
        do not consider; much less track. If a business uses a standard computer 
        or network consulting service, it is likely that the person performing 
        the service is not certified or highly experienced. Regardless, it is 
        still the case that they are only called in when a failure occurs and 
        this continues the problem of unscheduled down time. Additionally, the 
        business by which the consultant is employed is most likely involved in 
        the retail sale of equipment and software. This leads to a probable conflict 
        of interest of which the small business owner is, most likely, unaware. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">The alternative to the described methods is Professional 
        Systems Administration. By applying the training and experience of a team 
        of Systems Administrators, Nexus ITG will bring to the smaller businesses 
        in Mobile the type of information systems support that, here to fore, 
        has only been available to the large corporations. Activities in the areas 
        of planning, purchasing, configuring, installation and daily upkeep will 
        now be available at costs that will be aligned with the costs currently 
        being incurred under previous methods.</p>
      <p><b><u>Team access to team experience</u></b></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The personnel of Nexus ITG have a great deal of experience 
        in analyzing and planning the information systems that a particular situation 
        requires. Being used to conducting such dealings in projects ranging from 
        multi-million dollar solutions to basic small office requirements, our 
        team members have solved most of the situations that a company might face.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Because Nexus ITG does not resale technology, we bring 
        the ability to work with a company to determine their exact information 
        technology needs and act as an agent of the company during the purchase 
        of equipment and software. Although this is unusual in the current environment 
        of local technology providers, it is a model that fits with the paradigm 
        of a corporate Systems Administration group.</p>
