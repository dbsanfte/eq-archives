Hidden in the shadows of myth and legend, there are figures unknown, mysteries untold, and secrets hidden.  Among these are the Dragonmarked.  Granted immortality by the deities they serve, they travel together, and their power grows.  Entrusted with keeping the lore of Norrath, the Dragonmarked are constantly searching out new things, and remembering old ways.  We remember in our bardic songs, and in our scrolls of sorcery, and thus bring balance to a world born of chaos.
<p>
Guild Charter<br>
"Wyrm Scrolls"			
<p>
<img src="images/head_info.gif" width=153 height=20 alt="" border="0"><br>
<p>			
Dragonmarked is a guild founded in the belief that through mutual communication and help, all members, and indeed all denizens of Norrath that come into contact with our members, can improve their enjoyment while increasing the power and status of the guild as a whole.
<p>
Dragonmarked is officially Neutral Good, and all races will be accepted based on player merit.  The guild strives to maintain balance, and while good is generally our goal, evil is sometimes necessary to keep order.
<p>
Dragonmarked members will follow all laws as set forth in the Elemental Scrolls as follows:
<ol>
<li>Scroll of Earth:  All members are to breathe life into their characters through interaction and expression, be it in game, or in stories composed of the character.  Roleplay is encouraged, but never enforced. All members are to respect the Role-playing of others. Earth teaches us balance, and with this knowledge comes power.
<li>Scroll of Air: All members are to use proper chat commands i.e. when buying and selling items use the /auc command, and to keep shouting to a minimum. Chat commands when used as a form of roleplay is fully acceptable, when done tastefully. Communication is the key to becoming successful, and to maintain order within the guild. Do not debase or abuse other players by the use of OOC profanity.  Respect the integrity of the guild. Air teaches us patience and respect, and with this knowledge comes influence.
<li>Scroll of Fire: Dueling between guild members and close friends is allowed at any time.  Dueling outside of the guild is only done with the consensus of a guild officer. Attend and sponsor server and guild functions such as festivals, mass hunting parties, weddings, guild wars, feasts, and local pub parties when possible. Speak for the guild only if you have assurances that what your propose is possible and agreed upon by the guild.  Personal vendettas will never be guild sanctioned without just cause, and group consensus. Fire teaches us responsibility, and with this knowledge come justice
<li>Scroll of Water: Always protect, aid, and be charitable to fellow guild members. Each member is a part of the lifeblood of the guild, and regardless of level has something to contribute, be it trade skills, or simply guild errands.  Any internal disputes between guild members will be settled with a Duel of which NO looting is allowed.  Water teaches us control, and with this knowledge comes honor.
</ol>
Failure to follow the words set down in these scrolls can lead to a guild vote for dismissal.
<p>
Dragonmarked Lexicon
<p>
Any Guild wide event such as Events, Guild Wars, Mass hunting parties, or dismissal of a member will require a majority vote, using the voting system as follows:
<ol>
<li>Each member gets a vote equal to their level/10 rounded up + one extra vote for members in the Mark of the Hand. I.E. lvl 16 member gets 16/10 or 2 votes, and a level 10 member in the Mark of the Hand gets 10/10 + 1, or 2 votes.
<li>All Marks will have an officer, and each officer will have votes equal to the highest level member plus one. This will add weight to their experience.
<li>The guild leader will have votes equal to the highest level member plus two.  The guild leader maintains the right to Veto any vote, in order to maintain power within the guild.  Replacements for the guild leader will be appointed in the event of the absence of the guild leader.
<li>Membership into the guild will require nomination by an officer, and approval by the guild leader.  A candidate can be innitiated into the guild, and be approved at a later date in the event of absence of the guild leader.  This will be taken on the honorable word of the guild officers.
</ol>
Conclusion:
<p>
Changes to the guild charter will require a majority vote at an Official Guild meeting.
<p>
Guild Founders:

J Hoopes<br>
Characters: Jaesan Aumar Human Wizard, Calimari Prophett Wood Elf Druid <br>
Guild Leader

<p>
Aside from abiding by all the guide lines above, all new recruits will be guilded on a trial basis.  During this period they will carry the Dragonmarked tag, but may be removed from the guild at any time. All inquiring recruits will be tagged at a guild meeting, so they may meet as many of our members as possible.
<p>
The trial period will last no longer than 2 weeks, at which point they will be inducted as full members at the next guild meeting. Meetings are currently being held every other Saturday in the Arena bordering Lake Rathe. 
<p>
A new recruit need not do anything specific during their trial, it is only used as a means to get to know the person and the player.
<p>
Dragonmarked will not be accepting any new recruits under the level of 25 unless they are vouched for by an existing member. If a member vouches for a new recruit they are solely responsible for the actions of that recruit until they are inducted into the guild.
