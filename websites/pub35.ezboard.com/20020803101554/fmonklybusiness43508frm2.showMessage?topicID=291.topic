Tag a mob, run a distance, FD and wait for most or all but one mob to return to a spawn spot.  However, pulling goes far beyond this, it is an art that demands both patience and practice.  And in zones like Velious and Kunark where the rules regarding FD and memblur have changed, it is even more difficult.<br><br>For a long time, pulling has been more a closely held trade secret than an open topic of discussion.  Here and there, people have posted about one posting technique or another, but it is hard to impart all the knowledge that one has accumulated over one's EQ life.<br><br>To be honest, I've not talked alot about pulling to anyone except a select few monks that I've known in game, or close guildmates.  However, as I approach Level 60, I see the end of my regular gaming in sight.  Soon, my time will be exclusively raids, and my twinks will consume more and more of my time.  So I hope to leave behind something more for the monk community that has been my family for almost two years.  So here is alot of what I know about pulling... I hope it helps some of you.<br><br>----<br><br>- Basic Terminology -<br><br>Tagging - Hitting a mob with a spell or melee/range attack to aggro it.<br><br>Aggro Radius - The distance around a mob that it will pass aggro to other mobs.  Also the distance around a mob before it will notice you and become hostile.  This radius is NOT static.  This will be explained further.<br><br>Line of Sight or LOS - when a mob can directly see you in it's radius of vision.<br><br>Hate List - A list the mob maintains of everyone it wants to kill at the moment.  This can be very long, including dozens of characters.  This list can be passed from mob to mob.<br><br>-- Intermediate Pulling --<br><br>Basic Chain pulling or Tagging<br><br>This simple technique involves pulling a group of mobs, FDing and having another player tag the remaining mobs.  This is extremely useful when you have wandering mobs that will reaggro on standing or when their bind points are far away.  Though any class can do this, it's best done with a second monk or SK as they can FD should they accidentally aggro too many mobs.  To minimize the chance of FD failure, have the second monk FD at the designated tagging spot.  Then, pull the mobs, FD, and when ready to tag, the second monk or SK simply stands up and tags the second mob, waits for a moment to check that they don't aggro extras, then pulls to group.  The monk is then free to check aggro through standing up and seeing if remaining mobs return, FDing again as needed to clear remaining aggro, then return to the fight.<br><br>You can tag with spells, however some spells have much larger aggro radius than others, so you are best to use low level stuns or nukes versus high level stuns or nukes for tagging a mob.<br><br>Pulling Casters<br><br>Casters have a terrible habit of standing in one spot and casting at you over and over instead of coming to the party.  This can be circumvented.  Once a mob casts a spell it is not line of sight, IE, if you turn a corner the spell will still hit you.  However, for most mobs the actually Begin casting a spell, you must generally be line of sight.  So running around a corner or around an alcove will bring the mob running directly to a spot that's LOS with you.<br><br>Reverse Pulling<br><br>In some areas there is not sufficent room to FD and seperate a mob easily.  One solution is instead of waiting for mobs to return to bind point, is to pull mobs PAST a group and have them tag a straggler.  Then FD and let the other mobs return to bind point.  This can be used also to tag the tail end of trains.  This only works if you can fight Outside of the aggro range of the returning mob path.<br><br>Mob Kissing or Hugging, aka as Baby Sitting<br><br>In many zones pathing is horrendous.  Aggro'd mobs will take LONG detours through the zone instead of the short distance between you and the party.  However, if you remain in melee range with the mob while backing away it will follow you step for step.  This will allow you to circumvent bad pathing.  Note, you will take a beating if you need to pull like this, so backing away from a mob is generally better than turning your back to them... at least you can dodge and riposte this way.<br><br>- Advanced Concepts -<br><br>Level Based Aggro<br><br>Aggro radius is not finite.  It decreases in relation to the difference in level between the mob and yourself.  This is why greens will often not aggro until you stand right on top of them.  It's also why a level 60 monk can pull a mob from in between 2 blues and aggro only one, while a level 52 monk will aggro all 3 every time.  This is why a level 60 of any class is sometimes a better puller than a level 52 monk.<br><br>Aggro Delay<br><br>When you first enter a mobs aggro range, there is a random delay before a mob aggros you.  This is supposed to represent the mob debating whether to eat you or not.  During this time you are still not aggro, which is why sometimes you can run through a mob with SoW without aggroing, but always aggro it whenever you run through it at normal speed.<br><br>Bind Point Aggro Delay<br><br>When a mob resets to it's bind point, IE wanders back and clears aggro, there is a momentary delay (less than 1 second) when it cannot aggro someone within it's aggro radius.  This will be used to advantage in some techniques.<br><br>Aggro Passing Delay<br><br>This is a variant of aggro delay.  When an aggro mob passes another non-aggro mob, it will pass the Hate list.  When a mob wishes to pass the hate list, the second mob also experiences an aggro delay of up to 1 or 2 seconds before it actually aggros.<br><br>Lazy Aggro<br><br>In Kunark and Velious, if you are beyond a certain distance from a mob, it will lose interest and no longer pursue you, though will still maintain you on the hate list with an increased aggro radius.<br><br>-- Advanced Pulling Techniques --<br><br>Sit Aggro Pulling<br><br>Some of you have probably noticed that when you sit or heavily wounded mobs will aggro you at far greater distances than when you're healthy or standing.  This is a variant of Level based aggro.  When you are critically injured or sitting, the game actually considers you to be Level 1 instead of your current level, thus your aggro range increases dramatically.  This can be used to your advantage.  You can be outside of normal aggro range, then sit and stand immediately upon aggro, reducing your aggro range to original size.  If you are lucky, you will aggro the nearest mob, but will be standing Outside the lazy of the other mobs.  The minimum it will do is give you more time to FD and exercise additional pulling techniques.<br><br>Out of Sight Tagging or Obstacle Tagging<br><br>We know that a mob cannot generally cast spells or aggro unless it can see you, otherwise mobs would aggro you from other side of walls.  A mob's aggro is LOS, so if it can't see you, it won't aggro.  Use this with chain tagging or on short bind point pulls.  Aggro a mob, duck some distance around a corner and FD.  Then have someone tag the mob, or if the distance to bind point is short, just tag the mob yourself.  If you do it right, you won't aggro the other mobs, even if they're only a short distance away.  Note that some zones are bugged, and mobs will aggro you through walls... know which ones this will work in.<br><br>Split Pathing and Obstacle Splitting<br><br>Any observant monk realizes that mobs have return paths that they follow when they return to bind point.  However, what many monks don't realize is that there are Multiple return paths depending on Where a mob is when it loses aggro.  If you can get one mob on one side of certain points in the zone and another on the other side, they will take different paths back to the bind point.  Then, just chain tag or tag as usual as they will be far away from eachother.  This can also be used with obstacles such as rocks, fountains, staircases which act to block a mobs LOS, thus allowing you to pull one out of sight of the other.<br><br>Persistent Aggro or Auto Pulling<br><br>We know that roamers often don't forget you.  This can be a good thing.  On raids or groups when you want 4 to 5 at a time, you can aggro a bunch of mobs, and then chain tag 4 or 5.  Then, FD and watch the wanderers leave.  After the group finishes those, stand up again and wait to see what other mobs have been aggrod and split off a bunch more.  Repeat as needed until either all aggro mobs are dead or your group/raid needs a rest.  This allows you to pull without going deep into the zone on every pull.<br><br>Caster Delay<br><br>When you pull mobs with casters, often one will hang back and being casting a spell.  Sometimes you Want this to happen.  Continue backing away from the caster, taking the melees along with you who will continue to beat on you.  When the spell hits, FD.  Then, you can either chain tag the caster (a variant of reverse pulling) or you can chain pull the melees that came with you safely who are now out of the aggro range of the caster.  You can also wait for the near mobs to seperate should you need to whittle numbers down more.  Great for breaking 2 and 3 spawns.<br><br>Yoyo Pulling<br><br>When you FD, some mobs will return sooner than others.  If you stand some or all will reaggro.  If you FD and then stand repeatedly, you may be able to seperate the mobs should some mem wipe, or they decide to return staggered.  Combine yoyo pulling with obstacle splits, split pathing or caster delay to further break them up.<br><br>Bind Point Splitting<br><br>At the exact moment that a mob returns to bind point and is resetting it's aggro, it is unavailable for recieving a hate list.  If you have a mob that is just getting to it's bind point and another still wandering back, you can stand up from FD at the exact right moment, and the wandering mob will reaggro but the one at bind point may not aggro.  If not successful immediately, you may use this to increase the distance between the two mobs enough to use lazy aggro and aggro radius to tag or chain tag one.<br><br>Warp Splitting.<br><br>When a mob has a tough time getting to you, it may warp right on top of you.  This will not happen all at the same time, one may get stuck a few seconds before the others.  If you FD at the exact moment it warps to you, you will have one mob near you, and the rest far away out of aggro range.  You can then chain tag the single or couple safely.<br><br>Reverse Warp Splitting.<br><br>When a mob gets stuck returning to it's bind point, it will warp back to bind point.  This may not happen at the same time.  If you time it right, you can tag the one or two mobs at the exact moment that the others have warped back to bind point without aggroing the others.<br><br>Level Splitting<br><br>Mobs often have different levels, thus different aggro ranges relative to you.  Pulling a low level mob next to a higher level mob may aggro both every time, but pulling the higher level mob may not aggro the lower level mob as it's aggro range is smaller.  It is helpful to know the level of the mobs in question and their relative ranges should you wish to pull this way.  Have higher mid and lower level players con the mob to get an accurate gauge.<br><br>Ping pong splitting<br><br>If you have two monks, you can split multiple mobs that will not seperate.  Each monk aggros a different mob, then pulls them out of aggro range of eachother.  Then, a third person tags while both monks FD.  The third person only aggros one as his hate list entry never gets passed.<br><br>Snare COH pulling<br><br>Should you have a mage with CoH (level 55 spell), you can have the monk pull a group and a ranger or druid act as snare.  The monk pulls the group, the snarer snares one then is CoHd back to group clearing aggro.  The mobs continues to pursue the monk and then FDs.  When the mobs return, the snared mob slowly seperates from the group and can now be tagged safely.  Can also be used with reverse pulling.  Should a CoH not be available, you can have the snarer zone out or run outside of lazy aggro range.<br><br>Root COH pulling<br><br>Same as above, but instead of snaring one mob, you root one.<br>This can also be used to seperate boss mobs from groups of regular mobs.<br><br>Center Pulling<br><br>When three mobs are in a line with eachother, they may be in aggro range with eachother, but the ones on each end may not be in aggro range of eachother.  If you can pull out the center mob successfully, you may be able to pull out the mobs on each end safely.<br><br>-------<br><br>All of this knowledge was accrued through practice, experience, study, and observation both of mobs and other monks.  It is the accumulation of 2 years as a puller.  You may know some of these, hopefully some or all of these will be new to you.<br><br>This is not the end.  Each technique is powerfull in itself.  But when you combine them, synthesize them and exercise them in concert with eachother, you will find that you will have a very extensive set of pulling tools at your disposal.<br><br>There may be other techniques that I use, but haven't really thought about them.  Should I remember them, I'll make a point of trying to share those as well.<br><br>Remember, pulling is all about one goal... to bring mobs without wiping out your group or raid.  The complete wipeout of a group or raid is the Greatest failure of any puller.  It is better to die than wipe out your group or raid.  Expect to die.  Expect to die alot while learning.  But with time, practice and experience, miracles are possible.<br><br>Do the impossible.<br><br>LaotzuQigong<br>57 Master<br>Legendary<br>The Tribunal <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umemak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>memak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/12/01 6:56:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Laotzu's Guide to Advanced Pulling</span><hr size=1> Excellent pulling guide!  You covered pretty much all my techniques and gave me a few new ideas.<br><br>On "root" pulling, you don't necessarily need a COH mage.  There are items in game with root like effects that the monk can use.  They do seem to get resisted alot though.<br><br>On COH (call of hero -- L55 mage spell):  I don't think the guild clearly stated that COH clears agro.  I LOVE having a COH mage in my group while I'm pulling.<br><br>Also on tag pulling in dangerous places:  Make sure you know your agro at all times.  In Hate, for example, I often won't return to the group without /q, COH, or standing a long time first.  I also tell people to buff/heal me only on request.<br><br><i><b>Question -- </b>If someone does buff/heal me while I'm FD, does agro transfer even if the mob is out of the buffer/healer agro range?

Well, from my observations if you are the only one on the hate list and you have successfully LDd, it's safe for the healer to heal you IE they won't recieve a hate list entry.  If the FD has failed, any healing will be interpreted as assisting the enemy and will immediately pass aggro.<br><br>You can generally identify this by whether the mob stops beating on you or not.<br><br>The problem of course is there's a couple possible twists to the situation...<br><br>First, if you are in group or raid combat, you don't always know that your FD has been truly successful.  It is possible for someone to take aggro from you at the exact moment you pass an FD skill check.  The mob could still have seen through FD, but another tank at that moment might have passed you on the hate list, thus giving the illusion that you succussfully FDd.  The healer would then be in jeopardy of attracting unwanted attention.  However, this is usually a pretty questionable situation, so often I will let the other tanks build up their hate list a little before I ask for the heal...<br><br>Second problem is when lazy aggro comes into play... you can fail an FD, and be healed but the mob not aggro the healer.  How is this possible?  Well if the cleric is right at the edge of the mobs lazy aggro range, then the mob would consider the healer not worth pursuing... possible with very long range healing spells such as divine light and the mob is repathing all over the place.  Now, if the healer reenters the lazy aggro range, then suddenly the mob *sees* the healer and suddenly goes after him, even though the cleric hasn't done a thing for quite a length of time.  This is because he must have done enough healing to put him at the top of the hate list, but has just reentered the lazy aggro radius.<br><br>LaotzuQigong<br>57 Master<br>Legendary<br>The Tribunal<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukroakthetad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kroak the Tad</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/13/01 1:24:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.xmission.com/~buttons/images/kroaktad.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Laotzu's Guide to Advanced Pulling</span><hr size=1> As far as passing agro while FD, this is how I have known it to work and it has not yet failed:<br><br>So long as the person casting on you STARTS casting the spell AFTER you are FD and you remain FD until the spell finishes then the caster will not be placed on the hate list of any mobs the monk is hated by.

Then when I am healed I will pop back up and kill.

I think it is very important for other people to realize that pulling is indeed an art, especially the younger monks out there. With Verant doing their best to nullify the usability of basic FD pulling, it is very important now to have a solid grasp of the art as a whole. While our terminologies might differ, the ideas I've developed are pretty much the same. With a bit of modification and clarification, I think your guide could become the definitive work on the subject.<br><br>There are a few things I would like to bring up.<br><br>&quot;When an aggro mob passes another non-aggro mob, it will pass the Hate list.&quot;<br><br>This is not always the case. Some mobs pass the hate list and some do not. I've always called this being social, but I don't know if that's the commonly used term. Furthermore, depending on the mob and the zone, social mobs will pass off hate at variable times and/or variable ranges. It has seemed to me that these variables are based on the player level on the mob's aggro list as well as the nature of the mob itself. I do not know if this is the case for sure, but would be very interested in hearing from other monks about it.<br><br>Another important point is that some of the rules you mentioned override each other at times and some coexist. Using a ranged weapon to pull is great if you wish to avoid entering various mobs' aggro radius on you. In some situations, initiating aggro with this sort of attack is the easist way to solo pull.<br><br>Personally, I've always been about solo pulling. I realize that this is not always the most effective way to hold a camp or to conduct a raid. That is why I've never enjoyed pulling for raids as much as pulling for small groups. Most of my techniques are useless when it comes to Velious. The only way I've found to single pull those lower level kobalds in Velk's is by using the caster delay that you mentioned. And for those trio of giants in the arena (they were all PoZ's whenever I saw them), what you call obstacle splitting was the only thing I could come up with to solo pull them.<br><br>With the introduction of Velious, it is as important as ever to be aware of ALL of the tools at your disposal. I admit to being largely ignorant of other classes' pulling abilities. I am the puller, so I pull without help whenever I can. But in Velious, this is tough.

Mobs have two different aggro ranges, one for general aggro (IE, you walk too close for a period of time) and second a combat aggro range (IE, You're in a fight with a mob) that I refer to as a &quot;call for help&quot; radius.  For example, Treah in Growth has a zone wide call for help radius with certain mobs (a really annoying feature if I may say).<br><br>Also, at the outer ranges of the aggro radius, aggro delay is not a set time, as opposed to a percentage probability over time.  So you will find at the furthest reach of an aggro range, mobs will have highly variable aggro times.  You can prove this by slowly inching up on a mob, stopping, and waiting for 5 or 10 seconds.  If you continue to inch and stop, inch and stop, you will find the maximum range of aggro.  So one technique that I use sometimes is to figure out the very maximum aggro range, stop, and wait until the mob aggros.<br><br>The non-passing of the hate list would be more akin to an aggro percentage delay on other mobs... IE, they're at the maximum of aggro range, and so there's only a certain percentage probability of the second mob aggroing.<br><br>As for the trio of Giants at arena (the two Protectors of Zek plus the named, forget his name) I actually use a combination of techniques... juggling, caster delay (there's usually one that loves to buff the others on the way back), juggling, obstacle splitting, AND bind point delay.

The &quot;random&quot; timing of the aggro you mentioned in several of your techniques is not really random...it represents the server round-robining its way through the zone's mobs updating their hate lists one by one as fast as it can.  If you get lucky, you might catch a group of mobs at the right time and not aggro them when you otherwise would (this is why you can sometimes just run straight through a couple of mobs that are looking right you without getting aggroed).<br><br>I know what you're thinking:<br>Since this is server timing and the monk has no way of knowing which mobs are updating when, we might as well call it random, right?<br><br>Almost, but not quite.  The number of people in zone, the number of mobs in zone, the server's lag in general to some degree all affect the round robin delay...so, in general, it's easier to attempt to use the round robin factor in your pulls when the load on the server/zone is high.

Wait until you see &quot;a_mob begins to cast a spell...&quot; and then aggro one of the melee mobs.  If timed right, the one casting the spell will not aggro.  Guess he was too busy buffing ;)  Depending on which mob was casting, this can really help to break up a camp.<br><br><br>Example of buff pulling the King room in Lower Guk:<br><br>What I did was to wait until the Tactitian started casting.  Then I pulled a kinght on the floor.  The 3 frogs on the floor all came after me but the three in the upper tunnel did not aggro.

In a group of 2 mobs, if you aggro one by say throwing a knife at him, when they start to walk back, the one you originally attacked leaves FIRST, leaving the one that had aggro passed to him standing there for a second or two before he leaves.  We've all see this happen but I think many monks don't realize that it's predictable which one will hang around longer.

This is your bread and butter for Monks between 30 and 60 in group situations. It's related to the Bind Point Splitting in the guide, but different enough to be its own tactic.<br><br>This tactic is a variant of YoYo pulling... it's almost like Reverse YoYo. This tactic is used to split high level MoBs, especially yellows and reds. It works in the old world and Kunark best. It can be used in Velious but only if you've gotten so good at it that it's almost an instinct. Let me explain how the MoBs work to lay this out very simply.<br><br>With any Kunark and Norrathian MoB, there is a delay between the moment you feign death and the moment they walk back to their home point. This is a random delay. Some Velious MoBs exhibit this delay as well but it is far less common, especially in higher level MoBs.<br><br>This delay is the key to the YoYo tactics. With standard YoYo pulling, you pull all MoBs in the camp and feign. Usually, one of them leaves after the others, they rarely all go back at the same time. YoYo pulling is simply popping back up and kicking that last MoB upside the head after his friends have moved back out of aggro range. The Reverse YoYo tactic works backwards, you end up getting the first MoB that returns and not the last.<br><br>The biggest problem with YoYo pulling is that with higher level MoBs after Lvl 32, you don't get memwipes all the time. You pop up and find that the other MoBs who went home are coming at you full speed. This is bad for YoYo, but essential for Reverse YoYo. If you get a successful memwipe, Reverse YoYo will not work.<br><br>Our example is an Orc camp in the Crystal Caverns. We have three Mobs in the camp. All con high blue to red to the pulling Monk. His group is set up at some distance to give him room to work the spawn.<br><br>Our Monk pulls all three Orcs out away from the camp and feigns. After a few moments, one of the Orcs returns to the camp, while the other two stay. The first Orc reaches his home point, turns around, and stops moving. Now that he is home again, you MUST feign death one more time while lying there. I have never seen this second feign fail to completely memwipe that first MoB at his home point.<br><br>Soon after, the other two Orcs start returning home. As soon as they are within aggro range of the first Orc, but BEFORE they themselves reach their home point, our Monk stands up.<br><br>The late returning Orcs are still aggro on the Monk, so they instantly whirl around and come running back. In the process, they re-aggro the first Orc who was sitting happily memwiped at his home point. Our Monk waits for all three Orcs to return to him, and feigns again.<br><br>As soon as he hits the ground, the late arriving Orcs return to their home points. The first Orc however now stays put. He has been newly aggroed, so now he waits out the initial delay. The returning Orcs never lost aggro to begin with, so they start walking back immediately.<br><br>Once they return to their home points, our Monk feigns death once more. They are memwiped (bout a 90% probability). Our Monk pops up, kicks the remaining Orc in the teeth, and brings him back to the group.<br><br>This tactic works miracles, as it tends to work best in places where the more conventional tactics fail. It will take you a lot of practice to get this right.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Things to remember.</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br><br>You cannot use this tactic on MoBs that are 32nd level and lower, since FD will ALWAYS memwipe them, and you won't be able to get the return aggro necessary for this to work. The good news is that in that situation, normal YoYo pulling works better anyway.<br><br>If you cannot see the MoBs you are splitting, this is a very tough technique to use. You'll have to master the timing if you cannot see them.<br><br>This technique does not work on wandering MoBs, since they have no home point.<br><br>You must score a memwipe on that first MoB, or you won't get the delay once he comes back to you.<br><br>You must FAIL to memwipe the other MoBs that are returning to camp. They have to reaggro on you when you stand. This can be a bit tough since you will have to feign at least twice without getting a memwipe on them. Against high level MoBs, you'll find they tend to remember you no matter what you do, so this is where it works best.<br><br>If you are high enough level that the MoBs will not pass the hate list, this tactic will not work. Of course, who cares, since you can just go up and hit the one you want and pull him without fear of the others coming as well.<br><br>Having another puller to tag-pull off of you is invaluable. Using the YoYo tactics you can always split the MoBs farther apart, but in some circumstances you may have trouble wiping enough aggro to stop the others from coming after you. If you have a tag puller all you must do is separate them apart a good distance (easily done) and let him tag them off of you.<br><br>If you combine this with YoYo pulling, there is no reason that you can't split the camp with a single pull. If you get a memwpie, use normal YoYo and get the last one. If you don't get a memwipe, use Reverse YoYo to get the first one. Either way you win.<br><br>This tactic wouldn't have been possible without the Feign Death &quot;nerf&quot; we all hated so much.
