A long arse time ago, I was able to solo her with a 59 necro with only the help of a shaman to sow me and the pet. The rogue got hurt early so he basically stayed out of it so he didnt die. <br><br><br><br>Jump to present day. I did it yesterday, and we started out with 60 war, 55 clr, 58 brd, 58 dru, 53 shm, and 50 rog. I thought with a full grp, we would waste her. Well, I was wrong! I think everyone in the grp died at least once. If the cleric didnt bind there, we would have lost and I would be stuck starting over. The bard ended up having to kite her around while a few more people were called in. After a 30 minute fight, we killed her. <br><br><br>She seems to have gotten increased regen, and now she doesnt ignore pets anymore. I tried to make a shaman pet as a last resort but the doggy got raped. Definately a surprise to me. This is probably old news, but I didnt know about this. <br><br>My advice, bring a high lvl chanter for tash, and a 60 druid to try to snare her. Also, bring as many melees as possible for damage. The more the merrier, it would suck to have to start over and have to repick the GMs, and recamp Eldreth! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubayler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bayler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 8:15:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3877.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: she buffed</span><hr size=1> Borbas -<br><br>The group you've got is more than enough to take her down, *provided* that your druid can land a successful snare early.  Without an enchanter for Tash, that might be very difficult.  And, of course, once she's running at the druid unsnared, it will be very difficult to get off another one.  (My group had a 52 enchanter Tashing, and the 56 druid was resisted about 6 times.)<br><br>What I would recommend is have your shaman keep trying Malo and your druid keep trying snare until they both stick.  Have a kite-path set up before hand, and have both of them run in this same predictable path so that whichever one doesn't have agro can time his spell easily.  Make sure none of your melees try to be a hero and peel her off - anyone who has agro should be running away from Renux down the kite path.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utait.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tait</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 10:54:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3877.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: she buffed</span><hr size=1> Did it solo (60 Necromancer) about 2 weeks ago.

Someone almost always ends up dying from over aggro when you tank her.<br><br>Schortt<br>Spirit of Tunare<br>The Rathe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubayler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bayler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/02 11:06:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3877.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Battle plan:</span><hr size=1> Here's the writeup I did for my guild.<br>------------------------------------<br><br><br>BACKGROUND<br><br>I’ve been doing a favor for an exiled rogue named Stanos – I’ve been helping him recover and translate a document.  The trouble is, he has powerful enemies in the Circle of Unseen Hands, and one of them has been following me.  Her name is Renux Herkanor; she’s not horribly sneaky, but she is a magnificent thug.  I don’t dare face her alone, but I have reason to believe that she’s going to make her move soon, in the Steamfont mountains.  I’d like your help.<br><br><br>OVERVIEW<br><br>After I talk to Yendar Starpyre, Renux will show up.  Once she does, we’ll fight her by rage-kiting her.  That is, she’ll be snared and angered a great deal by one person who’ll dance around out of range, while a bunch of melees chase after her and attack from behind.  After we kill her, I’ll take a few things from her corpse that I’ll need for Stanos.  But she will also have some nice gear that I’ll be able to distribute to the folks who helped.<br><br><br>ADVERSARY<br>Renux is a level 50 rogue – a trainer in the Circle of Unseen Hands.  She quad-hits for about 200 damage, and has a sword that procs a 20 second poison-based stun.  Conventional wisdom says she has 32,000 hit points.  She is highly magic resistant, and immune to fear.  Fortunately, she doesn’t cast any spells, or summon.<br><br><br>ROLES<br><br>Main Kiter [50+ druid]: Snares Renux, and then kites her around in a consistent path, being sure to keep Renux’s attention on themselves.  (Repeated snares are reported to have the best effect.  This might be a long fight, so mana conservation is an issue.)  The Main Kiter is the person responsible for choosing the kiting path before the fight, and communicating about it to the ambush party.<br><br>Backup Kiter [50+ druid/ranger]: Kites Renux if the Main Kiter dies.  The Backup Kiter will also be provide SoWs or Wolfforms to the ambush party.<br><br>Tasher [50+ enchanter]: Casts Tash on Renux (and kites her for however long it takes the Main Kiter to gain agro afterward), so that the Main Kiter’s snare will land more successfully.  The Tasher will also provide clarity, speed buffs, and runes to the ambush party.  Finally, if any guards or other unexpected threats show up, the Tasher will make them go away.<br><br>Rezzer [49+ cleric]: Resurrects any members of the ambush party who die, if any.  Buffs the party.  Provides low-agro healing during the fight, when it’s safe to do so.<br><br>Quester [50+ rogue]: Spawns Renux, and helps damage her.<br><br>Melee Chorus [46+ melees]: Damage Renux, once the Main Kiter has angered her enough that Renux will ignore the Melee Chorus.<br><br>Other participants will be assigned duties as the ambush party is assembling.<br><br><br>BATTLE PLAN<br><br>Preparation: <br>Once everyone has arrived and groups have been formed, trackers will try to find Yendar.  If he’s not around, the Quester will ask for him in town, which should cause him to reveal himself.  At that point, the Main Kiter will choose the kiting path, and show it to the rest of the ambush party.<br><br>Spawn/Pull:<br>Once Renux shows herself, the Tasher will cast Tash on her, and then run to the kiting path, staying out of Renux’s melee range.<br><br>Kiting:<br>Once Renux has been successfully Tashed, the Main Kiter will try casting snare on her until it succeeds, and then will cast whatever spells they deem appropriate to maximize Renux’s rage toward them.  Once the Main Kiter has Renux’s attention, they will move around in a predetermined path, chosen for straight lines, gentle curves, and even terrain.  They will continue to cast spells to keep Renux mad.  (Note that many debuf spells have a higher taunt value DoTs or DDs.  Snare is one of the highest.)<br><br>When the Quester gives the order, the Melee Chorus will start attacking.  Any abilities that lower a melee’s position on the hate list should be used frequently.  Any spells or abilities that have unusually high taunts should be avoided.  Also, any effect that interrupts the victim’s movement – like stuns or roots – should not be used.  Melee Chorus members are encouraged take a break from combat any time they think they’re getting too high on Renux’s hate list.<br><br>If anyone, at any point, gets agro (other than the Main Kiter), they should immediately run away from Renux and follow the kite path.  When this happens, everyone should stop attacking except for the Main Kiter, who should try to regain Renux’s focus.  Under no circumstances should anyone stand toe to toe with Renux.<br><br>Once Renux is down to half of her life, any extra casters are encouraged to nuke her.  They should try to avoid being at the top of the hate list.  If they do get agro, they should run along the kite path.<br><br><br>LOOT<br><br>Translated Parchment – The Quester keeps this.<br><br>Jagged Diamond Dagger (piercing 9/22, 9dex; ROG) – The Quester keeps this.  <br><br>Trochilic's Skean (1hs 10/25, 5svP, effect: clockwork poison [long stun]; nodrop, offhand only, WAR RNG BAR ROG) – Participating warriors, rangers, and bards may make a need roll.  If none of them want it, participating rogues may make a need roll.  If none of them want it either, the Quester gets it.<br><br>Nonvisible Ravenscale (various locations; ROG) – Renux will drop two pieces of non-visible Ravenscale armor.  Participating rogues may make a need roll for each piece (with the winner of the first roll being ineligible for the second).  If none of the rogues want them, the Quester may claim claim need on left over pieces.  If the Quester doesn’t need them, all participants may make a greed roll.<br><br>Ravenscale Belt  +9 AC +5 Sta +15 HP +2.40 Wt<br>Ravenscale Cloak  +12 AC +5 Agi +5 vsCold +3.00 Wt <br>Ravenscale Mask  +8 AC +5 Cha +10 vsPos +0.80 Wt     See Invisible <br>Ravenscale Neckguard  +8 AC +5 Dex +10 vsDis +2.40 Wt <br>Ravenscale Shoulderpads  +10 AC +5 Str +5 vsMg +2.50 Wt<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubayler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bayler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/24/02 2:06:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3877.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Battle plan:</span><hr size=1> Forgot about one thing: here are the places that I identified as likely kiting paths.
