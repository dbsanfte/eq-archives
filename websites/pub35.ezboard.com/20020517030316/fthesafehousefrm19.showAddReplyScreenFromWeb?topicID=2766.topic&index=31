My tentative thoughts (noting that I'm not the expert people with L50s are) are that yes, the evenom exploit (put on tons of env gear, put high poison on wpn, then take off gear and put on better combat gear) needs fixing.  In fact, I actually (ducks) question why envenom alone of all skills is given extra &quot;spells&quot; for +spec items and RP?  It's interesting to note that just like the envenom skill, many other skills also get no other bonus for +spec items - take paladin chants, for instance.  IMHO, either ALL spec lines of this nature need to get their new spells/effects like envenom does, or none do.  <br>
<br>
Not sure which it should be - with people already speccing based on env items giving new poisons, I'd suggest just give the other classes the same benefit, maybe.<br>
<br>
Nerfing stealth in any way would pretty much shut down both the minstrel and infiltrator - both of which (assuming stealth minstrel template) rely on stealth to get them &quot;up close and personal&quot; with their opponent.  You basically can't reduce stealth's effectiveness without really hurting those classes.<br>
<br>
Damage caps in general have to be set up so that the one-shot kill POSSIBILITY is removed.  I know that CS hits don't crit often (and it's mostly the 800 pt infil hits and 1000+ SB hits that get the bad PR and the blood boiling).  You know it.  But the player who gets hit ONE TIME by a hit like that does not.  He figures it will happen &quot;every time&quot;.  And he tells his friends, who tell their friends, etc.<br>
<br>
Fact is that one-shot kills (or kills that occur so fast that there is no time or chance to react in any way) between even cons are bad for the game.  They discourage people from trying to play, and reduce the level of skill by increasing the luck factor.<br>
<br>
Personally, my thought is that CS crits are so darn uncommon anyway that it really hurts the class exactly ZERO to remove 'em.  Leave standard CS damage alone.  But remove the wild, crazy, radical damage spikes.  From caster bolts too - they are just as bad.  One thousand point bolts should NEVER be happening.  My opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The only other solution is to base caster defense abilities off the high spikes of damage - which is what will likely happen otherwise.  Casters will be designed to survive 800pt CS +400pt poison strikes...  So unbuffed they'd need around 900-1000hp, or about 300 more than they get now, or maybe a bigger absorb buff.  That's a _bad_ solution though, really - because it bases the whole on the extreme hits, and thus reduces assassin effectiveness on the standard, everyday hits.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - casters are SUPPOSED to die to assassins, almost every fight.  And they do.  Usually so fast they don't have time to blink. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The loss vs assassins should stay - the &quot;can't blink&quot; should not.<br>
<br>
Which reminds me - yes, an assassin should die vs a tank, about as often as a caster dies to an assassin.  3D's best win % vs a L50 warrior should have been maybe 5-10%.  Not 75%.  Tanks are the &quot;predator&quot; class for assassins - and are supposed to kill them with GREAT consistancy, if they find them.  And yes, he used specialized tactics - but now that Khel has so kindly published them, so can everyone else.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   No, collision is not a solution, because it's an equine lich.  Unfortunately.<br>
<br>
And 42 env with items really IS low for an infiltrator now, Khel - or should be.  A better term for 3D's template would have been &quot;suboptimal&quot;, not &quot;substandard&quot; - since it was nowhere near an optimal template for the style of fighting he was doing.  Would have been much easier in those fights if he had gone to 50 env buffed.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you do the math - and assume that you are trying for a template that can &quot;kite-kill&quot; effectively - then the poison skill is actually even more important than the CS skill - and is VERY, VERY much more important than thrust.  51 buffed thrust and only 42 buffed envenom?  =P  Fifty buffed envenom is now optimal in general, btw - with the new poison buff, and the new Env items, that is NOT hard to get and VERY worth it.  IMHO.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
***  All of the above is the personal opinion of me as a player.  I have played every class in Albion to a decent level (mid+) during the course of the last 15 months of playing DAOC, so I have a decent basis on which to compare the way they play.  However - none of this should be construed as anything but the ramblings of someone bored at work.  They are ideas, and not official in any way.  I don't have a hidden agenda to demolish the Infiltrator - rather the contrary, because I enjoy playing the class.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
***  I am not &quot;sticking up&quot; for 3D's ideas, or posting against them.  I am suggesting that crucifying the guy for doing his best is probably pretty stupid.  And that flamefests directed at people who are asking for opinions and comments are pretty dumb too.  If a TL comes to the public boards (which they are never, ever required to do) to put out ideas and seek feedback, burning them at the stake is a surefire way to ensure that next time, they just make their suggestions to Mythic without asking for the comments.<br>

Then you run off while they are trying to turn around, and you stealth.  It's possible to use said technique to kite targets that are MUCH tougher than you'd ordinarily be able to kill.<br>
<br>
Thinking about this, none of 3D's suggestions actually fix the real problem, though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I certainly see where Khel is coming from in wishing for collisions.  That - or some other coding solution (better/faster /stick command, or ability to hit/cast on people who are &quot;inside&quot; you, maybe) - is going to be essential in fixing this, I think.  And collisions would be &quot;nice&quot; just in general.<br>

Not only do I play an infiltrator, I also play a sorcerer, so I know it from both ends.  However, one thing I have recently learned (after biting through a lot of things after getting Shadowblasted) is that if I have a tank with guard, protect, and most importantly, intercept on me, and actually right next to me guarding me in a fight....no assassin can touch me.  The assassin goes for PA, the tank intercepts it, now the tank is very irritable, and squishes the sneaky kobold who is now right there for the world to see and uses him for a chew toy.  I will always ask a tank with me rvr'ing to put me on intercept and guard and stay close, from now on.  I saw it work, and I'm a believer.<br>
<br>
Now, from an infiltrator point of view, I'll reiterate all those endlessly tiresome but now infamous cliches, about how we live and work towards that ONE shot at massive damage, and hope that it is enough so that any incidental damage afterward (poison, bleeding, whatever) is enough to kill the target.  How many times have we all absolutely drilled a target (caster or other rogue), saw our poisons take, only to go up in flames when we die only to see the target healed at the last second.  We all know that happens far more than the infamous 1-shots.  What happens even more is taking someone down below 25% only to die and see them just sit down and heal by secondary intention while looking at our dead bodies.<br>
<br>
Our 1-shot kills and massive damage are infamous for the ONE reason that casters hate it because if they do not have a tank protecting them and intercepting for them, they have no idea when it's going to happen.  Casters like to see things at a distance and blast it, mez it, spindle-fold-mutilate it without ruffling their robes (I know I do), and they don't like it when someone maneuvers past their complacency and drills them for not taking precautions...and all that magical power that they use on everyone else is seeping into the ground with the casters anemic blood.  Casters have a 90%+/- solution in protecting themselves, they just have to do it.  The only people that we as assassins can hit so hard are casters and other rogues...and you don't hear too many rogues complaining in comparison (and Bile 1-shots me about 1:3 times he finds me due to the level difference and him being an SB).  <br>
<br>
Stealth at high levels should be damned hard to penetrate.  I don't want increased Detect Hidden range...I want it smaller, if anything for those assassins looking for me, if my stealth is better.  I think the way envenom is done needs to be fixed or changed, but giving a 'free lunch' for higher poison use because of items is not a good way to go in the first place.  There is no way in hell anyone should be able to put on items just to apply higher poisons, then remove the items and still proc the poisons. (we had a nice little argument over this previously...this doesn't work on Pendragon, and doesn't on 'some' servers, but has been proven to work on a couple of others...so it's a bug and isn't even the same on all servers.  On Pendragon, you must wear the item to both apply the poison to the weapon and to be able to proc it in combat).  <br>
<br>
Finally, I don't think the chance of a critical hit is unbalancing, even on PA.  Does it suck? Yep, if you're on the receiving end of it.  But we never complain unless we're on the receiving end.  Casters (and even light in the butt rogues) all have a means to protect themselves, they just have to make use of the tools.  <br>
<br>
Reducing CS damage in any way means fubaring the whole assassin concept in the game...because if we cannot kill in just a few seconds up to an even con caster or other rogue, then we're surely dead due to &quot;excess iron in the diet&quot; from all the irritated tanks, or a bad case of heartburn thanks of the friendly neighborhood caster if we are seen for more than 3-4 seconds tops.  IF our CS damage is reduced in any manner, then MUCH must be done to make up for how easily we die, because we die just about as easily in melee as a caster (and at high level with the new absorption spells, they have our equal in armor, 10%).  That means an entire revamping of all 3 assassin classes, and personally, I don't want to go back to October when we couldn't even kill low blues, and start over.  <br>
<br>
There has to be a better way.  For whatever reason, 3dknight is jumping the gun without exploring any options and going for the nerf now, and THAT is what has me irritated at him, along with him pushing so hard for this that he made the mistake of presuming himself to know more about assassins in general than everyone else, and not even asking for input prior to now. (Along with this, a disagreement with Pendragon infiltrators pretty much as a group, wherein we were told how we had been consulted and asked our opinions, and when we talked to each other, we found out that in fact, we weren't.  hmmm, that tends to tick people off. i.e. having it said &quot;I talk to Pendragon infiltrators all the time&quot; and then when we all talk to each other, every last one of us of an age that can rvr, and find out that isn't true, well, it makes us a wee bit upset at our class team leader).<br>
<br>
So many times classes have had huge, nasty changes made because of jumping the gun, so let's not jump it, and work on real solutions IF there is a real problem.  Just because a caster is too stupid to ask his tanks to put intercept on doesn't mean his stupidity should get assassins nerfed.  Do I think 3dknight is a complete idiot? No, I don't.  I haven't disagreed with him very often, and I know he's worked hard and was instrumental in getting infiltrators where they are now, a fun but fragile class that is a challenge to play, and an art to play well.  However, in his haste to avoid Mythic's normal approach of waving the nerf missile ('bat' my ass, it's a missile.  Come on, they don't take nor have the time to be gradual about anything...no game company does...they fix things, then they overfix, then they try to go back again).  Let's not break what I don't believe is broken.  Teach the casters that they have tools to protect themselves, and after they use them a couple of times and they work, then maybe the keening, tearing of robes and gnashing of teeth might just end without me having to uninstall this game.  Fix the envenom problem (make people 'have' to put in the points to use the best poisons), fix the fluctuations in stealth (far too easy for a caster to catch you coming in unless you come in fast), and show the casters the 'light' of intercept.  If there is STILL a problem after all this, then start digging for solutions, not just nerfing something arbitrary.<br>
<br>
I play an infiltrator as my main character, full time on Pendragon, with my secondary being a sorcerer. I am the former Midgard Realm TL, having played every class in both Midgard and Albion to at least mid-level other than primary healing classes, minstrel, and spiritmaster. I'm working on a shadowblade now, but he's still young.  Do I think I know everything about infiltrators, hell no, but I've learned from a great group of people....on Pendragon, on Safehouse, and yes, on 3d's Tarnished Dagger (the Army helped a little bit too).  Right now I'm really ticked because I see the best 3 classes in the game for playability (my opinion only) about to take it in the shorts, when it may not be necessary.  THAT'S why I'm on 3dknight so hard in these posts and elsewhere.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukheldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kheldor</A> at: 4/15/02 7:48:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/15/02 9:10:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2766.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reply</span><hr size=1> I don't know who's doing this stuff, but man, they are impressive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I barely have time to re-apply poisons in fights (though I only use the barebones minimum.  It would take some serious downtime to apply and then put all sorts of other crap on instead of +env items. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for Elvoril vs Origen, Yeah, It works.  Without the exploit it works too... PA/CD run, stealth.  PA/CD run, stealth.  Disease to keep them low on health.   Lets look at the really real world though.  It doesn't happen.  Where on earth (besides pendragon) are you going to have the time to pull this off???  You're unstealthed and dead.  You'd need time and a whole lot of open space.  Just won't occur.  So who cares?<br>
<br>
<br>
As for one shot kills... it's avoidable.  It just takes some thinking by casters.  10% damage absorb helps, now go find some slash/thrust resist gear and you'll never be one shotted ever again.  There is a level 50 sorc on pendragon, recently my PA's were doing FAR less damage on her then usual, I went through all the variables and finally realized the reason my damage went down is she got epic armor and her slash resist was much higher.  Lowered my damage output by alot.  The higher I level, the more difficult it is for me to one shot anyone.  I'm a shadowblade, max spec in CS.  It's easier for me to one shot a infiltrator/nightshade or friar by FAR then it is to one shot a caster, unless your sitting, in which case, DUH!   <br>
<br>
I can be two shotted by casters from ungodly range... when it happened, I went out and got myself some heat/cold/energy resist items to stop it!  Same deal for casters, get a clue and resist what you most fear... it's alot easier then resisting spells, there's only 2 things assassins use, slash and thrust/pierce.<br>
<br>
All in all though, I don't get it.  Assassins have been considered a weak class forever, finally things change to bring it into balance (we still blow BIG time PVE, but make up for our downfall by RVR), and we are ASKING for something that lowers us???? I don't understand one bit!<br>
<br>
I said it before, I'll say it again.  If mythic chooses to nerf us, so be it.  But, our teamleads speak for us, you are our representitives to Mythic, speak our words, not your own.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ask for improvements! <br>

If you're fortunate enough to get a 1 on 1 in the frontier and not be interupted for the duration of the fight then expect to win if the opponent sticks around on their own - that pretty much sums up an assassin i thought.<br>
<br>
In reality though ,  so many things can occur in a fight that nothing is definite , and 1 on 1s in the frontier are few and far between - but thats what an assassin is built for , 1 on 1s.<br>
<br>
That test with the lev 50 tank was totally pointless anyway , how viable and how often would that happen in RVR? It proved nothing.<br>

On a side note , i'm all for the envenom change that 3D proposed but not the stealth.<br>

<br>
Let me counterpoint a bit:<br>
1) Casters in general don't ask for guard, protect, intercept in RvR.  In PvE, cleric types get most of this attention, and casters are not used to thinking to ask for it (I know - they need to LEARN!).  Also, in RvR using intercept means sticking REALLY close to a tank - and the tanks are usually trying to rush headlong into the fray.  Ironically, some of my best fights (as a caster) have been when I sat RIGHT on a tank's coattails, waited till he engaged a target, and then proceeded to nuke the **** out of it.  Plus, for some odd reason the best theurgist template more closely resembles a thane in fighting style than a caster anyway (go figure that one out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  So - casters need to get the word out.  The effectiveness of these tactics is, simply put, virtually unknown.<br>
<br>
2) Our top guild infil - on Galahad - regularly takes out SOLO yellow con anythings.  That's right - anything.  Now, he's in top-flight gear, and I've seen him in action, his play is simply superb (he's a lot better at the sneaky stuff than me!).  But he has absolutely no trouble at all with light (read: low hit point) tanks, and only moderate trouble with heavy tanks.  He says healer-types are a PITA, but doable in emergancies.  He's got a better than 50% win ratio vs every class.<br>
<br>
Now - the question is, are assassins SUPPOSED to win vs anyone and everyone?  In an ideal game, my thought would be that any class could beat any other class if the player was more skilled.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Mythic's view on this though is that tanks should trump rogues - so there shoud not be a positive win % vs tanks for rogue classes.  Right now, there is.  Our guild's tanks fear archers and assassins more than they fear other tanks.  I think only Hib casters rank up there (stupid stuns! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  Part of that, though, is the surprise factor.  Stealthers can always hit when you LEAST want them to, which gets annoying.  It's part of the fun of being sneaky. =)<br>
<br>
Selvarr, good questions:<br>
Was it a &quot;cheesy tactic&quot;?  Maybe - but expect to see more of it now that it's out.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Works great - superb even - on any solo target.  Warrior had a hard time shrugging off 550pts (avg 265pt infil PA + 300pts poison) of damage!  And a snare poison.  By the time the snare was wearing off, the infil can be circling for another hit.  It's sort of like a dance - if the infil can make 2-3 passes before help comes, he wins.  If help comes before the kill, the warrior lives and the infil vanishes.<br>
<br>
Problem with walking around in autoattack mode (and yah, Warrior was trying his darndest to win I gather - best chance he had was if he could stun) is that the PA was executed in such a way that by the time Warrior-computer reads the attack, the infil was already INSIDE the warrior - and thus unhittable (this works GREAT on casters too, btw).  Infil continues moving out the back side, and while warrior is trying to whirl he's sprinting away to engage stealth.  How long do 3 back-to-back DoT poisons take?  That is how long the tank has to get help before he dies.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, our guild's infil doesn't even do this.  He picks a light tank.  Lines up PA.  PAs for 300ish, or a bit more under some circumstances.  Poisons for 400.  That's 700 damage right there...  Light tanks only have a couple hundred more than that (about 900-1000 base, plus another 200ish for item buffs).  Engage a 2nd DoT partway through the fight, and you have a really dead light tank.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think they should keep it in perspective that they aren't playing on a live server&quot; - actually, most of us do.  I play Galahad, and Bors if I'm in a &quot;hibbie&quot; mood.  Most of the other TLs also play a live server as their prime - or used to, not sure now with all the new TLs we have.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We head to Pendragon to test under somewhat more controlled conditions, is all.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, I agree with Khel here on _almost_ everything.  I agree on envenom - the bug w/ use of poisons without wearing the gear needs to get fixed.  Envenom being the ONLY skill that grants new effects for gear and RP needs to be looked at; other classes could use this too, Paladin being notable for it, and it just doesn't seem _right_ that one class gets this bene but none others do, does it?  Heck, if you think about it a minute - envenom is very akin to a caster's spell line - yet no caster gets new spells for +spec items.  Perhaps they should?  I'd always rather see boosts than nerfs, where it's possible.<br>
<br>
I disagree on the CS _critical hit_.  I DO agree that base CS needs to be left the heck alone!  An infil has a hard enough time without reducing that even one hp.  But - crit hits on CS seem to be generating 90% of the complaints, and give assassins just about nothing IMHO.  Bottom line is, if they are rare - then they are unreliable, hence useless to the class; and if they are useless, then why not remove the major complaint people have?  If they are common, then they are valuable - but if they are common enough to be critical to the class, then they are overpowered.<br>
<br>
As far as the tank vs infil test goes...  I'm less concerned with that than with caster vs infil, so my main concern is not special poison-kiting tactics but one-shot kills.  Why?  I'm a caster TL, not a tank TL.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But I agree that perhaps it should be looked at.  Or maybe the classes are ALL getting tweaked slowly to the point where any class is viable against any other, if they play superbly and use good tactics.  THAT would be my ideal - where the best player won most of the time, and not the person whose character fell into the right spot in a paper-scissors-rock diagram.<br>

It doesn't happen solo.  If 3d can find a solo warrior running around that sticks around waiting for him after he restealths, i'll give him a dollar.  #1, you aren't going to find a solo warrior.  they are not a solo class, and if they are solo, its hteir own fault.  #2, who would stick around solo to try and fight a guy that just restealthed?  you obviously have a speed advantage...  get to your friends!  RvR is not a vaccuum, and living means you won the fight, not sticking around to die.<br>
<br>
As for your infiltrator buddy on galahad...  sorry, but solo fights even vs most light tanks, i.e. thanes, skalds, zerkers will end up in a very dead infiltrator if they end up going 1v1 in a skirmish.  all of those classes get a huge bonus or no penalty vs leather, and the inf has a 50% chance of having huge bonus or huge penalty vs the chain on a skald of thane, depending on if he went thrust or not.  in a solo battle, it isn't going to happen, even in best case scenario.<br>
<br>
the 'unoptimal' argument is laughable too.  infs have more spec points than any other assassin.  even if they completely neglect a skill, they are going to be very viable vs other classes because of how high they can take their remaining skills if they wish.  I've had lifebane on me many times, and i have never once died to it.  I group with healers, and they actually heal, and cure poison.  It is too slow for the current state of RvR imo.  and again, the likelihood of an assin catching a tank solo on a normal server is so slim, if you try to balance a game around that, you are breaking the game.  certain classes have a choice to solo or group in rvr, and others are required to group.  this is how it works, and if you change it, it changes much more than the 1 in 1000 chance that you encounter a lone dumbass warrior who thinks he should stay and fight an invisible opponent.  if a healer did the same thing would you also say that assassins need fixing?  would a healer, who has no offensive capability at all, stick around and try to whittle down an opponent he cant see until he gets hit?<br>
<br>
post how long this epic battle lasted 3d.  I would love to hear.  I dont agree with the vultures that post things like '3dkngiht step down as teamlead'  and i think it doesn't belong at the safehouse, but trying to change the game based on such an improbability is ridiculous.  we don't play on a server with 300 people, we play in the frontier with battles that have 300 people. <p><a href="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=38056&raceid=10&classid=44">Dither Disgustipated</a><BR>

<br>
1)  Having critical hits removed from critical strike would require them to be removed from ALL classes, all damage types, and that cannot be done without totally changing the game, because then pve would no way be the way it is now.  My berserker is toast without critical hits, because they 'make' him what he is, and it is part of his special ability.  However, to suggest to remove critical hits from assassin CS but everyone else gets to keep them is wrong.  I won't suggest that critical hits be removed from anyone.  I will suggest that these same casters that complain about the assassin 1-shots be educated that they are in fact vulnerable and to become close personal friends with a tank who will protect them.  This requires modesty on a caster's part along with patience, because a tank's first instinct is to rush into battle, rather than being disciplined enough to stay with and protect the caster while the caster blasts/mezzes/etc from a far.  It's about team work; this is NOT your normal pk afternoon in Asheron's Call or UO.<br>
<br>
2)  Think back to beta 2 Kevin...we who were the minority, the Asheron's Call beta testers, had the argument about skill being more important than level with the majority, the EQ testers, along with the devs who sided with the majority.  Skill should be EVERYTHING, always.  In Asheron's Call, you can see a skillful level 40 drop level 80s 1v1 in pvp because they performed better, and thought better, versus the human opponent.  <br>
<br>
In DaoC, level is (nearly) everything.  A level 20 has no chance against a level 30 1v1 if they are just about any class.  The level differences are most notable amongst tanks.  However, a level 30 caster CAN kill a higher level caster (not too much higher) if they're smart, use good tactics, and have a small degree of luck.  A rogue (assassin or archer) also DOES have a chance against someone slightly higher in level, because skill and planning actually do matter for rogue classes, perhaps moreso than any other classes, because it's built into the class.  <br>
<br>
I've seen assassins in pve that just aren't any good at the class, due to inexperience, or lack of knowledge about how to most effectively use the assassins skills, or they unreasonably think they can play an assassin like a tank, but with poison and a big hit.  Conversely, those assassins that are successful in rvr are the standouts who understand their own abilities, and who think that skill does matter, because they know that it will definitely take skillful use of their abilities 'as a matter of course' that they were given to be able to survive any kill attempt they make against a near even con, let alone one that is higher.  Perhaps this is also what frustrates non-assassins the most with us, because rock/paper/scissors and the almightly level aren't quite so clear cut.<br>
<br>
Smith:<br>
/flame<br>
Who are you to be saying what tanks want? (and please, don't go spouting about being a level 50 armsman, I've got so many more levels as a tank in this game than you it'll take you a year to catch up if I never play one again.)  This game is called Dark Age of Camelot, and its pvp combat is referred to most commonly as Realm Versus Realm.  It's a TEAM sport.  That requires you to be a 'team player' or you get to take it in the shorts when you think you're a one man army.  If you think your oh-so-valuable &quot;tanking skillz&quot; aren't worth keeping a caster alive (because &lt;sob&gt; you don't want to be a slave or bodyguard) then both of you deserve to die...you for being a an arrogant idiot, and the caster for not demanding the protection THAT THE GAME WAS DESIGNED WITH, from you.<br>
<br>
I've seen tanks protect casters the way they are supposed to, and it works.  Guess what?  The tanks still get their realm points, and they still have to fight to protect the casters, since the casters are one of the top priority targets, along with healing classes.  I've seen Midgard healers who were so well protected by SMART tanks that they were untouchable.  If you are such a dolt as to see this as beneath you, please do go post it for all your realm mates on your server to see, so that they let your lame ass hang out to dry, that you have no interest in their survival and enjoyment of the game, only your own. <br>
/end_flame<br>
<br>
Now let me put it in terms you may understand, or may not depending on your ancestry and IQ. <br>
<br>
In this game, and in reality, infantry troops definition and mission in life is &quot;to seek out, close with, and destroy the enemy, in order to take and hold ground&quot;.  Nothing is harder in warfare than to remove entrenched infantry from a well-prepared position.<br>
<br>
Because, in Mythic's extreme shortsightedness, this game does not have collision detection, the infantry, i.e. all non-stealth classes who use a hand held weapon as their primary method of attack, have no means to take and hold ground in the classic sense, and protect valuable assets like healers and casters.  However, Mythic has input 'guard', 'protect' and 'intercept' as a very narrow but effective means for valuable assets to be protected.  All 3 work well in pve, and intercept works well in pvp.<br>
<br>
You cannot take and hold any ground, whatsoever, because your enemies can run right through you, or control/kill you from range.  No heroic 'shield to shield' stands can be made because of this.  You have to make use of the tools you have.  Screaming hordes of people rushing en masse down upon the enemy only works when the horde outnumbers their enemy by an extremely large amount, and in Hollywood and Starcraft.  Well thought out strategy and sound tactics are what wins battles most often, even in games.  I've seen tanks protect casters and healers to the point that that fact alone carried the battle for them.  I also see a lot of high level tanks get massacred as they tried the &quot;screaming horde&quot; approach, then they bitch about it when waiting for a rez or releasing. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukheldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kheldor</A> at: 4/18/02 10:49:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/18/02 10:26:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2766.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reply to Kevintest and Smith</span><hr size=1> Lucidus, stop talking theory.

<br>
so if someone has 45 natural stealth,yes he should be better off then a person with 35 stealth +10 from items.<br>
<br>
the one problem with trying to change the poison skill is that its not a primary skill for rogues per say. at best,for most rogues its a 3rd level skill or even 4th level skill.<br>
<br>
there are exceptions to this,in charecters who specced dual wield/left axe,and prefer envenom over cs. but even then it only moves up to a 2nd rank skill in most cases. the % of rogues who consider it there primary skill is probably less then 1%.<br>
<br>
also,the poison skill doesnt scale as effectively as any other skill in the game. this is due to the nature of the skill,in that 1 point doesnt represent new damage,it only represents new ability to use different poisons,only 1 of which does actual damage to a target. it also gives you a higher % to not be resisted. <br>
<br>
it might give you a higher median damage vs equal level opponents? it didnt do much when i was playing. if the + envenom bonus was changed,then you would have to change the entire line  of poisons,and how they work, they would have to be much more open ended on either side,or change how the bonus skill works so that lower level poisons actually increase damage beyond what they can currently do.<br>

Mythic stated early on in the game that natural ability and items would be equal.  You just dont get spells or styles.  With this in mind we all made choices.  Now 8 months into game you want to change a fundamental aspect of the game.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry but its just wrong to suggest this.  If you dont like the way the game is set up don't play it.  I purposely specd low in stealth and envenom knowing that in the end game it wouldnt matter.  I just have catching up with rr to do.  If you specd high in something and now it doesnt help you remember it did while it lasted.<br>
