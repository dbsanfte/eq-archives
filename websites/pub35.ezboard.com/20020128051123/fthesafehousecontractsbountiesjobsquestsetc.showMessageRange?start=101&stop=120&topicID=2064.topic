<br>
But why the extreme to start with? why not adjust to a midpoint to test.. evaluate if it needs to be taken farther.. that’s why everyone is freaked.. cuz its teetering on the edge of being nerfed to much. Why take something that due to changes in the game have become to beneficial to the players in one extreme.. and move just as far to the opposite extreme and then back a slight notch to fix it?<br>
<br>
 Everyone knows thru experience.. Verant is quick to nerf and slow as mother nature to change.. if that wasn’t the case everyone whouldn’t sweat it ..they’d just say “eh ok we’ll try, if it don’t work out it will get changed in a couple weeks”<br>
The reality is once its in, it won’t get changed back for months and months.. that’s the track record. that’s the history Verant has on class changes.. and its an endless battle to get it.. I’m tired of the battles. Look at rangers its not all rep.. there are serious problems their at highlevels.. its taken over a year for them to address and the end result isn’t all that.<br>
<br>
I’m just so bothered by things being changed to much upfront and not progressively changed abit at a time to fully test and evaluate the changes thru the real world experience of all the rogues out there to show how good or how bad each step was.<br>

Suddenly a skill, which has been in game for over a year, has become over powering and unbalancing. Instead of blaming it on the design of the zone or mob the problem in their eyes seems to be with the skill. So rogues are taking a wait and see attitude to it in hopes that VI by some miracle will understand the long reaching effects of this nerf and stop screwing with game mechanics. However they seem to think that nerfing one class fixes another. <br>
<br>
Kendrick the so called @#%$ of rogues listed his mathematical analysis of the new rogue evade and how its just as good as Jolt, while rogues sit scratching their head and rangers chuckle. The &quot;Fuzzy Math&quot; that is used seems to be a plague as of late when people see what they want to see. As the mass of rogues scream that this simply will not work, the cry is heard &quot;But it works on paper!&quot;. Well guess what, everquest is not a paper game and many game aspects can't be calculated unless you actually play in guild raid situations. For example look how easy sleepers is, &quot;But it looks hard on paper!”. <br>
<br>
So the rogue class is in the about the same situation rangers were before rok came out. Most can plainly see the horizon quickly approaching and the black abyss the rogue class is about to fall into. While VI keeps saying &quot;Don’t worry it will all work out” you hear rangers laughing in the background <br>

<br>
a long time ago rogue asked to be fixed, to have some skills that actually worked and to overall be more useful to a group (we were worthless)<br>
i really dont remember anything like &quot;we want to do make monks jealous of the damage we can do&quot; anywhere in the old reasonable rogue petitions<br>
<br>
instead of getting useful group skills and abilities we were made to do 2x the melee dmg of any other class through a combination of evade, class enhancements from lvl 50-60, and easily attainable superweapons<br>
<br>
rogues stopped complaining because groups finally wanted rogues, why? for their damage and their ability to do this damage while needing less healing than other secondary melee classes <br>
<br>
take away the damage and what do we have?<br>
<br>
we never asked to be the kings of damage ( a lot of twinks were made because we are the dmg kings though, so they dont count)<br>
but now that we are, i would imagine many people want it to stay that way (i saw this last week in a lot of the posts started by rogues stating what we should ask for) <br>
<br>
most old rogues just wanted their class to be playable, useful, and fun<br>
<br>
if u nerf evade (reducing our damage, i wish the company would just come out and say that rogues do too much damage right now ) give us something else that is going to be useful to a group and something that is FUN<br>
<br>
ie POISON SUX- completely redo it<br>

If anyone is crapping on the rogue class it's the flamers, with the mindless flames you are probably driving Kendrick away from this thread.<br>

This fix is in the process and needs discussion to help make it work.  The safehouse has a lot to offer in advice and ideas for how to make this work.  unfortunately that may be over looked because of stupid flames.<br>

Yeah rogues used to get the snot kicked out of them pre-rok because they had the same defense caps, d/p/r caps, same hp's, and same armors as rangers did. Now its easy to get to the soft ac cap while still having great stats. Look at all the whining about rogues who have MUCH higher defensive abilities now only being able to reduce aggro from 'much better than jolt, to worst case scenario as little as jolt'.

<br>
This won't change the way evade works very much at all.  If you think about it in a 6-person group the hate list might have 120 people on it but those 6 will be far and above the rest.  So, basically when we hit evade right now we hit 120 and at the next poke rise to at *least* number 6 (probably up to fourth).  <br>
<br>
So, right now evade basically drops us from 1st to 4th.  Now it will drop us from 1st to 3rd.  Either way you slice it we climb the hate list pretty damn fast.<br>
<br>
So suck it up, and work on your timing some more.   <p>Nimmbull

<br>
I see a lot of people bashing those who are "flaming Kendrick".  I don't, however, see anyone actually flaming him.  I do see a LOT of rogues that you guys have trusted for information in the past putting up valid points, concerns, and fears about this.  And in return, I see a lot of you people with your lips all over kendrick's arse, and feet on ours.<br>
<br>
I also see a lot of people saying "but hey, Verant just wants to lower our damage output, blah blah blah..".  Do you even bother to read?  Verant was FINE with evade when the hate list was 8-16 (I'd guess 16, although it has never been released, this was simply from my experience with damage in multiple group raids) people long (and it was like this for a LONG time.  It used to be that wizards and druids were the sole determination of who got xp in the planes.).<br>
<br>
The reason that it needs to be changed now is that with the hate list at ~128, is that a rogue drops SO far down the list that people who used to get pushed off before with melee damage (casters, etc) will now pickup agro if a rogue evades even once during the latter half of an epic Velious battle.<br>
<br>
The reason is NOT that "rogues do to much damage, and we wanna nerf em".  Unless Kendrick is lying to us rogues now.  In which case, @#%$ save us all.<br>
<br>
The problem with Velious is that rogues drop to the end of the hate list.  Failures on evade before would hurt us a lot more than they do in Velious.  Imagine the following scenario:<br>
<br>
5 warriors, 2 paladins, 2 sks, 3 rangers, 3 rogues, 4 clerics, 3 wizzies, 2 enchanters, 2 shamen, 2 magicians, 2 druids all level 60, all with epics on a raid (assumed fully buffed).<br>
<br>
Let's assume for a second that the old hate list was 12 players long. The way the hate list builds, within the first 20 seconds of the fight (assuming that the rogues don't evade within that period of time), you would see the hate list in this order:<br>
<br>
2 rogues<br>
2 shamen (malo/slow)<br>
1 enchanter (tash)<br>
3 warriors<br>
3 rangers<br>
1 sk<br>
-------old hate list cut---------<br>
2 paladins<br>
3 wizzies/2 druids/2 magicians (1 nuke each)<br>
1 enchanter (no spells cast)<br>
4 clerics (0-1 heal each)<br>
<br>
What does this show? rogues at the top of the list pre evade.  What about the paladins, wizzies, druids, magicians, enchanter, and clerics?  They're not on the hate list.  It's [the hate list is] so small that they have been "kicked" off the list, in essence, the mob forgets them because others have done more damage, or cast more debhilitating debuffs on it.  So, when a rogue evades, and 5 seconds after the evade is done, the hate list looks like this:<br>
<br>
3 warriors<br>
3 rangers<br>
1 sk<br>
2 paladins (kicked the shamen/enchanters from the hate list)<br>
1 cleric (just healed)<br>
2 rogues (evaded)<br>
-------old hate list cut---------<br>
2 shamen (malo/slow) (kicked off the list)<br>
1 enchanter (tash) (kicked off the list)<br>
3 wizzies/2 druids/2 magicians (1 nuke each)<br>
1 enchanter (no spells cast)<br>
3 clerics (0-1 heal each)<br>
<br>
Now, what is significant about this?  Well, for starters, the rogues aren't all the way at the end.  Why? Well, let's take a quick look a little deeper.<br>
<br>
The hate list is (in this example), 12 people long.  Those who have been kicked from the list now have 0 hate accumulated.  When a rogue evades, he/she is returned to 120 hate. Thus, still remaining on the list, but at 120 on the hate list, are lower than either paladin, or the cleric who just healed (a 400 point addition on the hate list).  Within a brief period of time (perhaps 20 seconds), they will surpass both paladins, they will pop back up on the hate list again.  This meant that rogues had to evade early and often, and they'd always be somewhere significant on the hate list.  If a warrior or main tank went down, it was always likely that a rogue would get beat on next.<br>
<br>
Now let's look at what Velious did.  imagine the same group within the same 20 seconds (let's say they're fighting a random WW named dragon):<br>
<br>
2 rogues<br>
2 shamen (malo/slow)<br>
1 enchanter (tash)<br>
3 warriors<br>
3 rangers<br>
1 sk<br>
2 paladins<br>
3 wizzies/2 druids/2 magicians (1 nuke each)<br>
1 enchanter (no spells cast)<br>
4 clerics (0-1 heal each)<br>
...60 more hate list spots to be filled...<br>
---------End of the hate list--------<br>
<br>
Again, that was pre evade on the rogues, in the first 10-20 seconds of the combat.<br>
<br>
Now, let's say the rogues evade.  Now how does the list look?<br>
<br>
3 warriors<br>
3 rangers<br>
1 sk<br>
2 paladins<br>
3 wizzies/2 druids/2 magicians (1 nuke each)<br>
2 shamen (malo/slow)<br>
1 enchanter (tash)<br>
1 enchanter (no spells cast)<br>
4 clerics (0-1 heal each)<br>
2 rogues (evaded)<br>
...60 more spots on the hate list...<br>
------------end of the hate list------------<br>
<br>
What's different here?  The rogues are at the VERY bottom of the list.  Below cumulated heals, nukes, debuffs, buffs, whatever.  They will NOT be hit ANYTIME in the near future.  Hell, at this point, they could stop attacking, go wander off somewhere, sit down, do whatever the hell they wanted to, and the mob would NOT pay attention to them until EVERYONE else was dead.<br>
<br>
THIS is what Verant didn't forsee.  But the problem is the way in which they're going about trying to fix it.  The problem is not really within single groups, as rogues will always jump up on the list very quickly in single groups, so I'm not understanding why they're looking at changing it, based around SINGLE groups.  Single groups would remain the same as they always did if rogues were moved down to the 12th-13th spots on the hate list.  The problem clearly only comes when dealing with large-scale raids, where the rogues put themselves SO far down on the hate lists that they will NEVER be hit.  But in these environments, a rogue can climb so quickly to the top of the hate list, that putting us 10-12 down on the hate list would have the same effect that putting us at the bottom did, pre-velious.<br>
<br>
I hope I make some amount of sense, and I hope you didn't just glaze over this, with merely passing interest.  This is how it works.  This is why it had to change.  And foremost, this is what should be done to fix it, rather than the extreme measures which Kendrick has listed for us here.<br>

I have offered ideas, I'm just getting tired of seeing people kissing Kendricks butt, Sure he rules most of the time.<br>
<br>
Just don't have to walk around with your lips attached to his butt?<br>
<br>
As for him posting before we're likely to know ?<br>
<br>
Umm no he doesn't<br>
<br>
Soon as he posts Absor posts on Whineplay the same thing.<br>
Maybe if you guys actually followed this a little better you'd know that.<br>
<br>
And I'm glad you post with your own thoughts.<br>
But do they have too include praise to Kendrick cause he works at verant and posts here?<br>
<br>
Is it great he posts here ?<br>
Yes, Its very helpful, keeps us from looking junk up.<br>
And i'm very happy he does.. He keeps us informed with stuff alot of the times.<br>
<br>
And most likely soon Kendrick will be posting logs of his tests of new Evade instead of paper numbers. <p>Level 52th Dorf Rogue of Cazic Thule, "for 20 levels all I smelt was goblin ass"

1 to 60.. is too much.. but 1 to 2.. is not enough.

<br>
<b>But Lozoria, wouldn't that unbalanced us in single groups?</b><br>
<br>
No.  That would keep us the same as we were pre-velious in single groups.  It would still only take us 2-4 seconds to surpass casters on the hate list, and would keep us from getting hit... unless we fail to evade (which happens a lot), or unless we are moving while we're trying to evade (ie: we fugup, we pay).<br>
<br>
<b>Well Lozoria, that's all fine and dandy, but Verant REALLY wants to screw with our damage output.</b><br>
<br>
If that's correct, then their version would be a rather crappy way to go about it.  It would also mean that Kendrick lied to us, specifically since he stated that Evade was fine pre Velious, and only has seen problems post-Velious, with the new hate lists, thus the need to re-tool Evade.  If they just want to lower our damage output, then just do that, instead of making me waste my time jerking off watching others fight while I eat my wheaties.  If I wanted to stand around, and <i>THEN</i> deal fast damage, I would have played a wizard.  I like stabbing things.  Don't make me stop.<br>

Please, if you can, support this idea on EQ's boards at <a href ='http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055876-4.html'>Whineplay's Rogue thread. Part III</a>.  It's really important that this is understood to be the way that the hate list worked, and the way it works now, and why the way they're planning on fixing it is SOOO wrong.  Wendolyn, Kaylum, Hobben, Tigole, Dirk, all of you.  Even if it's a "hey, I agree with loz", or even a "hey, loz is slightly off, but really close". <br>

<br>
If 60 is chosen Rogues gain the advantage in large/medium sized multi-party encounters. But remain about the same in smaller encounters.<br>
<br>
If 30 is chosen it only rearly balances the top ubber level encounters, as in all other encounters the rogue would still go to the bottom of the list.<br>
<br>
If 6 is chosen it balances out the mid level encounters, leaves Rogues stong in small encounters (although same as today), but for the ubber level encounters, it would restrict the event to either fewer Rogues or delaying the enevitable Rogue death by a round or two.<br>
<br>
If 2 or 3 is choosen we are likely just to die a lot all around.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
A possible solution might be to change the repop rate for both hide and tougnt so that they are linked to hast type effects. This would effectivly put more control into the players hands in manageing who is were on the hate list, and adding more class dependancies and possibly stratagy to encounters (both large and small).<br>
<br>
However this control may be to overpowering for the player-envirmoment balance, so it would possible also require rebalancing the failure rates. This would meen a lot more in the way of testing before any changes were to go live and so may not even be considered. <p>Hinur the Vicar
