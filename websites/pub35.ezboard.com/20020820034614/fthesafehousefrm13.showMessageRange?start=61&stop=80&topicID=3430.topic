Not sure if yall picked this up, maybe I am stating what yall already know, the general sayes: &quot;Return to me with the Box of the Hero of Shar Vahl and I will send a team of our veterans to escort you into battle.&quot; Geting the Hero Box done will greatly help the war quest, but by doing the hero quest you still have to do the war quests to get the castle key.<br>

<br>
The first three scout invasions are trivial.  You lose some cash if your scout dies and that's about it.  I can solo the first two and need 2-3 people for the third.<br>
<br>
Problem with the scout invasions is that a grimling officer may not spawn for hours.  So you end up sitting in a camp bored to death.<br>
<br>
The next one is a captain invasion.  Captain meets with a sergeant past the bridge and then you have to clear two camps.  A smaller camp with the sergeant and a larger one with the captain.  The smaller camp can be held with 3 people but a larger one needs about 5-6.  Just because of the numbers of grimling there.  A person can only have 3 NPCs' attention.<br>
<br>
Problem with the captain invasion is that a grimling officer may not spawn for hours.  So you end up sitting in a camp bored to death together with several other people.<br>
<br>
If you lose this invasion, you lose all your work.  So you have to bore yourself with the scout invasions again.<br>
<br>
The next one is a vetaran invasion.  The vetaran stops at one point on the way to the grimling camps and says that there is an ambush.  Several grimlings spawn near him and you kill them.<br>
<br>
Then he meets with another cat.  Here you need to split up your group again.  Both cats then go to their camps and charge them and then promptly die because they get nuked by grimlings within 5 seconds.  We lost both, the veteran and the other cat right at start.  I suggest you send in your people before the cats charge.<br>
<br>
Don't bother killing any grimlings because the whole camp will respawn when the cats charge.  This is also tru with the previous invasions.  But by having people in camp you will take most of the aggro.<br>
<br>
Anyway, at this point I gave up.  I lost everything that I aquired previously.  I did not want to waste my time and time of about 12 other level 60 people.<br>
<br>
So, I went to try the other route.<br>
<br>
I currently have 6 of the 8 components required.<br>
<br>
We completed the grimling high priest part of the quest but before we could escort the prisoner out, our server crashed.  I lost the no rent key of course.<br>
<br>
The next time we went to kill the high priest, there were three of them up.  So, three times the skeletons. After a petition, GMs looked at it but could not do anything about the extra versions of the high priests.  They could not target them.<br>
<br>
So, we got about 24 people to try to AOE the skeletons.  It almost worked.  Our one chanter died from the HTs right at the end of the third wave.  We gave up on this idea.<br>
<br>
Another day, another patch and we were off to pay the high priest a visit.  Well, guess what we found?  Nothing.  No high priest up.<br>
<br>
Well, to make something out of the trip, we got more people to attempt the fire ring.  We had three groups of mostly level 60s.<br>
<br>
We did very well.  Got first wave and their boss down.  Second wave and their boss down.  Third wave and their boss down. Then came the fourth wave and after a while we were overcome.<br>
<br>
First three waves we handled well.  Two skeleton spawns per spawn. First wave is light blue warrior type skeletons.  Second wave blue mix of SKs and clerics.  Same with third wave.  Fourth wave was three blue skeletons per spawn with a mix of SKs and clerics.<br>
<br>
For all the above work, including a fairly tough third wave boss we got terrible loot.  Something maybe a level 30 person would use.  There is absolutely no way people of level who would use those items could defeat the fire ring.<br>
<br>
Well, I know some of the people visiting here completed the fire ring.  Would like to know how many waves there are past the third wave.<br>
<br>
So far I've had bad luck with Acrylia.  Hopefully this info will make it easier for others. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umanr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Manr</A> at: 12/20/01 5:59:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustanlymanly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stanly Manly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/21/01 3:29:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3430.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> blah</span><hr size=1> FYI.. got some +5 alteration gloves from the Sorceress today.. int caster only.

Perhaps tomorrow it will change again into a burrower. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustanlymanly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stanly Manly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/24/01 1:17:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3430.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> blah</span><hr size=1> Summoned Pupae is now a Summoned Worm... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushelnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shelnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/24/01 2:15:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3430.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Summoned Worm</span><hr size=1> Summoned Worm and Summoned Pupa were up.

Was told by a druid friend they attack if you hand them an item (food whatever) also. <br>
<br>
Anyway worm/pupa killed...both MT !!! Minnows continued to spawn instantly....were 5 in the room.  We got them down to 1 a couple of times but back up to 4-5 almost immediately.<br>
<br>
It appears I either killed them to early or the drop isnt every time.  I'm thinking it has to be the first since all the other mobs drop key item every kill.  On a side note we tried the priest a couple of days ago also and its still down.  Makes me suspect both of these spawns are 7 days since this is the longest EQ has been up w/o a server reset since Luclin release. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ualiona.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aliona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/24/01 7:54:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3430.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scout Quests...</span><hr size=1> Just a note on the captive cat =) There is a prisoner in the cat fort area behind one of the buildings in a holding pen.

Actually what you do is stand on the plank till about 30+ skeletons have spawned.  Then you can finally hit the High Priestess.  And btw the skeletons come about every 10-15 seconds towards the end...Plus about every other one is immune to dazzle, hit fast as hell and have decent HPs.  So after you do this and manage to kill the priest then you loot another key and free the cat.  Only the cat is KOS to the dungeon so you better have a darn good PBAE team set up to do about 3 dungeon sweeps in front or at least 3 good enchanters and some bards to grab agro for the tanks to get the stupid cat out of the dungeon.<br>
<br>
ie if it was as simple as giving the cat a key you can get with one question we'd be past this part long ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/24/01 10:23:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3430.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cat freeing...</span><hr size=1> We tried doing the high priest tonight.

Oh, and I have to tell you all about the funniest thing that happend the other day.  We were in the room before the platform.  Our druid was the 'sacrafice' and was rooted in the shackles.  A monk in our group was exploring a bit outside.. and got agro by some Skeletons that spawned at the doorway.  He fd'd them off before they HT him.<br>
<br>
Now the funny part... The druid (who is rooted by the shackles) decides to SNARE the skeletons... they proceed to both run to him and HT him.  He dies instantly =).<br>

Doesn't the quest call for a &quot;husk?&quot;  When these transformations take place - doesn't it seem to reason (I know, stop using reason on VI quests) that the husk would drop off and be a ground spawn?  The theory of not enough time from server reset for this to happen seems sound. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3430.topic&start=241&stop=255>13</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=3430.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=3430.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3430.topic&index=80><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3430.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=3430.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3430.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3430.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
