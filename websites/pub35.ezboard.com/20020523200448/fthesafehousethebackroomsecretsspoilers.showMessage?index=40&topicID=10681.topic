I'll admit I haven't spent alot of time on EQclerics boards but their site blows nuts information wise. Why do they suck? Prolly because most of the people that would post there only visit it once per every 5 or 10 Safehouse visits. And that ain't gonna change. The safehouse forums Backalley and Quest forums have evolved to become EQ boards. <br>
<br>
If you think about it it's actually a compliment. The content that was posted on the forums was the most reliable informative content to be found so people kept coming, and they told their friends who started coming and so on.<br>
<br>
The only way it would de-evolve to a rogue only board is if all the moderators quit EQ entirely took speeders and stayed up round the clock immediately deleting anything that did not specifically pertain to rogues. And maybe in about 2 years the class boards for other classes would get some boost in readership. <br>
<br>
It still wouldn't be as unequaled as the info here. On patch days or major server down you can see as many as 500 people on Safehouse. You'll never see that on another class board. In addition the information posted here would fade greatly. Of those 500 people here ALOT of them are non rogues, or their rogues are retired now and they have a new &quot;main&quot; and thus would hang on their &quot;main&quot;'s class board and not be supplementing the information here.<br>
<br>
I have a 60 war, 57 Cleric, 51 Rogue, 59 Bard, 51 Enc, 42 monk. My main is my war. But I have given suggestions as well as advice to all classes. Many classes before I even played them. Sometimes my suggestions/advice was whacked, sometimes it helped greatly. I've received advice on many things from people who didn't and hadn't ever played the class they made suggestions.<br>
<br>
Lots of non rogue info has been posted and appreciated here - Chardock revamp new loots, CT revamp new loots. Not ALL of those loots were rogue useable but those threads florished (sp). <br>
<br>
I think the one guy stated it best:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As a Rogue I tend to die soon after the CH cycle is screwed up. I'm all for getting this information out there, despite it not really belonging here directly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Rogues are generally the first people mauled when Cheal rotation F'ups.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I'd love to visit a Class forum and get the information I need for said class there. But for it to be as high a quality as what has come to be here Everyone, including the hardcore supporters *Psst go away only rogues here* would need to visit THOSE forums as well and read ALL the threads and see if there was something they could contribute as well.<br>
<br>
I regularly visit Graffes. You saw my class list. I don't have a wiz. But I am interested in wizard info. I wanna know where I can farm to get my wizards their spells. I have printed and read just about every epic spoiler so I know what my people need for their epics. I also post on those boards giving my take on drops or mobs for certain classes. I once asked on graffes where the best spell farms were. Funny the info I had from numerous safehouse posts by far beat the info I received on graffes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upanamah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Panamah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 2:40:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10681.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CH rotation</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

The class message forum for clerics doesn't suck at all.  It's got some of the best information out there that applies to the cleric class. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi...tion=intro</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I have a 60 cleric and a 60 rogue.  I read it regularily for cleric stuff.  There's about 3 recent threads there about cheal chains, how to make the hotkeys, techniques various people use, even how to practice.<br>
<br>
Having Safehouse become the dumping ground for all EQ classes does a disservice to those of us who use it for Rogue related info.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showPrevMessage?topicID=10681.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showNextMessage?topicID=10681.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10681.topic&index=43><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.emailToFriend?topicID=10681.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.threadControl?topicID=10681.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10681.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10681.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers>The Back Alley</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
