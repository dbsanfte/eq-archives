But...the hate crime name is a two-way street...it can be used to add extra weight to someone who SHOULD be put away...but it can also be used to label something that had nothing to do with discrimination as a hate crime.<br>

<br>
/agree<br>
<br>
If a person kills a person, that person should only be regarded as a person, in the most in generic terms possible.  Notice how &quot;hate-crime&quot; legislation is really just a way to be plotically correct and favor minorities and women in legal processes.  As someone said, it's impossible to commit a hate-crime on a Caucasian male.  In fact, more discrimination takes place against Caucasian males these days than any other group.  Case in point: &quot;Affirmative&quot; Action and so called &quot;Equal Opprotunity&quot; laws.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against true equality in the justice system, or in any other part of life.  But favoring any group to be politcally correct is wrong.  (I think there was a thread while ago about a statue/memorial for the firefighters who raised the flag at the WTC.  The people planned to change their faces to be black and Hispanic.  That's not equality.)<br>

<br>
Heh. Having studied law I can tell you that there's lots of inherent bias in legal process against women and minorities. Like the horrific cross-examination of female victims of sexual crimes that are standard practise, for example? Case law and precedent in both my country and the USA have more sway over the results of any trial than many people realise.<br>
<br>
Back on topic: the Holocaust of WW2 was a hate crime. Hate crimes are centered around the idea that one person is saying that he is morally / racially / physically superior to another person, and because of that, considers themselves justified in killing that person. I doubt most murderers feel their victims &quot;deserved&quot; to die - but murderers like the one who killed these two women did. The idea that superiority supersedes another's right to life is abhorrent and should be punished with the full force of the law.<br>
<br>
I don't know if doubling the man's sentence is appropriate, most likely the man will spend his life in jail, so the extra sentences are simply a rubber stamp on his crime saying &quot;Look how much we despise this kind of behavior.&quot; I would think that where a hate motivation for crime can be conclusively proven in murder cases, the maximum penalty should be enforced. Yes, that means the death sentence if that's part of your laws. <br>
<br>
I have no tolerance for &quot;nazism&quot; of any persuasion. Intolerance on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexuality is unnacceptable in anyone who wants to be described as a &quot;human&quot; being. <p><font size=3><font color=#990033><font face=copperplate gothic light, times new roman, arial>Merribelle Stealshearts</font><BR><font size=2><font face=copperplate gothic light, times new roman, arial>~Lady of Swords~ <BR><font face=copperplate gothic light, times new roman, arial> Guildleader, <A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/bwarcry97210>Cry of War</A></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 11:46:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4765.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Murder is Murder, does motive matter?</span><hr size=1> Trust me, prosecutors (who are predominantly pretty conservative white males), will apply hate crime legislation to crimes that against white males who are targeted because they were white males.

<br>
Consider the obliteration of the Black Panthers and other black nationalistic movements as an indicator that the law hardly coddles minorities. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A> at: 4/13/02 11:48:40 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showPrevMessage?topicID=4765.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showNextMessage?topicID=4765.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4765.topic&index=50><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.emailToFriend?topicID=4765.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.threadControl?topicID=4765.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4765.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4765.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes>Rant Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
