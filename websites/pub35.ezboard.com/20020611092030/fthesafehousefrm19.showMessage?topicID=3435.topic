There is no way to tell what weapons are being used, there is no way to tell what sort of critical hits Penetration recieved, Mill had just killed someone and could have been debuffed as well having greater enervating poison applied at the beginning of the fight.<br><br>Mill missed several opportunities to style early in the fight and by the look of things the infiltrator styled on every attack.  For some reason Mills damage was showing huge variance with primary hand attacks ranging from in the 30's to over 100.  If his weapon specs are as high as he says, and he was fully buffed to the stats he says his damage would not vary nearly to this extent.  I'm guessing that either his buff bot was killed and his buffs were gone or that he was heavily debuffed.<br><br>You say that a shadowblade should be able to beat any other assassin most of the time.  Then who kills the shadowblade?  No assassin should dominate fights against the other assassins.  Tanks and casters have more natural enemies allowing for more variance in their abilities, assassins only natural threat is another assassin.  When one assassin is dominant over the others there is no reasonable counter to that.<br><br>Shadowblades should get something to help them against a wider range of targets.  Pre-patch I saw shadowblades kill anyone they came up against except clerics and minstrels with high success rates.  Post patch they must pick their targets more carefully like the rest of us have all along.  I wouldn't be against seeing left axe damage brought up a little bit more, but there is no way it should be returned to what it was before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 11:43:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> mill you slay me</span><hr size=1> has anyone forgot how the debuff works?<br>does mill remeber that con also effects how much damage you take?<br>guess mill did!<br>so not only are your buffs basicly negated but you now will take more damage from having a lower con<br>geee wonder why you got owned<br> anyone need to be koluge un educated to see where mill is trying to go with this?<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utakofmidgard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TakofMidgard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 11:58:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mith</span><hr size=1> Lay off the personal attacks.

And, why?<br>   Someone will always argue with you no matter what you post. We may as well save our logs, etc... And, simply play the game until a better one comes along. We are simple individuals that like playing on-line games. No use in getting our identities wrapped up into this game title.<br>   We were not sb's before DAoC came out. And, I will not be one as soon as a better game comes along. And, no one else does either, if they so choose.<br>   Other-realmers simply fear and hate the class we've chosen. Not all, mind you. But, enough do. <br> My toons are fellow citizens of Nerfdgard, I trully feel the pain. But, obviously, they were too much of a threat the way they were. <br>  I guess they still are. Here's the basis of my theory. Supposedly, sb's were nerfed- amongst other reasons- because sb's were able to 1-shot kill grays and not come unstealthed. Grayganking. <br>  All of my toons have been victims of grayganking so many times, I couldn't count them all. And, never once did I whine or bitch about the archers, assassins, or whatever who did it. Let alone, bitch to nerf(or, support a nerf through my 'reasonable' arguments from my perspective...PHHTT!!) their entire class!<br>   Sharsulias, in fact, grayganked my 27th sb just lastnight in DF. He's one of the people debating you in this thread. <br>   I, a 30th zerk, and a 30th thane had just finished fighting a mob. My sb was sitting and I saw him too late to even stand up and defend myself. He hit me for 898pts of damage. Enough to kill my toon twice over. And, never once did it cross my mind to go cry about it. And, my promise to Sharsulius, and all infiltrators, is that I never will. <br>   Hell, obviously, my 27th sb is such a threat to a 50th infiltrator that I had to be put down immediately. My friends and I had a good laugh over it afterwards. SB's are just too uber, baby! I'm scared that if I bitched to Mythic, then all 27th sb's will be made to immediately compensate, in cash,  any 50th lvl infiltrator's for the .000001% of durability damage caused to their weapons while they grayganked said offending sb. The amount will double if the weapon was Epic. Triple if player-made. LOL. <br> In fact, if I had not seen his reply in this thread, I would've soon forgotten the incident. Hell, I still will. No hard feelings on my part. <br>  But, it made me think. If he was willing to pass by all the high-lvl Nerfdgardians just to PA me, and then die, it must've been out of blind hatred. <br>  Mill, we can't counter-argue that kind of attitude. There's nothing that we can say that will make them look beyond the fact that we are Nerfdgard sb's. And, must be KOS! <br>  I see you, Danlitus, and other hi-lvl sb's banging your heads against the wall trying to make others see reason. I think of the hours you guys have spent lvl'ing and fine-tuning your assassins only to be struck down with nerfs by hear-say, misinformation, and pure bullcrap. And, I truly know why you're so frustrated. But, the fact remains, we're nerfed. And, we probably won't get un-nerfed until we find a better game to play. <br>P.S. To all you 50th lvl infiltrators on MLF! My sb will soon be 28th! You had better fear him. I am going to the herald website and taking down all of your names. Nightshades, too! When he's 30th, I will use him to ruthlessly hunt down all of you, using my uber Nerfdgardian 'sitting-wounded' sneak attack that I used on Shars...whatever-the-hell his name is. But, not before dating all of your daughters first. That way you will have heart-attacks and be fully debuffed before I 'attack' you. Hahaha.<br>P.P.S- Sorry, just couldn't help myself from taking a potshot. Hopefully, I didn't really offend anyone. But, my RL friends and I are still laughing about that one. <br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvehemencebelaern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehemence Belaern</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 12:21:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Infiltrators are unbeatable, check this log out.</span><hr size=1> Pene uses <br><br>Arc Sabre in mainhand dps 16.9 delay 3.9 qual 100 35%bon<br><br>Forgot what was being used in offhand. . .<br><br>Also we need to remember Penetration is going to be fully buffed to the teeth with some really nice buffs.

I'll put money on the nightshade.<br> <p><B><big><font color="#ffffff">Bile Silhouette</B></big><BR>Pendragon *Legends* Smurf of Death<br> <br><i>Half the world is composed of idiots, the other half of people clever enough to take indecent advantage of them.</i><br>BILE WAZ HERE!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uoldmill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Old Mill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 12:45:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sover.net/~danmad/images/bigbeer.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Infiltrators are unbeatable, check this log out.</span><hr size=1> Make no mistake, I dont want infils nerfed either.
