How Taoistic Tautara (the Iksar Monk) got faction. I first started by reading Aneka's Faction Guide. <br>
<br>
Dark Elves:<br>
<br>
I headed to Nektolus Forest to kill halflings for outerguard faction. This was too slow for me and does not give inerguard and merchant faction. I purchased some invis potions and 1 stack of red wine. I hauled tail to Neriak's 3rd gate. There is a library there. It is a white building with four pillars and stairs in the front (before the Necro guild). Enter this building and take the 1st door to your left. In here is Lokar Tobaith, the scribe of Innorukk. You hand him 4 red wines and in turn he will give you faction to:<br>
<br>
DarkBargainers (Merchants and Lokar's faction)<br>
Dreadguard Outer (Outside guards)<br>
DreadguardInner (InsideGuards)<br>
<br>
I was not KoS to him as I was not KoS to the DE Merchants in Sro (Who also have a lightstone quest for the same factions). You can hand in a max of 16 red wines at a time. Four stacks of four red wines. You need to be at least Indifferent to Lokar to do the red wine quest.<br>
<br>
You can do the Lighstone quest in Sro to get the faction up with the DarkBargainers (Lokar's faction). DarBargainer faction raises fast. I had sneak to make this quest simple for me. How to do this if you don’t? Well, handing them in while invis DOES NOT WORK. Too many ppl said that it would, Pfft. Someone suggested to Feign Death and hand them in??? You really have two good options here. First is to get light stones and greaterlight stones to turn in for faction in Sro. OR you can use a lil trick I discovered. <br>
<br>
!WARNING! This maybe be considered exploiting a game bug and hence a banable offence. You get a few stacks of 4 red wines ready to go. You then /quite while in front of Lokar. Don't sit and camp because he will attack you if you’re KoS. (Oh, that reminds me. He is a very low lvl Necro. I would guess lvl 5.) Then once you log in hurry and jam as many sets of four wines as you can into him. The reason this works is because faction is the last thing to load. He will be indiff to you until your faction loads. I have about a 10 second delay before my faction loads. <br>
<br>
Thank Gawd for sneak so I wasn’t temped to do this myself. 20 wines should get you warmly to the DarkBargainers and Lokar. I handed in about 10,000 red wines to get warmly to the innerguards. 1000 wine should get an Iksar well above KoS. This will get you GTG to bind in the zone and safe passage to the bank. Don't wander too far because the DE warriors will KoS you and the Necro/Sk's. If you want these two factions Kill the slaves in Crushbone or the Rangers in LesserFaydark for IndigoBrotherhood faction (Warrior Guild). It took me 500 dead rangers to get to dubious. As far as "The Dead" (Necro/SK) faction. This seems tuff to get. The only way is to destroy your Ak'anon faction or kill a single High Elf slave in Nejena. Thats one faction hit every 20ish minutes. NO THANKS.<br>
<br>
Freeport:<br>
<br>
I did some Orc killing as a newbie but not enough. Off to do the Nestral and Rebby Messenger quest as Anezka's guide suggested. I again used my necro to do the footwork. Get note, gate to Rebby, run back. This was taking forever. Being the rich uncle necro I am, I hired 5 newbies to help by shouting in the two zones. I showed them the quest once and paid them 50pp per stack of whiskers. We had fun. I kept them all in a group and was doing it along with them. <br>
<br>
Two hours later and about 200-300pp poor I had 175 whiskers and some happy newbies. I handed the whiskers in and was warmly to the merchants and dubious to the guards and non-merchants in East and West FP. Now there are still a few KoS NPC's in West FP and NorthFreeport. At this point it’s off to do the Fabian the Bard faction per Anezka's guide. <br>
<br>
My log shows 882 faction hits for the KnightsofTruth (NorthFreeport). 285 hits from killing Orcs in EC and 597 from giving the bard 2gp. This got me to dubious in NorthFreeport. I seen a few KoS NPC's in NFP still but the path to the bank is clear and that’s all that matters.<br>
<br>
Ak'anon:<br>
<br>
Part of this faction is easy to get. Goto Steamfont and kill Minotaurs. It took 250 faction hits for me to hit Dubious. The other part of Ak'anon faction is EldrithCollective (Gnome casters). I didn’t bother with this as of yet. I also haven’t checked 100% that the path to the bank is clear of KoS NPC's but I think it is. Just for the record there is also Gnome Necro faction but they are in lower parts of Ak'anon. Oh yes, and watch out for that lil shitter Meldrath in the Mino cave. He is a gnome necro and very tuff for his lvl. I would say a melee would need to be 46+ to solo him.<br>
<br>
And that is the end of my faction quest. I have a few new friends who will sell to me and let me bind in their fine towns. A very good thing indeed.<br>
<br>

<br>
nice... I wouldnt dare dreaming it took so little minos to fix Ak'anon.. ill do that soon.<br>
<br>
Be careful, in East Freeport, adn the tavern near the docks... dont bother entering, theres a barbarian and an Ogre who wont be happy to see it. also, each time I go bank, if I passs by that blue house while the door is open a little gnome runs after me, but hes blue at 27 and isnt strong at all. <br>

Turning in the bottles of red whine while invis works fine. I turned in my 800 red wines about a week ago, including a couple of hundred before invis wore off. Did you remember to hit Sneak before handing in the wine? If not, ya messed up. As long as you are sneaking, invis doesn't drop when you hand in the items. Kind of like rogues' hide+sneak. At least, that's how it's worked for me (red wine quest, pieces of tektite in OT outpost, ...).<br>
<br>

 No I did not sneak while invis. I sneaked while uninvis =) As I said he is a very low lvl necro and would not agro unless one of a higher lvl sat. Invis is not the key. Sneak is the key. The handing in while invis not working info was more for the non Iksars (who dont have sneak as an opption). I tried to hand them in with my necro while invis and did not work since Gnecro's cant sneak.<br>
<br>
PS. The merchant faction is not KoS to Iksar Monks from jump. Test it out. Goto Sro and con the 3 DE merchants there. They are on the same faction. <br>

<br>
 Q: I'm an Iksar Monk and I need help with FREEPORT faction! How can I do business in West Freeport and East Freeport AND North Freeport (And monk guild, in West Freeport)?<br>
<br>
A: The answer is threefold and takes a very long time to complete:<br>
<br>
Part 1: Get your Monk to East Freeport under the docks. You can use the tunnel system under Freeport - you should be dubious to everything. Now make a mule who can talk to the Rogues in the underground in East Freeport. I used a Wood Elf Bard. (Tip: Level the bard up to 6 so you can use Selo's Accelerando -- you will need it.)<br>
<br>
Go under the docks, in the door, down the steps and behind the hidden wall and you'll run into the Rogue guild area. Take a right and through the door is a dark elf who would like you to bring a note to Janam, who is in West Freeport. Follow the hails with the woman. Next, go out her door and straight down until you see a Human and Halfling. The tall one wants you to hand something to Rebby, who is also in West Freeport.<br>
<br>
Run to West Freeport and hand the materials to Janam and Rebby (respectivly). You will get whiskers from Janam and a note from Janam. The note is lore, the whiskers are not.<br>
<br>
Now run back to East Freeport and transfer the stuff to your Monk - the room under the docks is pretty quiet and safe to drop stuff. With the monk give the whiskers to the Dark elf and the note to the Human.<br>
<br>
That is the Janam and Rebby method and will raise your Militia Faction along with some other stuff, like merchants...<br>
<br>
Part 2a: For North Freeport you will need a druid to wolf form you in East Freeport.<br>
<br>
There is a Bard named Fabien who resides in a bar near the south gate. With no faction changes he will be 'threateningly' to you in wolf form, so he MAY attack you. If he does, don't worry - he's a wuss and the four guards in the bar do not assist. Just feign him away. Sneak behind him and give him 2gp. Then give him another 2gp. And another, and another and another. This quest will raise Paladin faction and bard faction (Bleh!). It will probably take between 115 and 150pp to get to dubious (!) with the paladins.<br>
<br>
Part 2b: Alternativly, you can kill two birds with one stone: Kill orcs. LOTS OF ORCS! Killing the orcs in the commonlands and west freeport will raise your Freeport Monk guild faction and Paladin faction. The only problem is that its incredibly tedious and takes approximatly 1200 kills to get to dubious.<br>
<br>
Part 3: Monk guild faction - As in Part 2b tedium takes over: Kill every orc you can see. Not sure how many orcs it will take - I am still threatingly (Just paid 1000pp for the freakin' headband (and sash) and trained in Cabilis, like a Good Swifttail.). The good part about doing monk faction here is that you can buy shurikens. Whoop-dee-friggin-do. Do the bracer of hammerfal quest. :)<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
Preface: Every Iksar Monk is dubious to start out in Cazic Thule - which is a good thing when you're running to the Plane of Fear to shake hands with `ol Thuley. Its very handy to not be KoS in Cazic Thule. So what do you do when you see the rare mob up that you just *HAVE* to kill? Kill it and use this guide to get the faction back up.<br>
<br>
Q: Help!! I killed a mob in Cazic Thule and I'm no longer dubious!<br>
<br>
A: Ever notice that there are two faction in Cazic Thule? One goes up and one goes down. The good thing is that both "races" exist and you can kill them both quite easily. The group of lizards that raise Cazic Thule faction are located outside Cazic Thule in The Feerrott. Not the two on the ramp leading up to the zone, but rather in the surrounding temples. Keep killing those `til your Lizard brethren tollerate you again.<br>

Just a note : Bards get selo's accelerando at level 5. I advise you to buy a percussion instrument as well (2 golds at bard guild, equip in SEC only but make you run faster).<br>
<br>
Also killing sir lucan for the soulfire quest will give you a BIG faction hit in favor of north freeport (although east and west will never talk to you again). <br>

 A lot of people hunt the orcs for xp. So I found an even easier way to get faction from the orcs. All you need to do is 1 point of damage to an orc to get the faction. So I just run up and down the zone 'tagging' the orcs other people are killing. Sometimes I use shurikens, somtimes I walk up to the group and kick the orc using the kick we got at level 1. If questioned by the group explain what and why I am tagging there kills. None has ever complained yet. Most never notice.<br>
<br>
This also worked for me in Greater Divide trying to get my dwarf and Claws of Veeshan faction up. I would wander around soloing the wolves for faction and experience. I would also 'tag' the giants and wolves other groups were killing.<br>
<br>
<b>Tarask Anklebiter</b><br>
<br>
 As described above Orc camps are frequently occupied by young newbies. My advice is to do as I did and PL them if taking this route. If of sufficient level youcan safely single pull the orcs, hit them down to 55% of hp and let the group do the rest while aggro remains on you. You get faction and they get safe, fast xp. Everyones a winner and you get liked rather than hated as the "hibie" farming a low level xp camp. <br>
 <br>
<b>Onnizen Omnipotent</b><br>
<br>
This is just one way you can raise up your Erudin faction so you can almost walk freely inside and in the Palace.(avoid the bard for the mail quest and the Cleric guild.) I personally did all of this myself so I could do the Inert Potion quest.<br>
<br>
It is best to have invisibility caster/friend who can buy things in the Palace with you during the later parts of this guide, so be prepared. Otherwise you may have to buy a lot of Cloudy Potions.<br>
<br>
Now, the first thing you should do is kill Elial Brook.<br>
He is a heretic necromancer (approx. lvl 8.) He raises the following factions: Deepwater Knights (paladins,)<br>
Craftkeepers (enchanters,) Gate Callers, (magicians,) <br>
and Crimson Hands (wizards.) Note that he also drops 'Bones.' Always collect these when you kill him, <br>
you can turn them in to the magician guildmaster, Markus Jaevins.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: Sentinel Creot wanders from the shop near the beach to the docks, and will kill you on sight.<br>
It is advised that you kill Elial with another character that is not KoS and collect about 100 bones... Hand the bones to your Iksar and have your Iksar get an invis, and go inside the palace, sneak from behind to hand the bones in to the magician guildmaster, Markus Jaevins.<br>
<br>
VERY IMPORTANT: Sentinel Edan is straight across from Markus Jaevins, and will kill you upon attempting to hand in bones. There are a couple ways to do this.<br>
<br>
1) Be prepared to die. Get a bind at the exit to Toxxulia. Have your friend hold the 100 bones and take 12. Set up your bones in stacks of 4 and put each stack in one trade slot, watch your faction go up, and die. Get 12 more and an invis, repeat. Not recommended for the higher levels.<br>
<br>
NOTE: These last two have not been attempted.. (Yes I did die a lot, but I am only level 14.)<br>
<br>
2) Have someone distract Sentinel Edan in some way that he does not face you when trading. Hails do not work. (Have not found a way yet...)<br>
<br>
3) Get a Ball of Golem Clay. (off the Clay Golem in Cazic Thule) Get into the palace with invis and use the Ball inside the back room of the shop 'Vials of Vitality' so nothing will aggro. The Ball will turn you into an Earth Elemental. Then hand all the bones in. (Not sure if anything will aggro on you when in Earth Elemental form)<br>
<br>
After that, it should be safe to kill Elial without worrying about Sentinel Creot, and all guards should be at least dubious.<br>
<br>
Killing Elial several, several times(approximately 40?)<br>
should get you to dubious with the casters, and threateningly to DW Knights. Killing him 20-30 more times should get you to amiable to casters (enough to do the Inert Potion quest,) and indifferent to DW Knights. Just remember to avoid the Clerics guild and the bard messenger.<br>
<br>
There you have it...though Erudin is very out of the way and is not really necessary to do the Celestial Fists quest, I'm sure it will help at least one person.<br>
I'll also be happy to assist you with anything if you are on Xegony.<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm surprised that I have not seen this mentioned on the boards before (probably has, but I just haven't seen it). I was motivated to post something by a message I read in the Quests forum where a young iksar said he ran from SK to Cabilis and back to pick up his head of Ghanex'Drah. This is totally unnecessary, even if you have not done the faction work required to bank in Neriak, NFP, or Qeynos. There are two banks on Antonica where Iksar monks can bank:<br>
<br>
....- Qeynos sewers: down in the "evil" guild area, there is a banker dressed as a banker. By default, Iksar are dubious to the evil guildies in Qeynos, so if you haven't messed that up, you can bank there safely (and buy/sell to boot).<br>
<br>
...- Runnyeye Citadel: This bank requires you to be around 30th level, or be willing to feign flop a ways, but there is a bank on the fourth level of Runnyeye, manned by a goblin banker. There are nearby goblins, but Runnyeye isn't that high level of a dungeon, so by 30th level it's safe. As an added bonus, you can buy red wine in the goblin bar, and use that to get non-KOS in Neriak.<br>
<br>
Hope this little guide-let helps other Iksar monks keep from running all the way back to Cabilis from Antonica!<br>

I've mentioned the Catacomb bank several times, but the Runnyeye bank was unknown to me. Thanks, I may check it out someday. I have used the Rivervale bank a couple times despite being KOS -- not really dangerous for me. Running past the cleric guild there is a little touchy, however. It's not difficult to use Freeport when KOS either, but as it happens I fixed major Freeport factions. <br>
<br>
<b>CoreShadowcast</b><br>
<br>
r.e. someone mentioned banking in rivervale while still KOS - unless it's been changed, I'm not sure I would recommend it; I'm warmly to the guards there (farming Runnyeye ), but the rogue guildmaster (hope it was him - hate to think of random_rogue_npc01 hitting that hard) has a huge agro radius (unless I was just unlucky and someone had moved him from his usual spot). He double hits 300+ (I think I got doubled for 260+ and 350+ before I FD). Fortunately he came at me from the front, I doubt I'd have survived a backstab - my finely honed "if-you're-hit-when-you're-not-expecting-it-hit-FD" reflexs saved me.<br>
<br>
He aggrod on me from where the zone tunnel widens.<br>

<b>Antira Donnerfaust </b><br>
<br>
Hi all, this is a guide i wrote for Dojo but i guess it will be as useful here <br>
<br>
i am too lazy to write it all again so copy and paste hehe. Maybe you got a few ideas how to do this as a monk cos i did it with a shaman (who couldn't sneak and such )<br>
<br>
So here it goes:<br>
<br>
-------------Iksar Faction in Freeport<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hi all,<br>
<br>
this is what i did with my Twinksar Shaman to walk in FP relativly free:<br>
<br>
1. Kill Orcs, kill many orcs until u can't walk anymore cos u got so many Deathfist Belts.<br>
<br>
killing Orcs builds Faction with Knights of Truth (NFP guards) Ashen Order, Commonsresidents and a few other.<br>
<br>
2. Now go for Quests (take an order u like, this is what i did)<br>
<br>
- Get/Buy yourself wolfform of a 39+ Druid, this will raise faction to Freeport Militia Guards (EFP + WFP) from Threat to Apprehens. then walk through gate and hand in all the DF Belts u collected. (i handed in 3 Backpacks of them and after that as an iksar i was dubious to the guards, so they didn't attack anymore)<br>
<br>
- Do the Rogue Quest in East FP many times:<br>
<br>
Nestral T`Gaza (female Darkelf), who is in the tunnels (when u are facing the sea on docks its down in the right building near Docks), has need of a helper. She wants you to take a note to Rebby. Rebby is located in West Freeport next to the Theater of the Tranquil and the Monk Guild. You will get Rebby's rat wiskers from Rebby, which you can deliver back to T'Gaza for experience, faction and some money. <br>
Do the first part of the Quest with a mule (i created a lvl 1 human rogue), ask Nestral 'who rebby' and u get a note. Then run to Rebby, give him the note and head back to Nestral, and repeat OFTEN. When u got enough wiskers hand them to your iksar.<br>
<br>
i handed 40 wiskers to my iksar and then got wolfform again (you need to be indiff to do the quest, iksars are dubious from beginning to Rogue, SK and Necros, so as a Monk u just hit Sneak [oh how i missed this skill hehe] and hand her the wiskers in).<br>
<br>
You will only get positive faction hits which are:<br>
Carson McCabe<br>
Coalition of Trade Folk<br>
Coalition of Tradefolk III<br>
Corrupt Qeynos Guards<br>
Freeport Militia<br>
<br>
- Do the Orc Pic Quest a few times<br>
<br>
In East Freeport go into Hallard's Resales (located in the "bad" part of E Freeport behind the import store) and talk to Tohsan Hallard. He will tell you about his special deal: bring him 4 orc pawn picks (dropped by those pesky Deathfist Pawns in West Freeport and the Commonlands) and he will give you some silver and a Highpass Hold Lottery Ticket. If u continue this will result in another quest, but cos we are only here for faction these are the (only) positive hits:<br>
<br>
Coalition of Trade Folk<br>
Coalition of Tradefolk III<br>
Knights of Truth<br>
Merchants of Qeynos<br>
<br>
if your faction is already high enough its fine, otherwise get wolfform again or for us monkeys hit sneak. i handed in maybe 3 or 4 backpacks of the pics too (just to be sure hehe). Be careful u will be overweight VERY fast by these pics, i was so overweight i could only walk V E R Y slowly with a sow on (without sow i couldn't move a step *grins*) at 249/79 weight So either go doing the quest when u still can walk or get yourself a sow <br>
<br>
After doing all these quests i am now dubious to both Guards (East/West FP and North FP) and amiable to vendors (yay, finally again i can buy and sell hehe).<br>
<br>
But i am still avoiding all other guilds, still KoS there (only can go to monk guild 'cos of killing hundrets of orcs) once i took my normal path i am doing with my human monk and came too near to casters guild... BAM... uh only half bubble left (300hp then total), crouching away to safety BAM... LOADING PLEASE WAIT... <br>

---EDIT---<br>
Oh forgot something hehe. I think to train in the Monk Guild and get quests also hit sneak and maybe do the white sash quest over and over until u hit amiable with Monk GMs (sorry got no Iksar Monk so i didn't do that part, but i guess others can complete the advice here)<br>
----------<br>
<br>
So good luck all you Iksar Monkies, it takes some work (or cash) and time to become non kos in FP but i think it's worth it <br>

<br>
That is more work than necessary, IMHO.<br>
<br>
I killed Orcs until faction maxed out. Then I turned in 45belts (more than necessary) to get my militia faction up. Just that was enough to make me NON-Kos to vendors, Militia, and most of North Freeport. I have to stay away from the casters guild, clerics, and warriors, but they are all easily avoidable. I sneak behind the monk and merchants to train and sell, and I can bank in North FP... thats all I need or want.<br>
<br>
And, when I did the quest about a month or two ago, wolf form did help me get to dubious or apprehensive.<br>
<br>
On a side note, Rivervale is even easier. Turn in 400bandages to a guy in misty thicket and you're all good except for the cleric guild. <br>

Read a post on Harbinger's yesterday about bard faction. Inside the bar before the arches when coming into East Freeport from North Ro, there's a bard named Fabian. Give him 1 plat and he gives you these faction changes:<br>
<br>
Better with League of Antonican Bards<br>
Better with Qeynos Guards<br>
Better with Knights of Truth (North Freeport Paladins)<br>
Worse with Mayong Mistmoore (who cares)<br>
Worse with Ring of Scale (dragons)<br>
<br>
You will be KOS when you start so you need to be high enough level that he won't attack you when you sneak behind him to turn in the plat. You also need to be at least dubious with the Freeport militia, there are at least 2 of them in the bar with him. Gaining wolf form may also work to get you indifferent and past the guards, I don't know. <br>
<br>
The Harbinger poster indicated he gave 250 plat to be not KoS. I turned in 75 plat last night and am still threateningly, but at level 40 he won't attack. I plan on checking every 25 plat after I make it to 101 to find out what the minimum number is to turn in. Should make getting in and out of High Keep a bit easier.<br>
<br>
<b>Nollid Dagunny</b><br>
<br>
BARDS -- Went back and checked my logs. I started out scowling and was at threatening after giving 75 plat to Fabian. Gave him another 51 plat last night and I'm still at threatening. Even though he's very low green to me, I was right behind him when I turned off sneak to check. <br>

With 3 or 4 militia men in room, that got my heart racing. Fortunately they didn't assist.<br>
<br>
I now have 628 dead orcs to my credit and still dubious to the monks. After I hit 700, I'm going to try wolf form to see if that gets me amiable to do the white headband.<br>
<br>
<b>Glayde</b><br>
<br>
Hey, just wanted to let you know how i managed to get non-kos.<br>
<br>
First, i did the two rogue messenger quests about 50 times each. I used my 2nd computer with a mule character (level 4 enchanter with gate spell) to do the running for me.<br>
<br>
He would hand the note and whiskers back to me upon returning to the rogue guild, and i would turn them in.<br>
I did have to use sneak to be able to do the quest initially.<br>
<br>
After about 50 of each quest, i was warmly with the rogues, and merchants in Freeport.<br>
I was dubious to the Freeport militia (yay!).<br>
<br>
Now that i could actually travel in West/East Freeport, my next goal was North Freeport to bank.<br>
I spent a few hours killing deathfist orcs in east and west commons.<br>
<br>
(I was lucky to get a camp to myself, but if there are newbies killing there, you don't want to take all the orcs. -- This is how you can avoid that. Some people suggest using thrown weapons, but you can run out of them very fast. I did this. You take faction hits for using Disarm. I would just go up and attempt to disarm every single orc while people killed it. I got faction hits for every one. If you need a faster refresh time, combine the Disarm skill with the weak attack, kick. That won't steal a kill either.)<br>
<br>
After about 4 hours of this, i checked monks and paladins, threatening, and scowl ready to attack. Some progress but not alot, this was going to take forever.<br>
<br>
So i decided to take a break and hit the Fabian coin faction dispenser in East Freeport. (This was primarily for bard faction i had read.)<br>
<br>
When i did it the first time i noticed that it also gave Knights of Truth(paladin) faction. <br>
<br>
So i figured why the heck was i spending hours and hours and hours at orc camps trying to get paladin faction, when i could just sit here and buy my faction?<br>
Contrary to many posts that it costs 1pp per faction change, you can use 2gp, which is ALOT cheaper.<br>
<br>
I turned in aprox 900 gp, to go to amiable with bards, and dubious with paladins. I turned in another 400 to go to warmly with bards, but was still dubious with paladins, i might go back and turn some more in and get a buffer with paladins later.<br>
<br>
This does lower ring of scale, so I might have to go raise that in mistmoore, because i believe gorenaire in the dreadlands might not like me now.<br>
<br>
This took about an hour total, which is alot faster then i expected to be able to bank in north freeport.<br>
<br>
A word of warning to all.<br>
<br>
Whenever you zone into a zone, from entering the game, or gating back to your bindpoint (using "Superior Feign Death"), your faction adjustments are the last thing loaded by the game. Unfortunately the way this works, monsters don't see your faction for an instant and if one is right there, you can be attacked.<br>
<br>
So when you do bind in these zones or camp, where you have fixed your faction, do it away from alot of high level NPC's who might attack you, and better yet, near a zone.<br>
<br>
I'm currently genociding goblins in WW right now so i can bank in FV, then i'll head back to the mainland and do the bandage quest for rivervale, and maybe some more rogue messenger quests and Fabian faction vendor machine to raise paladin and militia some more.<br>

It took me about 160 whiskers to get dubious to the guards. Also dont forget to turn them not more than 4 at a time, and you need sneak or wolf form (can't confirm if wolf form works) in the beginning until you are not dubious to the rogues anymore, wich is prety fast.<br>
<br>
I am warmly to merchants and rogue, dubious to guards.<br>
<br>
I am dubious to the monks and still kos to the pallys. Ill have to kill more orcs. and I think I will try the pick quest. <br>
<br>
<b>Lizzik</b><br>
<br>
Once I got to dubious with the Ashen order, I was able to get wolf form and be considered indifferent. I did the white sash quest about 50 times and went from dubious while in true form to Kindly in true form. It also helped the good guards in NFP as well. This will require decent faction with the militia, about 4 stacks of deathfist pawn scalps (can often be bought at merchants near the newbie areas or directly off newbies cheep). Then about two stacks of bone chips and snake fangs (off newbie snakes). Hand in one snake fang, one bone chip and two unstacked scalps to the guild master for faction and a white sash. You will need wolf form and possibly sneak. You MUST be dubious or higher in true form with Ashen Order to get faction even when in wolf form or sneaking. <br>

I've been non-KoS in Freeport for a while now. Still working on that @#$% CorruptQeynosGuard stuff. Between Freeport rogue quests, gnoll and orc scalps (High Pass), and goblin ears (High Keep) I've got 402 faction changes with CQG. I've moved from scowling to threatening, but still have a bit more to go. I've already got all the pieces for the purple headband, it's a matter of getting into the city. I did make 2 bubbles of exp while soloing the raider room getting goblin ears. I also plan on giving some bone chips and gold to Lashun in North Qeynos after I get the headband. That will give me some cleric factions and only lower bloodsabres (Qeynos necros).<br>

<br>
Ok, I am not sure how NOT to be KOS because I am KOS with everyone but Mayong Mistmoore (Shout out to ya babe!); but I CAN tell you how to get KOS with em all, even if you don't start out that way.<br>
<br>
1) QEYNOS<br>
All in Qeynos Hills<br>
Kill Holly Windstalker -- not only FUN, but all the newbies LOVE you for it!<br>
Kill Konem Matse -- not as easy as Holly, but just as satisfying; AND he drops blue headbands! woohooo!<br>
Kill the weaker green guards in the Hills -- again; very satisfying if you have ever been bludgeoned by their uber-counterparts in Qeynos proper.<br>
AND everybody's favorites....Boabob and his incestuous sister!! Killing these two ought to be thought of as a public service.<br>
<br>
Do them in any order as often as you want and watch that faction just FALL FALL FALL!!<br>
<br>
2) FREEPORT<br>
All in Freeport proper<br>
Now freeport is an altogether different animal than Qeynos, and therefor; it requires a little different (but more fun cause its more evil) strategy. For FP faction I kill RIGHT INSIDE THE CITY!! This fulfills the evil part of it that makes it all so satisfying. FP has about 24 NPC's that roam around in the back alleys and hidden corners within buildings. ANY of these are fair game. And the beauty of it is that ALL of them result in bad faction hits for you! (DING DING DING!! BONUS ROUND!!!). If I had to list them all your eyes would tire before my list ran out. Just PICK one and stay with it. If I had to name a favorite, I would pick the Seafarer's Roost cause you can get to it from the boats without seeing any guards. That is in East Freeport (DO NOT try this in west freeport, cause any fool other than me that wanders blindly by the Militia House on their way in from EC can bring out every guard in the place (seen it and it was WONDERFUL!). Likewise I try to stay out of North Freeport also, you have to go thru WFP to get there and it can be downright discouraging some times hehehe.<br>
<br>
<b>Sepuku Corpse</b> <br>
<br>
Took me 33 Damaged Militia helms to get from scowling to Aimable with the NFP Paladins and dubious with the Clerics. Just need Wolf Form to turn in the helms, after that your good to go. It goes very fast too. I had a couple friends helping me, 60 Bard, 59 Pally, 53 Necro *when he wasn't LD, hehe* and myself, I was only 20, but still got some good whacks in. =P After about 90 mins i had turned in all my helms and was free to roam in NFP (as long as i stayed away from the bards guild). Granted not all people have the help of high level friends, but even with a group in there high 30's low 40's its do able<br>
<br>
Of course I am VERY kos in WFP/EFP but don't really care as I have been kos to them with most of my chars I have played, so I'm used to it. =P<br>
<br>
*NOTE*<br>
<br>
The reason it's so important to me to be NON KOS in NFP is that on my server that's where the market place is. <br>
<br>
<b>Xsidis</b><br>

Just a quick question...<br>
<br>
Who exactly do u turn the helms into? I currently have 20+ helms and i am looking forward to a new banking service Also, if u could provide the name of the quest, i would be most grateful.<br>
<br>
Thanx for your help! <br>

<b>Nollid Dagunny</b><br>

Shatterbone, In true form you were amiable and could do the quests but were indifferent in wolf form. Have you killed many orcs in the commons? I reached the point that I was indifferent in Iksar form from tagging orcs. I couldn't get the quest at indifferent. I then got wolf form and was at amiable. After 40 or 50 white sash quests I became amiable in my true form and was able to get the rest of the sashes through red with scales instead of fur.<br>
<br>
My understanding is that wolf form removes the racial component from the faction tables. That leaves religion and any other changes you've done. Assume following:<br>
Halfling - humanoid, the humans like you, they really like you<br>
Religion - good ones only, the humans are okay with that<br>
Kills/Quests - don't do any they've got nothing to base like or dislike on.<br>
<br>
Take out race and all you have left is religion and changes you've made. Leaves you at indifferent.<br>
<br>
Iksar - Humans don't like lizards. Jealous of tail or something <br>
Religion - Cazic-Thule - followers are ruled by fear. Not good but not as bad as Bertoxx. <br>
Kills/Quest - Killed 800 or so of their enemies (orcs). They like me, I'm on their side.<br>
Take out race and I'm so-so on religion and they love me for helping kill their enemies.<br>
<br>
That may be why wolf-form worked for me after playing with the orcs and it didn't for you (assuming you haven't killed many).<br>
<br>
<b>Nymble120</b><br>

Nollid Dagunny,<br>
<br>
Im sure you're right.. My druid didnt do too many orcs in EC. Hehe.. must be my druids furry feet that pushed him up to amiable.. <br>
<br>
My monk is currently at level 18, but there is still TONS of thing to do and places to see in kunark so I will probably be here for a while. <br>
<br>
I've finally became Non-Kos in all freeport zones!!.. I am dub to most (Including guards in RV) and Amiable to bards . (cost me about 800 gps.)<br>
<br>
Only problem I have is the Ashen Order.. Ive gotten in excess of 1082 positive faction hits with the ashenorder and am still Threatenly.. Ive gotten a wolf form and was only raised up to Dub. And was unable to do the white sash quest. Ive even tried getting an invis, sneaking behind the quest giver and tried to do the quest.. No luck.<br>
<br>
Is there any other quests to raise faction with the Ashen Order? Or should I just continue to tag orcs till I reach dub?<br>
<br>
<b>Rukzak </b><br>
<br>
Why do you even bother working on East and West Freeport Faction? All you need is the Paladins to like you so you can bank. If your guild can't kill Zephyl, they probably won't be able to get the rest of the quest anyway. If you have a high conscience as an Iksar, and won't even use a brand new human monk to do the headband and sash quests, I feel pity for you because you're wasting time. <br>
<br>
<b>guice666</b> <br>
<br>
I don't know about you, but I raised my faction for the sole purpose so that I can train there. I was only lvl8 when I left Kunark, so I had many skills that I still needed to train.<br>
<br>
Now I'm Kindly to all of the monks there. I'm so high I might be able to pull the monks one at a time when I need to kill them later on ( I herd a trick that would allow one to pull any spawns one at a time, faction is a required factor though ).<br>
<br>
The trick is once I got a high amiable ( while in wolf form ), i did the white sash quest like 40 times, and I still run it to this day for fun. It also raises your Qeynos monk faction, so more is better here. <br>
<br>
<b>Balthenor</b><br>
<br>
One thing that was passingly mentioned above, but that I would like to stress here is:<br>
<br>
Don't bother mindlessly slaughtering Mobs that lowbies are xp'ing on. Just run by and give them a Kick(level 1). This will put you in on the faction change when it dies and leave all the super green spawns to the people that can benefit from them. Even better if you announce to the zone what you're up to so no one gets the wrong idea. <br>

Tumpy Tonics!<br>
<br>
If you have a druid friend (or a druid alt who can port to BB and WC) then just have them make a backpack of tumpy tonics. You take the tonics into the bar near the EFP docks (helps to have someone invis you first, if the Ogre is spawned in the bar) and wait for Groflah to spawn. If you are impatient, kill Tykar Renlin when he spawns (barbarian placeholder for Groflah) and within 3 game hours, Groflah will spawn.<br>
<br>
The key to this whole quest is you can stand behind the wall near where Groflah spawns, and use the 3rd person camera to see Groflah's spawn point. While behind the wall, hand the tonics 4 at a time to Groflah, and voila instant faction with Knights of Truth, and numerable other factions... best of all, no negatives. No hours of killing orcs, no shelling out for belts. It takes maybe half an hour to get a backpack of tonics, and costs probably 50p at most.<br>
<br>
[edit] here's the details of doing this (figured after posting it would be helpful)<br>
<br>
Druid binds on Sister Island in OOT. Have 8 backpacks (8slot is fine, 10slot would be far better). Fill up one backpack with stacks of water flasks, fill up the rest with kiola nuts. Now just port to Butcherblock, run to Kaladim, and hand in 1 kiola nut and 1 water flask to Tumpy Irontoe over and over again till you're out of Kiola nuts.<br>
<br>
Gate back to Sister Island and fill up on more Kiola nuts. Rinse and repeat until you have a full backpack of tonics (they are stackable).<br>
<br>
Get the backpack to your iksar and get him into the bar in EFP (once again, invis is best, but if you know that the Ogre, Female Barbarian, Bard, Troll, Tykar, Groflah, and Sir Edwin Motte aren't up, then you might be fine uninvis... of course, you could always feign flop I guess).<br>
<br>
Open the door to the bar, make a left down the entrance hall, make a right to the front of the bar, make a left into the common room, make a left to get into the hallway heading upstairs, and just hang out back there. Switch to 3rd person view so you can see the spawnpoint nearest to you (Groflah/Tykar/some DE chick/Sir Edwin). If Tykar spawns, you can kill him, but I'm not sure how the other patrons will respond to this (I had a high level Barbarian Shaman wax him for me) and 3 game hours later, Groflah spawned. While still behind the wall, hand him Tumpy Tonics 4 at a time... instant easy faction. <br>
<br>
<b>Rigor M</b><br>
<br>
Assuming you want to be able to bank on Antonica, in Freeport:<br>
<br>
Slaughter orcs in the Commonlands untill your faction is good enough to waltz into N. FP through the tunnels, to the bank (be careful, though, the guilds still won't like you). Then, sell the one hundred or so Deathfist belts you've accumulated to suckers trying to do the belt quest for 3-5 plat each. Take a trip to visit your new buddy, the NFP banker, and deposit your easily earned 500 plat.<br>
<br>
Takes some patience, but it's easy faction, and easy money.<br>

As of July 11th, on the Ayonae Ro server, wolfform NO LONGER makes you non-kos to the EFP/WFP Guards. Read your guide here and was planning on getting my shaman non-kos and I was beat down by the gate guards and almost died. So, Verant must have noticed and swung the nerf bat hard.<br>

1. I killed/tagged +700 orcs in East Commons, I held on to about 30 Deatfist Belts and 160 Deathfist Scalps.<br>
2. I got wolffrom from a friendly druid, and I found Captain Hazran on his balcony and gave him belts until my faction with him was Amiably (without wolfform I was then Dubiously)<br>
<br>
Now I can walk and talk in most of East and West Freeport.<br>
<br>
3. I got a new wolfform and went over to Velan Torresk in the monk guild and did the White Sash 80 times (1 bone chip, 1 snake fang and 2 unstacked deathfist scalps)...<br>
<br>
Now you should be able to walk and talk in North Freeport as well... and bank...<br>
<br>
Remember, stay away from these guilds, Casters and Warriors in West Freeport, Cleric and Bard in North Freeport... Be aware that there are others that want to kill you as the peasant woman outside the Monk guild and the gnome in the Jewelry shop in North Freeport...<br>
<br>
To improve some other factions I will:<br>
4. Give 4 and 4 orc picks to Tohsan Hallard in the Hallard's Resales.<br>
5. Give 2 gold coins to Fabian in the bar close to the South Gate of Freeport.<br>
<br>

Your faction standing with DeathFistOrcs got worse.<br>
Your faction standing with KnightsofTruth got better.<br>
Your faction standing with GuardiansoftheVale got better.<br>

Your faction standing with TheFreeportMilitia got better.<br>
Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradeFolkIll got better.<br>

<br>
Step 3:<br>
Your faction standing with AshenOrder got better.<br>
Your faction standing with KnightsofTruth got better.<br>
Your faction standing with SilentFistClan got better.<br>

Step 4:<br>
Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradefolk got better.<br>
Your faction standing with KnightsofTruth got better.<br>
Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos got better.<br>
Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradeFolkIll got better.<br>

Your faction standing with KnightsofTruth got better.<br>
Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<br>
Your faction standing with RingofScale got worse.<br>
Your faction standing with MayongMistmoore got worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
Who is who, factionlist:<br>
Ashen Order is Freeport monks<br>
Silent Fist Clan is Qeynos monks<br>
<br>
Knights of Truth - Paladin Guild and all Guards in North Freeport<br>
The Freeport Militia - Guards in East and West Freeport <br>

The ONLY way to fix Militia faction once you killed it ( ie - Did Sir Lucan? ) is by running the ear and scalp quests in Highhold Pass/keep about 100+ times.<br>
Sir Lucan gives a MASSIVE ( and I mean MASSIVE ) negative faction to the Miltia and its extreamly difficult to raise it again. <br>

There's an NPC that I like in WC named Mojax Hilkspin, who is fishing at the lake with a buddy. Get a wolfform and hand in an assload of milks to him.... it raises knights of truth, steel warriors, and a few others I think, but drops FP militia faction... I find I like this quest since milk is cheap and i dont care about militia faction as I can just use the sewers to get to nfp.<br>
<br>
edit: milk for mojax faction adjustments:<br>
+ Knights of Truth<br>
- FP Militia <br>
+ Steel Warriors<br>
+ Priests of Marr<br>
- Dismal Rage (WTF is that anyway? =P) <br>

Cation, Militia faction isn't important anymore once you have completed all your sash quests and have recieved all your monk skills.<br>
Unless of course you like training all the the Freeport Militia on your run to the Monk's guild <br>

Actually, Sithr, you can do a quest in Erudin that will repair your faction with the militia. It involves Slansin in the lower level of the erudin palace and one of the casters on the upper floors. I cant remember the details, but you basically hail slansin and say a key phrase, then he gives you an item, then you turn in the item to the caster. Works wonders to have the phrase hotkeyed. Its even better to hit slansin with a star and pull him up to next to the caster fellow. Then you can spam the phrase and turn in without moving an inch.<br>
<br>
I think I logged the spam and said the phrase around 1500 times and repaired my faction to non kos with the militia after killing Sir Lucan.<br>
<br>
Of course, this might be difficult for the more scaily among us if you have faction issues in Erudin.<br>

.. you're talking to an Iksar that's nonKoS to the bardic ones too! <br>
<br>
The bard in the inn/tavern thingy place in efp just owns. I have a bard on another account. Took him with me to the inn. Had him play invis song. Once it ticked, I got behind the bard guy and FD'd Sneak'd. Then, got up and just game him 1 plat at a time.<br>
Now me ist apprehensive to the bardic council, unt never have to vorry about them again. Oh, and I just love the irony of a lizard running the bard letter quest <br>
<br>
PS: It's best to have milita faction up first, too. There are two guards in the inn to the bard's left. The guards are against the wall, facing each other, thus, one is always facing the bard, thus, sneak doesn't work on him. <br>

Going to Qeynos to fix the Highpass Faction...<br>
<br>
Get some newbee (or an alt) so go down into the Rogue guild in North Qeynos, and find Knargon Lanenda, ask him: what shipment (if he doesnt give you anything, you might have to do the whole chat: hail, who is the courier, what is the shipment, what courier and fianly what shipment). He will give you "an Old Bent Card" that is not LORE and not NO DROP, so fill up a few bags and head over to newbeearea and find the Darkelf Jracol Breatiage, give him 4 and 4 cards and you will get a note (just drop/destroy it, it gives bad faction to return it)... Faction adjustments for the first part is:<br>
<br>
CarsonMcCabe got better.<br>
CoalitionofTradeFolkIll got better.<br>
HighpassGuards got better.<br>
MerchantsofHighpass got better.<br>
<br>
RingofScale got worse.<br>
<br>
Enjoy... <br>

Highpass and Qeynos factions<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Fix Highpass faction by killing Karana Bandits. This also raises Circle of Unseen Hands (Qeynos Rogues), Qeynos Guards (non-Corrupt), and Karanas Residents (unsure -- probably the various merchants in the Karanas, and the Guards at the Human villages in EK). You can also kill Mucktail Gnolls (EK and HH) and Shralock Orcs.<br>
<br>
By the way, once you can get to "amiably" with the Silent Fist monks in North Qeynos, it's very easy to get to maximum faction with them by buying up a few stacks of Gnoll Pup Scalps from the newbie area vendors and handing in 4x4 to Phin Esrinap. This also raises Qeynos Guards and Ashen Order factions.<br>
<br>
Once you have gotten Circle of Unseen Hands to Amiable, you can then push THAT to the maximum faction by saying over and over to Hans Kriegor (the head of the Guild and thus probably leading to the pun, "Circle of Unseen Hans"), "carson has a mole in the highpass guards".<br>

Ok, I've tried everything to start doing step #3 for the Ashen faction. Dub in wolf and sneak to be indifferent. Is there a minimum + faction above that needs to be attained?<br>
<br>
He states that he won't help the likes of me etc and gives a negative response after asking about the sash. He however does respond to the initial Hail.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any help. I would love to be able to train up all those extra points(without going back to Cailis each time) to cut down time for ID. <br>

Yup, no jive I'm affraid.<br>
<br>
After mining down through TONS of posts on this and two other boards. I found two posts where the folks said similar things and that they needed to get out of threatening in trueform before it'd work for them (even though wolf put them well above it). I've been threatening for the last 100 or so dead orcs so I should be on my way outta that faction hole.<br>
<br>
Will try soon as I get out and post a confirmation. Thanks for the great guide btw Hizzy. <br>

I am now dubious to the Ashen Order and Warmly to the Militia in true form.<br>
<br>
Can't get the quest.<br>
<br>
Sneaking and wolf forming, still cannot get the quest. Wolf form only brings me to indifferent now regardless of where I stand and whether or not I sneak. I actually tried a full stack or 10 times to quest as well as tried to get past the last text string with no avail and no matter how many time I moved and snuck etc.<br>
<br>
Guessing there has been a change to minimum faction to do the sash. If anyone has done it at less than dubious(recently), please let me know how ya did it.<br>
<br>
Still killing orcs... it's become an obsession now. =p <br>

This is about Gnoll Pup scalps for the Qeynos White Headband: yes, exactly as stated, 4 stacks of 4 scalps. Less than 1 backpack full to go from "amiable in wolf-form" to reach "Your faction standing with Silent Fist Clan could not possibly get any better". <br>

Sorry about the confusion... Blame it on me... hehe... I am from Norway so English isnt my native language...<br>
<br>
Anyway... When I said 4 and 4, I meant give him 4 picks (or cards) hit TRADE and do it again... Picks and Cards are unstackalbe so you wouldnt be able to give more than 4 anyway...<br>
<br>
4x4 (4 times 4=16)... So here you can give 4 stacks of 4 pelts in 1 TRADE... Woohoo... Makes the exp/faction work go alot easier...<br>
<br>
Hope this clears it... <br>

Or... If ya don't care about Militia faction and just want to bank Go knock off the two guards in WC at the booth.. Actually great exp from 39-42 and easily doable with a fungi tunic. By the time you hit 42 all faction has been maxed = ally with knights of truth and very KoS to militia.. Grab a sow and haul ass to NFP <br>

Rogue note quest in FP<br>
Good way to get better faction in FP with militia, and nFP guards, merchants, rogue guild and one more faction is to do the not quest in the rogue guild. Rogue guild is located under the docks in eFP.<br>
Sneak and talk to the dark elf lady in the rogue guild and get a note, then you also talk to the dwarf and his friend in the rogue guild and get another note. Take these notes to the two rogues at the theathre of tranquil (outside the monk guild).<br>
You get a whisker and a note back which you turn back two the dark elf and the dwarf and get good factions.<br>
<br>
I did the quest for 30 mins or an hour and I can go to bank now and I am even kindly to the merchants now.<br>
<br>
If you are KoS in FP have a mule or pay a newbie to do the first part of the quest, the whiskers are stackable while the note might be lore. I did the quest in the beginning with my druid since it went faster with SoW and gate. <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Just so you all know the Sash and Headband quests have always required more then indifferent faction to do them. There were many questions by young monks back in the day that forgot to hand in their newbie note and could not do the Sash quest in Freeport. There were even cases of players not able to do the quests after handing in the note. You need just above minimum amiable to do the Sash and Headband quests.<br>

Reply | Edit | Del All Iksar's guide to getting North Freeport Faction<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Since Zad is such a great guy I figured I should contribute something to his new site <br>
<br>
Here is how I got faction for CoalitionofTradefolk, KnightsOfTruth, MerchantsOfQeynos, and CoalitionofTradeFolkIII doing the Tonics for Groflah Steadirt quest. You will have to use a secondary character to make about 60 tumpy tonics and give them to Groflah Steadirt in the Seafarers Roost in E Freeport.<br>
<br>
1.) Log on a goodly character that has good faction with Freeport, Sister in OOT, and Kaladim (I would suggest making a newbie human in freeport if you dont have a druid or wizard that can port). <br>
2.) Pickup 8 empty bags, about 60 water, and a bunch of platinum<br>
3.) Travel on the boat to the sister island and fill all the bags with kiola nuts(they dont stack)<br>
4.) Take nuts to Tumpy in Kaladim and do his quest to make Tumpy Tonics(hand him one nut and one flask of water at a time). <br>
5.) If you didnt have enough room, repeat this till you have about 60 to 100 tonics. <br>
6.) Give tonics and a couple invis potions to your iksar<br>
7.) Take invisible monk to SeaFarer's Roost in E Freeport.<br>
8.) Wait for Groflah to spawn, sneak behind him and hand in the tonics 4 at a time(be careful of other tavern residents since you will most likely to be KoS to them).<br>
<br>
I dont remember exactly how many Tonics I turned in but I am now warmly to the paladins in north freeport. You may have to wait a LONG time for Groflah to spawn, he has 3 placeholds that could spawn in his place. <br>
<br>
His place holders can be Sir Edwin Mott, a darkelf, or a barbarian all at the same spot near the stairs. He or his placeholder despawns once or twice every 24 game hours. You can kill the place holder but you lose alot of good factions. I had to wait several RL hours before he spawned(even after killing placeholders a few times). <br>

If you want to save yourself the hassle of getting the Trumpy Tonic, just buy a crapload of Brandy and hand it over to him. Did this with my DE Chanter back when I was doing th Solu Ro quest with him. Had to raise faction with merchants to do the quest and it took about 60 Brandy to go from KoS to indif, this also includes the other faction's listed above. Hope this helps. <br>

You can also enlist the help of a character that has invis. Invis, walk behind, hand the first brandy, have the buddy invis as soon as you become visible, fill the rest of the slots in the trade window, give, rinse, & repeat.<br>

 I don't know how to raise faction with her so just stay away....far away. As you zone out of WFP into EC there a few huts and then the desert stops and the grass starts. In one of these huts, sort of on the left, resides Rinna Lightshadow. She's the cleric guild leader for FP. If you're going to FP to bank or whatever, even if you're not kos to the guards, you're kos to her. Usually she's happy sitting in her little hut knitting or whatever she does but every now and then she's playing hopscotch on the roof of her hut for some reason (crazy clerics). If she's in the roof and you run by the hut not only will your bones become some necromancer's pet but you'll also have a very difficult time getting your corpse out of her aggro radius, without someone else's help. The bottom line is: stay away from her hut. She hits in the 400's weaponless and she's a friggin cleric. <br>

If you have fixed your factions with the emerald warriors, go see Regren, the warrior guildmaster. <br>
<br>
Turn in one of each: <br>
ruined wolf pelt<br>
bat fur<br>
bone chip<br>
spiderling eye...<br>
<br>
...for a faction hit. I did it 269 times so far and I am still at threatening. expect it to be some long work.<br>
<br>
Bat furs are found on a merchant in EC, the gypsie in the inn near the zone to WC. Ruined wolf pelts and spiderling eyes usually flood the Neriak and EC merchants. Bonechips are everywhere.<br>
<br>
This is annoyingly long, as the eyes don't stack. I suggest using a porter alt to fetch the items in the commonlands and bring them back to your char.  <p><center>

<br>
Merchants are never scowling, true, but it is because the characters are set up like that.  If your faction is at its lowest, merchants will be dubious.<br>
<br>
But if characters that are not merchants are on the same factions as a merchant, he will scowl.<br>
<br>
For example, merchants inside a guild house are usually on the same faction as the guild itself.  and while the guild is scowling, the merchants will be dubious.  when the guild is dubious, the merchants will be dubious, and when the guild is ally, the merchants will be ally.<br>
<br>
An easy way to verify this is to check your faction with the merchant inside the emerald warrior's guildhouse.  he will be at the same faction as Regren, and not the other merchants.<br>
<br>
now if the banker was on rogues faction, and not merchants, how come it has raised to treatening with my faction work?<br>
<br>
the faction increased are the following:<br>
<br>
Emerald warriors,<br>
Kelethin merchants<br>
Felwhite merchants.<br>
<br>
I suppose this will fix the felwhite bankers as well, although I haven't ventured in the city yet and I do not know of their faction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lolandary>Lolandary</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/7/02 3:35:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> CQG Faction</span><hr size=1> There's another way to build faction with the Corrupt Qeynos Guards and that pesky Lt.

<br>
Kill &quot;good&quot; Queynos guards - the ones at &quot;tower 1&quot; in WK are a good set - until you're dubious with the Corrupt Guards. Take the short run south to &quot;tower 2&quot;, near the Barbarian fishing village, to check your faction, as these are Corrupt Guards. Then commit mass genocide of Gnolls in Blackburrow to regain faction with the goody two-shoes Qeynos guards, and use the fangs to become non-KoS in Halas, as explained in the guide. If you want, you can increase your CQG faction even more (without tanking any other factions) by doing the &quot;Arrow Crate - Evil Version&quot; quest in Qeynos. Once non-KoS (and dubious is definitely good enough) you can max out your CQG faction in less than a half-hour and actually get paid for it - by Lt. Dagarok, no less. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=anezka>Anezka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www3.sympatico.ca/pratte1/Icone.bmp" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 462<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/17/02 5:56:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Faction Guide</span><hr size=1> UPDATE<br>

To get dubious to HH guards and be able to bank in HHK, you do not need to endlessly kill orcs.  Killing Chief Gan'Shralok in the SW corner of Kithicor 25-30 times will get you to dubious.  He is a six minute spawn and is approximately 20th level.  The really nice thing is that he spawns right on the wall so you can continue to camp him throughout the EQ night with little worry of seeing any of the high level undead.  It took me about 5 hours total to get to dubious.  Just make sure you sneak past the bard near the HHP/HHK zone and you're golden.<br>

I've been fixing my faction lately and a faction that I haven't really seen anybody mention that I was particularly interested in fixing was Freeport/Qeynos Casters.  So far I've found a quick and cheap way to fix the Freeport guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Freeport Casters Guild - Arcane Scientists</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
First off head to East Commons to the Erudite spell component vendor near the West Commons zone.  From her buy two backpacks worth of &quot;Rat Ears&quot; for around 1 silver a piece if I remember right.<br>
<br>
Now grab yourself a port and invis to either North Karana or Surefall Glade.  Once you're on that side of the world head to Qeynos Hills to the small lake where you have so many different folks fishing.  The one you are looking for is named, Rephas.<br>
<br>
Rephas asks for &quot;<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>three rat ears</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->&quot; and in exchange he gives a LORE grilled rat ear which I think is for the Paw of Opolla quest.  Use Sneak and hand Rephas 4 stacks of 3 rat ears at a time for the following factions.<br>
<br>
Arcane Scientists and Knights of Truth get better<br>
Opal Dark Briar and the Freeport Militia get worse<br>
<br>
It took me around 200 rat ears to get maxed faction with the Arcane Scientists which is easily checked just by conning Rephas himself as he starts Ready to Attack and changes to Amiably by the time your done.<br>
<br>
Total Cost was around 20pp but that included port costs.  Total time was about 15 minutes.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3219 ">Chabisu</a><br>Disciple of Cazic-Thule<br>Prexus Server

it took me 8 stacks to get to dubious with them.  He was blue to me and scowling at first, but I was able to sneak behind him, and he did not turn around while I was handing him the ears.  <br>
<br>
Each single ear give a faction hit, and we can hand them in by stacks of 4.<br>
<br>
I got from apprehensive to amiable to the Knights.<br>
<br>
I cannot tell exactly how the quest affected the militia factions, sadly.  I had done the innert potion quest lately, which had raised my factions with them, but I did not check back with them before I tried the ear quest.<br>
<br>
I was dubious before the potion quest, and after the ear quest, I was indifferent.  I cannot say how high I got with the innert potion quest, so I cannot tell if this quest has great impact on that faction...<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm not sure how badly it affects Freeport Militia as I'm still currently KOS to them and planning on doing the Inert Potion quest after I fix my Qeynos caster faction (which I belive to have found a way also).  I'd recommend fixing the Arcane Scientists faction before you did the Inert Potion quest for somebody up and coming just incase the faction is a large hit.  At least then you'll not really notice as you're already going to be sitting awhile.<br>
<br>
As for Opal Darkbrier.  She is the guildmistress for the Freeport Necro guild if I remember correctly.  Not sure on a way to fix this faction without ruining all the surface Freeport factions but it isn't really a big deal as if you fix the others you don't have a reason to travel the tunnels under Freeport anymore.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The Qeynos Caster faction I think can be fixed by doing either of the quests linked below but I haven't done either yet so I'm not sure on how long it will take.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=502">eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=502</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> - Bat Fur<br>

<br>
Both have the following factions attached but again I'm not sure on the levels gained or lost.<br>
<br>
Order of the Three and Guards of Qeynos got Better<br>
Opal Darkbriar and Bloodsabers got Worse<br>
<br>
I'll be trying it out sooner or later, but if you wanted to try them out first there is the info I found.  Have fun and thanks again for all the time you've put into your guides so far.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3219 ">Chabisu</a><br>Disciple of Cazic-Thule<br>Prexus Server

<br>
Faction for Highpass groups, Circle of Unseen Hands, Corrupt Qeynos guards<br>
<br>
Talk to Knargon in the rogue guild in Qeynos.  Sneak behind him and ask 'What shipment?'  Each time he will give you a bent card (not lore unlike most courier quests) so you can load up.  Turn these cards into a dark elf named Jracol by the east wall in the newbie yard (he is on one of the highpass factions).  Each time you turn a card in you will get faction with all of the highpass factions.  (Also I believe Coalition Illegal).  You will get a negative hit with Ring of Scale.<br>
<br>
Take the notes he gives you and give them back to Knargon in the rogue guild.  You will take positive hits with Circle of Unseen Hands and Corrupt Qeynos Guards, and (small) negative hits with Qeynos Guards and Merchants (easily remedied by killing gnolls).  This can be done repeatedly, and gives good faction for both.  I went from dubious to both to Warmly with Circle of Unseen Hands, Amiable to Corrupt, and Ally to all Highpass and Highkeep factions.<br>
<br>
Of course if you are KOS to the Circle or to Corrupt you will have to get in.  I've been told there is a sewer entrance to the Rogue Guild but have yet to find it.  The best way I figured was to cross your claws and hope that the Lt. doesn't see you and sneak inside Crow's and take the trap floor to the bottom and enter the side room that Knargon enters with another rogue sometimes, get the cards, sneak out (past trainers no less.  Ouch!) then get the cards to the dark elf.  After a few turn ins you shouldn't have to worry about the guards or rogues any longer.<br>
<br>
Ancaglon also mentioned that you can build CoUH faction by giving the phrase to Hans, but I have yet to verify this information personally.<br>

About wolf form though, I don't really see a problem.  I've used wolf form successfully to fix faction in the area already instead of having to rely on invis.

<br>
I cringed back and closed my eyes, preparing myself for a huge nuke, but nothing happenned.<br>
<br>
She is a high elf, and she is dubious to me.  I don,t get how I could be dubious to her if I never raised that faction, only lowered.  I guess she must have been an iksar lover from the start...<br>
<br>
I'll parse my logs to see if I even uped my factiosn with her.. <p><center>
