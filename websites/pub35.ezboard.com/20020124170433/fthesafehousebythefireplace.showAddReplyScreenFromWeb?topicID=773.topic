 </font><br>
<font size=4 color=gold>Rumple and the Covered Coin<p><br>
</font>        <font size=3 color=gold face=Harrington></b><b>R</b></font>umple, the halfling, was as merry a little fellow as you could hope to meet in the quaint little town of Rivervale.   If one happened to saunter past the local tavern, the Fool's Gold, and hear the bellows of laughter overhead, most likely at the root of this happy hullabalu was Rumple.   He was a great maker of merriment when a Lendel's Grand Lager was in reach of his hand, and an audience in earshot of his words.  And never did a day pass in the town that Rumple didn't cause at least one patron of the Fool's Gold to part with a piece of platinum in a fool's wager that left the patron somehow chuckling heartily as he parted with his coin.<br>
        Thus, Rumple was well known as a trickster in Rivervale, and a pride of the Deeppockets family.   Though himself not a true Deeppockets, it was decided early in his youth that he had an aptitude more akin to their ways than to his family's own.   And as anyone knows, the halfling society is but one big family anyway, and so Rumple went to live with the Deeppockets so that his more natural talents could be properly cultivated.   And so now, as he sat at a barstool of the Fool's Gold, nursing a Lager and keeping the tavern's patronage quite lit, he was indeed the pride of both his own true mother, and the Deeppockets family as well.<br>
        The barkeep of the Fool's Gold was a ripe young fellow by the name of Kittlen, a fellow not much older than Rumple, who was as good a friend as a brother to that little prankster.   Even Kittlen, who had seen and heard enough of Rumple's tomfooleries to keep him laughing till the end of his days, was ever-amazed at the new tricks Rumple could come up with to amuse a crowd.   Just last week Kittlen had witnessed a Dwarf named Karg (who was not a stranger at the Fool's, and who was most certainly aware of what a trap-layer Rumple could be) fall prey to yet another of Rumple's "games."<br>
        "Look here, Karg.  I have a game for you, good sir!"  said Rumple to the red-bearded fellow to his left.<br>
        "Nay, I'll have none of <i>your</i> games, you little swaggler!" Karg replied with a laugh and a shake of his head.<br>
        "Well I'm not sure what a 'swaggler' is, Karg, but as for being little, I believe I have an inch on you.   Now look here, and don't be fooled..."   Rumple reached into a pocket and plucked out a perfectly round coin of pure platinum.  He held it up to the window-light so that it flashed a bit, and then tossed it on the bartop to his left, in front of Karg.   "Examine it.  I assume a man of your background can tell the real thing when you see it, yes?"<br>
        This was merely a ploy to secure the interest of old Karg, for Rumple knew that the Dwarf came from a prosperous lineage of miners.   Karg slipped into the trap without thought.   He picked it up, gave it a squint of the eye, pressed it between his teeth once or twice, and announced it's authenticity.<br>
        "Yes, this be pure platinum, through and through," said Karg,  and then, with a sudden look of awareness, "though I don't suspect its owner's motives in giving it a show be so pure..."<br>
        "Now, now, my Dwarven friend," Rumple responded with a smile.  "Why so suspicious?"<br>
        "Because the last time I was here--"<br>
        "Bah, don't live in the past!   Now watch closely."  Rumple took back the coin.   "Kittlen, bring me a stein would you?"  <br>
        Kittlen, who had been listening with some interest at the end of the bar, came over with a medium-sized silver stein.   He had no idea what to expect himself, for this seemed to be a new trick.<br>
         Rumple placed the coin on the wooden bartop.   Then he took the silver stein, and without any possible trick whatever, placed the stein over the coin so that the coin was secure and hidden underneath.   "There we are.   Karg, do you believe me when I say that the coin is under the stein, and on top of the bar, and that there is no way to remove the coin without lifting the stein?"<br>

 <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A> at: 9/27/01 7:09:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/21/01 1:13:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=773.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tales from the Vale - &quot;Rumple and the Covered Coin&quot</span><hr size=1>         Karg mulled it over.   In fact he could not help but consider this, as he was driven to wonder what was coming next.   Kittlen also considered it, and it seemed to both men that, so far at least, there could have been no trick.  There had been no sleight of hand, that was certain; they both had seen with their own eyes the stein slowly coming down over the coin.<br>
        "Aye, I agree to that," said Karg finally, with a perplexed frown.<br>
        "And would you agree that if I were to attempt to retreive the coin, I would need to lift the stein, or at least in some way touch it?"<br>
        "Aye," Karg said easily.   The suggestion seemed to simply follow from the last.  "There ain't no way around that, I think!"<br>
        "Then I propose a small wager - say, a plate of Bixie Crunchies and a round of Ol' Tujim's to wash it down?" Karg was a sucker for the hard stuff, Rumple knew, and Ol' Tujim's Fierce Brew was a temptation to be reckoned with on this account.<br>
        Karg, stroking his thick red beard, thought about the coin under the stein.   He tried to place himself in Rumple's shoes.  Could a napkin perhaps be slipped under the stien to retreive the coin?   No, the stein was too heavy, and the coin too thick.   Could Rumple have some magic with which to transport the coin?   No, that would be the same as cheating - Rumple was never known to cheat anyone outright, though one might accuse him of it in jest.  <br>
        But then a possibility occured to him, and Karg stood up out of his barstool, and said loudly, "right here on this bar is a coin under a mug.   I'm puttin' a bet up with Rumple that says he can't get that coin without liftin' up that stein.   This is between me and him, so I don't wants to be seein' no one else touching this here mug, got it?"   Karg gave a serious look to all of 5 patrons who were present.  "Is that going to be agreeable to you, Mr. Rumple?"   Karg's grin was smug.<br>
        Rumple appeared to think hard for a moment or two.   "Let me get this straight: this is between me and you, and no one else is to touch this Stein, yes?"<br>
        "Them's my conditions.   Also...leave out the bixie crunchies.   I knows you like 'em, but I got no use for 'em whatever.   How you folks can eat that muck is beyond me."<br>
        Rumple thought a moment more and said, "It's a deal."<br>
        Karg sat back in his chair, and waited for Rumple's "solution."<br>
        He didn't wait long, for in a moment Rumple's hand was under the bar, 3 full inches of wood below the stein.  <br>
        "What are ye..."   Karg trailed off, watching in consternation as Rumple's fingers seemed to be fumbling for something on the underside of the bar.  <br>
        Gradually there came a faint scratching sound...the sound of metal on wood.   The sound grew louder, until the sratching became a very odd, but very pronounced scraping sound.  Karg's eyebrows furrowed in disbelief as he watched the Halfling's wrist turn and twist, working at something under the bar.   He turned to the face of Rumple and saw that he wore the smile of a tradesman enjoying his craft.   Then, after the crescendo of metal on wood had grown to a frenzied scraping, it stopped.  Rumple's hand came out from under the bar, his fist closed.<br>
        Karg stared down at the fist in sheer consternation and anticipation.   Then, slowly, the fist began to open, and as it did Karg thought he caught a glimpse of silver between the knuckles, and he held back a gasp.   Then the fingers opened fully in a quick flash, and there it was: a perfectly round platinum coin.<br>
        Karg looked up in pure amazement at Rumple's face, which was simple and only faintly smiling.   Then Karg turned to the Stein, and the solution came to him in a flash.   Rumple had had two coins, and the one true coin still lay under the Stein.<br>
        "Ha!"<br>
        Karg jumped out of his seat and lifted the Stein.  There it was!   He had been right!   The coin was still there.   Karg beamed a smile of victory.<br>
        "Ah, poor Rumple, I'm sorry yer little trick didn't--"<br>
        Just then Rumple reached over and grabbed the coin off the bartop.   He tossed it in the air with a whimsical spin, caught it, and tucked both coins into his pocket so that they made a little clinking sound as they rattled against each other.  "'Ol Tujim's, Karg?   Or would ye maybe settle for a couple Pints of Grand Lager?   I prefer Grand Lager myself, and it is a wee bit cheaper."<br>
        "wha..."<br>
        "Throw in some bixie crunchies, and we'll call it even."<br>
        "But..."<br>
        "'Just between you and me.' Those <i>were</i> your words, yes? - no one else was to touch the Stein...and no one else did, I believe."<br>
        "Bah!  Darn you, you swaggler!"  A look of anger crossed Karg's face, but it melted away after only a moment as he began to laugh.  "Kittlen fetch me a pint of Lendel's, and one for me friend here, too.  Rumple, yer a wonder if I ever did see one."<br>
        Rumple began to laugh, and the whole bar with him.  <br>
        As Kittlen poured out 2 pints of Lendel's finest, he chuckled heartily, "Be fairly warned, Karg, for the only 'wonder' about Rumple is him wondering how he's going to squeeze another pint out of ye when this Lager's run out!" <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A> at: 6/22/01 7:29:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/21/01 9:24:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=773.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tales from the Vale - &quot;Rumple and the Covered Coin&quot</span><hr size=1> I hope you have enjoyed this first "Tale from the Vale."
