&quot;I heard you fought a daemon, did you get a daemon mark?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I made sure to not let it heal completely so it's still legible.&quot;<br>
&quot;Good. I'll have to inspect it to see who summoned the daemon then we can heal it.&quot;<br>
Xvar nodded and sat on a cot, pulling up his leg cuff.<br>
The medic kneeled down pulling the skin on either side slightly to tighten the skin and clarify the image.<br>
Daemon marks are not simple blots caused by daemon acids or blood, far from it. That blot only takes the outer shape of the mark. Usually this outer boundary is dark brown and like a thick scab, it becomes a light green until the pigment matches the healthy skin.<br>
Inside this boundary is a thin layer of blood red dead skin, burned off by acid and tinted a brighter color then the actual flesh it would've revealed. At the center of the mark is a small symbol. Sometimes the symbols are so abstract that originally it was not realized that it was the mark of the caster, not a natural form from the wound itself. This mark is in the darkest black that the skin can become.<br>
The medic looked it over closely then stood and pulled a tome off the shelf.<br>
The room was very small, maybe 6 feet by 6 feet and Xvar had to duck when the medic pulled a book off the bookshelf above him.<br>
He licked a finger and ran through the dusty pages until he found a mark of like form.<br>
He put them close to eachother and compared.<br>
He nodded and scratched his chin, marking the page with a leather book mark and putting it on the small desk beside the cot.<br>
&quot;Odd... The mark is of a high born, powerful wizard, yet you say the daemon was weak... It should have been summoned powerful, not in need of growth from corpse eating. Very strange... Well, I'll go report to the commander, you'd best take the potion on the desk, the uh...&quot; he paused, &quot;...red bottle... Yes, the red bottle. Ok?&quot;<br>
Xvar nodded, picking up the bottle and returning his cuff to his boot.<br>
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br>
The medic smiled and nodded, looking over his shoulder as he left the chamber.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
Tyu and Farren jumped from ground to branch to limb to rock as fast as they could, approaching the smoke.<br>
They came upon a small cottage and abrubtly stopped.<br>
Farren looked to Tyu, &quot;Let's do this the easy way, we have trouble we kill them, alright?&quot;<br>
Tyu nodded. He then rose his hands hands high in the air after securing his mask to his face. Green bubbles surrounded his form, slowly melting his figure to that of an erudite.<br>
&quot;Remember, don't speak.&quot;<br>
&quot;I underssstand.&quot;<br>
They went to the door and pounded on it loudly.<br>
A young wood elf boy opened the door, his mother ran over and picked him up, scolding him. &quot;I'm sorry, he's so rude, need you place till o'er this storm?&quot;<br>
Farren nodded, &quot;It would be appreciated, yes.&quot;<br>
Tyu and Farren walked in and sat on a wooden bench near the fire. Several children looked on from the otherside of the small room giggling.<br>
&quot;My friend is mute, so I'll thank you on his behalf as well.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ahh, tisn't a problem. We cou' use company till Edric an' moy husban' ge back.&quot;<br>
Farren nodded, she handed him a cup of hot tea and he sipped it thankfully smiling.<br>
Tyu rested his chin on his chest and closed his eyes, crossing his legs and folding his arms as well.<br>
One of the children came and sat near Tyu, looking at him happily.<br>
One of Tyu's eyes opened and a small smile crept on his face.<br>
The little boy ran over to Farren and tugged his pantleg, &quot;Oy! Sir, sir, please tell your friend he should smile more sir, he looks very funny not smiling sir!&quot;<br>
The mother laughed and revealed a lack of teeth, she walked over and kneeled by her son, apoligising to Farren.<br>
Farren smiled and looked to Tyu who's eyes were closed but smile remained.<br>

&quot;How fairs Dacrin?&quot; Xvar's words seem to pierce through Jerra's thoughts and she looked up, pausing before she spoke. &quot;Oh he's fine, just needs some rest.&quot;<br>
Xvar sat on his bed and pulled up his pant leg, applying the potion. It stung but Xvar didn't flinch at the pain, nor let it interupt his speech, &quot;Good. We're leaving in a few days as long as I get all the info needed on our new enemy.&quot;<br>

<br>
    I was quite taken aback at the way you carry your story with such driven passion...its great to see such writers like yourself practice such a skill in a manner befitting to you and not to anothers request..I simply mean writing for YOU will always be better than writing to the demands of others. I give to you friend Praise long overdue as to the great job you are doing. By chance I picked to read from your Post in the section, and I am glad for having ended up in here.  There are many hinderances in the way of writers but you seem relentlessly driven on by your readers to write on. This for you should be a boon for their criticisms will only better you in your style of writing friend...<br>
<br>
P.S.  From one writer to another....GREAT F@k'N JOB!<br>

The door was slightly ajar and Jerra could hear pieces of the conversation, but since it was all in dakan she understood none of it.<br>
One of them noticed the door was ajar and pulled it shut. A minute or two later Xvar leaned through the door and spoke to Jerra, &quot;I must go and be breifed on the possible enemy.&quot;<br>
Jerra looked a little worried but nodded, &quot;Alright...&quot;<br>
Xvar gently shut the door and Jerra heard him walk down the dusty rock hall.<br>
She sat back on the bed, then layed down on it looking at the black stone cieling.<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
Xvar walked down the familiar halls of the outpost to the 8 tunnel chamber, then to the 3rd to the left.<br>
The tunnel was smaller then the rest and had several slots where large stone doors could be layed, making it almost inpenatrable.<br>
As he reached the end of the hall he knocked on the door at the end. It was a gigantic wooden door reinforced with iron.<br>
A slot completely hidden from view slid open slowly.<br>
&quot;We were expecting you.&quot; Said the man behind the door.<br>
He opened it slowly and let Xvar in.<br>
Parallel to Xvar was a large desk, surrounded by bookshelves on every wall. Behind the desk was a large intimidating chair, covered in leather and facing the wall away from Xvar.<br>
Xvar knelt, his right fist on the ground and his left behind his back.<br>
The chair leaned back, showing the hairline of gray.<br>
As the chair swung around Xvar remained kneeling.<br>
Xvar sharply saluted in dakan to the man in the chair, who responded with a similiar salute.<br>
Xvar stood and so did the man, who walked out from behind the desk to a bookshelf. He spoke very quietly and gently, &quot;I've heard of your hardships. And of the daemon, and of Coriard's assasination. I was told the assassins were an iksar and an elven enchanter.&quot;<br>
Xvar nodded.<br>
&quot;Now this sparked my interest, for I know of an organizations who's cheif assassins would be of that like.&quot;<br>
&quot;And who is that m'lord?&quot;<br>
&quot;Now Xvar, this may be painful for you, but I'd like you to sit down and read the marked passage in this book.&quot;<br>
Xvar looked intrigued but worried as well, he took the book and sat in another chair diagonally to the right of the desk.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Royal Family Coriard's Accounts:&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Xvar's expression loosened as his jaw hung open and his eyebrows raised and forehead wrinkled.<br>
&quot;C-c-coriard was a royal family?!&quot;<br>
The man nodded, he sat in the chair and folded his hands.<br>
&quot;What have I done! I let him die!&quot;<br>
&quot;You did not fail your cause Xvar, the Coriards have long lost right to rule. But it does explain several things, like why he might have been a target. That is, if who I think is reasponsible is reasponsible.&quot;<br>
Xvar calmed himself and focused, looking to the man he questioned, &quot;Why did they kill him?&quot;<br>
&quot;For an heirloom actually... You see the Coriard's were of little importance, but their cheif magician, Korrash.. Well he's a different story.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who is Korrash?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm getting to it, heh. Korrash was a very wise sorcerer and the son of the Coriard king was promising. He wanted to raise him to become a great champion of the Dakan and a great king. But alas, the Coriard king was killed, and the dakans declined to the point of being conquered and then came the exodus.<br>
That son was named Eroc. He fleed with Korrash to Kelethin. Eroc had 3 sons, Qetra, Darcy and a bastard son who's name was unknown. Now Eroc was nearing death when they were born. So they were taken to a small cottage and took care of by a foster family. You see Eroc was quite old when he married, and even older when his wife had children. Now none of this matters except that Qetra was about 4 when they were left, and he had the amulet tied around his neck. He never took it off, and even more seldomly even showed it to anyone. Now this amulet was made by Korrash and contains all his earthly power, originally destined to protect Eroc, then Qetra. Qetra had a daughter and son, he gave the amulet to Sett, his sucessor. And in turn, Sett gave it to you.&quot;<br>
&quot;What sort of power does it pocess?&quot;<br>
&quot;More then could a mortal imagine. It can only be used by a decendent of the Coriard. Which is why our enemy is after it.&quot;<br>
&quot;The bastard son?&quot;<br>
&quot;Indeed, as far as we know. We assume he knew he had syblings, but I doubt he cared enough to value Darcy's life.&quot;<br>
&quot;And his name?&quot;<br>
&quot;Aftar...&quot;<br>

The rug was woven with silk strands, the walls had been so skillfully carved they were flat and painted. All the walls were white, with red trimming and a velvet curtain. Behind the red velvet curtain lay a smaller room where he slept. All the furniture was darkwood, stong and beautiful. The furniture was fairly simple, a velvet red couch, a darkwood writing desk, a circular table, and a elaborately carved darkwood liquor cabinet. In his bed chambers were simply the bed and closet, which looked much like the liquor cabinet.<br>
He paced around the central room, sitting on the couch and sighing, worried.<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I'm sorry father, but you know I had to do what I did. I will soon return our deserved glory. For the Dakan and the Coriard! I just hope you and Tunare can understand that to put this world back on it's correct path we must cut down a few trees. Xvar must know by now that Coriard was of the royal family if he had Eroc's picture with him. But it's not as much a threat as I thought. He probably knows my reason for need of the amulet. He'll run. It creates complications, but I believe we can handle them...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
Xvar looked the man in the eyes, &quot;Do I need to kill him?&quot;<br>
The man turned around again, speaking although he had turned around, &quot;We're not sure of his motives, he may be harmless. But due to his past belligerent nature, I'd say he's a threat. We may have to take the amulet and keep it here... Although it may be safer to have it traveling around so it's harder to track down...&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm going to keep it. If I need to kill Aftar it will be done.&quot;<br>
The man pulled a book off the shelf and turned back to Xvar, putting it down on the desk. He licked a finger and flipped to a page with a sketched picture on it.<br>
&quot;This is him.&quot;<br>
Xvar reached forward and ripped the page out, stuffing it into a belt pouch and standing up.<br>
&quot;I know you'll leave whether I allow it or not Xvar, but loose that amulet, and we're done for.&quot;<br>
Xvar didn't look back over his shoulder has he left the room, pausing only for a moment to speak, &quot;I won't come back after this you know, I'll either die to Aftar or to Serhan.&quot;<br>
The man chuckled, &quot;Love kills more soldiers then wars, be careful young Xvar.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
Tyu and Farren left the cottage much rested. They had spent the night, and were filled with warm food. Their clothes had been dried by the fire and were still warm from it's orange glow. As they walked out into the damp forrest Tyu commented, &quot;I'm glad we didn't have to kill them.&quot;<br>

He put both his palms down on the counter, narrowed his eyes, and said to the clerk, &quot;I want the dragonscale armor.&quot;<br>
The clerk's eyes widened, &quot;Is, that uhhh... wise sir?&quot;<br>
&quot;You hear what I said, now do your job.&quot; Xvar said sternly.<br>
The clerk stood and walked behind him to a small door, he opened it revealing a large chamber with rows of racks and shelves for armor. He reached to the top of the one in the very back grabbing a chest.<br>
He put it down on the counter with a thud and pushed it to Xvar.<br>
Xvar picked up the chest and walked out.<br>
Once he reached his chambers, seeing Jerra was asleep he suited up in the glinting red scale armor.<br>
&quot;It's to flashy.&quot; Xvar said coldly.<br>
He reached under the bed for a small chest, taking some over armor black clothing to put on. He pulled it on then pulled on the scale gauntlets and boots, which weren't covered in black then pulled his hood over his head, securing it accordingly.<br>
Letting out a long sigh he stood, looking to Jerra who had not awakened.<br>
He walked to her, trying to rouse her from her sleep. Unsucessful he sat back on his bed and fell asleep as well...<br>

Karok grinned, hovering close to Tyu and Farren, hidden by the opaque mask of tree foliage and shadow.<br>
----------------------------<br>
Serhan's mother smiled, her wrinkles were pulled tight be the action and she cooed, &quot;Ohh my baby, growing up.&quot;<br>
Serhan seemed indifferent to her mothers annoying comments.<br>
&quot;Are you not happy to marry a man such as Yurd?&quot;<br>
&quot;My heart is not settled on him, though my hand is promised.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ahh, but you will hold your heart in your hand my dear, will you not?&quot;<br>
&quot;If I still have a heart to hold, to clutch broken pieces and clasp a hand is a tricky thing to do -- unless I mean to prick the hand I clasp.&quot;<br>
&quot;Be frank my child, have you love for another?&quot;<br>
Serhan's tears flew through the air as she turned to her mother then away, running out the room, &quot;Why not ask me this when I was promised? Why did you let yourself hurt me by waiting!?&quot;<br>
Serhan ran from her house, down the platform and through the forest, ripping her dress and scraping her arms and legs. She kept running despite the mounting pain of multiple cuts and scratches. She reached a clearing. After leaning over with her hands on her knees, panting for a moment her head flew upwards and she screamed, &quot;Xvar!&quot;<br>

Since there was no indication of what the time was by the sun he was unsure of the time. Jerra lay in her bed, her back to Xvar.<br>
He came close to her, but stopped and left. He went and got some breakfast of iko, rice, and some meat.<br>
When he was done he went back to the chamber, Jerra had woken up and sat on her bed, looking groggy and stupid.<br>
Xvar sat next to her and pulled his blade from his belt and handed it to her, &quot;Have you ever heard the legend of Tunare's blade?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, I didn't know such a thing existed...&quot;<br>
Xvar sighed, &quot;I know there's something about this blade, some kind of power it has, but I haven't been able to wield it properly yet.&quot;<br>
&quot;I've never seen you wield it...&quot;<br>
&quot;Whenever I do I feel as if I'm somehow holding back, I'm not sure what it is. There might be a spell trying to channel through the weapon...&quot;<br>
Jerra nodded, &quot;Maybe so...&quot;<br>
&quot;Then again, I am not a loyal follower of Tunare in the sense that I rarely go to worship her... Maybe it needs a true follower to unleash it's power...&quot;<br>
Jerra seemed lost in thought, Xvar's words were absorbed as if by osmosis, since she didn't seem to be paying attention, &quot;A ranger or druid perhaps?&quot;<br>
&quot;A druid cannot wield a dagger well, maybe a ranger...&quot;<br>
Jerra looked at the blade, as she moved it through the air slowly the light reflected off it in different directions, it seemed to refract the light, because when the light hit the wall it seemed to turn to the rainbow.<br>
The blade itself, and handle were both golden, but were much stronger and lighter then gold. It was not a thin covering, for in battle that would have chipped or scraped off. Encrusted in the pommel of the handle was a large stone with a black symbel that seemed embedded in it.<br>
&quot;What does the symbol mean?&quot; Jerra said, intriuged.<br>
Xvar looked at it, surprised he had never noticed it, &quot;I'm not sure.&quot;<br>
His eyes narrowed as he examined it closer, taking it from Jerra and running his finger along it's smooth surface.<br>
&quot;That's not the symbol of Tunare...&quot;<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Sir, did you see who the daemon mark was from?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I'm aware. I'm surprised he's still alive, and yet at the same time I could have expected as much -- he's known to be very clever.&quot;<br>
&quot;I suppose it would explain his lack of power... I didn't know that entry in the tome was so old...&quot;<br>
&quot;His power would not decrease with age, he's probably still contained and he gave a call for help.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;The daemon, it was weak on purpose. He is obviously still contained in the perfect cell, but he thinks it's been long enough that we'll forget and some fool will unleash him again.&quot;<br>
&quot;How could he get the daemon out of the perfect cell?&quot;<br>
&quot;He probably summoned it right outside the cell, the bars only keep him from leaving. And his majik doesn't allow for teleporting. I doubt we have to worry. But if he gets angry he may unleash something stronger. It's probably a symbol to his followers to try and release him.&quot;<br>
The medic nodded, &quot;But why not destroy his maaterial form and summon himself out of the cell?&quot;<br>
&quot;Allow it seems ironic, he cannot destory his material form without giving up a great deal of power. And for a long time he'd be severely impaired. He'd rather wait until he's released then have to live in fear...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes... But sir, I do not know the circumstances that led up to his capture, how was his power subdued long enough to get him into the cell?&quot;<br>
&quot;I know not, only Korrash knows, and he is long been lost.&quot;<br>
The medic nodded downcast.<br>
&quot;If he manages to get out of the cell...&quot;<br>
&quot;We must find Korrash!&quot;<br>
&quot;It is not even known what happened to him when he left, besides, we should first focus on Aftar.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sir, why did he wait so long?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know, Perhaps some sort of event he's been waiting for. Bad timing for us might also be part of it.&quot;<br>
&quot;I didn't realize quite how important that daemon mark was sir, I had no idea who Daro was, all it said in the tome was-&quot;<br>
&quot;Do not recite it for me, I know his crimes.&quot;<br>
The medic nodded apoligetically.<br>
&quot;We will deal with Aftar first, if we are lucky he might know where Korrash is...&quot;<br>
&quot;Are you going to tell Xvar?&quot;<br>
&quot;Not many know of the perfect cell, or of Daro and Korrash's battle, we kept it all secret. We knew someone would be idiotic enough to release Daro. I trust Xvar, but I want him to focus on Aftar for now. If you hear of any activity from Daro's followers then report it and Xvar will be informed.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br>
The medic briskly saluted then walked out of the chamber. The man in the leather chair turned back to his bookshelf...<br>
He opened a tome and read a passage to himself, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  And did the storm clouds open as red and blue blood was shed to defend Dakan! Korrash fought Daro, oh and how the thunder screamed their names! Oh how the lightening matched their conjurations' fury! And Korrash did stand over Daro and defiled his face with blood and dirt! And took him to the perfect cell and enclosed him there! Oh, and Daro did yell and scream for many an hour until Korrash did smite him and make him sleep! Ahh but Daro was crafty! He did feign his sleep until Coriard twas dead! And Korrash gone! But wise, Korrash's cell kept Daro enclosed! Daro summoned many a daemon, but all were struck down by the rebels until the exodus and death of the rebels. Oh and how many a man cried for the death of the rebels who stayed behind to protect the cell! The exodus took their loved ones to safer grounds as the new conquered the rebels and the rebels covered the cell's enterance with their corpses!......</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
&quot;The rebels shall be someday justified, but Aftar, this is not the way...&quot; the man said with a long somber sigh.<br>

Although most of his energy was drained from lacking the evil energy around him he had been suited to his thoughts paced around his brain like he did his cell.<br>
He reached out his hand, as he paced his hand grazed against the cell's smooth wall.<br>
He grumbled and mumbled, all chants in a long lost language of arcane evokers.<br>
Sweat drops formed on his brow as he paused, concentrating.<br>
His red eyes, which seemed to glow with an aura not of earthly light narrowed, fixating on a certain spot in the cell. His eyes then closed and he put his hands infront of his head. Putting his fingers together, forming a triangle he put his hands right in front of his eyes. His eyebrows constrained and furrowed his brow. His mouth opened partially, revealing a hodge podge of mismatching canines.<br>
Suddenly he put his head up and his eyes opened, then screamed an evokation. Between his fingers a small ball of reddish glowing mana dripped from his hands from all sides. The ball grew until he had to open his hands and it skyrocketed toward the wall in a crimson wave of power.<br>
It smashed against the wall with such great force that the shockwave almost knocked Daro over. He put his arms in a criss cross in front of his face, creating a small protective aura around him. The aura flashed as it clashed against the shockwave.<br>
The wall absorbed the the power turning bright red for a moment then cooling to it's constant black.<br>
Daro's fists clenched then relaxed as he sat, further pondering his seeming eternal fate.<br>

Jerra was lying peacefully in sweet repose. Her hand was off the bed and she lay on her stomach. Xvar felt awkward, he poked her gingerly.<br>
She didn't notice.<br>
He poke again, with more pressure.<br>
She again, didn't wake.<br>
From sheer frusteration he threw a pillow at her.<br>
She wiped her eyes and looked at hin bewildered, &quot;Morning?&quot;<br>
&quot;Could be,&quot; Xvar said with a chuckle, &quot;Can't tell in the caves.&quot;<br>
Jerra yawned and nodded sleepily in agreement.<br>
&quot;We're leaving today, I assume Dacrin will be fit to travel.&quot;<br>
Jerra threw the covers off her and hopped off the bed.<br>
Xvar stood and left, calling over his shoulder as he went, &quot;I'll go get Dacrin, meet us in the food hall.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, see you there.&quot;<br>
Xvar went to Dacrin's cot. He was already up and sitting on the stone block supported stretcher.<br>
Dacrin asked if he could borrow some equipment.<br>
Xvar showed him to the equipment chamber and they suited him up in glowing greenish armor. He too put some other leather clothing over it to keep inconspicuous.<br>
Xvar then took Dacrin to Jerra and left them to talk as he went to the report chamber.<br>
He there recieved a leather map of the area, including some suspected hang outs of Aftar's organization.<br>
Apparently, the organization even had a name, &quot;The Knights Justified.&quot;<br>
They even had ties to pretigious artisans, who could discreetly supply them with weapons and armorments.<br>
Although most didn't know their true purpose, to redeem themselves by taking over the world -- The Knights Justified also did venial misacts for rich people, namely assassinations to supplement their plans for world domination.<br>
Aftar was by no means a fool, in fact, he was at least close to a genius. His plans were always flawless and his charasmatic diplomacy spared the Knights from a criminal reputatation.<br>

Jerra and Dacrin sat on the edge of the bed, looking ready.<br>
Xvar didn't need to say a word, they both rose silently. He led them out the caves and back down to the ground. This time neither seemed as phased by the elevator rock.<br>
------------------<br>
Tyu and Farren had met some opposition in their search for Xvar. This opposition came in the form of bandits. The bandits weren't helping Xvar out of the kindness of their hearts, but more for the coins out of Tyu and Farren's pockets. They had no idea this had aided Xvar in getting from the outpost safely.<br>
The battle was not long, but Farren now had to wear a bandage over his recently gauged out eye.<br>
This hindered their search immensely. Although Farren could handle the pain, the lack of an eye is not an easy injury to recuperate from.<br>
Tyu was none the worse for ware from the battle, but understood the severity of Farren's injury.<br>
Blood continued to drip profusely even with Farren's turban of bandages.<br>
&quot;I swear, I swear on my blade and my lost eye that I shall gain back vengeance from a hundred men.&quot;<br>
Tyu knew what this meant, but kept from expressing his own discontent in Farren's decision.<br>
They found another small village where Farren's eye was better tended to and the bleeding subsided.<br>
A long, fresh scar now ran from his left temple, across his nose and a small part on his right cheek. Farren had never revealed much emotion, even now he kept most of his rage to himself. He only hinted at it with his new short temper and obscene comments. In the village tavern he drank until he passed out and the next day fought off a massive hang over.<br>
Karok noted the new behavior. He had gotten a teleport back and had been following them. Even during the battle with the bandits he did not interfere. He knew his place, it was not to defend Farren and Tyu. His place was to simply to finish the job if they failed to kill Xvar.<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
Down a dark passage somewhere in souther Nektolus a small dark elf ran. He cross over a bridge made of several wooden boards tied together with leather. Tangled and woven into the long leather strands were bones of a human or elven kind. Skulls had holes through them and were stacked on spears at either side of the wall where the bridge led.<br>
Underneath was a long drop into what looked like black, bubbling tar. He was panting, looking excited but at the same time a little worried.<br>
He burst into a chamber of occupied priests. They were all chanting, or commiting sacrifices to the alter. His rude entrance made them all silent, waiting for his news.<br>
&quot;The signal! The signal!&quot; the man panted breathlessly.<br>
The priests threw their arms into the air in a panic, scurrying about the room, pulling books from the shelves and making potions. The man was so tired he fell back on the wall and slumped to the floor. A priest, the only one who had remained calm approached him.<br>
&quot;When?&quot;<br>
The man looked up at him, &quot;A week ago, maybe more, it took a long time to travel milord.&quot;<br>
&quot;I understand, thank you.&quot;<br>

It was completely devoid of hair and covered in scars that almost looks scale like. He had several notable scars. The most notable was on that ran right down the middle of his head and brow. Ending on his nose. The other was more suttle, two rows of small scars below and above his lips. All of them looked like only as big as a nail head, but were parallel to the ones below. When Daro was young, and fully an elf, they saw him turning. His chants were drawing power from evil and evil alone. In order to stifle this growing power they held him down and stitched together his lips. Of course, they were majikly bound; making them almost impossible to cut, but eventually Daro's power surpassed their power despite his handicap. He learned to chant without opening his mouth and eventually tore the stitches off anyway. The large scar that ran down his head was from the battle with Charikak, the high priest of evil, thus claiming his place at the throne, the throne of the necromancer guild that is. He still had another throne he hoped to attain -- the throne of the gods.<br>
-------------------------------<br>
Aftar was fully dressed in the finest garments he could afford. He wore a dark blue vest, a white jacket, white sash, and black pants. The jacket was velvet, with large cuffs and bright gold buttons. His boots were dark black, shined to the point of perfect reflection.<br>
His sash was laced at the ends and had a slight fringe. His hair was perfectly combed, also dark black and tied back with a small blue ribbon. His beard and mustache were perfectly trimmed as were the side burns from the beard to his hair. He scratched his beard impatiently as a servant brought him the carriage. He stepped up into the carriage, riding to a large mansion.<br>
He stepped out, immediately greeted by a servant who led him inside. <br>
His we led into a large, slightly dark chamber. All the curtains were closed tightly and the only light in the room came from a large lamp.<br>
&quot;Welcome Lord Aftar.&quot; The man sat Aftar down at a small circular table.<br>
&quot;I have no time for pleasantries, please simply inform me on the status of our goods.&quot;<br>
&quot;I understand milord, forgive me. It is all ready. We have it at rondeview point QKE, everything is in perfect order.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well done, how much do we owe you?&quot;<br>
&quot;6000 platinum, or preferably, a favor for our business.&quot;<br>
The man slid across the table an envelope.<br>
Aftar opened it, seeing a picture and a set of instructions.<br>
&quot;A favor? It's the least we can do for such appreciated business, consider it done.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you milord, if you'll honor us with your presence tonight at the party we would be able to discuss some other jobs you may be able to do. But on a more profitable basis.&quot;<br>
&quot;The honor is mine, I would be happy to attend. Have you chambers I can stay at until the party?&quot;<br>
&quot;Why yes, indeed, I shall have a servant show you to your room until tonight. You are also welcome to come quail hunting with us after luncheon.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'd enjoy it immensely, I shall see you then, I am quite tired -- I take my leave.&quot;<br>
The man shook Aftar's hand and called a servant to show Aftar to his room.<br>
As soon as Aftar reached his room he threw a piece of paper out the window, below one of his servants retrieved it and look at it for a moment then scurried off.<br>
&quot;I am done doing favors, we must now seize our destiny. But I shall wait until after the party, I do enjoy a good social event.&quot;<br>

The servant brought the note to the carriage rider; he nodded and raced down the path back to the headquarters and handed it to several men standing on guard outside.<br>
“Right now? It’ll take several hours to prepare the needed chemicals and place them for blast.”<br>
“That’s what the note said, he’s serious about this. You better get it done.”<br>
The man sighed and walked down into the caves. He walked into a room labeled “Specialty Alchemy”. He handed the note to one of the men.<br>
“Formula 219, sharp snap men, we have 3 hours!”<br>
The other members of the alchemy team stood up quickly getting to work.<br>
“Pass me the bottles 3-20, 9-9, 4-57, and 12-233, now!”<br>
The intricate process of making explosives, mostly from fertilizer was performed over and over.<br>
“3-20, 9-9, 4-57, 12-233” rang out the loudest in the hushed panic.<br>
“Pass me that one, yeah, wait no- that one, next to it!”<br>
“Pass me the fuses, and a box, now come on! We had this drilled at 450 seconds, we’re already far over that, now let’s GO!”<br>
The men quickly attached fuses to the bottles full of explosive then carefully put them in a wooden box, filled with hay.<br>
Several of the alchemy team hurried through the cave to the waiting room, where a team of gariks, or elite stealth warriors waited.<br>
“One box for each man,” said the alchemist, “and here is a map of where to place them, be very careful to make sure you don’t lay fuse in wet grass!”<br>
“Yes sir!”<br>
Each garik grabbed a box and jumped into a specially made wagon. It looked like a normal hay wagon, but about 1 foot under the hay was a small chamber made to hold about 12 men. The wagon driver sped down the trail at full speed…<br>
When the gariks arrived at the house each took a box and put the explosives at strategic places around the mansion, each at a stone support. All the fuses were readied and the men stood each with a way to light the fuse. <br>
One man ran back and forth from each, inspecting the explosives masked by grass and darkness. He checked each one and gave a thumbs up, standing by the entrance, waiting for Aftar.<br>
----------------------------------<br>
“Milord Aftar, the party shall begin in only a few short moments, your presence is awaited.”<br>
Aftar nodded at the servant, straightening his sash and lace tie. He stepped down the stairs carefully, both hands behind his back and his head high and attentive.<br>
The other guests applauded his arrival and several beautiful women came over and flirted with Aftar. He took it gracefully, being polite and slightly dismissive. <br>
His manners were that of a well-trained courtier. His hand movements, facial expressions, speak, all of it perfect. At every guest he met he made a bow, always attentive, always graceful.<br>
He bowed to the man, Count Lugiver, “Forgive me milord, I shall return in a moment.”<br>
The count nodded, barely noticing as he drank his wine and flirted with women.<br>
Aftar walked nonchalantly out the mansion, not bothering to look back at the beautifully crafted marble mansion.<br>
As he walked by the garik team leader he removed his hand from his vest and put his index finger up.<br>
The garik leader nodded, still lying in the grass, he suddenly jumped up, screaming, “NOW!”<br>
Count Lugiver looked over his shoulder, shrugging off the disturbance.<br>
Each garik lit his fuse and watched it start to burn down to the bottle. Each got up at the same time and turned around.<br>
Aftar paused, not looking over his shoulder as the mansion exploded furiously in the night. Creating a sun in the mid-evening sky.<br>
“Delightful party Milord Lugiver, but unfortunately for you, I have more pressing events to attend to. Forgive my rude absence.”<br>
Wreckage and shrapnel flew through the air, several pieces near his feet. The gariks dispersed into the night, as silently as they had come.<br>
Aftar stepped up into the carriage, looking on the burning remains of the mansion, “I always did think your home to be a bit garish though Lugiver, I think these renovations look much more humble.”<br>
