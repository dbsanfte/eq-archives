The Sand Giant Cycle mobs can be triggered by killing any of the mobs with rare/odd names, including the one fixed one in the tower.<br>
<br>
The way it appears to work is kill odd named (Madman,Crypt Mummy (no a), A Darkboned skeleton, sand mummy) and then approx 20 minutes later - one of the Sand Giant cycle (SG, Hussein, Terror etc) spawns.  Kill that and then there is a small chance that IMMEDIATELY after the AC will pop.<br>
<br>
I actually use this all the time to pop lots of SGs for collecting other items, and have personally now popped the AC 5 times this way.<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that the Sand Giant cycle however also includes some non obvious mobs (the Star shaped Desert Tarantula spawn being one), and I believe that there is one Sand Giant cycle mob always spawning (at 20 minute frequency) regardless of killing the trigger mobs.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp of long observation<br>

<br>
For some reason, people seem to act like their strategy is the only one taking place in the zone.  They're killing only sand giants, and the AC pops. so, they go around preaching that killing SG's spawns the AC.  They pay no attention to the fact that there are 2 mages, a shaman, 3 wizzies, and 5 other people wandering the zone wiping out everything they can get ahold of. Nope, they didn't make a difference. It was that one guy killing the SG's that spawned the AC.<br>
<br>
Point is,  Kill everything. it's the only thing that will actually get provable results. Simply because if you don't kill that madman, someone else will. if you let that spider live, someone else won't.  If you don't kill that SG, someone else is going to.<br>
<br>
Kill it all.<br>
<br>
On a more civilized note...<br>
<br>
Let's say that there is a Named/AC spawn cycle.  Those mobs have PH's as well as being PH's themselves.  So, you have to kill the PH's to get them or the AC to spawn. And to get all the possible PH's spawned, you have to kill their PH's.  In other words, what you end up doing is killing everything trying to get the names to spawn so that one of them might be the AC.  So, just to shorten the process, just kill it all.<br>
<br>
Have I suggested.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Kill it all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unottomf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nottom F</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 8:15:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5433.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AC in SRo</span><hr size=1> Best advice I have is to stop camping in SRo and try for the one in OOT instead, he is a nice static spawn although higher level.
