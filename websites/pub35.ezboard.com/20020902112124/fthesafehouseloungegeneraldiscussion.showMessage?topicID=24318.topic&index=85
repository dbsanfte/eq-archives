<br>
Storys true or not of rogues dealing unbalanced damage are being posted on most of the server forums.<br>
<br>
This got me to thinking of a way to &quot;Fix&quot; some of the problems backstab has made.<br>
<br>
Why dont Verant change Backstab along the lines they did the Donals BP. That is associate it with a buff that cannot be overwritten for a predetermined period of time.<br>
<br>
Ie. Rogue_01 Backstabs mob ....... Buff land on mob and lasts for say 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
Anyone else trying to BS within the 15 seconds would get a &quot;Your target is imune to your attack&quot; message. But would not use up their BS if it did not land.<br>
<br>
This idea still gives BS it's usefullness but also requires a bit more tactics than 3 2 1 Backstab.<br>

All you have done so far is make general snipes at the rogue class rather than bring any rational points to this idea.<br>
<br>
If you disagree with it ( Im going to go out on a limb and say you do ) then by all means post something to back up your point of view.<br>
<br>
As it is MB negates a dragons Melee, Regen and Ae and does not require any healing tactics. <br>
<br>
Do you honestly think a few peeps standing in a line and clicking 1 button at the same time is a feasable &quot;Risk Vs Reward&quot;?<br>
<br>
All my idea does is make it slightly less trivial to kill a dragon. But honestly its still not going to be very hard, just going to seperate wizards with skill and tactics from the ones that just click a button.<br>

Training and ksing is a matter for GMs, not balance. And I seriously doubt manaburn has increased training anymore then fiegn death. Ksing can be done as long as you do more damage then someone else, and there will always be a way to do that.<br>

It may seem a big step up for you to turn on autoattack and hit the hutbutton for evade, backstab when they pop. As long as nothing goes wrong so is there no reason for anyone to die. Things can go wrong with manaburn too, wich has a larger side effect.<br>

No, what its about is to remove an alternative way to kill a few select mobs. Changing MB wont make it less trivial to use the normal tank/healer/melee to kill them.<br>

Once every 72 minutes I get to slack off and let some other class kill the mob. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just kidding folks. I think like every skill, there are the people who use it to benefit others, and those who use it to benefit only themselves. I play on Mith Marr, and yes I have seen MB squads do Gore right from under a raid force. Why? Well I guess the many /auctions selling scales for epic use (usually 15k for a red/white and 100k+ for green) might have something to do with it. <br>
<br>
I think any person in a guild with a MB wizzie knows the value of the skill. I say person so the more argumentive posters don't go whining how all rogues want this nerfed. So any person with a MB wizzie knows how valuable this is over all. And any wizzie with the MB skill knows how painfully limited that skill is. My only beef is how SOME people have been using this skill- not discounting how hard the skill is to get. The beef is not the damage, not the refresh, it's how 6 wizzies can take a Kunark dragon and turn it into yard trash for fun and profit. <br>
<br>
I like the idea about turning MB into a kind of effect, where multiple ones can't be landed too close together. Maybe not 15 seconds tho- a spacing of 2-3 seconds is more then enough to balance out risk vs reward for those who want to do it. Like was posted- it will just seperate the button pushers from the more skillfull players. <br>
<br>
As to MB negating a Dragon's melee, regen and aoe, well I really know from seeing it multiple times that it does Znail. The Gore got through her opening spiel - started to cast a complete heal- and it landed a few seconds later on her corpse. She was dead and looted before anyone could even pitch a bitch they were doing it- and the wizards were gone before the blame game could start. There was no melee- no body to regen- and no aoe cast. Therefore it was negated by the use of MB. I don't understand how only the regen was negated if there was no dragon left to melee or aoe.<br>
<br>
Your quote about how novel clicking autoattack is, and popping evade ever time it comes up- well yes at it's base form thats all we do. But we do it as a larger force- not as a group of six who only are doing it to fatten their pockets- remember my bitch isn't with MB wizards- it's the k3wl d00ds who want 100k bankaccounts. <br>
<br>
Either way- to each their own, MB'ers are gonna do what they want to do with the skill, good or bad, for fun or for profit. The people who end up really getting hurt are the people who are working to get these drops off the dragons, and never get to- because of how fast they get killed. Well they can have the drops, but now they have to go into the bazaar and pay for them. <p>Graynd Theftauto </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/18/02 8:11:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24318.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Quote by Graynd:<br>

Your example actualy shows my point. Gore had time to start to cast, what if that had been AE fear, summon etc. Then it hadnt been negated. This time enuff damage had been done that Gore tried to cast complete heal, wich is basicly the best that can happen for a MB team. Another day it may be AE fear and some MB wizard gets feared and its a whipe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usharafi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sharafi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/18/02 8:17:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24318.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> /Sigh<br>
