Even from his birth, his hands were always clutching something.  Maybe a bit of his Mother's facial hair or maybe a tiny stone, but there were times when his Father or a family friend discovered with a gnomish watch or a pen in his possession.  Some small thing that interested the babe's attention... and since his infant eyes were not yet adjusted, he had to use touch to sense his surroundings, just the only difference between him and the other babies was he did not let go...  <br>
        His father, Rilixc, was a baker in North Kaladim, and taught Silic the art of making cookies and pastries.   Though Silic didn't really like the grueling, hot work, he did love the results.  Especially the Gingerbread men. His father knew this and made sure to double check to see if Silic didn't take any.   Even with this strict security, many many gingerbread men walked out that door.<br>
        While munching on a barbarian shaped cookie, Silic passed the deep mines of Kaladim.  It was usually quiet at the top, with all of the workers picking away at the stone looking for precious stones, but today was different as cartload after cartload of precious gems where shipped out for various cities.  Small, easily missed, perfect items to &quot;have&quot; according to Silic.  As he casually talked to the banker who was outside leaning back watching the busy dwarfs come out of the mines, Silic snagged a gem in the motion of looking for the lighter for his pipe.  He felt something small drop into his hand and further searched for his lighter... which seemed not to be in his back pocket.  Without result, he just thought he left them back at the bakery.  Selic bid the Banker farewell and headed back to the bakery.  Silic gasped as he felt a point in his back.<br>
&quot;I be thinkin' ya have somethin' of ours there, Silic, &quot; the gruff voice whispered.  It was Jeet, the Supervisor of Miner's Guild 628.  <br>
&quot;Ya have no proof.  Dis gem I have here is not from ya, &quot; Silic pulled out the freshly lifted gem, &quot;It's from some goblin I found outside.&quot;  <br>
&quot;Ah, then dat is a good excuse.  Oh, I also did go through whoever stole dat gem, &quot; Jeet told Silic.<br>
Jeet threw a lighter into the air... an all too familiar one at that.<br>
&quot;If yah see a certain thief with the initials S.D, let me know, &quot; Jeet said finishing with a wink.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh @#%$, &quot; Silic thought, &quot;dat lighter is worth way more den dis gem.... &quot;.<br>
Silic tapped Jeet on the shoulder. Jeet turned around smiling with an open hand.  Silic dropped the pebble into the calloused hand.  Jeet turned to a passing carriage and tossed it in with the rest. <br>
Then the experienced miner went back discussing matters with his fellows.<br>
&quot;Ahem, &quot; Silic coughed for attention.<br>
<br>
Jeet turned around wondering what Silic was looking for. Silic held out his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;What? What do you think I have ?  Maybe ya should check yer pockets.  Dink you missed something, &quot; Jeet said casually as his workers started snickering.<br>
<br>
Silic fumbled quickly through his pockets and felt the smooth metal of his gnomish lighter.<br>
<br>
Awestruck and dumbfounded, Silic just stared at Jeet.... <br>
<br>
Jeet put his hand around Silic and led him into the gaping tunnel.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You are one of us....  you have the skill and we could use that...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now....<br>
<br>
<br>
After going through months of rigorous training, Silic dropped his name.... Silic was dead now.  He couldn't let his father or mother hear of his &quot;profitable&quot; adventures in Norrath.. all they will hear about is Tehptoh.  <br>
Tehptoh was on a business transaction today.  A wood elf just paid him a hefty sum to help him hunt for the orc runners that seemed to zoom across Butcherblock delivering messages back to Crushbone.  <br>
<br>
Cross legged, Tehptoh took long pulls off his pipe filled with the fungus that came from Unrest... Amilintatata something or other.  The mushrooms created a strong poison when injected into the bloodstream, but heightened Tehptoh's senses when smoked.  His eyes became bloodshot as he focused on everything around him.  That merchants pocket had a frayed edge along the left side, that brick was coming lose a tad bit, and that lizard crawling around had a slight limp in the right front leg.<br>
<br>
A blue figure appeared at the horizon.  It grew larger quickly as it demonstrated it's high skill at running at terrible speeds.  Three buttons on it's vest, and full money pouch Tehptoh saw.  Tehptoh dropped the pipe  to the ground unto the dirt road.  Still smoking and lit, the pipe caught on the dry kindling Tehptoh set up before.  The fire grew into mighty flames as the big logs caught quickly.   Taking out a poison, Tehptoh sprinkled the liquid on the fire, creating a thick red cloud.  Tehptoh lifted a cloth veil across his mouth and nose, and faded into the red smoke.  The orc slowed just before the red cloud trying to figure what what hell it was.  It cautiously stuck it's hand in.  Seeing nothing  wrong, the orc started running through the cloud. Inhaling a large breath of air to replenish the oxygen in his blood, the orc breathed in the hallucinogenic cloud.   Rays of color and big spots flew past it's eyes at an intense rate.  The landscape the orc could see was shifting and squirming like a gnome slave in chains that it so loved.<br>
<br>
Flying through the cloud was a dark figure with a large spear.  Hopping this way and that, the shadow made it's way closer to Rloec, the winner of the Orcish Marathon 3172.  Finally the leaping spot stopped right in front the orc as he stumbled around.  Then a high leap into the air with a large spot above the short figure.  What was the large spot?  Rloec finally recognized it as a rather large harpoon heading straight for him.<br>
<br>
*thunk*<br>
<br>
Through the lungs the thick harpoon pierced.  The orc staggered randomly as it tried to regain his <br>
<br>
&quot;By Bristlebane, &quot; Tehptoh thought, &quot;dis guy got unfa&quot;.<br>
<br>
Holding up his hand, Tehptoh snapped his finger and a fine dagger appeared between his knuckles.  The dwarf rogue flipped the dagger towards the orcs neck and bit into the jugular.<br>
<br>
Spurts of dark blood sprayed across the grass and the dirt path.  Weaving this way and that, the orc started gasping it's last breath.  <br>
<br>
&quot;For all things, just DIE, &quot; said the frustrated dwarf.  Running up to the front of the orc again, Tehptoh leaped and shoved the harpoon deeper in.<br>
<br>
&quot;IN! IN! IN!, &quot; the bloodthirsty dwarf screamed.<br>
<br>
Finally, the orc died silently.. even after all that struggle.   <br>
<br>
Picking up a heavily blood stained pouch, Tehptoh threw it over his back and walked over to the wood elf ranger that was watching the entire thing.  Jaws agape at the carnage, the wood elf could not believe such a runt did all of this.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, you.  Here's ya bag.  Now's where be mah payment?, &quot; inquired Tehptoh.<br>
<br>
The wood elf fumbled through his pouch, all the while looking at the remains of the orc runner, and pulled out 25 gold pieces and dropped it into the dwarf's open hands.  <br>
<br>
Tehptoh tossed the bag into the wood elf that made the ranger stagger back, &quot;Danks, here's ya mumbo jumbo mail  or wutever is in it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tehptoh walked back over to the corpse, put a foot on the the corpse, and with a *shick, snap* the rogue withdrew the harpoon from the rib cage and guts of the hapless victim.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good day ta ya, &quot; Tehptoh mumbled lighting up his pipe again while walking back to Kaladim.<br>
<br>
<br>
