(very long)</span><hr size=1> Ok feel FREE to delete this if this is a Rogue only stories area. If not then read if you like. I know its long and really rough but here goes:<br>
<br>
<br>
Vizier looked through the crowd of people at the bank. Faces from all over Norrath were huddled together in a whirl of conversation. In his Dark Elf illusion, all his senses seemed hightened. It seemed he could percieve very quick movements more clearly. With his keen Dark Elf ears he detected one distinctly familiar voice.<br>
<br>
In a thick southern accent Kepelus was haggling with the banker. Kepelus said, &quot; No sir you seem to be mistaken. I am very sure I had kept my robe here, now could you please check again?&quot;<br>
<br>
The banker had a strange accent, but then again all humans seemed to have that accent. It sounded uncivilized in a way to Vizier. In a gruff tone the banker said, &quot;look we aint got it 'ere. Cripes bloody Erudes think they know everything! Next.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kepelus slammed his fist on the counter, &quot;Ill be writing a lenghty report about what has transpired here you mark my words!&quot; Kepelus pulled his robe up out of the dust and stomped away. <br>
<br>
Vizier weaved a few simple divination threads in a weave around himself. He instantly took the shape of a human. They effect was so perfectly executed, one would have been hard pressed to even notice the change while staring right at him.<br>
<br>
Calmly he stepped up to the banker and said, &quot;Aye mate. Did ye get me packages?&quot; This was the code phrase that was needed to see what goods they had behind the back door. The banker replied, &quot;Aye they back 'ere&quot;<br>
<br>
Vizier followed him down a short hallway and to a door which was locked. The banker pulled out a long rusty key and opened the door. <br>
<br>
Inside was a poorly lit room with a few tables displaying various items. There was no order to the goods at all. The poor lighting coupled with his inferior human eyes made it a chore search the tables. <br>
<br>
After a few minutes he spotted his prey. It was a black robe with green lining. There was an aura of magic eminating from the robe. Vizier said gruffly, &quot;Hey what about this ere? It'll be a nice robe for one o me whores. Hahaha&quot; <br>
<br>
The banker began to laugh evilly. &quot;Aye mate. I tell you what you give me a few gold for the hassle of having to deal with the Erude scum I stole it from with and its yours.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ere, take a few platinum, go get drunk on me with your friends&quot; The banker thanked Vizier heartily. If it had been any easier Vizier would have laughed. <br>
<br>
Once outside he shed the unwanted illusion and apeared in his pure Elven state. Inconspicuously stepped arround to the back of the bank. There he grabbed a few more divination threads and bent the light around his body....In this way he was invisible to the naked eye. <br>
<br>
He slowly made his way through the crowded streets of Freeport. At last he caught site of Kepelus tromping along, fire pet in tow. Vizier summoned a few conjuration threads, so fine they were almost non existant. He sent the threads softly into Kepelus's mind. *turn around* It was a gamble to use Suggestion on another caster, but Vizier was a master.<br>
<br>
Kepelus stopped short. He suspiciosly glanced around. Something in his subconcious had been alerted but he didnt know what. He was about to continue on formulating his complaint report mentally, when something about his pet caught his attention. <br>
<br>
Draped around its shoulders was the black and green robe. Kepelus donned the robe hurriedly. He looked around a little confused. Eventually Kepelus turned back to his original destination. This time however his pace was much slower. He appeared to be lost in thought.<br>
<br>
Sometime later Vizier was found himself walking through the forest. It was nightime. The wind was a little stronger than his liking, but it was a glorious night nonetheless. <br>
<br>
Vizier fully intended to kill Kepelus. But when the time finally came he wanted his revenge to be absolute and complete. If that meant he had to help Kepelus to some degree then so be it. That moment was all that mattered to him. It was the only reason he lived. Kepelus' end was near. Patience was Viziers biggest ally. <br>
<br>
Soon his Honor would be restored. He needed a complete and total victory in his own mind. Until that day he would never be able to attain to true power. Vizier whispered softly, &quot;Until that day Kepelus.&quot; Vizier faded away.<br>

(very long)</span><hr size=1> Kreigan Watched the exchange quietly. He felt a brief tinge of guilt at the thought of his brother's hatred. Kreigan held no ill will toward the Erudite, in fact he respected the mans logical nature. <br>
<br>
The fact that House Bloodmane was unofficially at war with all of Kepelus's ancestors was irrelavent. Kreigan knew Kepelus to be a fair and unselfish person with a history of giving sound advice. <br>
<br>
Eventually this would all have to end; he knew that his brother would stop at nothing less... Would he have the courage to follow his heart when the final hour was at hand? <br>
<br>
Kreigan put away the troubling thoughts and focused on his task. Keeping the edge of his weapon razor sharp took the skill of a master. Instead of metal, the Axe was forged with an ice that was harder than Mithril and lighter than Platinum. <br>
<br>
The ice was called Vellium here in Freeport. The Dwarves that first discovered the ice, used it to make many things besides just weapons. Furniture, and tools were also made with the Vellium.<br>
<br>
But it was not until the High Elves recieved their first sample, that the true power of the Vellium became apparent. <br>
<br>
They High Elves theorized that the ice originally came from the Dragon @#%$ Veeshan. When her claw had scraped the land, all the matter that had directly touched the @#%$ had formed Vellium.<br>
<br>
The High Elves soon discovered that Vellium could hold more magic than any substance they had previously worked with. In fact there was no way to accurately tell how much magic could be infused into the ice, because it seemed to hold their strongest Enchantments with ease. <br>
<br>
Within a few weeks of recieving the first shipment of Vellium. House Bloodmane had several mining projects in the newly discovered land know as the Icelad. <br>
<br>
Vellium was worth more than platinum, and it was plentiful. The demand never seemed to stop. A slight streak of jealousy flashed through Kreigan when he thought of how the Erudite made Vellium items with slightly more power than the High Elves. <br>
<br>
The Erudites understood that leaving the crystals in there natural state made them absorb more Magic. High Elves felt that an item of power should have asthetic appeal as well so they sculptured the ice into beatiful creations as they Enchanted it. This however had the drawback of lowering its potentcy. <br>
<br>
A bird was hopping close to Kreigan, looking up at him expectantly. Kreigan tossed it a small piece of muffin. The bird hurriedly gobbled it up, and again looked at Kreigan. You are just like many people I have met in this world little bird, Kreigan thought to himself.<br>
<br>
He attached his Axe to his back, satisfied at the edge. His thoughts had taken him well past dusk. Sounds of music could now be heard from inside houses. The streets were beginning to clear. <br>
<br>
Kreigan had developed quite a taste for the Talashi Ale that was brewed here in Freeport. With that thought he decided to unwind at the tavern across from his rented room.<br>
<br>
Kreigan took great care when attaching his magical armor. The slightest imperfection in the armors surface greatly displeased the Paladin, causing hem to spend too much time polishing it.<br>
<br>
As he made his way through the northern section of the city, he began to sense a set of eyes upon him. He stopped and turned around. <br>
<br>
A thick cloud of black smoke surrounded surrounded Kreigan. Instinctively, he drew his axe and dropped to the ground. Once on the ground he rolled away from the cloud. He was on his feet in an instant, axe at the ready.<br>
<br>
Everything began to fade in Kreigans mind. His breathing became perfectly timed. Kreigan began to use his sense of hearing to guide him. He heard the dagger cut through the air, making a hissing noise. This would have been undetectable had Kreigan not beeen specifically listening for it.<br>
<br>
He leaned forward and spun on his attacker, missing the blade by fractions of an inch. The thief recovered instantly and began launching a series of lightning fast attacks. <br>
<br>
Almost immediatley Kriegan was backed on his heels. He had his hands full keeping the attacks at bay, and no time to even think about conterattacking yet.<br>
<br>
After parrying and dodging a few swipes he decided to let his guard down a little. The thief, thinking his moment of victory was at hand, swung his dagger into the left side of Kreigans stomach. His last thought was of disbelief at the undamaged armor. He never even saw the death blow.<br>
<br>
Kreigan said a quick prayer to Tunare for her forgiveness on the now departed theifs soul. He decided that perhaps he should just return to his room instead of going to the Pub.<br>
<br>
Back in his room, Kreigan removed his implements of war. As he lay beside the small fireplace in his cot, he let his thoughts turn to the next days activities. Perhaps it was time to explore the Ruins of Sebilis. It would be a good day to get away from the city, and all its problems Kreigan thought as he drifted peacefully off to sleep. <p>One name.

(very long)</span><hr size=1> When are you going to wake up??&quot;<br>
<br>
As if cold water had been thrown on him Kreigan jerked out of sleep. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Kreigan said with a nervous tone. As his eyes focus he caught site of a small wood elf with light brown hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;My new boots dont match my outfits.&quot; Stardove stated crisply.<br>
<br>
Slowly pieces of Kreigans memory drifted back to him. Kreigan recalled when he had first met Stardove. <br>
<br>
It was a perfectly fine day in in Faydark. Sunlight was doing a decent job of getting through the thick green leaves. All the faydarks creatures were out in full force, especially the chipmunks.<br>
<br>
Kreigan had been wandering under the city on his way to Felwithe. THere were many trails well worn under the city proper. A few of the cities less reputable shop keepers chose to use this area occasionally. <br>
<br>
It was at one of these shops that Kreigan first laid eyes on Stardove. Stardove was short, even for a wood elf, but what caught his attention was her eyes. Stardove had kind blue eyes that almost seemed to curl at the edges. Her figure was nothing to be dismissed either. Having the slender build that High Elf ladies could never fully achieve thogh they tried.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you looking at?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her voice jolted him back to the present. &quot;Are you even listening to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was listening!...I told you i was gonna be away for a few days. Why are you in my room?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up I have something you will want to see.&quot; Stardove stated mysteriously.<br>
<br>
Quickly Kreigan donned his gear he strapped his axe on his back and grabbed an unusual sword he had recently aquired. The sword seemed at first glance to be a terrible weapon, flashy design and unbalanced, but it had the unique property of disappearing if not held for a while. It had been a very useful find just for that feature.<br>
<br>
Kreigan was still buttoning his tunic when Stardove grabbed his arm and pulled him out the door. He followed her quick pace across the twisty rope bridges of Kelethin and down southern lift. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey when are you gonna tell me where we are going anyways?&quot; Kreigan asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shh. No talking.&quot; Stardove scolded.Kreigans look darkened visibly but he continued onward in silence.<br>
<br>
Before he'd met Star, Kreigan had always thought he had known every inch of the Faydark Forest. Everytime Stardove took him into the Fay he realized how little he really knew. She seemed to make trails apear where there were none. Kreigan had learned quickly to stay close or you will soon be lost.<br>
<br>
Kreigan could detect slight signs of a trail that Star seemed to be following. It seemed to be a horse she was tracking, if he wasnt mistaken. Feeling quite pleased that he had been able to see the trail, Kreigan began to think of way to use it to his advantage later.<br>
<br>
Stardove stopped instantly and silently. It was so fast that Kreigan almost walked right into Stardove. Not that he would have minded bumping into her all that much.<br>
<br>
Stardove motioned for him to follow her slowly and quietly. Ahead Kreigan saw fire. A few tents and ramshackle shelters were barely visible through the brush. Tied to a small pine tree was a pony.<br>
<br>
A few men emerged from the tents and began to converse, although Kreigan was too far away to hear what they were saying. Starvove wispered in his, those men have stolen many things from the good people of kelethin. I want them to see justice.<br>
<br>
Kreigan looked curiously at the Wood Elf. From what he had heard these bandits were strictly low profile, known to heist only from the well to do.<br>
<br>
In any case he would now have to capture these men...the law was the paw after all. Kreigan abandoned all pretenses of silence and walked casually in to the camp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good evening gentlemen.&quot; The men took one brief look at eachother and lunged instantly for Kreigan. One immediately caught him from behind and began to plant a dagger into Kreigans heart.<br>
<br>
Kreigan grabed that hand by the wrist and jerked upward. A sickening popping noise accompanied the broken limb. Immediately Kreigan kicked outward and connected with a second mans throat. Straining for air the man fell backwards.<br>
<br>
Kriegans Vellium axe was instantly in his hand. With blinding speed the axe swung to Kreigans right, impaling itself in a dirty man with foul breath's skull. The mans arms twiched violently and he fell.<br>
<br>
Calmly Kreigan looked around for the next target. A tall thin man wearin a rusty set of iron mail stepped out of one of the tents. He quickly assessed the situation around him.<br>
<br>
Drawing a pair of huge hunting knives he charged at Kreigan yelling something incomprehensivle. Kreigan planted his feet and waited for the attack.<br>
<br>
Clumsily the man swung both knives down in a crossing pattern. Kreigan parried the poorly executed manuever easily and ook advantage of the position. He took the long spike at the center of his axe and drove it through the eye socket of the flailing bandit.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later everything was over. Looking around he caught sight of Stardove huddled in close conversation with another Wood Elf. <br>
<br>
Kreigan closed his eyes. He knew who it was even before he was close enough to see. It was Dekasha Stardoves older sister, As intrigued Kreigan was with Stardove, he could not stand her sister for one moment. <br>
<br>
As he approached the two , he heard faint giggling. &quot;Thanks for getting Dekashas pony back Kreig. Those nasty men stole the poor little thing and were gonna sell it to the Gnomes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But...&quot; Kreigan stammered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks for the help hon see you later.&quot; Before he could ask any further questions the two disapeared into the forest.<br>
<br>
Well this is exactly what i expected to happen. Kreigan thought to himself sarcastically. It suddenly dawnd on him that he was lost.  <p>One name. Many Faces.

(very long)</span><hr size=1> Kepelus was completely at peace. The Library of Erudin had been his favorite place since he was young. The tables were made from Red Oak as were the benches. The faint smell of wood oil was present. <br>
<br>
The entire facility was spotless. No trace of dirt could be detected on the marble floors. Kepelus expected no less from Emnu, the library's caretaker. Nothing was out of order, and that was exactly what he was looking for.<br>
<br>
Kepelus sat down at a table somewhat distant from the main entrance, though it was not in the very back. He didnt want to seem reclusive, so he ignited both of the oil lamps that were positioned at either end of the table.<br>
<br>
Kepelus placed his traveling pack on the hard oak. He began to rummage through its contents. After removing several of the larger contents, he withdrew an thin leatherbound book. He placed the book on the table and sat down. The book was in actuality his personal journal. He stored many observations and calculations within its pages.<br>
<br>
Recently he had been sketching patterns of conjuration threads. He theorized that it was possible to summon enough threads to weave completely around another individual. If that was to occurr, he would be able to summon the target of the spell directly before him.<br>
<br>
Kepelus began sketching though his mind wasnt completely focused on it. It seemed he was caught in tidal wave of questions he had no answers for. <br>
<br>
A tall Erudite entered the library. He was wearing a simple brown robe of a commoner. Kepelus smiled to himself. He liked to see people making use of the vast knowledge collected within in these walls. The man was young, maybe 25 years aged. <br>
<br>
The man selected a book off the shelf and took a seat at a table near Kepelus. &quot;Good evening sire,&quot; the man said with a slight bow, &quot;I hope you are enjoying the dusk.&quot; &quot;I am thank you.&quot; Kepelus replied.<br>
<br>
Kepelus could sense the man was capable of using magic. More than likely the man had no idea that he could be taught to weave some basic spells. Kepelus always fet a tinge of pity for those who never had the opportunity to utilize their innate magical abilities.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a young woman burst into the door. She hurriedly whispered some frantic word to Emnu and they both rushed out of the library. His curiosity piqued, Kepelus quickly gathered his things and followed the two. To his surprise so did the young man.<br>
<br>
There was some sort of commotion a few blocks north, near the palace. Kepelus quickly gathered information from one of the nearby citizens. Apparently a young enc had brought in a wild beast from the forest, and was doing tricks with it to amuse his friends. Unfortuneatley, the Charm spell had worn off before the beast was returned to the forest and now the thing was running loose through the streets.<br>
<br>
Kepelus thought to help the situation so he continued toward the palace. Not too far from the palace steps at a small fruit stand Kepelus spotted a large brown creature. It was covered in fur. It seemed to be almost like a huge dog with muscular arms and legs. Kepelus immediately reconized the beast. It was a Kobold.<br>
<br>
The Kobold was gorging on apples from a barrel that it had knocked over. Kepelus began to cast a spell. Almost instanty the ground erupted aound the Kobold. A creature made up mostly of earth and rock emerged. The creature was vaguely humanoid, having legs that merged directly into the ground instead of forming feet.<br>
<br>
Recovering from the initial shock, the Kobold lunged at the earth creature's neck. The creature grabbed the Kobold in one hand and held out at arms length. Immediately thick branch like roots came up from the earth and surrounded the Kobold. <br>
<br>
Though the Kobold tried very hard he could not break free of the roots. Kepelus motioned for his pet to move away from the helpless Kobold. Instantly the creatured obeyed. A few more words and Kepelud conjured a small pool molten rock above the beast. In the next second the liquid rock fell fell from its place in the air and enveloped the Kobold. It happened so fast that the Kobold felt no pain. <br>
<br>
All that remained was a smoldering pile of fur and wood. The stench was less than pleasant. Mentally he commanded his pet to dispose of the remains. A few people around clapped softly. Kepelus turned to see that quite a few citizens had been watching the display. Kepelus closed his eyes and bowed politely. <br>
<br>
&quot;That was impressive.&quot; the man from the library said calmly. Kepelus nodded breifly at the man, more concerned with removal of the foul Kobolds corpse. Ofhandedly Kepelus said &quot;You possess the ability to weave magic as well sir. Perhaps with practice one day you will be able to do the same thing.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps I will one day be your equal or even your superior. Anything is possible.&quot; the man stated evenly. Kepelus looked at the man oddly. That was not the response e had expected to get. The man just stood there staring at Kepelus, his expresion was unreadable. &quot;Perhaps...&quot; Kepelus said cautiosly. Slowly he turned from the man, and walked back to the library. The man didnt follow.<br>
<br>
Once back at the library Kepelus began transcribing the days events into his journal. He couldnt help but embelishing slightly on some of the smaller details of the encounter. After a while his thoughts turned to the man he had met here earlier. The stranger not been surprised in the least to hear that he had magical capabilites, so why then did he choose not to excercise them? Kepelus sighed in slight frustration. This was yet another question he had no answer for. <br>
<br>
After a few hours of scribing, Kepelus decided the time had come to leave the library, and Erudin alltogether. He needed answers, and he had a feeling he knew where to start looking.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Vizier watched Kepelus walk back towards the library. When he was out of sight, Vizier let go of the Erudite illusion. <br>
<br>
After seeing the display with the Kobold. He knew he was no match for the mage when it came to using magic destructively. <br>
<br>
It had been easy to get Kepelus to reveal some of his techniques with the kobold, though Vizier was far from done learning about Kepelus. Vizier had a plan to achieve his goals, but even the slightest miscalculation could lead to disaster. He needed every advantage he could get if he was to succeed.  <p>One name. Many Faces.
