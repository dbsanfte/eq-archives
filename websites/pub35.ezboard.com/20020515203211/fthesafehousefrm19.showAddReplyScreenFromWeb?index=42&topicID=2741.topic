At the time this idea/thread was started, Darkness Falls was just on test where he plays (I assume) and has access to its goodies, which includes the +5 envenom jewel and such.<br>
<br>
<br>
But like other posters, please stick to your class 3DKnight, thats Infiltrators.  Its not your job to ask for nerfs to all assassins globally, and I would argue to not ask for nerfs at all (that job belongs to the teamleads of your prey).<br>
<br>
<br>
I've seen some of your posts on the vault, including one recently about some kiting tactic where it took you 2 minutes to kill a warrior with the superior envenoms (perf/venom/run repeat)  My fights are over in 1 second (one shot), or 10 seconds.  If it lasts 11 then the extra delay is usually from my camera rotating to look down on my corpse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udiirkethwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diirketh Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/11/02 3:49:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thorune.com/images/wolf.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I waited til I calmed down</span><hr size=1> And in the end I come up with two lines of thought. One in which I have to accept a change for the worse and hope for the best, the second, where I look only to the best and see the proposed 'balances' ignored by the developers.<br>
<br>
If I were forced to accept a change, I could live with keeping the +envenom on to get to 50 envenom. However that would still suck, but I could still live with it. Any changes to stealth as proposed would see me drop my account. <br>
<br>
If I had the extra spec points I could see the argument better for both counts, but alas, I do not have those points. That given I am behind in the power between differing races. The shout spell given to me to have my live up to being the most magical of assasins is quite a joke. It does have its uses, but I would much much rather have the spec points the infils got. The ONLY way to make the stealth change viable is to give all three classes the extra spec points.<br>
<br>
Respec would be a disaster, and I didn't even get the auto train benefit in my template as I learned of it too late. Those changes would not balance out the classes. It would only serve to benefit the infiltrator class, all around. I have yet to see an argument that shows that it would put infils on an even par with shades and blades. If it is such a critical issue then remove the extra .3 spec points from the infils! Then in return give them different levels of bolts for the crossbow. Then they would have a crying joke of an addition like the hp's and shout the shades and blades got. That seems fair to me, how about you folks? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrisbanoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brisbanoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/11/02 6:39:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Interesting</span><hr size=1> Level 50 Infiltrator on Galahad, 37 envenom, 50 with items/rvr rewards.<br>
<br>
First off, it is an interesting proposition, but it goes against other game premises, such as +enhance items adding to buffs after the buff is cast, and the caster removes the item that gives the + to enhance.<br>
<br>
Secondly, 3DKnight, I think you do over estimate your support on this. I don't think many people want to have a current ability removed, even with a promise of respec. I know I don't want to give up my 65 points I got from autotraining to 44. Nor do I want to give up the points I got as sort of a 'bonus' for the 2.5 spec point revamp.<br>
<br>
Third, why don't you concentrate on pushing for a fix that actually allows me to apply poison to a blade that is equipt in my main hand that gives a + to envenom. You recognize that no weapon in your mainhand gives you any bonus to envenom even if it says it does right? You have tried this out, right? If I have a 50 envenom total (2 blades, +3 rvr rewards, +2 fishing hook), and I put a thrusting frenzy in my mainhand, and a thrusting frenzy in my offhand, I cannot apply Lifebane to either blade, even though my stat reads that I have a 50 skill in envenom. In order to apply lifebane, I have to take the thrusting frenzy blade out of my mainhand, put it on my back slot, select it as the primary weapon, then any blade I put in my main hand can be envenomed. <br>
<br>
Since your whole 'must have equipt to use' proposition would essentially make the offhand slot useless, with the mainhand currently useless, I have to vote no. If you retain the back slot as counting towards the + to envenom, then you possibly might have my support. However, the current weapons that give a + to envenom are not particularly good, and being pinched into always using them in primary and offhand renders them useless to me.<br>
<br>
While  I don't particularly like SBs and NSs getting lifebane with a possible 29 envenom (+11 items, +10 RvR), under the current setup, it is possible, but it would take a LOT of juggling to get it to work, and a lot of time RvRing to earn a reward. <br>
<br>
I don't think its a huge issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upeebs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peebs</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/11/02 7:04:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting</span><hr size=1> A TL shouldn't just be there to beg Mythic for upgrades, which is what some of you seem to be getting at.

And don't even get started with the 'I don't have enough spec points' stuff, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

While I don't agree 100% with what Knight has to say (removing auto-train, natural stealth over 40 getting a bonus).  I DO agree that you should have to *wear* your envenom items to get benefit from them.  Does any other class get to &quot;take off&quot; an item and still have the benefits that the item provides?<br>
   As far as I'm concerned its a bug that lets your poisoned item go off when you don't have the skill to use the poison.  Isn't that the point of having the skill?  From now on should I be allowed to put on my +Dual wield items, take them off before combat for +thrust items and cry because my +DW bonus isn't still there?  Think about what you're really saying here.  We should get the benefits of items without wearing items...thats just wrong regardless of whether you're an infiltrator, nightshade, shadowblade or ANY other class...  If you want the bonus, wear the item, its that simple.<br>

as I said in my earlier post, infiltrator can still have 39 stealth, 39 critial strike and  39 melee skill, if they need to bring envenom to 50, the only thing they have to sacrifice is 10% chance to hit with both weapons,<br>
<br>
but for nightshades and shadowblades, they would have to either sacrifice their melee skill or their envenom skill.<br>
<br>
As a nightshade, I already have the least hp and do the least damage, the chance of me killing someone in one hit or two is alot smaller than the other two, so I have to rely heavily on envenom to get my work done, a change in envenom will be davatating for us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwanderings0ul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wanderings0ul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/11/02 8:22:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting</span><hr size=1> oops, misread the 3dknight's message,  my apology, I do aggree that you have to have your envenom item eqed for the poison to proc.<br>

Trade-offs are part of the game (and what makes it fun), and right now we are getting something for nothing (there is very little reason and reward for using up scarce skill points to train past 39 in stealth and envenom). <br>
<br>
The changes to envenom and stealth would create more balance and add more individuality to the class, an excellent goal IMHO. <br>
