I was in Sol A looking for some clockwork oil stout after receiving the note from Lon. I gave a shout if there was anyone selling the stout. I got a reply from Abzzolute, who if i remember, was a 45 Necro. He said he had some but i would have to come to him. Well this was my first time in zone so I had no idea how to find him. I was using hide/sneak and came to the lava pool with the island that has drawbridges on it. He told me to swim across the pool. So i jump in start swimming. You are burned 38 points damage. Over and over. I try to get out of lava on the other side and I can't get out. I am thinking why can't I get out. Doh, I am swimming with hid/sneak still on that's why I can't get out. I try to turn off sneak, but by this time I see Loading, Please Wait. Dang it I am steamed. I was bound in Greater Fay. No way I want to run and jump on a boat so I go into Butcherblocks and shout for a gg to Lavastorm. No druids in zone so I do a /who all druid 39-45. I see a L40 druid in Unrest so I give her a tell saying sorry to bother you but i could use your help. Her name was Negina I believe. she said she was camping the ghost, but asked me what i needed. i explained to her what had happened and she came to butcherblocks and gave me a gg to Lavastorm. Free! Thanked her immensely and she only told me to help someone myself to complete the circle. I get back in Sol A and am talking with Abzzolute again. He offers to get my corpse for me so I give him consent and somehow he dies in the lava pool as well. I log and come back the next day. See Abzzolute in the zone and he tells me that he got his body. i told him I still had not gotten mine, so he offers to pull it out for me again. This time it works and he dragged my corpse to the zone for me. Then he gave me a stout to boot. (CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE THE PURSE LADY SPAWNS AND HOW TO GET THERE) The next day (this morning) I completed the circle that these two began. I had gotten the axe from the poisener in DC and was on my way to High Pass. I get to Kithicor at night and see a naked dwarf run by me. Did a /who and seen it was a L5 Dwarf cleric. I gave him a tell saying he was mighty brave to be running through Kithicor at night being as young as he was. He said he was on his way to Qeynos to meet some friends. He had died in N Karanas from a lion and could not get a gg back for his corpse. By this time his corpse would have rotted seeing as he was only L5 and they rot after like 20 min. I know how dangerous this trip is to Qeynos from Freeport. I ended up escorting him to Qeynos. When we got there I gave him some extra banded armor I had in the bank, bought him a tarnished mace and gave him a few plat to help him out considering he had lost his corpse. I am not blowing my own horn here. Just trying to point out how generous people are and how we shouldf treat the others in the game. There is nothing I hate more in the game than a rude, obnoxious person who tries to force their opinions and playing tactics on you. If everyone would just treat others and they would like to be treated themselves this game would be much more fun. C ya all in game.<br>
