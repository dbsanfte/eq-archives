He was driving an excursion and towing a boat. I doubt he was the redneck Radahr portray's him as. He was probably honking at the semi driver, and he's got Radahr getting in his face about it.<br>
<br>
I mean honestly, none of you have ever done anything annoying? You think someone would have been within their rights to manhandle you from your vehicle and break your nose? I understand the desire to kick people's asses when they annoy you, I have that desire sometimes too, but really, I'm not 7 years old anymore. <br>
<br>
Congrats Radahr, you broke a guy's nose because you were in an irratible mood. You should get a @#%$ medal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uladykaylan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lady Kaylan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 2:53:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8767.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://agentsofanarchy.homestead.com/files/crazycat.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: any one remember?</span><hr size=1> He should get a @#%$ medal.<br>
<br>
opinion -<br>
I agree with Mythas ... I wouldn't mind going back to the days where if someone acted out of line, they got their ass handed to them.  Most (oh no!  Generalization!) people are rude because they know they can get away with it.  Who's going to do anything?  No one.  You can ask them to stop.  Nada.  You can threaten them to stop.  No go.  Why?  'Cause no ones actually going to do anything.  All bark and no bite.  Sometimes violence is a good solution (woohoo, go go video game lessons!).  <br>
<br>
Heh, I think bringing back duels would be great.  The ol' 10 paces and shoot kind .. and make 'em use the old flintlock pistols too!<br>
<br>
Point?  I had one ... somewhere.  If you see it, let me know. <p><CENTER>

Sheesh i wish my horn was powerful enough to move semis. That guy was just being an arse to be an arse.

<br>
     &quot;duh i wanna go...honk...semi not moving...but...i wanna go...honk...oh man getting mad at me...but i wana go...honk...man say something else agian..*innerthought : semi still not moving maybe if i honk more he will* ...honk...oh, man really mad now...but...i wanna go...honk... hrm man comming back to be my arse...&quot;<br>
<br>
I mean that guy certinly did nothing to help his self in that situation, he was just being a moron, and not helping the over all situation either...he did not have the common decency to stop when some one asks him to stop. Its people like that, that deserve a punch in the face, they need to wake up. <br>
<br>
* Long similar self story incomming *   Its kind of like a thing that i did...In High School, there was a boy, who was the superintendants son...So, he thought he was big stuff, he had a large older brother ( i mean this guy was 6' 3&quot; and 220 lbs of solid steel, which was intimidating to most people...<br>
<br>
    Anyways said younger brother started to make fun of me, which is fine, but then he started to make fun of my GF ( which incase for all you people that sided with the redneck you don't do ) so right in the middle of the hall during class change he got what was comming to him. He said his usualy comments, with his friends around ( key part, he never opens his mouth w/o his friends ) about my self and my GF. So one day i just snap. I calmly walk over to him, then suddenly grab him by the neck, and slam his face into the wall, busting both of his lips open and breaking his nose, he's ko'ed *I R teh winar* little to my knowledge his big brother saw this and started running down the hall Po'ed assuredly.<br>
<br>
     Its a long hall, so i notice people moving outa his way..and he is picking up speed..I notice that he is running straight up, when he gets about 100 feet in front of me, he starts raising his fist...still standing straight up. So i take my football skeelz and right when he is about to hit me, i lower my shoulder and hit him in his gut, and use his momentum to flip him over me, he lands with a thud on the nice soft concrete floor, i get my self up and walk over to him, and say what i think the whole student body wanted to hear &quot; who's afraid of you now B@#$%&quot; then whack one right in the nose...I get up, still a lil woozy from being knocked over my self, and all the kids are cheering, but then school police come in and pick me up, and take me to the office...* that = teh suq!<br>
<br>
      So the boys father ( member he is the super intendant of our whole city area, so he has l33t powa ) comes in raging mad, all of a sudden gets in my face, and is yelling at me, and he asks me why, so i tell him what his two sons do to people and how they act, this calms him down right quick. anyways, i get expelled. However talking on my friends on-line i ask him to start a petition to tell about students and thier encounters with his sons. 200 people write in, and 300 sign, saying / agreeing to his sons behavior in that they had similar incidences ( being made fun of, picked on etc, and felt they could do nothing about it )...So to make a long story short, i get re-enrolled 3 days later ( an original 1 year suspension ) and his two boys get expelled from the HS and moved to a private school...<br>
<br>
3 years from now, and the two boys are as humble as anything, they do not pick on people, and to be honest are now outstanding citizens...<br>

Personally, i think these two stories goes to show, sometimes it just takes a rather harsh diciplining to correct something. Believe it or not ghandi, sometimes violence is the answer. to the posters attacking rahdar you are just as bad, violently attacking him with words, and from my experience words hurt far worse than fists, i still haven't over come the social stigma that boy had inflicted on me, but his nose is fine, you can't even tell...but anyone around me knows i still have problems with just the words he has said, which over time, go really deep into a persons heart and soul...So congrats radahr for teaching that man a lesson, hopefully he doesn't continue his rudish, and obnoxious behavior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usneakstershenanigans.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sneakster Shenanigans</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/dagger.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 11:08:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8767.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what good?</span><hr size=1> Thank Jebus for people like Mythas /roll eyes<br>

Don't tell me the few people disagreeing with Radahr are 'violently hurting him with words'.  Nothing has been said to violently insult him.  I really find nothing heroic about you sucker-slamming some kid and then punching his older brother in the face for trying to defend him.  In my opinion just turning the other cheek would have made you the bigger man.  Fight violence with violence, don't fight words (or horns) with violence.<br>
<br>
And I seriously doubt that you breaking some guy's nose made them outstanding citizens.  More like them just growing up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umythasgrimlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mythas Grimlore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 1:18:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8767.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> i got tired</span><hr size=1> Yeah, i know turning the other way makes me a bigger man. However, its constantly turning the other cheek, for months on end, thats when it gets to me. It enraged me so much that nothing was being done to lots of other people like me, where they turn the other cheek...e.g ( kinda the same )<br>
<br>
Terrorists?? What do you want done about them? Lets put your family in a building, and have some one blow it up, yet, you nor the government is allowed to do anything about it. Just turn the other cheek, no biggy...<br>
<br>
I know said example is a little out of context, but it all boils down to the same thing, its easy to say when its not you. And if it is you, and it makes you hurt, then stand up for yourself because no one is better than anyone else, and no one deserves to be treated like that. I got tired of being pushed down, over and over and over agian. After a while, those things that he said really began to sink in, it seemed his whole existance was to make mine horrid. So, one day, i stood up for my self. Don't get me wrong i tried to get him to stop before * appologies for not putting that in the story * but yes i verbally asked him to stop many a time. It seemed everytime i asked him to stop he only did it more...<br>
<br>
Maybe some people are too meek to stand up for themselves, thats fine. Maybe some people have the strenght, steadfastness * not a word but you get the idea *, and faith of job, but i don't. I prefer to stand for my self, and i just got tired of turning the other cheek, i got tired of going home and telling my self those things aren't true, and having it not work...I got tired of dreading every day of school...So i decided to rid my self of my problems. <br>
<br>
Roll your eyes all you want, turn your other cheek, i just hope you have something in your life that makes you miserable day in and day out, and see what you do. If you are the kind of person that can just let it roll off your shoulder then kudos to you. However, if you can't i'd like to see what you could do...Could you save your family if need be, or would you just let what ever was happening happen??? Its always easy to say to do something until it happens to you...<br>

If he had hit you first, then there really wouldn't be a problem.  Its when you let the words get to you and strike back with violence that you have done wrong.  I would much rather fight words with words.  Say that day he'd chewed you out bad, so you punched him.  The next week he cornered you with a bat and hit you in the head.  Next week you brought a knife and shanked him.  Maybe he'd die, maybe he'd live.  Next him or his brother shoots you.  All because he said some stuff that wasn't true.  Maybe you were justified, maybe you weren't.  Its hard to say what I would do if I was in a similar position.  I think you (Mythas) were more justified in what you did that Radahr.  <br>
<br>
In the end, violence doesn't make people better people.  If got some bully of your back, which is cool.  But it could have ended differently. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uragwheed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ragwheed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 2:37:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8767.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://wombat.homestead.com/files/2Daa.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i got tired</span><hr size=1> Moral of the story?

<br>
There is no right or wrong in either situation...  Sometimes it's better to turn the other cheek, and sometimes to stand up for yourself...  But it's up to that person to decide which is for them. <br>
<br>
Anybody trying to judge them who wasn't there, and is sitting here telling them they're wrong should probably not bother...  Cause, well, simply put you weren't there, and you don't know what really happened.<br>
<br>
Both of them could be right, or wrong, but they both feel they were right, which is all that should matter, really.  It's their choice whether or not it was worth it...  Not yours, or anyone elses.<br>
<br>
The brittish definatly thought Sam Adams was @#%$ wrong, and now he's in US history books as a hero...  Perspective.<br>
