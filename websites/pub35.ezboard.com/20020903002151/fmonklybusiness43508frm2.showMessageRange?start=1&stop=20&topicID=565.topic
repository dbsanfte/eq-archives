Every server has a few of those, and every server has a few of those that are very good at what they do and often put uber guild vaults to shame. In this guide I will try to explain some of the princibles behind advanced trading and hopefully give you some insight into that field.<br> <br>Trading is probably the only occupation in EverQuest that is entirely different than everything else you can do in EverQuest (IE: kill stuff) and yet very similar to real life. Everyone knows the phrase &quot;Supply versus Demand&quot; yet few people know what it means to them in EverQuest let alone real life. <br> <br>So what does it mean? Am I going to tell you to invest in stuff that's going to go up in demand and down in supply? Hell no! First of all, supply is technically never going to drop in EverQuest as nothing breaks down. As for demand, that is unpredictable. You never know what new items are going to be introduced tommorow and therefore you can forget about trying to make long term investments. <br> <br>So how can you make a buck at trading? The answer is to take advantage of the people who do a lot of the killing in EverQuest and a bit of the trading. Sounds harsh? It is. The only way you could make money trading is by making other people lose it. They may not realise it. People may not frown upon such money making, But that does not change the fact that you're making money on the expense of others.<br> <br>Still interested? Great. So what do you need to do in order to take advantage of those people who spend their time killing mobs? Two things, mainly.<br> <br>First, you need to make a name for yourself. This is the hard part. Basically, if you sit in your server's trading zone long enough (At least a few weeks) buying and selling (Even if you buy and sell at the same price, you've still gained something - Reputation) you will eventually be recognized as a trader. What does that mean? That you will begin getting tells from various people. Some will want to know if you can get them a bloodpoint for that Heriophant's cloak they just got. Some will want to know if you can get them a Heripphant's cloak for the bloodpoint they just got. And some will want to know how many flawless diamonds you can get for their guild as they need 73 of them and have quite a few things in their guild vault. Now, on to the next thing you need.<br> <br>Flexability. Along with getting buyers, you also need to get sellers. This means you first of all need to aspire to have most of your assets in a liquid state (Either platinium or very easily sold equipment). In addition it helps greatly to know what guild is fighting where, who is farming what and who just got a cool item in a GM quest. All that info in conjunction with liquid assets would allow you to take advantage of your reputation.<br> <br>Finally, a couple of points to remember.<br> <br>Reputation comes in two forms - good reputation and a bad one. By default, you will not have a good one as a heavy trader. People don't really like traders. They know you're making money on their expense. While they are happy to get the item they want from you they will curse your name the day after when their friend logs on and tell them they could have got it for half the price. The only way to get a good reputation short of giving stuff away is to offer refunds as long as it is viable for you to do so. Suprisingly, a bad reputation is just as effective for trading as a good one, or so I have discovered. And you're not likely to become richer, even in the long run by having a good reputation. HOWEVER, keep in mind you may actually want to continue playing EverQuest some day, and when that day comes a good reputation would go a lot further than phat lewt.<br> <br>Before finnishing I would like to leave you with one more tip. If you happen to have two copmuters it is tremendously beneficial to be trading with two different chars at the same time. You must make sure no one knows you are both chars or you will gain nothing of it. You can use your alternate char (Even if it doesn't have a rep) to fish out sellers and buyers to find out exactly what they are after before making offers with your main charactar. There are also more malicious ways of using a second charactar, but I'm not going to point them out as they I personally condem them and they can get you in trouble with GMs (Which will already be on your back when you've got 500k in the bank). Unfortunately it doesn't take someone with a very active imagination to come up with these malicious ways so I wouldn't be surprised if many of you were victims to such abuse.<br> <br>If you have any questions, feel free to E-mail me at qqq@netvision.net.il<br>- Good luck, Q.<br> <br>  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Q</A> at: 10/10/01 5:01:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utaehoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taehoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/01 5:15:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced trading.</span><hr size=1> Aaaaaalllll you have to do, is place one TINY classified ad, and then in literally 10 seconds, you're a quadzillionaire.

I know it's already mentioned, but this is one point that will make you some profits.  You have to know the general price range of an item in order to weasel a cheaper price if you buy, and maybe a slight profit if you sell.<br><br>Here's some points that I think should help:<br><br>1) You must have some measure of *people* skill.  Haggling is an art form!  So you have to be nice and convincing while trying to exact some profit from the person you're dealing with.<br><br>2) Never ask for a price check!  The other person will know that you don't know jack about the item you're trying to buy/sell.  That will give him/her the advantage when you haggle.  If you're firm with your offer, then they'll think twice about trying to scam some extra PP off ya.  How do you prevent this?  KNOW YOUR ITEMS!<br><br>3) Know where the hot items come from.  Know how hard it is to get.  How rare is the drop rate.  What kinda shit you have to go through to get it.  This is crucial information and it will help you in your haggling.<br><br>4) When your deals range in the 20+Kpp, it's easier to shave off some PP than it is if the item's worth a couple Kpp.  Example:  Fungi tunic ~35kpp.  When you're dealing with this much PP, you can try to shave off ~1.5kpp-2kpp and it won't matter much (if you're buying).  The higher the price tag, the more you can shave off, most people wouldn't bother haggling to the last PP when they know they'll be a phat PP whore after selling that CoF <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Use this to your advantage.  A couple thousand pp saved here and there will add up.<br><br>5) Try to always get PP from a deal instead of an item.  Why? Because then you'd have to sell that other damn item!  People prefer you pay in PP anyways.  Unless you're making a good trade, then go for it.<br><br>Well that's all I can think up with, but the most important thing is: KNOW YOUR MARKET!  It is a marketing principle!  The better you know the game, the more loop holes you can make for yourself.  And lastly, nobody should feel dirty or bad when they day trade.  It's hard work on your part and think of it as a service that you provide to the dungeon crawlers.   <p><center><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/worldx/street/ken10.gif" border="0"></a></center><font size ="3"><center><b>SHINRYUKEN SHOTOKAN<br><br>"Don't jump scrub!!!"</b></center></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utaunto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taunto</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/lrdkalvan/gnomehead3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/11/01 12:11:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced trading.</span><hr size=1> I used to do this.

Basically, sit your butt down at a camp, hope an item drops, hope you win it, then go to your local auction zone and sell it.<br><br>This has one of the highest potential for earnings for time spent.  IE, an 8 hour camp can net you 10 or 20 k in items.  There are multiple downsides to this of course, you can only camp items of which you're of sufficient level and have access to the relevant zones.  Then there is the actual moving of the item.  Moving an item can take anywhere from 15 mins to 15 days depending on the item.<br><br>Small but high demand items tend to move fast, big high demand items tend to move slowly.<br><br>The more expensive the item, the more difficult it is to sell regardless of the level of demand.<br><br>I know that sounds strange, but think of things this way.  Everyone and their kid brother may want that 100 k CoF, but how many people actually HAVE 100 k plat sitting around in their bank accounts?  Not many... so you might get that nice 20 k item, but find that it can take days to weeks to sell.  Or even worse, find that Nobody can buy one because none of the people who want it can afford it.<br><br>Another major downside is item price deflation.  Hot items become very heavily camped making it difficult to supply a steady stream of these items, while over time flooding the market and pushing prices down over time.  Also, addition of new item content tends to heavily obsolete items, further pushing price value down.  Good examples of this are the FBSS, Yaks, Wurmslayers, etc.<br><br>Making Items for Sale<br><br>This falls under trade skills and questing.  IE, go out, collect components, make an item and resell.<br><br>Generally, cash earnings tend to be somewhat low, with the rare exception of Jewelcraft which has medium earning potential.  A good jeweller can probably net 10 to 20 k per week assuming they can get enough of the right components.<br><br>The major downsides to this is the time required to get components, the risk of material loss (failures), as well as steady depreciation of profit margins as more people gain skills in those trades.  Also, the costs of building trade skills can be exceptionally high.  Ranging from 2 k for basic master blacksmithing to in excess of 10 k for grandmaster Blacksmithing, 25 k for Jewelcraft, or 50 to 100 k for skills like Tinkering and Alchemy.<br><br>Making items for Fees<br><br>This falls under trade skills, however instead of manufacturing equipment from components, you simply hire out your skills as a service.<br><br>Cash earning tend to be quite low compared to camping or making items yourself as you're not getting a markup over component cost, however this is one of the most time efficient ways of making cash.  Since you don't collect components, nor do you need to camp items, you make cash anytime anyone needs something made.<br><br>Basically, you make yourself known as a master tradesman, and people contact you regarding the making of items.<br><br>There are multiple downsides, but none other than the time to acquire the skill are major.  These include the cost of the tradeskill (see above) and deflation of skill value as more people gain skills in your tradeskill.  Also, few people tend to pay for trade services unless your tradeskill is *VERY* rare.  People rarely pay for Jewelcraft (everyone has a 250 JC friend), though currently they will still sometimes pay for master Poison, Tinkering, Tailoring and Smithing services due to the tremendous time and costs of reaching 250 in those skills.<br><br>Finally, cash flow is of limited control. You cannot make cash whenever you wish as you need to both build a good reputation as a master tradesman as well as wait for customers to come to you.<br><br>Reselling Items (Middleman)<br><br>This is the most difficult of roads for making plat.<br><br>Essentially, the idea is to purchase items at below market value and then to resell them at current market value or slightly above current market value.<br><br>This requires tremendous time investment.  Those wishing to fulfill this role of middleman needs to master multiple skills including good interpersonal skills, a talent for selling, exceptional patience, all while maintaining constant awareness of server market conditions.<br><br>That being said, trading is probably the most lucrative and most consistent of the methods of earning plat in the game.  There are also multiple major advantages to trading.  Any person can become an in-game trader.  You can do it any time as long as you can get a port or mule to a trading zone.  The amount of money you have to start with doesn't have to be substantial and trades can scale up in size to accomodate your finances and skill level.  It is not limited by your level or class, does not require grouping, and is completely controlled by you.<br><br>That being said, there is considerable risk to trading items.  It is possible to lose plat, and Significant amounts.  I'm sure there's more than a few traders who have cursed themselves over that Mortificator's Staff or Argent Defender that they somehow picked up in a deal.  8P<br><br>Trading is somewhat more of an art than a science, and at it's highest levels can be very complex.<br><br>Since this thread is mostly about trading, I'll specifically address the concept of Trading and levels of complexity.<br><br>Types of Trades<br><br>Plat for gear - This is the simplest trade.  You find an item, buy it for plat at a hopefully good price, and then sell it for plat at hopefully a higher price.  Your profit margin can range tremendously depending upon the timing and your level of integrity.  Essentially, all this requires is a knowledge of the going price of an item to determine whether the buy/sell price is high or low.<br><br>Gear for Gear - This is the next most complex trade.  You have an item (acquired in some way), which you then trade for another item.  Hopefully, the trade works out in your favor as the item you trade for is of higher value than the item you traded away.  Price however is not entirely accurate, as utility often comes into play.  IE, if you NEED an item, you may trade at a loss in order to get that item.  Also, getting a straight item trade is often difficult, as the person who has the item you need does NOT necessarily *want* your item, nor do you want their's.<br><br>Gear + Plat for Gear - More complex than a straight trade in that you're trying to assess both the value of both items, as well as cover the price difference between the items with plat.  This trade complicates the situation as often plat can be a major sticking point.  So now you have the problem of finding someone to trade something you need for something they want or vice versa AND they or you need to have cash onhand.  Many people don't have huge bank accounts to add value to a trade, so executing this sort of trade consistently is more common than straight plat purchases.<br><br>Multi trades - This is the most complex form of trade and can range tremendously from hard to very difficult to assess.  The only thing common to this form of trade is that it usually involves multiple items on one or both sides And can include cash in the mix.<br><br>A typical example of a complex multitrade might be Fungi + Lamentation + 15 k in exchange for Bloodpoint + Mrylokar's Helm + Hiero Cloak + Blue Diamond Bracer.<br><br>There are multiple points of difficulty in making these sorts of trades.  First, you need comprehensive knowledge of item values across the board.  Second, if you're not going to use every item you acquire, you need to accomodate the time of selling as well as inventory space usage into your thought process.  Finally, the higher the total value of the trade, the harder it is to do successfully (IE, at a profit).<br><br>Laotzu's Basic Pointers....<br><br>Okay, so now you have some idea what's involved in trading, so here's some basic tips and rules that I like to go by...<br><br>1)  Integrity.  DON'T lie.  Ever.  Don't lie about the value of an item when you're selling.  You can ask a slightly higher than market price (like 10 to 20 percent), but don't tell someone a 1 k item is worth 10 k.  If someone mentions that they saw your 10 k item go for 8 k, no problem.  They can spend 2 days waiting for the next one to show up.<br><br>Yes, you can get a few more bucks by cheating someone, but if someone knows you deliberately charged them an exorbitant amount, it does nothing but hurt your customer base.  Not to mention, it will cost you in ports, rezzes, xp groups etc in the long run.<br><br>2)  Your word is your bond.  Once you make a deal, for good or for bad, go through with it.  Don't go back to market holding out for a higher price once you've agreed to a deal.  It might net you a few more plat that sale, but it will leave a bad taste in people's mouths, and word travels fast.<br><br>3)  Bargains.  Watch for items below market.  When you spot one, don't volunteer information.  If someone is selling an item for 1/2 of the going market price, don't offer them more.  Don't procrastinate.  Send a tell immediately, buy it, and then sell it at the correct market price.  If you feel uncomfortable with reselling it immediately, hold it for a day or two before you start auctioning.<br><br>4)  Desperate buyers.  Okay, sometimes a person comes along who KNOWS the current market price on an item, but really Wants to buy it and buy it right now.  In these situations, *ANY* price you agree on is fair.  As long as both of you know that the price is substantially above market price, then there's nothing wrong.  If a person is that desperate to get item_XXX today, this minute, this second, then they should expect to pay a premium.  They might say, &quot;But it only goes for X...&quot;.  On the other hand, you can always tell them, &quot;True, but that's the price I'm asking.&quot;<br><br>5)  Don't fall in love with a trade.  Always be willing to walk away.  Don't try to haggle if it's clear they're not going to haggle.  And never feel obligated to buy anything unless you've agreed to the deal.<br><br>6)  Don't be afraid to pay a premium if you truly NEED an item.  If you want to buy an item and it's something you need and will use for a long time, don't let price stand in your way unless you see it for sale 3x a day.  IE, that Cloak of Flames might theoretically only go for 80, but how often do you actually see one for sale?  If you actually NEED that CoF, IE you're not going to resell, then BUY IT even if it's a little expensive.  6 months of play time in that cool new piece of gear is worth Alot more than 6 months trying to save some plat here and there.<br><br>7)  Get off your duff and do some trading!<br><br>This should be enough to get anyone started.  Keep in mind, that trading is actually amazingly complex, and a person could probably write a huge multi-page document on successful trading in the EQ economy.<br><br>However, regardless of whatever guides are written, trading requires experience.  You just gotta get out there and do it.<br><br>If you're good, you can outfit your characters in whatever buyable gear you desire, AND have a bank account that makes people /boggle.<br><br>LaotzuQigong<br>60 Grandmaster<br>Legendary<br>The Tribunal <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uskekofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skek of Vazaelle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/18/01 2:55:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced trading.</span><hr size=1> Ahh such inspiration and about 600pp sitting in my alts bank account <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Great oak trees grow from little acorns...I hope! <p>Skek.

Why?  I enjoy it, I like the feeling of slowly working my way up, I like the feeling of doing a good profitable trade.<br><br>I started with 800pp from various loots (wisps, bandit sashes, etc) and now have approx 300k in equipment and have gotten a chance to try virtually all the tradeable monk goodies in the game.  It's fun, and yes I've been using my main Character, Jorlen of Drinal to do it all along and have made dozens of great friends and even got myself into a great guild.  I've never ripped anyone off, I hate scammers and I play the market as a fair trader, and spend about 30% or more of my time in North Freeport (trading area on my server).<br><br>Quick tips: <br><br> - Try your best to be nice to people, even if they're rude to you (it's hard sometimes).  <br><br>- Alot of people will try to lower your price by intimidation, bogus trades, insults or by bashing the item itself, a crude way of haggling, so simply ignore them, move on and look for a true buyer.<br><br>- Go for the sure sale items (haste items, right-clicky items, popular weaponry, etc) and slowly but surely work your way up.  You'll get to know sure sale items eventually.<br><br>- Keep an open mind - some days may be rough, no sales or buys.  Usually it's feast or famine - one day you'll rack in the good trades and others you may even loose out.<br><br>- Know your items, know the proc level of weaponry / effect items, know the stat boots and their advantages, know the item INSIDE AND OUT!  This is crucial because when auctioning you need to point these out.<br><br>- Be honest, yes there are honest traders, and unless you wanna be making new alts everyday you need to keep a good reputation.  <br><br>- When YOU in turn want something, get the plat.  Everyone needs platnium, no exceptions, and you'll always get what you want if you offer to PAY for it.  Trading for specific items with specific items is hard, time consuming and discouraging.<br><br>It's tons of fun, it's also a great way to pass time and meet new interesting people.  Much of what I've learned about the game itself came from conversations with other traders, it is very resourceful.  Anyhow,  I wish you all best of luck, and if you on drinal, send me a tell anytime for item info, I just may be able to help you, and if I can, it will be my pleasure.<br><br> - Jorlen 53 monk of Drinal (60 days logged)<br><br>BTW - It's extrelemy addictive <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/usnoogins47.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snoogins47</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/22/01 12:24:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/miggadabooyah/Breucepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trading</span><hr size=1> My best thing was probably...<br><br><br>I turned a peacebringer into an IFS + a war with about 10k worth of equip.<br><br>And I had basically &quot;settled&quot; for the IFS because like it's been said, I NEEDED it. <br><br>It's a very fun and lucrative hobby, but it can get frustrating if you have a few bad nights.<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ughoumer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghoumer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/22/01 1:15:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Advanced Trading</span><hr size=1> I started off in the Trading biz about the time my pet, myself being a Magician, was able to handle Wisps on his own, or, with my help. I had also recently just started on Tailoring, also.<br><br>I had noticed people buying Greater Lightstones for about 7-8pp each. So, I would spend hours hunting the little buggers down, often collecting 10-20 of them at a time. This gave me enough money to start buying other stuff for resale and profit. It also let me work more steadily on my Tailoring.<br><br>So, I basically lived in East and West Commons from 12th level on up till now, 26th level, only occasionally going out for experience, working on my tailoring, hunting greens for materials (pelts and silks) and working the auctions. Once I started making Cured silk, 10 slot backpacks and Wu's Gauntlets, I started to make the serious cash. I had bought several items for about ½ to 1/3 price and resold them for almost list price. Then, Wu's Fighting Armor came out and I've been averaging a couple kpp a week in sales. I took a month off from the game soon after the Wu's armor came out and when I came back, I am now one of the few people that still sell it regularly. I sell it for 10pp per AC &amp; AGI.<br><br>I have traded items that I have made with Tailoring for loot that I re-sell for sometimes 10 times the value of the item I selling.

Example, you can pick up endless supplies of batwings and sell them for 3pp a stack to casters in a pinch who don't want to &quot;hunt&quot; them down- pun intended.  You can buy a stack for a few gp and make 10x what you paid.  Now, like I said, this isn't to make enough for a Fungi Tunic, although I never tried to make that much... but it could make you some good cash for those Wu Wristbands you saw in N. Freeport!  Also, that reminds me, in N. Freeport, you can almost always find Wu Wear at many of the vendors (Tunare Serv).  They sell at 'bout 1/3 going rate at the EC Tunnel.

For some reason or other it seems people have a soft spot for the girls and will often give them better deals etc. Personally I always assume that the person is male at the keyboard but I still catch myself giving free pp and items to newbie wood elf women ;)<br><br>As mentioned before PATIENCE is likely the most important skill. Don't rush it just take your time and get the price you want.<br><br>If you come across a new item and you want to figure out roughly what its worth there are a few things to consider. One how difficult was it going to obtain? if it comes from Crushbone your not going to get 10k for it.<br>Secondly Who can use it? Good example is that nice staff, its a 32 dam 36 del 2hb but its ranger only. Personally I have yet to meet a ranger with 2hb over skill 4 and most of them just want to duel weild. This item should be worth  about 8-10k when you compare it to some of the other nice weapons out there but goes for about 1-2k on Xev since it is not sought after. The larger your market the better. Singing steel stuff often goes for alot less then actual value of the item simply because there aren't that many bards out there.<br><br>A nice way to use farming to you advantage that I have seen used on Xev is done by the 54 druid guild leader of a newbie guild. He farms EE bags out of Guk then sells them to the newbies in his guild for 200pp then gets them to resell them for 400pp each. They make money and he can move a much larger volume of the item and can basically corner the market on the item keeping the price very stable. I always give tells to members of the guild when I need an EE bag and I always get them for the 400pp they ask. This could be done with a larger number of items and when I was a new chanter on the block I needed that pp for my spells and some gear I was hoping for. Nice little trick.<br><br>I think in order to make an anology to RL the best way to compare trading it to think of yourself as a pawn broker. You are aquiring items from people who are in a hurry or have a need for something badly and you can sell it to them by having the patience they didn't. They extra money you make is for your time, not for the item itself. Are pawn shops looked down upon in RL? yes. Traders in EQ? yes. But who hasn't been happy with a great deal they got at a pawn shop at one time or another. <br><br>Also a good way to help your reputation is to sell items for a really good deal. Every now and then sell an item for what you bought it for just so people talk about the good deal you gave them. Or if they don't haggle just shave a bit off the price if you started the talks at a figure that was a bit high but you were expecting to haggle. Not everyone knows how to fight for a few plat but will remember when you take that 1k off that 20k item cause you like there spunk ;)<br><br>Good luck to you, trading is a fun way to improve your charecter without exping and give you something to do when all your friends are on vaction and you're bored of pick up groups full of goofs.
