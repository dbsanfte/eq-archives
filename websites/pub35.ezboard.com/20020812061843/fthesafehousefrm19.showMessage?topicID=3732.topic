If I don't evade during the perf chain I immediately go into tranqualize until I do get an evade.  There is no bonus damage, but the defensive bonus almost guarantess an evade within 2 rounds in pve and 3 rounds in rvr.  Then I jump into the evade chain which also has defensive bonus and encourages more evades.  This fighting style has been very effective for me with most of the damage coming from the CS evade chain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 8:24:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3732.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: evades and weapon speeds</span><hr size=1> Landrill,<br>I`m starting to think that the defence penalty doesn`t apply till the very end of the round. cause if I don`t get an evade durring my pa chain (50/50) then 70 of the time i get one after my 1st garrot so pass on AH and go straight into the evade chain. the way my evades are working seem to me that i garrot then the penalty wont apply till the round I would be ticking on for AH.

I do mostly use fast weapons(2.5spd or faster) because it makes it much easier to get evade styles off.  All around I seem do better in fights with fast weapons, but I feel it's because I get more reactionary styles off.  <br><br>I think it's misleading when using fast weapons because once you get your first evade you can usually chain off multiple evades thanks to the defensive bonus on hamstring.<br><br>From my experience the bonus/penalty kicks in immediately when you hit your opponent with the style.  When soloing in pve I pull with X-bow then try to time a tranqualize so that I hit them before they attack me.  When I get the hit in first I evade about 75% of the time.  When this happens I often go the whole fight without taking a hit because I evade 6-7 times consectutively thanks to the bonuses.  I do this regularily against yellow/orange con angry bwcas when farming money. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usneakyandmean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SneakyandMean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/14/02 1:20:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3732.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: evades and weapon speeds</span><hr size=1> I have to say, the idea that you evade more with a faster weapon does make sense in a way.<br><br>On the whole, Mythic seems to have made an effort to make it so that two weapons of different speed that are otherwise identical (dps, qual, stats, etc.) will do the same damage over time.  If weapon A hits 2x faster than weapon B, weapon A will do half the damage (and use half the endurance?) of weapon B per swing but still do the same damage because it hits 2x as much over the same period of time.  <br><br>But evade styles are different story.  They are not anytime styles.  If for example I will evade 4x in a fight, I only have 4 chances to execute an evade style.  Since evade styles generally have a better bonus damage multiplier then anytime styles, I will get more damage per evade out of the slower weapon then I would with the faster weapon.  <br><br>Therefore it does make sense for Mythic to increase the evade rate for faster weapons to make up for the lower damage per evade.  <br><br>Of course to do so they would also have to consider other factors.  It wouldn't be fair to say that 2x faster weapon = 2x more evades.  Every time you evade you avoid taking damage as well as have an opportunity to do damage.  This means that any % change in evade rate due to weapon speed should be less then the difference in weapon speed to truly balance it out.  <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3732.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3732.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3732.topic&index=15><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3732.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3732.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3732.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3732.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
