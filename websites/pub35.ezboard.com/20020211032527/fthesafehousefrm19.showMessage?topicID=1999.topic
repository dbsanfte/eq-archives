In short, archers are too powerful in RvR combat, but feel they don't have enough to offer in group-based monster hunting. We have spent a lot of time testing this in-house over the last week, as well as analyzing player and tester feedback, and have come to the conclusion that archers can kill higher-level players far more easily than we ever intended. Currently, low-40's archers can two-shot kill 50th level mages (who are red or purple to the archer), which is far too powerful. The testing also found that archers were not as effective fighting monsters in groups as we designed the classes. This version takes steps to correct both these problems. <br><br>- Archers no longer receive a to-hit bonus against sitting opponents. Low level archers could previously crit shot much higher level sitting targets - ones they normally could not hit at all if the target was standing. <br><br>- We've lessened the damage that Critical Shots do against higher-level player targets. Against same-level or lower enemy players, your critical shots will do exactly the same damage they always have. However, against higher-level enemy players, your damage will be less, depending on how much higher the player is than you. Please note that this change does not affect critical shot damage versus monsters at all - the change only effects RvR combat. <br><br>- Arrows do exactly the same amount of damage in combat versus monsters as they always have, but they now accumulate less &quot;aggro&quot;. This means that you can use your critical shot or normal shot in combat with monsters and the monster will be less likely to aggro on you, and will be easier to pull off you if you it does aggro. We made this change because of archer complaints (and subsequent testing) showed that archers indeed did so much damage to monsters that they automatically had the monster attack them exclusively for the entire encounter - an encounter which the archer would rarely survive. Now it will be much easier for them to do critical shot/normal bow damage against that same monster with much less chance of the monster focusing exclusively on them. <br><br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>- Spell-damage critical hits have been added. This works just like melee criticals - 10% of the time your damage spells (not including DOTs) will hit for a random amount of extra damage. <br><br>- You should now be able to get information (shift-I) on an item that is in a player trade window (i.e. when you are selling or trading items with other players). <br><br>- The switched race name bug has been fixed. You should now see your correct race name. This was a Pendragon-only bug. <br><br>- There was a Pendragon-only bug where strength, if max-buffed could roll encumbrance around into negative numbers, thus making the buffed player unable to move. This has been fixed. Please note that with this change, your encumbrance is now capped at a maximum of 250. <br><br>- Scouting monsters now have the Detect Hidden ability. If you are higher level than they, then you still have a good chance of staying hidden, but beware of scouting monsters that are higher level than you. <br><br>- Damage clamp of spell damages raised to be comparable with damage clamps from melee attacks. These should only come into play when you smack low level targets (grays). Now caster max damage against low level players and monsters should be about the same as melee max damage. <br><br>- Low level monsters could previously interrupt much higher level spell casters and archers. This has been fixed. <br><br><br>NEW MONSTER ART AND SOUNDS <br><br>- There is a new giant humanoid monster model. <br>- New &quot;glow in the dark&quot; Glimmer Knight (2 types), Glimmer Witch (2 types), and Glimmer Ghoul figures have been added to the Hibernian Epic zone. <br>- By public demand, the frog model finally has his own sound effects. <br>- The Svartalf (dark elf) now has his own model. <br>- There is a new &quot;scaly wolf&quot; skin to go with the new Midgard Epic zone. <br><br><br>SPELL SYSTEM NOTES <br><br>- The Amber Simulacrum (Albion Cabalist pet) now has the chance to &quot;proc&quot; a stun effect. <br><br>- The Constitution buff in Midgard has been moved from the Healer Augmentation specialization track to the Seer basic abilities (meaning now Shaman and Healers will both get the base Con buff). We made this change to bring Healer/Shaman in line with healing/buffing classes in other realms that have con buffs as a base class abilities. The levels awarded are: <br><br>3 Augment Health <br>9 Increase Health <br>14 Enhance Health <br>20 Strengthen Health <br>29 Exaggerate Health <br>38 Intensify Health <br>47 Amplify Health <br><br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>- The otherworldly magic that controls Sheeroe Hills (the new Hibernian high-level zone) has cloaked the entire zone in perpetual twilight. <br><br><br>TRADESKILL SYSTEM NOTES <br><br>- Fixed a bug when using /salvage on Reinforced armor. It will now give you the correct type of strips, not leather squares. <br><br>- Stiletto hilt and blade recipe icons now show the correct dagger icon. <br><br>- Trinket recipes no longer should have ?'s as their icons. <br><br>- Changed the icon for the trinket recipes to be a bit more uniform across the board. The trinkets for the lower half of the skill range will be a white gem icon, with the trinkets for the upper half will be the black gem icon. <br><br>- Fixed Midgard cloak recipes so that there should be a cloak recipe a separate hooded cloak recipe. <br><br>- You should be able to buy the correct tanned torsion cables now instead of the incorrect linen torsion cables <br><br>- Icons for Midgard stave recipes show an actual staff icon now instead of a shield <br><br><br><br><br>K,  just my two cents, but in my opinion(and im not jumping on any nerf archer bandwagon =P ) if archers are doing that much damage.....they should be getting that much aggro, right?? oh well, whatever.  but defintely a bit of an improvement w/ regards to rvr.<br><br>Mauddas Bloodriven<br>14th hero guinevere <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=majin>Majin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 11:20:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1999.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: new patch up</span><hr size=1> Basically this is no nerf to the archer but an improvement PVE wise.

I also understand that Augment spec gives you your attack speed buff (similar to the druid's Nurture spec), a self-only damage add, and a group running speed buff - all of which I would consider useful.<br><br>My point is that Hibernia tanks (and everyone else here for that matter) can either pick the &quot;beefy&quot; Celt or Firbolg with base 60 Constitution, or the Elf or Lurikeen with base 40 Constitution.  Midgard tanks have the Kobold on the low end with base 50 Constitution, the more typical Norse or Troll with base 70, or the Dwarf with base 80.  Hibernia needed a base-line Con buff to bring the tanks up to par.  Midgard didn't, which was reflected in the fact that Con buffs were harder to come by. <p><b>Ciardha Sidhe</b>, Elven Nightshade<br>Guinevere<br><small>Explorer 93% | Killer 60% | Socializer 40% | Achiever 6%</small></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 9:41:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1999.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: new patch up</span><hr size=1> How about, instead of moving con to base, they just let shaman (and the other &quot;best buffer&quot; in the realm) buff 24 buffs max instead of 16? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A> at: 2/1/02 9:41:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 11:32:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1999.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cableone.net/truggiero/smxumcard.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: new patch up</span><hr size=1> Im actually sorry to see them hit the archers again. Sure in theory I can see where they are coming from, but their &quot;changes&quot; on the archers seem to have far too many variables for me to believe they will actually get it right. Damage on monsters will stay the same... sitting damage will be reduced... damage to higher level player will be change, but to even/lower level players it will stay the same. They're still trying to figure out how to get standard debuffs working on the champs, but we are supposed to believe they are going to be able to make this change to archers successfully?<br><br>I have to admit the change to con buffs for the shaman/healers is nice, but they also should have given some sort of addition to the aug line, so that those who have put considerable amount of points in that line wont feel like they just got bent over.  Is there any other class in DAoC that has a spell line you put points into and only you get ONE spell from it? I mean besides the shaman... <br><br> <p><img src=http://www.cableone.net/truggiero/xummten.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uubergnome563.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ubergnome563</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/02 2:48:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1999.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Yes i feel bad for those who have archers.<br><br>But really, archers have the highest solo rvr kill quota in the game.  no other class even comes close to it.<br><br>Lower level archers shoots you for more than you perf for 3 times in a row (luckily i have a ton of hp).

Mythic is going to add all these variables in archer damage when they could have put all these variables in detect hidden and allowed rogues to have some sort of bonus vs stealthed archers. Heck even make rogues immune to archers stealth... in other words archers not being able to hide from rogues at all(keep rogue vs rogue detect hidden as is). <br><br>Make an archer just as vulnerable to a rogue as every other class is vulnerable to an archer. Dont decrease their damage, just make a more potent kryptonite(a rogue) to the Supersniper. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A> at: 2/2/02 7:59:42 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessage?topicID=2011.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessage?topicID=1961.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1999.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=1999.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=1999.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1999.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1999.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Dark Age of Camelot</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
