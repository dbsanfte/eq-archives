A few were gathered on the dock, messing with their baits as the lights in a nearby tavern slowly came to life.  About a kilometer off, a tattered ship was slowly emerging from the white fog, like a ghost ship that you would only hear about in stories.  As the ship got closer writings could be made out on the side &quot;Dark Knight&quot; they read.  The words were written in red that was as dark as blood.  As the phantom ship slowly made its way towards the dock, a lone figure could be made out.<br>
<br>
<br>
The ship finally reached its destination, and the man on board stepped on to the docks.  Twas a man of small stature, dressed in armour as black as night and wore a face as cold and dark as the armour he was wearing.  Attached at both sides of his waist he wore two knives, the blades glimmering in the dim light of the morning sun. He slowly made his way to the tavern, not looking at anyone or anything.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
...I entered the tavern cautiously, knowning of the eyes at my back.  The smell of beer and stinch of rats filled my nostrils as I let the door close behind me.  I quickly eyed the room, taking in every table, chair, and person sitting there.  At the back sat an Ogre downing a lavendar liquid, to his left about 5 feet, sat an old antique piano and a drunken bard playing it.  I recognized the bard immediately.  I used to let him travel with me, until one of his closest friends got killed, and he got screwed up in the head.  It's a shame to see excellent talent wasted on beer and a broken down piano at 5 in the morning.  That is why I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> choose</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to have very few close friends.  Someone dies, I say what a great person he was and go on with my life.  The other side of the room held a few haflings talking about something boring I'm sure, an Erudite and Human sat at the bar, and a beautiful Teir`Dal tended them.<br>
<br>
<br>
I withdrew one of my blades and slowly made my way towards the bar, sticking close to the shadows, keeping myself out of view.  I reach the bar and put the tip of my knife in the back of the Human, poking him lightly to let him know what it was.  &quot;Gimmie yer money old man,&quot; was the only thing I said.  Immediately the Erudite, next to him, jumped up and started towards me ...then stopped.  &quot;You crazy fool, how the hell have you been?&quot; the Erudite says to me as she puts her arm over my shoulder.  With a smile on my face I returned the blade to its sheath.  The Human turned around and a surge of relief washed over his face.  &quot;Blackwand, Kelnork ..It's been a long time old friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I ordered a drink, and sat down beside Kelnork, remembering the last time we met in this bar.  This time was different though, from the dispair of his letter he wrote me, I knew he wasn't calling me back to talk about old times.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Glad you could make it Aathos.  We've been having a few problems ever since you left,&quot; Kelnork started.  I could see the fear in his eyes and hear the quiver in his voice as he talked.  I glance at Blackwand, who was finishing off her drink, and noticed sweat forming at her brow.  &quot;We got word a few weeks ago that Paineel had been infested with Elementals.  Somehow they were able to break through the barrier that has been keeping them captive for so long.&quot;  Kelnork took a deep breath and finished off his drink.  &quot;Chosne is in Erudin as we speak, trying to come up with some sort of plan to drive the Elementals back.&quot;  I took a sip of my drink and leaned back in my chair, deep in thought.  If the Elementals were strong, and smart enough to break the barrier, then what will stop them from taking over Paineel ...then Erudin.  &quot;I will call upon my brother and a few of my friends,&quot; I replied.  &quot;In 2 weeks time, we'll meet again in Erudin, until then safe journies to you both.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
With that, I took my leave.  I had plenty of things to do before I headed to Erudin.  Light filled the tavern as I opened the door to leave.  I could hear the cusses of the few drunks who didn't appreciate me letting in all the light.  Outside the city was bustling, I hadn't realized that we talked for so long.  I headed towards North Freeport to sell some goods and buy some food...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ...In Erudin...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
...As I sit at my study I can hear the cries of young Kobolds in the nearby forest.  I can make out sounds of battle, excitement and the sounds of death.  I cannot help but to think back upon my childhood days.  Running through Tox with my friends, looking for excitement and adventure.  We would happen across a few snakes every now and then, but nothing too big to cause us any trouble.  One day we decided that it was time to venture further into the forest, far from the protection of the guards.  At the time we thought we were brave warriors, off to rid the evil that plagued the forest, now I know that it was stupidity.  We happened upon a small kobold camp ...we had found our adventure and a close friend of mine had found his death...<br>
<br>
<br>
Foot steps brings me out of my dream back into reality.  I look over my shoulder to see Dethius, my servant, standing in the doorway.  &quot;Someone is hear to see you Master.&quot;  I nod to him and he quietly takes his leave.  As I stand, my knees crack a bit.  &quot;What it would be like to be young again,&quot; I think to myself as I sigh.  I make my way to the front room, passing old paintings of my Mother and Father.  I enter the room to see the messenger I sent to Freeport, standing in the doorway.  &quot;They come in a week mi`lord.&quot;  I hand the messenger her wages and have my servant see her to the door.  &quot;The time is almost near,&quot; I think to myself.  &quot;There are plenty of things to keep me busy, I must come up with a suitable plan of attack and study new spells that will have the demons wishing they would of never came back.&quot; <p><i> Sullon Zek </i>
