They do much more damage too, they have a significantly higher weapon skill when put side by side with a shadowzerk even with the same weapon skill, because we're on a lower scale.  Their armor is a much better type as well--leather is weak vs. the most common weapon out there, slashing weapons.  <br>Evade does give us an advantage in doing the comeback chain, however.  Envenom probably closes the gap in our damage difference, and we do get throwing daggers, which shouldn't be forgotten now if you're soloing.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=biabia>Bia Bia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 4:45:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do shadowzerks compare to zerks?</span><hr size=1> i was skeptical on the effectiveness of zerkers as a viable pvp class untill my friend, lvl 35 at the time, proved me wrong...<br><br>late one night in the bg's it was me and my friend zerker, watching a group of 5 albs sitting around on the alb bridge doing nothing waiting for some action.  my buddy decides he's gonna go out with a bang to end the night.  he runs right in the middle of this group of albs, pops into teddy form and procedes to SHRED. let me empasizes this..

Hitpoints<br><br>Zerks are on the same HP table as Warriors.  Its likely that we'll have a couple hundred more hps than a SB.  Advantage - Zerk.<br><br>2.  Armor<br><br>Studded vs. Leather.  Better absorption helps reduce the damage you take.  Advantage - Zerk.<br><br>3.  Defensive Abilities<br><br>Zerks have Evade III and SBs ultimately get Evade VII.  Zerks, however, also have Parry and most, with items can specialize it to 40 or so.  A specialization of 40 gives you a 25% chance to parry an attack.  It also opens up a couple of nice styles that SB's can't make use of.  Advantage - Even or maybe a slight edge to Zerks.<br><br>4.  Damage<br><br>This is a tough one to address I think.  Zerks being a Viking class should have a higher Weapon Skill than a Rogue class and probably do.  So purely from the perspective of Left Axe, I would guess that we probably hit harder.  Also, because of the number of skills we invest points in, we are very likely to have a higher specialization in Left Axe  and our main weapon skill than an SB (unless you elect to ignore Critical Strike and Envenom).  At 44.5, for instance, my base specialization in Axe and Left Axe is 44.  At 50 it will be 44 in Axe and 50 in Left Axe.  So on average, we should deal more damage simply from having specialized more.  Also, the higher Left Axe specialization gives a larger LA bonus.<br><br>Having said that, there is Critical Strike.  If you've invested points in that, you have a damage dealing ability with Perforate Artery that can be pretty darn devastating.  Of course, we have Berserk that we can invoke every 7 minutes.  In case you don't know, we lose our defensive abilities, but crit with each hit, we haste and we have a heightened chance to hit.  The damage that we can deal while Berserk can, um, be impressive.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Advantage - Not Sure<br><br>5.  Playability in the End Game<br><br>Zerks are completely group dependent.  Because they cannot specialize Shield, they are cannon fodder to ranged attackers.  Their reputation, also, often results in their being targeted in lieu of other classes.  They have no acceleration ability independent of Sprint. They cannot Stealth.  For these reasons, I would argue that SB's are much more viable in RvR and therefore more playable in the endgame.  Advantage - SB<br><br>I will say, thought, that realm abilities are a wildcard.  There are some things for Zerks in there that really expand their horizons particularly, imo, the root and snare abilities.  I have not looked at what was given to SB's.<br><br>Just my thoughts anyway.

The shadowblade capitalized on all 11 evades getting off a comeback-frosty glaze combo. While the beserker only capitalized on 5 of the evades. He also only capitalized on one of the parries.<br><br>The log clearly shows that the parry chain beserkers gets needs to be boosted. In all other accounts it prooved that the beserker does far more damage, and takes a lower percentage of his total hits per mob then a shadowblade. <br><br>He did try to even out the damage by using the level 50 poison, however I do not think that is a fair test. Not every shadowblade will have access to the level 50 envenom, and they may not be using it all the time. I would much rather be doing a high base damage without having to worry about envenoming weapons during rvr.<br><br>I play a level 41 shadowblade with heavy left axe specialization. After fighting side by side with beserkers for a while, and looking at many beserker logs, I can honestly say they are better tanks/fighters then shadowblades are by far. The main thing a shadowblade has going for him is he can stealth. This allows him to have a greater chance of surviving on the battlefield.<br><br>Just my two cents.<br>Merry <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 2:48:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do shadowzerks compare to zerks?</span><hr size=1> Yes, that's true, studded is weak vs. crush, leather is strong vs. crush.  And they were probably blue at the time, leading to much more damage avoidance by the assasin.  As a 39 healer, I'm very comfortable with having a zerker as the main tank.  I'm not at all comfortable with seeing a shadowzerk tank.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwolvenspikefeather.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolven Spikefeather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 3:26:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do shadowzerks compare to zerks?</span><hr size=1> I never said that shadowzerkers are better tanks then zerkers are.  They aren't.  But, the comparison was a general one.  Against even con solo opponents, the shadowzerker is comparable.  The high level of evades combined with non-stop comeback/frostygaze is a lethal combination.  Right now my wife and I are soloing spindels.  She frequently kills the yellow con's with 0-1 hit taken from her.  Once she gets the first evade off, comeback/frostygaze (which also increase her defense and make more evades more likely) and usually another set of them from more evades.  She mows through them with ease, often killing the orange con ones with out much trouble.  Admittedly spindels are easy kills, but still.  <br><br>In a group, a real zerker is a much better tank, able to take much more of a beating.    In the end game, ie RvR, the shadowzerker wins hand down though due to stealth and poisons.  They can pick their fights and attack with surprise. <p>Wolven Spikefeather, Hunter<BR>Wolvan Ebonmyst, Shadowblade<BR>Blargo; Healer.

They are the main shadowblade leveling creatures. They have extremely low hit poitns due to their snare spell. They also do not hit hard at all, and with thier minus for leather its even worse.<br><br>Try fighting scavs or even crabs. Crabs hit a lot harder then spindels, and have a lot more hit points. The beserker will start outperforming the shadowblade on those. <br><br>I group with a beserker friend of mine a lot, I might evade more then him, but he does a lot more damage then I do. I rarely ever take aggro from him. He also doesnt have to worry about taking aggro, if I take aggro its two hits I am dead. While he can tank fairly well.<br><br>I do notice when I use my str/con debuf and envenom poison we are pretty close to damage output. However that gets pretty costly for me to use. I spend roughly 20 gold per buble in poisons.<br><br>At any rate, shadowzerkers do less damage then beserkers, have less hits, and get hit harder by just about everything. We get poisons, the ability to stealth, climb walls, and safefall. I do not care what people say I really like safefall!<br><br>For my play style I enjoy my shadowblade. I like scouting, I like climbing keep walls, etc. I do have to pick my fights carefully in rvr, which with my stealth I can do. My beserker friend is not so lucky. <br><br>Merry <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showPrevMessage?topicID=154.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showNextMessage?topicID=154.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.emailToFriend?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.threadControl?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=154.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=154.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22>Stealth Training</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
