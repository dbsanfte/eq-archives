Its still balanced(unless you are comparing the actual LA and DW style lines) cause of the primary hand / secondary hand damage reduction, IF the person is unbuffed because that reduction takes place and its not a tremendously overpowering hit.  Toss in a buff bot with a pre nerf LA SB, and you got people 3 hitting other rogues with LA syles because the damage cap is soo ridiculously high.  Something's seriously screwed up when a 46 SB hits an epic armor 50 inf for 105, every hit, with both hands non style, and mythic simply nerfed the wrong thing.<br>
<br>
Nerfing left axe was stupid.  They should have put a range on the conc buffs, especially before looking into a flavor of the month class issue.<br>
<br>
My gripe with Prenerf pre 1.51 SB's were that they could garrot for 570+ (700ish on a critical garrot) with a 2h.  When somebody use anytime styles me for nearly 2x harder than i perf them, with 50 base melee / CS, I tend to get a little pissed, especially if its supposed to be a class with similar properties to mine.  2h perf /melee overpowered now?  Dont think so since they removed the one shots + epic armor and RA's.  Nerfing LA itself was incorrect source of the problem imo.<br>

When casters were complaining about dying so fast, the problem wasn't that their AF was low and they couldn't absorb damage.<br>
<br>
The problem with casters is, if you get into melee range with one, the <b>ONLY</b> way they can cast a spell is to quickcast or to spam the cast key until the spell goes through. The chance to interrupt a caster is 99%, and when you do managed to interrrupt them, they can't even attempt to cast again for 5 seconds. This leaves the caster dead.<br>
<br>
Mythic, instead of making interruptions less intrusive gave casters bladeturn and absorption buffs then went about bolstering their damage. When the problem was simply without range, a caster is dead--PvE or RvR.<br>
<br>
Then epic armor came along and casters have decent survivability, but still if someone gets into melee range of them it's as if they lose all their spec points because the only spell they can cast is the one they quickcast.<br>
<br>
Root problems of Class types:<br>
<br>
Heavy Melee: Cannot physically stop anyone<br>
Casters: Spell interrupted too easily; melee cannot physically protect casters<br>
Healers: Combat is still a bit too fast for heals; melee cannot physically protect healers<br>
Light Melee: Often outdamaged by Heavy Melee, yet still defensively inferior<br>
Archers: Stupidly high miss and fumble rates with bows<br>
Assassins: Hidden attacks are vastly inferior to Heavy Melee no-opening styles and most ranged attacks -- rapidly becoming light melee with poison and stealth. Why not just combine light melee and assassins into one class and stop the suffering?<br>

<br>
I do not believe any amount of whining and nerf cries will actually make a nerf happen. Only thing it does is direct mythic's attention to the 'point of whine'. If, and only if, the examination shows something is wrong, a nerf will come.<br>
<br>
Example: I hear 'You Infiltrators whined about LA and got it nerfed!'<br>
<br>
What in reality happened is that a lot of people complained about doublefrost damage(and not just infiltrators), mythic heard the complaints, looked at logs, thought 'hmm, the damage is kinda high, lets take a look at it...'<br>
<br>
And then '... gosh, we had the damage set wrong the whole time, it should be that on an anytime style, not a reactionary style like it is now!'<br>
<br>
Then, they set the DF damage to the correct type(anytime) which reduced the style damage (and STILL not to where it should be, mind you), NOT because someone whined about it, but because it was simply set wrong.<br>
<br>
So dont go around accussing infiltrators because they(along with others) pointed out a flaw in mythics code.<br>

Often the whines indicate there may be a problem.  So Mythic looks into it and finds that, yes, there IS a problem.  The techincal problems, like Doublefrost damage are easy to understand.  To be honest, after the fix to it, I can't understand why people keep saying it needs to be back where it was.  The reason they gave was perfectly reasonable, and made sense.  If peoples' complaint is that it is reduced more than the 3% they said it was, I can understand that.  That should be addressed.  If its damage is less than other use-anytime styles then THAT should be looked at.  If the only complaint is that the damage is lower, well, too bad.<br>
<br>
Other changes however DO come from pure whining.  The one-shot nerf is a PERFECT example of that.  If it wasn't for a cacophany of whining from many players, assassins would still be one-shotting people.  They made a change that caused one-shots to be &quot;inadvertently&quot; fixed.  Ok fine, I'll accept that.  But the only reason it STAYED &quot;fixed&quot; was because people whined that it should. <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 9:07:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.camelotherald.com/guilds/nightshade.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Nudges the post back ON topic</span><hr size=1> Buffbots.<br>
<br>
Well, the many suggestions I have seen to fix this problem are all great and worthy of a look, however, the root of the issue is this.<br>
<br>
Do we want to go back to EQ style buffs?<br>
<br>
Think about it?  Mythic ( love the game, much better than verant ) has in the past, taken the easy route to fix things.  This is to be expected, it makes good buisness sense to spend as little time on a fix as possible but still ensuring a fix.  Same results, less money spent.<br>
<br>
There will be no range limit.  Which would be easier to code, a range limit, or a time limit?<br>
<br>
There will be a TIME limit.  I for one, hated this in EQ, and I will hate it here.  It is inevitable that something like this is in the works at Mythic.  As so many of you have pointed out, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   the squeeky wheel gets the grease </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and people are indeed squeaking.<br>
<br>
My wife plays a bard, blue buffs are great, will she let me bot her? No.  Hell, personally, I would feel dirty, cheap, as if my kills were made simply because I had buffs and not because I have the ability to accomplish such on my own.<br>
<br>
Those are my own set of morals.  They can't be forced upon anyone who USES a buffbot, but eventually, Mythic will limit their effectiveness.  Precedence assures us of that.<br>

Look at our history of being ignored, pushed asside, left broken, uncommunicated too, and the list goes on. If anything people crying about berzerkers and their LA styles is what got DF nerfed, shadowblades like all of our classes were just incidental victims. Like how our debuffs, dots, and countless other things get adjusted constantly when they are 'fixing' other classes. Secondly, give it a bloody rest and move on with life. I am sorry that some infiltrators out there were asking for nerfs, if you think there are no shadowblades that would have done the same, that are not now doing the same with the lovely excuse of 'you did it to me' you are sadly mistaken. Bottom line is that there are jerks and morons in all classes, no one class is exempt of this. All that it matters is which one are we as individuals, boohoo nerf boys, or otherwise. This isnt directed at Baym btw, this is to every person that goes on and on and on and on and on about this topic every second thread.<br>
<br>
Nightshades are not weak nor do they suck. Its one of those common beliefs everyone shares that really in my personal opinion has no basis. If nightshades suck, then all the good ones must be on Guin, because they certainly dont suck.<br>
<br>
As for buff bots, the biggest problem is that there is no way to tell if your opponent was buff bot'd. While I agree with the poster that said if someone wants to pay the extra money, for the extra edge then they should be able to do so, I draw the line when its going to potentially impact my playability as someone that doesnt buff bot. If any class is nerfed to make their buff bot versions more balanced it will without question crush all those that dont buff bot. What I think would be a good idea is that a new bit of information is added to the damage line. So beside where it says how much damage you do, or take, you get another bit of info that shows the buff bot advantage. So the extra damage you did because of buffs, the less damage you did because of the AF buffs. This wont show all the aspects of buff bots, but its something thats doable in my opinion, and then if folks want to complain about the extra damage they can atleast direct it at where it belongs, buff bots. <br>

His point is valid people.  I'm personally staying out of the Nerf LA aspect of this thread.  That's not why it was started.<br>
<br>
However, when buffbots get nerfed, it will hurt the entire population as a whole.  Not just those people with 2 or more accounts buffing up their assassin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucovenn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Covenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 12:01:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Used a friend's buff bot today (stat changes)</span><hr size=1> Nightshades may not be 'gimped' but they do need some love to bring them online with at least SB's.

I think they look at the screenshots that showed huge Doublefrost damage (made possible SOLELY by buff-bots) and then swung the nerf bat. My point which has been completely missed since the beginning is that BUFF BOTS are the cause for LA getting nerfed. Does everyone understand where I am coming from now?<br>
<br>
That being said, I still do think it is despicable the number oand tenacity of the non-shadowblades (better?) who did post that LA should be nerfed.

Yes I'd be willing to go back to the EQ-like timer based buffs in order to eliminate this problem.  I'd prefer not to have to do this but if that's the only way to get rid of the buff bots I'd be willing to put up with it.  Since the people who use buff bots refuse to control themselves it's up to Mythic to attempt to control them for the good of the game. <p>Sanlail Swiftpaw

It was hillarious what happened with this one botter at a keep once.

Mayia I don't think you fully understand what the point of a caster is in RVR or PVP<br>
<br>
A Caster is suppose to die extremely fast at close range<br>
<br>
The fact that absorb buffs/bladeturn was added makes Casters overpowered bar none.<br>
<br>
2 Things mythic should possibly do<br>
<br>
One, No quickcasting CC... Sorry but if a Melee gets up to close range that caster shoudn't stand a chance, a Melee stands zero chance at Range vs a Caster, it should be same for the caster at close range.<br>
<br>
Other Possible thing is to remove Self Bladeturn in RVR.<br>
<br>
Personally I think no quickcasting CC would be best.<br>
<br>
This would screw Albion over so they'd have to give Sorcs Instant Mez like the other realm.<br>
<br>
But still, Casters in General need to be reworked so that they actually don't have a chance at close range.<br>
<br>
That may sound crappy, but when I get rooted and nuked for 400 a pop every 2 seconds (6 seconds dead) I don't see a problem with me having a chance if I sneak up on them.<br>

Maybe the real issue here is, &quot;I wanna be able to roam around solo without buffs and not have to worry about other players who DO have buffs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because it seems like what people are really saying here is that buffs themselves are overpowered.  That no one should be able to have their hps increased by 500+ or their damage increased by 50% from a spell.<br>
<br>
Also, i'm having a real hard time understanding how this is a real burning issue for some people.  Some make it sound like everyone and their mother has a buffbot on their server.  Like its becoming the norm.  But this seems a bit off to me.  I have a hard time even finding buffbots on my server.  I dont see a dozen afk clerics at portal keeps like you guys suggest.  I mean where are these buffers coming from?  Someone had to level them and i sure as hell dont see many in groups.  I'd say there can't be more than 5 or 6 high level enhance clerics on lancelot and i have no idea who they are because i've never even seen one other than my own (same account as my inf).  One of the reasons i started one was because of how rare they are.<br>
<br>
I dunno, it just seems to me that the basic gripe here is that someone has an &quot;unfair&quot; advantage over you when you go 1 on 1.  But when you think about it the &quot;advantage&quot; is just as arbitrary as being a higher level, having better items, or even traveling in numbers.  Because when you come across someone who's buffed to all hell you're really fighting two people, whether you see the other person or not.  And to those who whine about a class who can use all their prime skills and not have to be out there on the battlefield for you attack, i think your chances would be much worse if they WERE out there with the person they buffed.<br>
<br>
Would any of you have a problem with infbots or archer bots?  Where a single person controlled two assassins or archer accounts and had one follow the other around, doubleteaming whoever they found.

Gathering statistics probably wouldnt be easy, but the 'lvl 50 tanks' that you are talking about suddenly getting unjustly killed by someone thats been buffed, could just as easily get some buffs themselves. And likely do.<br>
I also find it somewhat unlikely that Mythic would not take buffs into consideration when they make their changes.....ok, well maybe. But I can't see them makes changes based solely on someone's posted logs. They are going to try to reproduce it for themselves, and if they don't get buffs they wont see the same numbers, and if they do, they will know why they got those numbers.<br>
So I don't think I buy the whole 'buff-bots got me nerfed' thing. And even if its true, you cant nerf a buff bot without also nerfing a buffer with a real human behind the toon. So they need to find another way. Maybe park some 'buff-vendors' at the border keeps for those who cant 'bot. <br>

I don't like buffed oponants<br>
so:<br>
I'll call for nerfing buff classes<br>
<br>
Dull in the extreem.  And if you think its odd that people here are defending buff classes then remember that the ones who have buff bots also *play* a buff class.  Its bad enough all that rebuffing after Link death but it can't realy be avoided.  <br>
<br>
The way to fix buffing classes is to give them some of the RP for anyone they buff - if that person is out of the 8,000 RP range then buffer don't get the points but the buffed player still looses a portion of the RP they would have gained.<br>
<br>
You'll probably still loose if your solo and unbuffed but the buffed player will get less RP for fighting with an advantage - that seems fair to me.  Of course they are just as vulnerable as any soloist to a modest sized group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 2:55:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1</span><hr size=1> heh,amusing topic. <br>

simple fact is infiltrators are going to get nerfed,part of the reason is the players who use buffbots. as uber has stated,most people who rvr at all ,know who uses bots,and who doesnt.<br>
<br>
buffbots are unbalancing,just like any other class/style that was unbalancing. when you get a 75% improvement for using these types of charecters,your just creating more game balance issues that will eventually be addressed.<br>
<br>
i wouldnt have a problem if the people who used buffbots had to share the risk on there bots themselves. however they dont have it,its a win/win situation for them. however theres a real difference between a buffbot and a normal cleric,healer,druid etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3781.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3781.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3781.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3781.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=40><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3781.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3781.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3781.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3781.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
