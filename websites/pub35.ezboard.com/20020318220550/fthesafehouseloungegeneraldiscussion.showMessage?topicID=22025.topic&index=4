Someone performs a deal on an on-line auction site. Deal goes bad. Person decides to sue everyone involved. If EQ backed on line auctions then they could be found at partial fault.<br>
<br>
2) No $$ to be made. <br>
As was stated above. No money to be made for Sony. I make a character, get it to 60th. I sell my character for $300. I made $300. Sony made $0. They are a business after all.<br>
<br>
3) Wasting customer service man hours.<br>
Additional waste of customer service resources on something beyond Sony's control, such as scams involved with on-line auctions. Bobby spends $100 for a level 60 warrior. That warrior only comes with half the gear that was listed. Person selling warrior insists it had it all &amp; states Bobby should get EQ customer service involved. Additional resources are wasted on tracking this all down.<br>
<br>
Also, all kinds of additional customer service manpower wasted (financially at least) on things like name changes, account billing info changes &amp; such.<br>
<br>
4) It's a game to be played not won.<br>
Plus the pure aspect of EQ is made to be a game played, not a game won. Verant likes to support the idea that hopefully you'll have as much fun playing a level 1 player as a level 60 &amp; tries to build around that.<br>

I wasn't suggesting that Verant support the selling of accounts, was just curious why they were proactive in preventing it. Which are very different things IMO from a liability perspective.<br>
<br>
The only one I'm not sure about is #2. It seems if there were no aftermarket for accounts, a lot of people leaving the game would simply cancel their account. With selling them they continue the subscription. To me it seems more likely that a person who plays casually and has a level 30 character would be more likely to cancel their subscription than someone who has a level 60 character with mostly nodrop gear. It seems that a lot of the accounts get bought up by people who have multiple accounts already, and are willing to spend $50/mo and upwards maintaining all of them, rather than people who are just getting into the game and buy an account in lieu of starting their own subscription and starting from level 1. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaraxasxev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>araxas xev</A> at: 1/30/02 5:04:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaanadien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aanadien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/30/02 6:14:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22025.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.vanessarussell.com/Phank/jumppavitarsmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The reason is to protect themselves from liability</span><hr size=1> The reason Verant officially frowns upon the trade in gear and accounts for real-world dollars while making only token efforts to actually fight the trade is, I think, obvious:<br>
<br>
In case some twit ever gets it into his head to sue Verant for damages relating to the loss of his toon or some gear due to some alleged negligence on the part of Verant or their employees, Verant doesn't want to be caught on the record recognizing the real-world monetary value of game objects.<br>
<br>
The suggestion that selling gear for real money is somehow a violation of Verant's intellectual property (IP) rights is too silly to comment on. <p>----------------------------------------<BR>Jumpp Jivenwail, 60 Rogue<BR>Aanadien Jones, 60 Enchanter<BR>

<br>
To poster above me, are you really of the opinion that most people who buy accounts are new players to the game, who will play less because they're already level 50. It doesn't seem to logical to me that a beginner would be willing to invest several hundred dollars buying an account. Seems to me most bought accounts are by hard-core addicts willing to pay several subscriptions at once.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaraxasxev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>araxas xev</A> at: 1/30/02 8:03:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upulid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pulid</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/communtychest.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/30/02 8:56:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22025.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The reason is to protect themselves from liability</span><hr size=1> i sort of agree araxas.

<br>
  Player A, we'll call him Bob, Bob has a 60th level and he is tired of everquest and is short on rent money.  Bingo, he decides he will sell his account.<br>
<br>
  Player B, we'll call him John, John has a friend on bobs server who is 52 and John doesn't want to level up his character all the way up. John goes to an auction site and finds bob's character for a fair price and buys it.<br>
<br>
  Sony has now gained $10.00 a month assuming bob will never play again. However, that 10.00 they gain goes to running everquest and they probably only make a fraction of that in net profit. <br>
<br>
  Now, lets say you couldn't buy accounts. John now has to buy everquest, kunark, velious, and luclin. Verrant now makes $80.00ish, most of which is net profit, and that at least is why I think they frown on the selling of accounts. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uunem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>unem</A> at: 1/30/02 10:08:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usarkaukar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarkaukar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 6:02:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22025.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.dcms-kurita.net/images/images3025/1stsothdrdh.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The reason is to protect themselves from liability</span><hr size=1> Agrees with Unem.<br>
<br>
Add the impact of uninformed/nubie players on the high-end of the game, loss of revenue from more than usual frustrated, long-term real players who decide it isnt worth it anymore.<br>
<br>
How many would continue playing the game if approx a fourth of the players you ran into were Ebayers and that did not know completely on how to play the toon?  Warrior who doesnt taunt, others that do not know how to assist, cleric that uses the wrong heal/buffs. etc.<br>
<br>
That lvl 60 ebayed toon learns it is way too hard/too many hassles to play and quits in a short time.  Sony loses not necessarily on the monthly fees, but on the original purchase(s) (as pointed out by Unem).<br>

Lets see:<br>
<br>
Original kunark and EQ bundle $30 (or cheaper)<br>
Velious $20<br>
Sol$30<br>
<br>
total = $80<br>
<br>
now take away sales tax, the retailers cut (about 50%!!)<br>
now take away distribution, packaging, production etc oh yes and marketing, pr you are left with a max of $15.00 profit.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it why on earth do they make us have to visit these retailer rip-offs in the first place. <br>
<br>
I mean HOW ON EARTH can a retailer justify their profit from a pre-order. The customer already knows about and wants the product. The retailer takes no risk, and with no outlay at all and reaps all the benefits.<br>
<br>
Just look how the distribution channel F**cked up the 'worldwide release' of SoL. The only country that it got released in on time, was America. I wasted a weeks holiday from work due to these obstructing c*ck s*ckers and payed them for the privilege!!!. <br>
<br>
I even emailed customer support and asked why the promised worldwide release didnt happen and they replied and said it did - I may have experienced problems in my locality. I emailed them back and told them not to tell lies and that my locality was ONLY THE WHOLE OF EUROPE!!!!<br>

<br>
... I had the pleasure of being in the Guide Program in Beta through the first year or so and even was involved in helping update the Policy and Proceedure manual used by guides (you can blame me, in part, for the play nice policy &lt;evil grin&gt;). [Note: I left long time ago so no conflict of interest here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ]<br>
<br>
During that time, I got to know a lot of the background philosophies of the company and as I said, all the reasons mentioned above are part of the reason.<br>
<br>
Mostly it was against &quot;the vision&quot; but the other BIG reason, at least early on was the Customer Service issue. You cannot believe the amount of calls we got from bad deals even when they knew we didn't support the sale. I shudder to think of the man-power drain that would occur if it was condoned.<br>
<br>
There is also a lot of truth to the liability thing. If you ever work for a large corp, you soon see the levels they will go to minimize liability exposure.<br>
<br>
The lack of sales revenue was never really an issue. As mentioned, Verant makes little off the real sale (heck they're giving the base game away now with magazines and Gateway computers).<br>
<br>
Anyway ... there were lots of reasons to not do it and few, if any, reasons to support the sale via Ebay. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urkrazor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RKRazor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 8:17:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22025.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/ribbon_small.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The reason is to protect themselves from liability</span><hr size=1> Trilogy (EQ, Kunark, Velius)=$49.99 if that<br>
