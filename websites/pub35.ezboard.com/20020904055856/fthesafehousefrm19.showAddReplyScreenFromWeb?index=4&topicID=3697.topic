I'd just like to add that I don't believe that Infiltrators have any chance to critical on their poisons. Nightshades can purchase the realm ability wild arcana which allows a 5% chance to critical per level of the ability, and the ability Viper, on a 30 minute timer, which doubles dot damage for 30 seconds (?).<br>
<br>
I don't feel that either ability drives the Nightshade into the realm of 'overpowered', so you may wish to adjust your post at the Healer forum, as Infiltrators are unable to get poison crits. Nightshades have less spec points = not able to spec as many lines as high as Infiltrators = not hitting as hard in melee.<br>

They are the most dangerous classes out there because they can rez. Rezzing classes turn a losing battle into a winning battle by creating instant reinforcements.<br>
<br>
I can sometimes kill Healers. It's doesn't surprise me at all that an Infiltrator can.<br>
<br>
What that infiltrator (you know, the only one that's ever killed you) did was hit you with disease poison and a dot poison most likely. With the number of hitpoints you say you have, it would have taken at least 8 round after a successful perforate artery to kill you.<br>
<br>
If a decent tank or caster was anywhere near you, that infiltrator would have died--possibly before you died. I see it happen all the time in Hibernia when then Infiltrators attempt to kill our bards. The bard may die, but so does the infiltrator. And they get a one-way ticket back to Albion and get to wait 15 minutes for the portal back.<br>
<br>
Assassins are easy to defend against: don't be alone. Ta da, you're invulnerable... or at worst, the only person who will die.<br>
<br>
But I see you're on the path to get assassins nerfed. And I wish you luck... bad luck, the kind where a piano falls 20 stories landing on you, but you survive only to die on the way to the hospital when your ambulance drives off a cliff, into the ocean and just before you drown a whale eats you--you dissolve slowly and painfully in whale stomach acid.<br>
<br>
Hmmm, I've been playing my necromancer too much lately.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, no one here takes this poster seriously. The post is filled with inaccuracies and ignorance:<br>
<br>
<i>"ESPECIALLY if they can now CRITICAL with said posion"</i><br>
<br>
Only one who can do that is a Nightshade... a really crazy Nightshade who wants to waste their RA points on Accuity and Wild Arcana no less.<br>
<br>
<i>I THINK there is a problem with the hibbie ae root line</i><br>
<br>
Roots don't break early. Unlike a mez or stun, you can still cast spells, shoot arrows, and throw weapons while rooted. Your root spell is the same, as is the runemaster's. I've been rooted... for minutes.<br>
<br>
<i>Inf at level 50 are RvR GODS</i><br>
<br>
I think Runemasters are much more frightening. No one is an RvR god. Everyone can be killed.<br>
<br>
<i>How much damage can these rogues deliver in the space of 10 seconds</i><br>
<br>
Less than a Spear Hero or Polearm Armsman. You would have been dead faster if either of those got within range of you.<br>
<br>
<i>check if attacker is using style, if attacker is using style then all other checks are at 10% of normal</i><br>
<br>
Most Albion and Midgard no-opening weapon styles have a high bonus to hit and no defensive penalty. This is why it seems defensive skills don't work in RvR. Trying being a Hibernian... where nearly all weapon styles have a defensive penalty and no to hit bonus.<br>
<br>
<i>all defensive skills except evade useless, and pointless to train in</i><br>
<br>
I guarantee I can kill a berserker who ignores the parry skill easier than one who specced it high. Skalds who ignore parry I can actually kill as well. Shields terrify me. Defensive skills work very well. Of course, I don't have any decent styles so that might be part of the reason I fear defensive skills.<br>
<br>
<i>both other realms were given instant cc, which is a nerf to Midgard as a whole</i><br>
<br>
Only Hibernia got new instant CC spells. And that's because there were ZERO instant CC spells available. The new Minstrel AE Mez isn't instant.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Midgard has insta mez on Healers and Skalds. There's no nerf here. It's like a Nightshade saying they were nerfed when Infiltrators got 2.5x spec points.<br>
<br>
Just like you are specced high enough in Pacification to get your instas is no different than the multitude of Druids and Bards who aren't specced high enough in Nature and Music to get their instas.<br>

We never did solo as well as a shadowblade.<br>
<br>
They are a support class, just like a healer, designed to kill important people like mezzers / healers / overpowered cloth casters / etc.  If they cannot kill these people, then they are a broken class.  There is a lot of risk assosciated with doing this too, because its a melee range thing that leaves an assassin surrounded by enemies.   There is no more one shotting either so we always unstealth.  <br>
<br>
If you, as a healer, die to an infiltrator, then your tanks / skalds arent doing thier job.  Infiltrator is intended to do large dps in a short time frame (as is all other assassin classes, who have probally the highest short term rvr melee dps), because they dont have the hits to deal with a long duration fight.  <br>
<br>
About thrust.  Midgard is the only realm, i mean the ONLY realm a thrust infiltrator gets attack bonuses too.  Everybody else except non absorb buffed casters gives us a penalty.  I would rather have 2 realms with neutral targets, than 1 realm with a bonus target.  <br>
<br>
Infiltrators cannot critical on poisons.  Poison dots have no resist i believe because they took that feature out before 1.51 went live - but when they do get them, they will be body resist which is poison / disease / melee stun.<br>

Luckily my shield, small and untrained though it may be, still gives me decent heat and flame resistance.<br>
<br>
Having read through your posts, I will do my damndest to raise my physical resists as high as possible, and see how much that helps.  I hope it helps a LOT, but I am not positive it will.  I have put my thrust resist up to 27%, but it doesnt seem to actually take off 27% of the damage.  I think it takes off (27-15)=12% of the damage.  But it doesnt really do that either.  From my testing against thrust using svartelves, it seems that the armor penalties are applied twice, once on base damage, and again on added damage.  For example, if I switch to studded, while wearing 27% thrust resist, I am getting hit for 84(-23).  This is actually doing 60ish points of damage per hit.  If I am wearing chain (with the 27-15 resist), I will get hit for 122(-13), which is actually over 100 points of damage.  I am not sure why the type of armor acts in a double fashion, but it will take a TON of thrust resist to make me able to survive an inf attack.  I have started to build a studded armor set for use in RvR though, as that seems to be the way to go, especially since most of the classes I seem to fight have trained in thrust type weapons as opposed to slash.<br>

In general, I agree that mythic should not nerf classes before they are done their RvR &quot;balancing changes,&quot;  whatever those changes entail.<br>
<br>
I disagree with the inf being able to kill me faster than I can twitch heal.  If they can do that, then it makes any guards or melee characters with me useless, as the inf kills the healer, the guards kill the inf (assuming he doesnt vanish), the healer's party is screwed, and the inf SHOULD be able to get rezzed by others in his group (assuming he is not soloing).<br>
<br>
What I have not taken into account is whether the inf I have been fighting have buffbots.  The first inf that I fought traveled with a minstrel.  The minstrel mezzed me, the inf killed my companion.  Then the inf killed me.  The minstrel, apart from the initial cc, did nothing.  I am also unsure of the average damage that an inf can do unbuffed vs buffed by an enhance cleric sitting in a safespot elsewehere.  Also, I have no real recommendations on how to counter the abilites given by buff bots that do not completely screw over people that actually play support classes.  In addition, buffbots give Mythic twice the revenue stream, so I cant really see Mythic wanting to deal with the issue in a timely manner.<br>

Part of the problem that you have is that Healers are such a priority target.  I'm a L41 Infiltrator (Slash) and I will gladly trade a death in order to take out a wounded Healer.<br>
<br>
Typically I'll be wandering along in Emain or Uppland and I'll see the end of an RvR skirmish in which the Healer has taken some damage.  At that point I basically suicide on him to take out the only rezzer that the Midgard hunting group has.  This is the most cost effective use of my time because it slows an entire group down to a crawl while they wait for reinforcements to rez their rezzer.<br>
<br>
This infuriates the Midgard group and the Healer (my corpse gets jumped on a lot) but it's an unavoidable part of the game.  Without this type of check on the Healers I think they would be truly out of control and dominant in RvR.<br>

<br>
The Infiltrator is not the only one who can kill so fast. A caster could certainly do it. As I said above, a spear hero or armsman could as well. A mercenary or blademaster could probably do it too.<br>
<br>
The advantage over the other high-damage classes that the Infiltrator has is stealth--if you didn't see that spear hero coming, you'd totally panic when they smacked you for 500 4 times in a row. Assassins can get into range to attack you before you see them. In order to get that stealth advantage assassins give up armor, group functionality, and hitpoints. These are huge sacrifices--especially when it comes to group functionality.<br>
<br>
Assassins are a one-trick pony: do damage. Okay, maybe two-trick: scout and do damage.<br>
<br>
Although you may feel it's unfair to be prey, I don't find it all that nice when a healer sneaks up and heals my intended victim ruining 15 minutes of getting into position for a kill, or worse mezzes me and invites a cabal of friends to smush me. Them's the breaks though. You have your super powers, I have mine.<br>
<br>
I play a healer and a nightshade, a healer is way more useful and powerful than an assassin. I may not get the kill, but I can make whole armies just stand around looking stupid while my group chops them up into little pieces. It's a gratifying feeling. As a nightshade, my time is usually spent waiting for a rez after yet another failed attempt to kill someone.<br>

Melee resist bonuses are capped at 26% just like spell resisances. Any natural resistances you have are added on top of that, as are castable, duration-based resist buffs and RA-buffs like the 3%-resist buffs. Unfortunately there are no melee resistance buff Realm Abilities (only avoid pain, which is available to few classes, and has limited duration / recast timer.)<br>

<br>
I am sorry you get killed, but as a healer you are a target, no question about it, because everyone knows if you dont kill the healer they will CC your group into oblivion. Do you feel bad when a mid healer and a hunter can zoom around mezzing entire groups of 50th level folks, then stunning them one at a time, kill them and move on to the next till the entire group is dead without them every having a chance to use their weapons or spells? Oh they use a purge, big whoop. Always another stun, root or mez to fix that isnt there? 2 mids against 8, and the 8 have no chance if they dont mez first. Didnt see that mentioned in your little rant, well let me tell you there is always another side of the friggen coin just like with assassins.<br>
<br>
For your information rogue poisons have resists. My poisons get resisted a hell of a lot more often then I ever resist your bloody CC's. Also for your information, infiltrators dont get to have crits on their poisons, thats nightshades. Also you can shove your belief that infiltrators easily solo any midgard class where the sun dont shine. What a big pile of crap. Yea my 300 PA thats easily removed by first aid I, is a huge factor in a fight against a tank, any tank that isnt stupid enough to let me kite him, or sit around on his ass being a target.<br>
<br>
I see these posts about how assassins are over powered and cant help but partly laugh and cry at the same time. Its ok for an Eldritch to run around able to nuke for 600+ every couple seconds, PBAOE for 500+ every couple seconds, have a quickcast/instant stun, speed, gtaoe, and whatever other god forsaken abilities they have, but an assassin with his 300 standing PAs... wow they are horrible, over powered monsters!!!!<br>
<br>
Bottom line is that assassins are in generally pretty crappy. We have @#%$ armor, we do for the most part crappy damage, we no longer have much of a role in keeps, and honestly we are not even assassins any more, we are extremely light tanks with stealth.  What we have, and have always had, is suprise. We are masters of taking advantage of a situation, of exploiting other peoples stupidity, of causing people to panic, screwing up what they were doing. We dont win fights because we out melee them, we win fights because we sit around waiting for the right moment to maximize the impact. People will be sitting, will try and run instead of fighting, be on the wrong hotbar, and all sorts of things. There are people of all classes that are super hard to kill, including healers, what assassin doesnt recognize a few of those? Why are they so hard to kill, because they dont often put themselves in a weak position, they dont panic, and they dont often screw up. Be one of these people and you will find your assassin problems are remarkably over.<br>
<br>
So in short, nerf me if you like I no longer give a crap. DAoC will never, ever be balanced because Mythic doesnt have a friggen clue about its end game. There method of balancing is listening to people like you who only ever spout about other classes, how horribly unbalanced they are, and so forth. What about your class? Perhaps I am all wrong, perhaps you are not this type of person, maybe you have posted that CCs are destroying the game for everyone that doesnt use ranged attacks, that CC timers are a complete joke. If so I appologize, if not well stick it.<br>

Also, to be considered is that we can spend 20 mins easy tracking and setting up a kill.. for what 400rps, i'm a 40 inf.. so thats normally my best,  a caster with pbaoe or aoe can wade in through off 5-6 spells reap more than 400rps in what 20 sec?  if their realm wins the battle they can go on and do it again.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
