1. [Nevermind.  I see that you had different weapons in each hand.]<br>
<br>
2. Rib Separation and Ripper aren't where they should be.  RS should be about 110 and Ripper 125.<br>
<br>
3. At first glance Doublefrost seems little bit better than Garrote/AH combo.  Starting with a full endurance bar, you'd be able to get off 6 DFs for +525.6 damage.  An assassin could pull of 5 G/AH chains for +640.  The issue is time however, as the DF assassin will get his +525 over 5 attacks, and the G/AH assassin gets his +640 over 10.  If the assassin using DF and the assassin using G/AH meet eachother on the battlefield (theoretically, identical SBs could meet on Mordred) and they fought for 10 combat rounds (not out of the question if both are in epic armor and buffed), the DF SB does a total of 1444 points of damage and the G/AH assassin does about 1558 damage.  In that case, G/AH is better.  If they only fought for 5 rounds (about right before acquiring epic armor), the G/AH user gets around 769 damage, and the DF user gets around 897.  So DF looks stacked toward frontloaded damage, but G/AH seems to work better over time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Braack that is some excellent work.  Do you think you could get with 3DKnight and Zed to do some testing against the same mob?  I'd like to see how thrust and slash measure up, and I'm sure some shades would like to see how pierce and blades do as well.  Of course, you'd have to be specced similarly and similarly equipped, and I'm not sure how hard that is to do.  It would be a great test though. <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A> at: 7/1/02 11:20:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/unage42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nage42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 4:10:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3668.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CS and LA Styles, an indepth test.</span><hr size=1> Heya Braack, heya Brandyn<br>
<br>
I think the choice of weapons was a good one -- not the best but certainly fairly representative of what lots of people will be using out there.  Only enough money for one high-qual crafted one, and off-hand proc'ing weapon which you can sometimes get lucky with it and is just as good vs. PvE (but 89% qual.... *shudder* wouldn't want to try using that against a person wearing epic with the double-dip penalty there &lt;grin&gt;).<br>
<br>
To Brandyn:<br>
<br>
&gt;RS should be about 110 and Ripper 125<br>
<br>
Yes, this is exactly the issue, that they are not where they should be at all, especially considering that they should be on reaction-based damage table!  I'd argue that Ripper should be INSANE damage if it is gonna stay a 4-chain.  I mean hell, you should hear trumpets playing and cheerleaders should dance around you if you can land a 4-chain in PvP  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for the discussion about using Garrote/Achilles vs. Comeback/Double Frost... I must be missing something, but are we not all in agreement that unless you are Ultra-CritBlade with big 2H that the Garrote/Achilles chain is a Bad Thing to use in 1-vs-1 (what with Garrote's penalty to defence)?  For the SB, the make-or-break is based on reaction damage styles where the Comeback -&gt; Icy gives high damage and stun, followed by Hamstring/Comeback for either bleeds &amp; def. bonus (yumm!) or just straight huge damage.  One need only look at DragonFang to understand about how important regular, reaction-based styles are (ooo, don't get me started &lt;grrr&gt;).<br>
<br>
Braack's comment about how people will ONLY use DoubleFrost as a backup to Comeback -&gt; Icy [as backup to Comback, etc.] is 100% true, which is fine by me cause it keeps my quickbar simple <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I _think_ that Braack's very Thrust *cough* of his discussion is that the CS line is not really that good in 1-vs-1 and as such the ShadowZerk was born (totally forgoing the CS line entirely).  Now I'm all for variety, but in a situation where say a Thane decides to completely forgo his StormCalling line because he'd rather put points into other abilites.... well... you'd expect them to revisit StormCalling wouldn't you?  &quot;I only take it to 34 cause the rest is crap&quot; would raise some eyebrows too I'd say.<br>
<br>
Personally I only use Garrote/Achillies in groups or when the target is running for the snare effect (not a chance of me being hit) because of the less than stellar damge and defense penalty -- Brandyn, do you not find yourself getting hit more when you use Garrote?<br>
<br>
I'd really like to see the defense penalty for Garrote go, it's enough that it already slightly delays the attack (greater delay, but perhaps this is just perceptual).  Garrote should be bleed with no effect on def and Achillies should be snare with say small bonus to def... that would make the chain more attractive (even with low damage) because there would be no _penalty_ in using it (as there is now).<br>
<br>
Am I wrong? <p>Cheers,<BR>

<br>
<br>
Couple concerns though, the 53 LA is not readily attainable to non-inflated characters, unless they truly ditch CS altogether, not a wize move. There is very little + LA items out there unless you are sacrificing other stats, whereas there is a ton of + CS items.<br>
<br>
I think you would find better results for all styles and all lines switching out cleaver for an arcanium Double Bladed Axe. The DPS is slightly lower, but should be around cap, and it is .2 seconds slower, good for styles. I was never impressed with cleaver myself.<br>
<br>
IS there anyway you can deflate your stats a little, to say 50 axe, 40 LA and try it? Curious to see what the reduction will be, your numbers appear really nice, higher then mine, I ended at 47 LA with items, 51 Axe.<br>
<br>
Problem I see is that good numbers at 53 LA, 53 axe or whatever it was will make left axe seem a beter line then it is, in your test you still had good CS capability, you just cant do all that with 2.2 spec points.<br>
<br>
Woot though, good job.<br>

So one of the moves should be picked as the reference, and others normalized to that.<br>
<br>
I.e., you got your non-styled, your use-anytime style bonus, your second-chain after a use-anytime, your reaction-based multiplier, your second/third/fourth bonus after a reaction-based, etc.<br>
<br>
Obviously you are correct with the statement that most will not be able to get the styles so high (and wouldn't even if they could cause there are no useful styles up past 44).<br>

<br>
Pure Soul (only left-overs in Enven)<br>
CS: 34, LA: 44, Sword/Axe: 44, Stealth: 36, Enven: 5<br>
<br>
Running the tests with the 5-spec is probably most representative of the player population out there.  Early players were mostly CritBlades, but now the 5-spec is more common.<br>
<br>
CS: 34 (cause the higher styles are not useful) Base Wep: 39 (where we don't use the styles for this wep, just the damage table).<br>
<br>
Then expect people to have say +8-10 total to these (not everyone has perfect equip and high realm rank.  Say +10 total to count for an average (maybe not accurate, but gotta pick something).<br>
<br>
So a real running of numbers would be (with equipment) CS: 44, Base: 49<br>
<br>
And yes, the ideal equipment given free-reign of crafter weps (assuming Legion weps is not realistic in general) would be:<br>
<br>
99% Arc Double-Bladed Axe (16.1 dps, 4.2 delay, 35% bonus)<br>
or<br>
99% Arc Bastard-Sword (16.2 dps, 4.1 delay, 35% bonus)<br>
<br>
99% Arc Bearded Axe (15.3 dps, 2.7 delay, 35% bonus)<br>
<br>
Giving you the high front-loading for a Crit opener and delay balancing with the faster off-hand.<br>
<br>
I think there are more sword users out there cause they started their char that way (let's not assume respec just quite yet).<br>
<br>
After respec we will see huge polarization: Viking = Hammers,  ShadowBlade = Axes, Infs = Thrust (OMFG!), Scouts = Shield (1 Stealth), etc.<br>

Could you try 50 trained axe (63 axe with items). With a 2h using regular axe styles Havoc (frontal) and Try's Fury chain.<br>
<br>
I am really wondering if LA is less damaging now overtime than baseline using a 2h. Test it against Doublefrost.<br>
<br>
Anouther interesting test would be equal spec points. <br>
<br>
1274 spec points (50axe) vrs 1259 spec points (34la &amp; 36axe) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ujablackhand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>J A  Blackhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.crewsman.homestead.com/files/Demon_Hunter.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/6/02 3:10:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3668.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Braak...</span><hr size=1> I still need yer email bro, you have mine and I have loads of logs all from rvr setting the other night in duels.

<br>
I do think these tests show that critblades are viable.  A lot of people were saying that garotte is useless so critblades don't hit all that hard after the first punch.  Now if it's reasonably equal to df then that's not so bad.  <br>
<br>
I guess it doesnt address the delay on the second hit, but it's better than it was.<br>

<br>
Garrotte has a penalty to defence, and costs the same as Doublefrost, although only doing roughly 65% of the damage as doublefrost.<br>
<br>
When you choose garrotte, you have nothing to fall back on it with.  When you have Leftaxe, you use comback (which does roughly 115% of garrotte damage) with Doublefrost as a backup.  So if you dont evade, you still get DF off doing great damage, no defence penalty, for the same amount of endurance.  If Comeback hits, then you have frosty-gaze, the 6 second stun, which greatly outdamages achilles heel.<br>

<br>
In some ways ah hitting a little less makes sense in that critblades get the great opening hit.  However I'd say that it shouldn't quite be so bad<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It seems to me (i play a 5spec) that critblades struggle more landing cd and need help with that.  The gar/ah is really more just a finisher.<br>
<br>
If Garrotte hit hit the same as df and had same endurance cost the only reason to go la is for the 39 stun and if they keep increasing resists etc then that won't be a good reason and I will /respec to a critblade.  I guess that's enough for me but it seems like la should hit a bit harder since it's yet another spec line.<br>
<br>
However I don't play critblade so these are just guesses.<br>

You have to be careful what you do with it though or you could make things worse for shadowblades compared to other assassins.  Most infiltrators and nightshades rely on gar/ah as their main any time attack because they have nothing else as damaging.<br>
<br>
The simple truth about Garrote is that the endurance cost is too high and the defense penalty too severe for the damage that it does.  I have taken to using my level 18 thrust detaunt style which does no bonus damage over garrote simply because it is less endurance intensive and gives a defensive bonus which leads to evades alowing the real damage to begin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uarmylt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ArmyLT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/10/02 10:29:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3668.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Braak...</span><hr size=1> did I miss seeing it, or was the lvl 29 positional to the 44th chain never tested?
