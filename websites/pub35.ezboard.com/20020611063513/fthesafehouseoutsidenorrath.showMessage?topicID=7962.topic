between India and Pakistan ? <br>
Semms like the world is quite close<br>
to what could rapidly escalate into the world's first full blown nuclear war. All signs are that<br>
India may attack soon...at most all it will take will<br>
be one more serious attack by Pakistani militants, on top of their massacre of 30 wives and children of Indian soldiers 2 weeks ago. I knew it was close to war but when I read today that the Indians were burning 1000's of acres of forest near the border with Pakistan in order to have a clear field of view..on  top of all the other war preparations lately<br>
like the 1 million troops massed along the border, cancellation<br>
of all military leave, laying of 1000's of mines along the border,<br>
putting the merchant marine under the command of the navy,<br>
the hawkish rhetoric, etc etc etc - the signal seem to be pretty strong for a relatively imminent strike by India, possibly<br>
hoping to have a 'limited' war by hitting militant camps in<br>
Pakistan..though staying 'limited' could well be difficult.<br>
India far outweighs Pakistan in conventional forces and the Pakistanis have said they would use nuclear weapons first if it looked like they were getting their ass kicked. <br>
What makes this so dangerous is that these countries do not<br>
have the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction which is<br>
largely what prevented a nuclear war with the Soviets.<br>
In fact, many elements in the Indian establishment believe<br>
they can 'win' a nuclear war with Pakistan because Pakistani<br>
missiles can only reach half of India; while Indian planes<br>
and missiles can reach all of Pakistan. Once you start thinking<br>
you can 'win' a nuclear war you are setting yourself up for<br>
your own little instance of hell. I'm not gonna take sides in this<br>
thing because both sides have their stories. But hopefully these guys will smarten up cause right now they are literally a hair trigger away from a war that may very well turn nuclear.<br>
Combined both countries are estimated to have<br>
over 100 nukes..ranging in power from the Hiroshima bomb<br>
to ones of more than 10x that power.<br>

Once they get that vote in Kashmir for which side of the partition they wish to be on it should all settle down.

Love to think that some dilly-dallying maharajah in 1947 who wouldn't come down on one side of the fence or the other is causing this. Personally I've been more in favour of Pakistan control of Kashmir in the past, but always hard to support any country that may have un-responsible use of nuclear weapons (no offense, French people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Of course the big questions really are, what are the nuclear capabilities of the 2 countries in question? Both of them have ballistic missiles of ranges over 2k miles covering the entire of both countries, and expert opinion holds the number of warheads at Pakistan (25) and India (60). As to if they have devices suitable for missiles is another question. It's all a game of one-up-manship and bluffing ATM.<br>
<br>
And of course, will a nuclear war finally put the dampners on the Austrailian cricket side doing the test tour? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.aodoctors.org/Cross.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/02 7:13:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7962.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.myezboard.com:81/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/aodoctors/images/weeee.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuclear War ?</span><hr size=1> I wonder if use of a Nuke in this instance will "Lower the bar" globally.<br>

I'm pretty certain one could easily fit on an Oil Tanker. Of course, Denver and Salt Lake City may not be at as much risk, but I can think of a number of port cities that would make very tempting targets.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Either the world splits in half when 3+ of those things go off in a single day, or at the very least, we irradiate the better half of europe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I think you overestimate the power of a Nuclear Weapon. Yes, they are quite devastating, but in the popular press, their destructive power has been overstated by several orders of magnitude. A limited nuclear exchange (Under 10 warheads) could probably go on, without a huge amount of effect outside of the immediate region. Yes, it would blow the crap ou of that area, but Pakistan and India could duke it out with a handful of nukes, and its not going to be the end of the world, or of the human race. Most of the country wouldn't notice, outside of some minor, temporary atmospheric changes. (Pretty sunsets!
