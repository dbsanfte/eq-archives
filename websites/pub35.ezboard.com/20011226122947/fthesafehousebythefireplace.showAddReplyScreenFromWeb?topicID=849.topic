My name is Bilal, they call me ‘The Rat’. Midgaard is my home, been crawling around the nooks and crannies of our fair land since I was a runt. Come to think of it, I guess I still am a runt. In any case, Its how I learned my profession, you know, ne’erdowell, hoodlum, rogue, cutpurse, some even like to call us shadowblade.<br>
<br>
Nothin’ particularly exciting about my education. I learned not to steal ‘shroom fritters from barkeep Ygrslad, that girls are usually more trouble than they are worth, that you should never fence a sword in the same town you ‘found’ it in. Just your basic truths. Two things that stick in my head are my encounters with Sudian and my new gang ‘Erovrar’. <br>
<br>
Sudian, well he is a special kind of kobold, he took the time to teach me the more violent aspects of living in the wilds. He taught me such things as how to move without attracting attention, where the vulnerable parts are on most mammals, even drab and humdrum things like how to apply a poison to your blade without making yourself sick. I owe Sudian a debt of gratitude. Come to think of it, I probably owe Sudian my life. I wonder why he bothered to take the time to show me these things…<br>
<br>
Thinking of Erovrar on the other hand. This group of scalawags is another story entirely. They seem to flit around preaching the ideals of all that is good in Midgaard. I am not fooled. Just by the fact that they associate themselves with me is proof enough that not all of their intentions are ‘good’ and ‘just’. Despite their self-delusional fancies, they are for the most part an entertaining crew. I must admit I learned things from them as well, more mundane than Sudian’s education, but worthwile nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Enough reminiscing, the past is the past, and is one thing that cannot be changed. This story is about my final transition into manhood, my first assassination.<br>
<br>
I suppose it started calmly enough, I was strolling around the gates of the Faste when I got a message that the rest of the gang was taking their turn manning an outpost to protect from Albion invaders. This sounded more interesting to me than oiling my armor, something I look for an excuse to avoid as often as possible, so I set across the frontier to find them.<br>
<br>
The frontier was uncharted territory for me, and while the trip was uneventful, it was no less frightening. I didn’t know giants grew to be that BIG! I digress, I made it to the outpost without incident, waved at my friends manning the battlements and moved on through into the wilds to scout for the enemy.<br>
<br>
For an hour, nothing. Back at the fort a cry for arms goes up. Just as I am about to turn to run back to help I see a lone Albion invader coming down the road to the fort. I literally have to rub the sleep out of my eyes. I cant believe that this Albion scum can be silly enough to think he can clear through the fort unscathed. This Albion has some sort of magical stone construct following him like a troll butler. Certainly he has a deathwish.<br>
<br>
Well if a deathwish is what he has, certainly I can help him on his way to Muspheleim. I check my equipment to make sure that all my straps are secure and will make no noise, turn and apply the lotus extract to my longsword as quietly as I might and set off behind him.<br>
<br>
He must not be quite as dumb as I thought, though his death will be no less real. The Albion hugs the left wall on the way in, dancing amongst the rampart on his way to the gate. Fortunately for me he has to go through the gate so that’s where I meet him. <br>
<br>
As he opens the outer gate I quietly unsheath my sword. He takes one step, two, with his big construct following. I quickly place myself between this pesky Albion and his magic in order to strike. Three, four, he is almost to the inner door. I stay my blade a second making sure I have everything in place. Five, six, WHAM!<br>
<br>
Surprise is total, I could not see his face but by his body language when I slammed my longsword through his ribs cracking two in the process, the Albion was in deep shock at what had so rudely invaded his body. I could even begin to see the poison take effect, it amazes me now just to think how fast it acts. I have done it, I have assassinated my first Invader! WHAM!<br>
<br>
The blow from his golem glances off my left shoulderpad. The bruise would stay with me for a week. The caster begins to turn to defend himself, perhaps to run, I will never know. I begin to panic, he isn’t dead, what do I do, oh crap, I don’t wanna die out here! Sudian’s voice rings through my head, “Don’t think, act.”<br>
<br>
I collect my wits, and as master Sudian taught, place my sword between the casters thighs. I draw it up and to the right, cutting the femoral artery. The Albion drops to the floor life blood staining the dirt floor in the gatehouse. I remember to turn to protect myself from the stone construct. Fortunately for me it is now just mere stones, its magic fled with the life of the Albion.<br>
<br>
Taking a life isn’t easy, but then again, it never should be.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
