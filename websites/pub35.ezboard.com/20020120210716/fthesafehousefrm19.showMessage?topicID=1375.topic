I doubt they would have ever had it if Mythic would have put the two classes in at the same time.  They can't take that away at this stage of the game, but by giving archers stealth they have pigeonholed the role of the assassin classes to Archer-killers as Archers are the true assassins in the game. <br>
<br>
The problem is although the game dynamics give us that role(archer killer)... our class design isnt very well suited for it. <br>
<br>
Not only does the rogue classes need to be looked at, but archers need to be factored into the equations as well. <br>

btw: Don't get defensive, not trying to flame, but just wondering<br>
<br>
I for one love being a Nightshade simply because of 3 reasons<br>
<br>
1: We are a rogue and are the most rounded class of all, not many can do what we can (Stealth, Melee (a little), Critical Strike, cast spells, poison, disguise, etc etc)<br>
<br>
2: difficult to play, why be a class that is just too easy, as you stated earlier, more sense of achievance (don't even know if that's a word or if it is I spelled it right, but it fit :P)<br>
<br>
3: Hibernia, wanted by every other realm, also the most underestimated and underclassed realm, btw.

More that everything we can do is equally ineffectual.  Our spells are somewhat of a joke.  Sure I can pull with it, but that's not why I chose to be nightshade after reading the class descriptions, before ever logging in.  Disguise isn't in yet, and in order to be as effective as I want to be at certain things, I can't afford to be well rounded.    <br>
Took a shot at a yellow con dwarf healer today, frontal PA, with a decent sized sword.  Took maybe 20% off.  Archer probably would have had him dropped in four shots.  As is, I was dead before I could get more than 2 or 3 swings in (He had a group with him)...<br>
Of course, two days ago, I would have been bladeturned, so this is still an improvement.<br>
<br>
Seriously, for my money given the difficulty of setting up, we should be able to take out any yellow.  Now, sure, that one was in a large group, but I sincerely doubt I would have come out on top even had he been solo.  My first shot barely scratched him.  Hell, I've been hit my blue con mobs for a larger percentage of damage.<br>
Perhaps for RvR our initial CS chain should take off a percentage of max health (Random, but modified by con, etc.  I.e. on a high purple if we even land we take off perhaps 5% health on a full landed PA chain, perhaps less, while on a yellow a full landed chain should average around 100%.  I.e. We should have a good shot at dropping any yellow con in three shots.  I'd even take a trade off where our chain could be interrupted if we're hit from another source during that initial chain...  That would make the element of surprise all the more critical - A group that reacts quickly MIGHT be able to save that healer, but the healer him or herself striking back shouldn't interrupt (I'd go as far as to say that we should be nearly immune to insta stun messes from a yellow target - provided that we've started our chain on them.)  <br>
Yeah, I know if anything like this was ever put in, we'd suddenly be hearing cries of &quot;Nerf the Nightshades&quot;.  @#%$ I wish there was a reason for people to cry that though, I really do.  My score for today was one grey troll, twice (They didn't learn.  He was grouped with a yellow tank, so I considered him fair game.  If his friend got to me, I was toast).  I should have been able to take out his friend instead of him.<br>
I mean, seriously... Who's immune to a blade across the throat?<br>

I had an orange con on the run yesterday, only thing that saved her was an instant cast stun...

Perhaps you should look, instead, at what you can do and work with it. Not at what you can't do and worry over it.<br>
<br>
Blanket statement (not directed towards anyone in particular, some of you posted a few facts) - if you want to throw out numbers and ask the question why, then please state ALL the facts: ie your level, weapon(s) you are using (con, DPS, Speed, quality, bonus) your specs and bonuses, your armor and what con, con of victim, possible class of victim... there's so many factors. It's hard to advise, provide answers, solutions and generally help out when all we get is: why can't I crit like an archer.<br>

Thanks for the numbers on the minor enervating poison, Scoops. Didn't know it did all that. Guess my envenom will be going up soon.<br>

I have a 16 Ranger with 1 stealth, and I can solo yellows like there was no tomorrow.  Even if I miss my pull shot, as long as I do about 60 dmg on one of the TWO other shots I get off on his run in, I won't die.  I usually have yellows down to 20% before they start hitting me - and I can melee one to death if he starts at 85% reliably.<br>
<br>
I have not tried RvR with him - my plan is/was to not go back to my SB until after Christmas.  I thought I'd get him (the Ranger) to 10 or so and try another class - but the levelling never slowed down, I started fletching, and I just haven't set him aside yet.  (Guilty pleasure in actually being able to level / solo!)<br>
<br>
Anyway - my point - Stealth seems like overpowering this class, IMO.  I plan to take him to 20, try some PvP without any stealth skill, and see how I do.  I suspect I will do just fine, since piercing / CD / self buffing will be pretty high.  <br>

Stealth is one of the places I feel that I have an advatage over other archers too.  I don't get big time damaging spears, or pets, or quicknes buffs, or sprint buffs, or dual weild and damage adding buffs, and more.  But if they can't see me first it don't matter.<br>

you'll be limited to how an assassin has to fight all of their fights (sans poison) but you'd last longer since at least you get better armor.<br>

remember there are only 2 assassin CS moves that don't require hidden (garrote +chain which is anytime, and hamstring+chain which requires evade), i.e. there is only the opening move, and two 'unique' assassin moves that you don't get with sword/shield.<br>
<br>
i agree though, scouts sound fairly limited.  They should really drop your stealth though or convert it into some better kind of sight/tracking/awareness skill and make scout's stealth a lower level of spec (or an ability)<br>

Also, points well taken from everyone<br>
<br>
Ideas that I like is to give the Archers Stealth, but only let it rise up to 8 (that way they learn Detect Hidden at least) a good sniper should at least know when he's been discovered) but if someone sneaks on an archer, let's say another assassin type which mainly is a rogue, they shouldn't really stand a chance. Every class should have a strong point and a weak point, kinda reminds me of one of the little mini games that was in FF7, Condor Point for those who remember it<br>
<br>
Where as if you was a mage, you was strong against melee, weak against range<br>
<br>
If you was a tank, strong against range, weak against magic<br>
<br>
If you was a ranged attack, you were strong against magic, but weak against melee<br>
<br>
so classify rogues as a melee, just not a good melee, we should be able to kill range, but don't last against magic (that is when detected) of course in the game, no one could hide, but still it's a good concept.<br>
<br>
And in the game, for those who played it, the flying creatures stand for magic :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udowser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dowser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/19/01 7:27:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1375.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why cant we....</span><hr size=1> Regarding Archer stealth, a better solution to nerfing archers would be to make Detect Hidden more effective (As I understand it, only assassins get that skill).

Can you afirm today that PvP is balanced really? No i dont think so. Archers have too many advantages compared to the others. Dont tell me they are vulnerable in melee, cause only a dumb archer ever finds himself meleeing in pvp (they stay stealthed all the time and only an assassin type has a chance to approach them). Then they can shoot from far for an insane damage (compared to assassin types again), and have better armor. The two last times i died in pvp were archers: Once i died in 2 arrows, then i was shoot for 700dmg and got insta killed. Even versus a blue con (and maybe green?) I cant do that...And i gotta position myself (knowing that 50% of the time ur stab fails cause the guy turned himself right when u attacked)!! Our critical just sux compared to theirs, and this is not fair cause it s much harder for us than for them.<br>
<br>
Anyway, i m not trying to whine, but just to say that it seems OBVIOUS that this is not balanced and that we (assassins) have all the disadvantages of being a stealthy class, but no advantage at all at the same time compared to archers.<br>
<br>
Making of stealth a skill for archers is a solution. Cause more points in bow means it s easier for  us to detect them (and harder for them to hide), and more points in stealth means lower criticals with bow. Or increase our critical and general damage output, cause right now we are way under everyone.<br>

You can sort of lump together everything that goes into that balance: the amount of damage you do, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> how</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you do your damage, the risk you take to do the damage, the time it takes to do that damage, the amount of armor or other defenses you can use, the amount of damage you can take, etc; and make it into an overly simplified pool of 10 points.  Then you can allocate those 10 points to either offense or defense.  <br>
<br>
For instance, your average nuking fingerwaggler can do a lot of damage from a distance, but can't take much damage if they let the foe get to them before they kill it.  They'd be like a 9 offense, 1 defense.  Whereas your theoretical tank should average out around 5 offense, 5 defense (maybe 6 offense, 4 defense or 4 offense, 6 defense depending on what gear or skills they choose to use, but you get the picture).  Steady damage dealing and taking.<br>
<br>
Now, considering the first post of this thread, let's compare an archer and an assassin.  The archer can do a lot of damage from a distance.  I believe that someplace Mythic stated that an archer should ideally be able to knock off 1/2 to 3/4 of the target's life before it reaches them, then they finish it off with melee.  They should be 3/4 ranged, 1/4 melee, basically.  They train one skill, archery, to do that 1/2 to 3/4 damage and shouldn't be hit by the target while doing it.  Once they get to melee, they get reinforced armor (less than a tank, but better than a nuker) to protect themselves and have fewer hitpoints than a tank, but more than a nuker.  Let's give them 7 offense, 3 defense.<br>
<br>
In order for assassins to do their damage, they have to sneak up unseen and once they fire off that first hit, they begin taking damage from the target and are in melee.  In order to do that damage, they have to train <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> two</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> skills, CS and Stealth, and it takes longer to slowly sneak in and position themselves perfectly for the Critical Strike.  Therefore, their damage is more difficult to deal out than the archer (or nuker) who just has to get in range and firefirefire or the tank that just has to walk up and start whacking.  Finally, assassins get armor between archers and nukers.  Theoretically, they should then be rated around 8 offense, 2 defense.  Ideally, assassins should be able to knock off <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> at least</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 1/2 to 3/4 of the target's life before having to engage it in normal melee.<br>
<br>
In other words, in this scheme the assassin's level appropriate critical strike or critical strike chain (and we could even add in level appropriate poison to the equation which would add a third skill that would have to be worked on to do our optimum damage) should do a level of damage higher than an archer's critical shot + normal shots until the mob reaches them but lower than the amount a nuker can nuke a mob for before it reaches them.<br>
<br>
As Mythic stated, the assassin classes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be the most challenging to play, but that challenge should come from having to tactically set up the situation to be able to deal our damage and do our jobs, not from having an increased cost and risk in order to do mediocre damage.  As I said, this scheme is overly simplified, but hopefully it instills a general sense of what I'm talking about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/20/01 12:05:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1375.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Archers are hardly overpowered</span><hr size=1> Archers are the only ones I regularly kill.

Archers just aren't that frightening. Whip out a shield and close in on them if they see you... block rate with a shield versus arrows is insane. You can totally negate the crit shot with bladeturn.<br>
<br>
The only people who get shreaded by archers are soloer.<br>
<br>
If anything, archers desperately need the Volley attack type so they can do AE damage during battles. Of course, this still leaves thieves with little to do during massive battles.<br>

Nerfing another class to bring your own up in power is the wrong way to do things IMHO. <br>
<br>
If anything discuss ideas and solutions that will.  <br>
1) Make assassins much harder to detect when stealthed.<br>
2) Make assassins detect others at a much higher rate.<br>
<br>
Use whatever ideas you may come up with to suggest better ways for this to happen.  Keep them simple.  The easier they are to code into the camelot engine the more likely they will be able to implement and kept for consideration.<br>
<br>
Just a quick idea would be to add a few &quot;character levels&quot; to all skill check for assassins, whether for stealthing or detecting.  If stealth seems to be heavy dependant upon character levels this should fix all the problems at a quick glance.   The only issue I can think of is can the game engine handle a &quot;50+ level assassin&quot; skill check?<br>

There is no way to even remotely compare them.  Any class that has ranged attack is way more powerful than a class with no ranged attack.<br>
<br>
I don't think archers should have gotten stealth, but it is a done deal now. <br>
<br>
So I think the only solution is to make Detect Hidden a skill that increases.  For instance Detect Hidden II, and Detect Hidden III.<br>
<br>
Then I could find the archers.  Yes, if I can find an archer I can either kill them or force them to run.  But the problem is that I can't ever find them.<br>
<br>
By the way I regularly group with a Hunter and every day I am blown away by the insane damage he can do.  The other day I needed 12 more RP to advance to the next realm rank.  Midgard was way out numbered and the enemy was staying together.  I could not find any target that I could take down.<br>
<br>
The Hunter comes out, and we advance to the G2 gate in Emain.  There are 2 of us and maybe 30 of them.  He picks a target.  He takes 2 shots.  We both get 100 RP.  We run away and the 30 Albions can't find us.  They would have found me if I had tried that solo because I would have been right there in their group.  My Hunter partner then picks off 2 or 3 more of them.  He finally dies when he gets greedy and tries to take 2 of them at once.  I got about 350 RP in about half an hour.  I didn't die, when he went down.  I start looking for a target.  I find a lone con grey Alb and kill him for 1 RP.  Eventually I get bored and attack a sitting con red healer, and I get Creeping Death off and I KNOW I am going to kill this healer (she must not of been paying attention), but then I am hit by two arrows and die.  So in 1 hours play time the Hunter gets me 350 RP and I get myself 1 RP.<br>
<br>
Also, the only people in my guild that constantly solo past level 40 are Hunters.  My guild will get a group together to hunt for Exp, and the ONLY class that ever says, &quot;I think I am going to go solo now&quot; are the Hunters.  Sometimes while fighting con yellows while teamed with 1 Hunter I won't even get to take a swing because the critter is dead before it gets to me.  Once in a while this happens with con orange critters.  If the Hunter picks the right target they can solo easily past level 40.<br>
<br>
I wish I was that effective.  Hell, I would be happy to just be 3/4 as effective.  I would consider re-rolling a Hunter but I have to say that it just looks too easy.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=1375.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessage?topicID=1384.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessage?topicID=1381.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1375.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=1375.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=1375.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1375.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1375.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Dark Age of Camelot</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
