You will find that as you increase in levels, and get a better feel for your ns, your speccing preference will constantly change.  I think I've tweaked my template around a hundred times.  Be patient with your ns and don't be too quick to create a final template.  Do some real rvr, see how well you do against tanks, mages, healers, assassins and base your template from what you wanna do as an NS.  Keep reading the message boards and gather information about what each line does.  One thing that I can tell you is that +11 stealth is easy to achieve through items.  +10 evenom is easy to achieve as well.  Each realm rank you gain (after real rank 1), gives you +1 to all stats. <br><br>So based on that, you may want to take:<br>Stealth to 36, 37, 38<br>Evenom to 37, 38<br>I think the rest of the points really depends on you.<br> <p>Bloodreign<br>-=Anguish=-*Pellinor*<br>Level 46 Lurikeen Nightshade<br>~Oh you were finished?!!

In having my stealth and envenom as low as I do, *all* my jewlery slots are dedicated to raising envenom and stealth.

I know alot of shades who think 37 pierce is too low, and they might switch my CS with Pierce... but then again they like mixing it up in pure melee as if they were a tank. That isn't what I find enjoyable.<br><br>Thus is the strength of the skill-lite system Mythic has. You encounter 2 shades on the battlefield... probably not going to be exact copies of each other. Know your strengths, know your weaknesses, spec accordingly to max your strengths (what is fun for you) and limit your weaknesses.<br><br><br>Oh yea, and the original poster <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Diamondback - spec 25 pierce.

I think I will have to agree with you, when I started out my character, I was under the impression that the best you can get is +11, that is why I have chosen to bring all those skills to 39, I didn't know the skills bonus adds on top of the item bonus until much later, and I was too lazy to replan my template when I found out. <br><br>I probably would have gone with your template if I can do it over it again, but as for now, I have no problem killing people. so I think I will just keep it that way. Later on I will try to wear as many +con items and +resist items as possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3511.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3511.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3511.topic&index=8><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3511.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3511.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3511.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3511.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
