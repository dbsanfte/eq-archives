If as the Paladin says, high damage means one should not be a good or even acceptable tank then the solution is clear.  The disgust paladins feel at being touched by undead mobs should mean they take triple damage.

My monk was created when Kunark came out (Iksar, of course). I chose this char because I have something called a RL with obligations/responsiblities and have limited play time. Melee play style appealed to me but I did not have the time to waste sitting /lfg on so I wanted a class that COULD solo. Enter the monk. At the current time I am a blue away from 56, epic'd and have decent equipment (approx 1080 ac and 2400 hp) and yes my soloing ability has been adversely affected (no, do not have a parser but it is painfully obvious when mobs I could kill fairly easy pre-patch are now handing me my ass). I will go as far to say that there may be some high end monk unbalancing in the game now (I will never see NToV and higher zones) and perhaps even some perceived unbalancing with the new expansion coming out but, as usual, VERANT CREATED IT (see several other excellent posts on this topic). The solution is to fix the real problem, which this patch definately did not do. To all you fucktard non-monks who say that we are &quot;overpowered&quot; and &quot;I haven't been able to solo since I was level 30 so why should you&quot; and all the other bullshit I have seen you spouting on this board...STFU. If you want to whine about not being able to solo, roll up a char that CAN solo instead of crying about the classes that can. This is a fucking game and I pay my monthly fees just like everyone else. If I only have time to pop on for brief sessions to get a little solo exp then that is my perogative and should be an option. If not what the dipshits at Verant have in mind for &quot;The Vision&quot; then they need to emphasize that from the get go...a nice little warning on the game packaging, &quot;this game is NOT intended for the casual gamer and soloing is NOT condoned or supported in any way&quot; or something to that effect.  If Verant does not want people like me playing their game then that is fine by me. I will stick around a bit longer to see what the bottom line is as the dust settles but I have one foot out the door and do not plan on looking back.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udaishanozeb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaiShan o Zeb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 5:57:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monk role?

Tier 1 Monks: Can still Solo ME<br>
Tier 2 Monks: Who who could solo ME can still solo Velks.<br>
Tier 3 Monks: Who could barely solo lower zones can't anymore.<br>

From my personal experience so far:<br>
<br>
60 monk<br>
1150ac<br>
2750hp<br>
<br>
I can still solo Velks reasonably well, and at least as well if not better than any comparably equipped melee/hybrid. <br>
<br>
From the reports I've seen (as I mentioned earlier) I'd guess that accross the board we still solo as well or better than any other comparable melee/hybrid. And that's the thing that's starting to get me. If there is this much uproar and it turns out that we do in-fact still solo better overall--well, then hell yes we were overpowered. If it turns out when everythings been analyzed that your avg monk can no longer solo even the lowest dark blue mobs available, then we have more room to bitch. <br>

<br>
- So?<br>
<br>
&quot;next argument.......compare monk weapon skills to war wep skills...pre-50? um, they are the same, with regard to HTH being higher, yet, if any monk uses fists (like they should), they are out of the competition on SUCKING anyway.......what it in fact is, is that warriors slow down in leveling their wep skills at level 40, yet monks continue to get the 5 per lvl all the way on up, with bonus caps removed here and there...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
- So you say monk weapon skills are equal to war weapon skills pre 50 and then go on to say that past level 40 monks keep raising their skills (with dual wield maxed at 252 at level 36). <br>
<br>
40 skill raises = big difference. As if you were not contradicting yourself enough already you say that a monk misses less than all melee pre 50 due to this skill level disparity (psst. they also give us raw atk bonus in the offense skill department). <br>
<br>
A warrior can't hold a candle to a monk pre 50 damage wise in similar equipment, and post 50 if you see each and every one of the logs posted regularly on this board you will see that on average monks do outdamage warriors by a good margin. <br>
<br>
&quot;where the hell do you think monks can even GET actual WEAPONS before lvl 30 anyway? less we wanna use store bought staves (which were fun to run around with in beta looking cool).......im not including luclin, luclin is new and has fucked up EQ beyond repair as we are seeing now anyway, so all the HTH weps dont count (could count in all the war weps up there then too but i dont know luclin well enough). i think its time you try playing monk again using only what you can personally rip off a cold dead corpse.......youll be outdamaged by untwinked warriors your entire life......<br>
monk fists are a joke, but thats what youre gonna rely on......&quot;<br>
<br>
If you're not a moron, you will diligently sell spell reagents to higher level players for decent cash and will not be prancing around with a fine steel great staff at level 30. Don't compare damage with not knowing what the fuck to do as a low level character to aquire money and items. Plus, monks are on a higher damage table than the rest of melee pre 50, and post 50. That means that if you equip a warrior with a jade mace at level 30, and a monk with a jade mace at level 30. The monk will hit harder than the warrior with that same weapon. <br>
<br>
Monk fists were meant as a pre kunark weapon and widely outdamaged whatever a warrior could muster in the old world as the monk leveled. <br>
<br>
Harder hits + less misses = more damage (amazing, no?). <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;if a war WANTED to, however, (and this is the case with 99% of players from 1 to 55, until they start getting into end game), he/she could easily equip him/herself to outdamage a monk in 9 out of 10 situations.......<br>
<br>
sorry buddy........i think you need to wake up&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Do yourself a favor and take a scoot over the general section and dig up some logs and then try to defend your (wrong) argument with facts instead of ill thought false statements followed by &quot;sorry buddys&quot;.

That is what an Eq monk should be like, plus he was a great dmg dealer.<br>
<br>
Also we fought AOW last night I got triple hit for max dmg, and quad hit 3 of the hits for max dmg and the 4th over 1000, Im not uber but I have full NTOV armor (minus Vulak drops) my buffed Ac was around 1340 and over 5100 hps, FD saved me, but boss mobs are hitting for full and near full for sure.<br>

AC 1140 (1152 epic)<br>
<br>

I can still solo in Velks.  But soloing in Velks was TRIVIAL prepatch.  Velks is exactly my point.  Velks was BENEATH my solo capabilities prepatch.  I never soloed there.<br>
<br>
What I can't solo anymore is in Maiden's Eye and DSP.<br>
Gatherers are doing TWICE as much damage as before.<br>
5 to 6 Bulbs of damage after the patch compared with <br>
2 to 3 Bulbs of damage after the patch.<br>
<br>
To the UBER monks who ME was trivial Pre-patch.  They can still move down to ME for Solo ability.<br>
<br>
Again why do I have to suffer a Solo Nerf in ability?<br>
Why can druids/shamanas/necros Root/Rot so easily.<br>
<br>
This kind of nerf would be similiar for dotting classes IF Dots no longer worked on a Rooted Mob.  You could still do DOTS<br>
in groups where someone else could take agro.  But dots no longer worked on rooted mobs.<br>
<br>
For the Wizard, Nukes no longer work on Snared Mobs.<br>
<br>
In either case, you could still use those offensive abilities with a Tank.  And with lesser effect in solo ((no more medding while rotting))<br>
<br>
Ubers Monks = No hit.   Can still solo same places<br>
Level 2 Monks = Lost Access to &quot;higher&quot; solo places like ME<br>
and down to level 3<br>
Level 3 Monks = SOL.  if you had it difficult soloing Velks prepatch, if it was a challenge, then your SOL.<br>

Good advice, if only the plate classes would have listened to it, Monks might not have been nerfed this bad.  Well, maybe. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

&quot;Dmg dealer.... who says you have to be the BEST dmg dealer?&quot;<br>
<br>
This statement is too stupid to be even touched. I'm afraid it might rub off on me.<br>
<br>
&quot; think you meant to say 'rangers with 45 AA points, an uber bow that procs avatar<br>
and a group/guild that understands how to position the mob and themselves to avoid archery doing 0 damage' there.&quot;<br>
<br>
You know, the same could be said about VI changing the game because of a select 0.5% of the monk population that was able to tank end game mobs in rare situations. You know, the mobs that spawn once a week or 3 times a month?<br>

Pleae, Absor, or anyone at VI for that matter, doesn`t give a damn.

There can only be one class as the best at something.  I'm sorry but that is just the way it is.  Warriors are the best tanks.  Rogues are the best damage dealers.  Rangers are the best with a bow.  Monks are the best with their fists.  Paladins have the ability to be the best against undead.  Each class has it's own unique things they are the best at.  <br>
<br>
  You can't be the best at everything.  Damage stacks.  You can have 3 damage dealers hitting a mob and all are bring something useful to the group.  If you have two tanks in a group then you have one tank too many.  How many people can a mob hit at any one time?  Just one person.  Defense doesn't stack like offense does.  <br>
<br>
  Monks still have a very large role to play.  They can do alot of damage from any side of a mob.  They can pull better then anyone.  Yes, sk's can pull but fd can't be interupted.. sk's spell version can.  Both have a chance of failing.  Monks are also on a seperate dmg table then the plate classes.  This means you put out more damage.  <br>
<br>
  The monk role is one of damage dealer.  That is what you do.  There are alot of ways you can do this role.  A secondary role is as puller.  As a primary damage dealer you should not be tanking any hits.  Your job is to put out damage not absorb it.  The disc's you have allow you to live thru the times you might get agro, and FD helps in those times too.  The whole point of all your defensive skills is to allow you to live in case your dmg output gives you unwanted agro.  The reason you have unwanted agro is because you are doing more damage then most people.    <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94313>Chavr Wyrmbane</a><br>

<br>
stone stance may be enought to save us once if fd fails once....Many times i've had to stonestance, mend, and still barely get fd off. Repop time on FD is 8 seconds, if i remember coreectly, stonestance lasts 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
if fd failes twice were screwed either way<br>
<br>
if monks abliity to take damage is reduced, then 6 seconds of defens disc isnt enough, and you'll never see your pull.<br>
<br>
sk's fd can be interrupeted, but they can take a lot more hits than we can <p><br><br><center>
