People claim some arbitary system is working against them, the so-called &quot;disadvantaged&quot; and favoring the &quot;priveledged&quot;.  Social engineers in the last one hundred year have tried to devise ways to turn the hierarchy upside-down.  Communist certainly tried their best to do it... only to realize a new class of elite emerges to take its place.<br>

So guys just give it up!  There will ALWAYS be someone at the top of the pyramid, and that is NOT you, the type that won't put in the time or effort to achieve something.

<br>
I think a good example is mobs with good loot and several drops being spawned via quest similar to epic quests.<br>
<br>
I mean the relatively easy, story driven quest like Rogue and Shaman epics, as opposed to the ones that are, in and of themselves a series of ubermob farms like Warrior or Mage epics.<br>
<br>
Example, imagine doing the Ragebringer quest and instead of getting a ragebringer at the end, you got to spawn a mob like Zlandicar for your guild to kill.<br>
<br>
Then imagine taking this a step further and melding it with tiered quests like the colain ring war, only the end result not a ring for one person, but a mob several people will benefit from killing.<br>
<br>
Example, doing some quest until you could spawn Velkator, then continuing the quest to spawn Vindicator, then continuing the quest even further to spawn Tormax.  Killing each and getting loot for everyone along the way.<br>

<br>
Anything that has to be camped or triggerred, I agree that isn't going to solve the problem, unless a LOT of it is added, more than all the uber guilds on the server can camp with all their 55+ alts on their third accounts with better gear than the 60 main of a casual player.  I have seen people in even the sub uber guilds on my server camp Ragefire and the pained soul while raiding Yelinak or ToV at the same time . . . 1 person, doing all three things.<br>
<br>
Triggerred content is not the answer, unless:<br>
1) the reward isn't good enough to attract uber guilds.  However, they'll still go after it unless<br>
2) there's too much for the ubers to do.  TOO many uber mobs, TOO much triggerred content.  And that's a lot of content.<br>

If I put in more time than you ... why the heck should I care if you have less than me? If I put in 40-60 hours a week into this game and you put in 10 ... why the heck should we have the same opportunities? If you only work 20 hours a week and I work 40 should you have access to the same cashflow and the same priveleges at the office? If I put in my overtime and bust my ass why shouldn't I become an executive while you're doomed to never rise above your current station?<br>
<br>
Everything in our lives points to one thing ... the more you put in, the more you sacrifice, the more you get out of your choice. For casual gamers they, at this point in their lives, have priorities that involve family and work. For students, who's responsibilites are low, and single people with jobs... why shouldn't they get more out of this game than the casual gamer? You've got the family by choice, one presumes, so why should that translate into gaming companies tailoring their games to make sure you don't EVER have less than anyone else?<br>

Problem is that it drags GM's away from already busy schedules to repop zones for people. It also increases the flow of items into the game. Give it 10 guilds on a server that can take down NTOV, given the time ... that means during your &quot;once a month&quot; period you have over triple the items flowing into the game than would normally go into the game ... 14 sets of vulak drops, for instance, instead of the 4 sets that would normally drop. Not exactly a good thing as far as mudflation is concerned to triple the number of drops on a permanent basis even if it is going to different guilds. Multiply that across ALL zones in the game and you have a MASSIVE flood of items into the game that would decimate the economies of the servers as poorly off as they are already. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm>[60 Grandmaster] Brother Fdor [Keepers of the Faith] - Prexus</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upacalsidhe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pacal Sidhe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 10:11:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22089.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suggestions</span><hr size=1> The seriousness with which some people take this game is rather amusing.

<br>
1-50 dungeons are practically EMPTY all the time on my server. I have found that I have more fun, risk and adrenaline rush doing a low level dungeon with 5-6 other crawlers as I do raiding. On prexus I found the following dungeons practically EMPTY when I started playing EQ again:<br>
<br>
Runnyeye<br>
SolA<br>
Unrest<br>
Nurga<br>
Droga<br>
Kaesora<br>
Dalnir<br>
Upper Guk<br>
Cazic Thule<br>
City of Mist<br>
Najena<br>
Warrens<br>
Befallen<br>
<br>
That is a heck of a lot of content and is a blast with single group. Personally, I think as EQ has aged the sweet spot for gameplay has become 25-45, not the vaunted &quot;high end game&quot;.  <p>Portico - 42nd Monk<BR>

The pool has gotten larger, but so has the aging player base too.  I suspect VI recognizes this issue and will be adding more higher level content to the game (for example, the revamp of Nurga).<br>
<br>
I, personally, was surprised (and dissapointed) at the amount of low to mid level content included in SoL.  Again, I think VI recognizes the error of thier ways and will strive to include more things for the higher level player base to do. <p>Galendril Silverdawn<BR>

<br>
Don't lump all casual players in with wanting it 'easy' - that just is not true. People like me just want mobs to kill on our own timetable. The example of the triggered mob I brought up - Trak - is a good one. The quest to trigger him is not easy and his loot table is much dimished - the window for a guild to have the power to kill him and yet still have his loot be worth it is pretty small but it does exist. This is a very good compromise.<br>
<br>
The two things I ask for really don't make it any easier in a fighting/strategic/tactical sense - they just make it so the casual gamer does not have to compete directly against ubers who will be WAY more uber even if what I suggest were to happen.<br>
<br>
1. Rotate patch schedule. I really can't see any good argument against this. Ubers will still be there when the servers come up every single time but now casual players from different timezones can also have this advantage once in a while. <br>
<br>
2. A few more trak-like triggered spawns. An appropriate level of difficulty and loot (the value of which shifts over time). <br>
<br>
Nothing revolutionary about either of those concepts. They just add a little bit of content for the casual player while not sacrificing the &quot;uberness&quot; of the uber. I agree with you in that I do not understand or have compassion for the casual player that feels like they are entitled to the same stuff as the full timers. That would just be lame.<br>

<br>
Yes, it does. Every high end encounter takes hours and hours. What do casual gamers expect or want? High end encounters with great loot that can be done in an hour or two at most?<br>
<br>
Casual gamers have said often that they can do everything the ubers can do ... they just need more time. Well, I've lost track of how often VP is ignored on my server and yet no casual guilds bother. Probably because they can do other things and get exp or loot. They'd have to spend their first 3-4 trips into Veeshan's Peak dying, a LOT, in order to learn how things work. The very same thing all the uberguilds did back in the day and with a lot less gear than the current crop of players would have.<br>
<br>
As I said before, though ... its not that the casual guilds want the same chances, its that they want the same chances AND they want those chances to be killable by them in an hour or two, tops. VP would take time, and lots of effort, to learn and so they never touch it. The dragons drop all sorts of nice loot but the casual guilds ignore it because it involves precious time that they'd rather spend getting exp than losing it by dying repeatedly.<br>
<br>

<br>
Currently the patch schedule is designed to inconvenience the least number of people's playing time. If they rotated their patch schedule then you, personally, may find yourself TOTALLY unable to log on some nights because they're patching from 4PM to 12PM on your time zone. Rotating patches wouldn't just mean it suits you, or even the casual gamers. Then again, the uberguilds don't just live in one timezone so how is this going to benefit casual guilds? Its not. Uberguilds have more flexible schedules so who's to say this is going to do anything for casual guilds?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2. A few more trak-like triggered spawns. An appropriate level of difficulty and loot (the value of which shifts over time).</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Problem is that triggered spawns, unless the trigger takes a long time to do, massively increases the loot flow into the game. ROF, for instance, is triggered but its one of very few. Imagine having 5-10 of those in the game? The mudflation would fly through the roof as uberguilds then have their entire week doing triggered spawns and the casual guilds start getting gear at a rate MUCH higher than they were previously. Not a good thing for the game overall. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm>[60 Grandmaster] Brother Fdor [Keepers of the Faith] - Prexus</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=22089.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=22089.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22089.topic&index=125><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=22089.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=22089.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22089.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22089.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
