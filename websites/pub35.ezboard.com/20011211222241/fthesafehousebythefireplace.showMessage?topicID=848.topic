<br>
<br>
The Halfling was eating his bread and cheese rather quickly, his eyes looking to the sides of him, nervously. The bartender, Crow, was polishing his wood counter, talking to a bardmaid about the local guards. An Erudite was talking to a Half Elf maiden, his voice too low to be identified. A man walked in, cloaked in scarlet. A large sword was strapped to his side. He sat down at a lone table off in the corner. The barmaid walked up to the man to ask if he wanted the daily special but he just asked to be left alone. The man took out a silver puch and emptied its contents. The whole tavern seemed to be watching him. A few coins fell out and clinked onto the wooden surface of the table. 'Mighty fine prize ye got there, friend. With those coins, you might be able to sleep under a good roof tonight with a good supper in yer belly.' Crow eyed the coins very carefully, intrigued by them, for he had never seen such designs. The man fingered around in the pouch and pulled out a peice of paper. He did not open it but continued to stare at it for a bit. The Erudite walked up to the cloaked man and sat down next to him. 'Hail, my name is Udare, Enchanter from the great land of Odus. Can I buy you a drink?' The man said nothing, still looking at the paper. 'Are you ok, friend?' The man took his gaze off the papers, looked at the Erudite, and smiled. He placed the paper in the Erudites hand. 'Now you shall see the true might of Bertoxxolous!' The cloaked man then screamed, grabbed his heart, and dropped to the ground. The Erudite opened the paper and he was taken aback at what he read. 'TO THE CITIZENS OF NORRATH, AT DAWN, HELL SHALL BE UNLEASHED ON THOSE WHO ARE HOLY AND TRUE!! MANY WILL PERISH IN THE NAME OF BERTOXXOLOUS!!'<br>
The Erudite dropped the piece of paper and ran out of the bar, heading to the Temple of Life...<br>
<br>
5:48, Freeport...<br>
<br>
*A man appears from no-where, in the tunnel that leads to Northen Ro. He tells of Bertoxxolous' coming and how those who believe in the dark @#%$ should join the fight against good. The believers of the Holy Gods quickly dispense of the man, but are afraid of what might happen if the man was true in his tellings...*<br>
<br>
'If Bertoxxolous is coming, we need to stand together and fight him. He is one and we are many! He shall fall to the forces of good!' Derkis looked at the many people before him. 'I shall not die before I know that Bertoxxolous does not destroy another land!' All of a sudden, the ground shakes lightly. The group looks around to see what caused the rumble. The sky begins to darken and turn red, the air begins to reak of rottening flesh, and many men and women are running around, trying to find a safe hiding place. 'Here he comes!' 'Save yourselves!' 'Prepare for battle!' Many of them scream. A dark shadow is seen in the sky, it begins to descend. After a few minutes, the beast lands and starts rampaging towards the tunnel. A few groups of guards try to stop the beast but are quickly and brutally killed. Many are killed before the beast gets to the tunnel. 'I am Bertoxxolous' inhuman form. My Children! Come join my side!' A few Necromancers, Warriors, and Shadowknights walk over to the beast. 'Good, let the fight begin!!!' The beasts attacks an Elf standing in the middle of the group. It takes its tucks and launches the poor elf in the air. The elf soars into the heavens and is soon out of sight. A shaman tries to disease the beast, but it bounces of the beast and kills the shaman. A Warrior of Bertoxxolous brandishes his swords, turns to the beast, and impales it. The Beast looks down at the warrior, roars, and falls down, smashing the warrior in hope of killing him. Blood begins to cover the soft ground and stains everything red. The warrior, almost dead, looks up at his friend and says,' I told you I wouldn't let Bertoxxolous destroy this land...' Saying that, Derkis's eyes rolled back into his head and fell into a peaceful eternal slumber.<br>
