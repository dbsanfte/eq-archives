Each server has different designations for these rooms and my references will be based on the Emarr server where I play.  Visit <a Target="_new" href="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQ Atlas</a> for maps.<br><br>Sol B can be broken down into 6 sections:<br><br>Kobolds (left and right from Lavastorm zone) - Pool Room, Window, KPC (King, Priest, Champion), Noble/entrance<br>Sonic Bats - B1 (room with 1-2 bats that can only be taunted down), B2 (room to the right of B1), B3 (room to the left of B1), B4 (area beyond B3, between SS/LDC & Sol A zone)<br>Lava Beetles - Death Beetle (room between B2 & B3 -- leads to Efreeti/Imps), B4 (area beyond B3, between SS/LDC and Sol A zone)<br>Imp Protectors/Lava Guardians - commonly referred to as Efreeti/Imps (accessed through Death Beetle room)<br>Fire Giants - FG (Tranix, Rokyl, Skarlon, etc) (access through SS room)<br>Lava Duct Crawlers - B3, B4, SS (Stone Spider), LDC (area beyond B3 & B4, provides access to FG)<br><br>What can you solo and when?<br><br>Each monk will find his soloing ability different based on his gear and experience.  Those with a fungi tunic will find soloing a LOT easier than those without, but we can compensate by having a partner.  I have found that a druid partner is the most logical choice as you can evac to LS in case of trouble while deep (imps/FGs).  As for other gear, I do not make recommendations on specific gear; just followed the old rule of the more AC/HP the better.  Weapons are the same basic idea and I did most of my soloing using a Stave of Shielding (primary) and Knuckle-Duster (secondary) until level 57 (shed the KD at that point).  Presently using a Wu Stick (primary) and either fist/Sos (secondary) -- I do not have the epic.  The monk epic will improve your damage output and decrease your downtime.<br><br>Kobolds <br><br>General: Mixture of light blue/green 50-52.  At 53, they are nearly all fully green<br>Solusek: Mixture of blue/light blue 50-52.  Some still light blue till 57.<br>Named: King, Priest, Champion - Blue at 57 (last time I looked).<br><br>Personal Notes: <br><br>Not really a viable camp for soloing or grouping past 52, unless working on alternate advancement.  Items that drop in KPC/Noble are decent, but do not carry much value overall.  I have not done much killing here with my monk, but have spent time here with a druid (52) and warrior (45-48).  Fantastic xp for the warrior, decent for the druid.<br><br>Sonic Bats <br><br>Fantastic source of xp from 50-55.  B2 is the best area solo as you have 8 bats plus 2 possible wanderers (one is a PH for the infamous Guano Harvestor*).  In addition, B2 has the added advantage of quick access to the Death Beetle room with 4 lava beetles (one is the PH for the DB).  As you get higher (54+), you will also find B4 a great source of XP.  You can do this area before 54, but due to people training Sol A and the occasional pop of the Noxious Spider (vicious, hits hard and can drop a Golden Chitin Bracer -- RARE), this spot can be a bit more volatile.  I usually recommend partnering here, at least until you reach 55/56, but even at that you can still partner and pull from the LDC area.  It should be noted that B1 and B4 are not typically camped these days and are pulled by B2 or B4 depending on the strength of the person or group in those camps.   <br><br>Personal Notes:<br><br>I have spent a lot of time with bats.  I spent levels 53-55 in B2/B4 (B4 required a healer).  56+ I have almost exclusively pulled to B4 from SS/LDC (and the bats and beetles in the way of course).  Great xp for me (now 59) and for my druid (52 and working on 5th AA).  As a casual player, it is hard to find good players to get decent xp for 2-3 every few nights, B4 is a great spot.<br><br>Lava Duct Crawlers<br><br>Great xp, even at 59.  Probably should not attempt taking them on until 54/55 unless you have a healer or 1-2 partners with you.  LDCs cast Boil Blood which is approximately an 800 point DoT.  Pack regen can wipe the DoT (you must have pack regen prior to getting the dot and is erased when the spell is cast again).  LDCs are blue until 58, and are a decent mix of blue/light blue at 59.  The Stone Spider is a real chore to kill and requires a healer.  I still need a healer at 59 (but if I had a fungi and/or epic, I might not).  <br><br>Personal Notes:<br><br>LDCs are great xp and can cause lots of havoc.  They have a large agro radius and are very friendly...they will stop and help any of their friends in Sol B.  LDCs are a great source of spider silks and cash.  SS doesn't drop much of value (orb that casts Eye of Zomm and Brown Chitin Protector -- druid only with decent stats, but no WIS (no druid should want this and sells to vendors for 25+ plat).<br><br>Imps/Efreeti<br><br>Good xp, but this section really isn't for the under-equipped and/or pre-55 monk (not saying there aren't exceptions, but even at higher levels a decent healer is a must).  All the imps and guardians seem to still be blue at 59.  <br><br>Personal Notes: <br><br>I still have to do the occasional sneak pull to get singles.  This section is a lot of fun, but requires attention to pathing and agro.  I personally will not partner with any healer under 55 in this area, unless I am guiding a group into the Efreeti.<br><br>Fire Giants<br><br>Good xp, but not enough giants, items, etc to make it really worthwhile for the amount of effort to put into this area.<br><br>Personal Notes:<br><br>I do think that killing the FGs can be a great way to hone or improve your pulling skills or to help you train another monk how to be main puller as opposed to just chaining.  The only item worthwhile to a monk here is the Tranix Crown (great stepping stone to better pieces).  If you have a cleric seeking Ragefire in this area, there is no longer a need to kill FGs to get to him.  Have your cleric get a levitate/DMF/etc and walk over the lava in the LDC area to Ragefire's location right below the ante-chamber to Tranix.  No agro, a quick turn-in and its good.    <br><br>*Guano Harvestor<br><br>This guy is out of place here (he is a goblin) and his spawn and path is often a point of hot debate.  What is so important about this guy you ask?  He drops 2 items that are extremely valuable for a monk -- Large Soiled Bag (100% weight reduction, small items, 1.0 weight) and Cloak of Shadows (+12ac +13dex 0 weight).  First, where does he pop?  A highly debated question but from my personal experience (i.e. I saw him pop) he spawns in B4.  There have been some discussions about him spawning in B2, SS, or wherever...in 36 kills (I like to log) I have yet to see him spawn anywhere but B4 (actually watched him pop 14 times).  Strangely enough, I have actually watched him pop invised (I never thought I'd see that, but it explains why I never saw him a couple years ago) and he makes a run for B3 (his path is actually B4 -> B3 -> DB -> B2 -> B1 -> B3 -> DB -> so on until he is killed).  He is non-agro and I followed him one night before killing him (I like nights being the only person in zone).  The reason that a lot of folks assume he pops at different spots is because his invis wears off and he recasts.  I have seen him do this at DB and just outside of B2.  In fact on my first few kills (all netted the bag), I would see his spell effects when he was casting invis and stop killing the bats and hit him hard.  He likes to run so be prepared for a hairy encounter at times.<br><br>Summary<br><br>This may not be the most comprehensive guide and I hope that others will add to it.  I did not track how many blues per hour or how many mobs per blue.  I just go, try to have a little fun and grind out some xp from time to time.  I can say that it is hard to beat Sol B from 50-60 (can be done of course), but it’s a great fall-back location.<br><br>PS: If more detail is requested, I can certainly pump this up some.  I tried to summarize as best I could, but more detail can be added.  I just didn't want to reinvent the wheel as many guides have been written about Sol B.  Jekhar's guides used to be the standard once upon a time.  If needed, I can write up some detailed instructions for pulling FGs or getting to the Efreeti, but for the most part, once you do it once...you should get it down.  :) <p><br><br><CENTER><a href="mailto:syke@nwassociates.com"><img border="0" src="http://www.nwassociates.com/misc/everquest/SYKEBANNER.jpg" alt="Syke Auttic, Master of Erollisi Marr" width="500" height="100"></a><p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2" color="#990000" style="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif">Proud Member of:</font><font size="2" color="#800000" style="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif"><a style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; color: #FFFFFF" target="_blank" href="http://www.phoenixcrusaders.com">Phoenix Crusaders</a></font></b></font></p><p><b><font size="2" color="#990000" style="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif">Magelo:</font><font size="2" color="#800000" style="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif"> <a Target="_new" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; color: #FFFFFF" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36160">Syke Auttic</a></font> <font size="2" color="#990000" style="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif"> | </font><font size="2" color="#800000" style="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif"> <a Target="_new" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=82168">Sssyke Auttic</a></font></b></font><br></p></CENTER></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 5/21/02 7:27:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/userackdoushi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Serack Doushi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 603<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/19/02 3:30:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=953.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Antonica Damage tables</span><hr size=1> I have found that most mobs that I solo follow one of 2 damage tables to determine how hard they hit. Usualy you can tell exactly what level a mob is by this.<br><br>The first damage table which is more common for lower levels and some higher level mobs with certain &quot;procs.&quot; For this damage table take the level of the mob times 2 plus 2. This applies to Bloodgills in LoIO where the highest goblins hit for 78 and are level 38 (78-2=76. 76/2=38 ). It also applies to kobolds, bats, LDC's and almost anything below level 40 in Antonica. <br><br>The second common damage table is more common for mob's that are level 40 to 47 and typicaly don't have a proc or in sol b they are the rare spawns. For these mob's you take the level times 2 plus 27. The shady swashbuckler follows this. He is always 45 and always hits for 117. Other mob's that follow this damage table are any of the giant spiders/wolves/bears in permafrost who are as high as level 47 and hit for as much as 121 (121-27=94, 94/2=47) Also the Stone spider and Nox follow this damage table.<br><br>Not everything follows these 2 damage tables but generaly if it is in antonica and it is a pure melee it will. Examples of mob's that don't are Lava beetles (same level as bats in my experience just hit harder(101 max) and have dd proc), the kobold king hits for 101 every time and is light blue, Icy terrors are as high as level 49 yet only hit for as hard as 101 (they also have a lower attack rating for some reason so I consider them very good exp but they are guarded by the stuff that hits for 121 and is only 47)<br><br>I am gona post some tips for soloing in sol b and perma in my next post.

Mino's (good ol raster) usualy arn't above level 36 or so if my memory serves me correctly. Also on the live side all those shaman's reak havoc on the monk soloer. They haste everything and worse they have that rare and elusive indoor sow spell that they cast on everything. <br><br>I can't help you with the haste except to advise trying to disarm the mobs since I think that weapon speeds below 30 do effect a mob's delay and that will help some... As for the Sow here is what you can do about that. Guk mob's are comunal meaning that they will ask each other for help and are aware of when they are getting help. If you are fighting 2 mob's at once then neither will run untill the other is dead. A frogulk shaman will not run as long as it's pet is alive and helping it no mater how many PC's are ripping it appart. Also if the frog is close to another mob even if it can't see it it usualy won't run. So if there is another frog just around the corner even if it isn't assisting it gives the frog you are killing the sence of security it needs not to turn tail and run when it is low on health.<br><br>The king's guards are blue to light blue to me at 60 but almost everything else in the zone is green. I have soloed the king with one FD/bind wound at level 60 with non NToV gear but the spawn time is 30 minutes and at level 60 there are not enough mobs that give exp to make the camp viable compared to the 30 min spawn time.

That doesn't mean they are good exp though =P<br><br>I hate lava beetles cause they are about the same level as bats but hit harder and have a nearly unresistable DD proc that hits you even harder. Why do beetles when you can do bats? Unless you cant do bats of course =P<br><br>LDC's are tough cause they are higher level and they have that nasty dot added into the mix. Also it can be a little more difficult to controll the adds at times. I can't imagine doing LDC's without a fungi cause it helps a lot with the DoT. <br><br>As for tatics... First off let me explain how I have survived the Dot countless times when it should have killed me. I have nearly 600 hp in raw hp gear, and when you zone or /q camp the server basicaly takes off all your gear and puts it back on. If you zone with less hp than you have hp gear you go into the neg hp and basicaly die. Well they programed the game to not actualy have you die from this but part of the coding made it so that if this happens you lose all spell effects when the server brings you back to life after it puts your gear back on. This has it's pluses and it's negatives. On the plus side if you had a nasty dot like from a LDC it will be gone when you get through the zone/get back on the server and also you will get all the hp that your hp gear gives you. On the down side I have lost aegolism several times this way. So in a nutshell, if you have less hitpoints than you have hitpoint gear and have a dot on you and can't get a heal you can /q and if you don't die before the server boots you, you will come back on the server with no buffs/dot's and with the amount of hp you have in hp gear.<br><br>When I break LDC I usualy start in the hallway to the right before you have to go twards the sol a zone. I typicaly fight barely past the elbow turn because the nox/nox ph wanders within sight of the actual corner and WILL add if you are fighting in line of sight. Once you get there there is a wanderer that is spacific to that tunnel. If you don't see it wait for it. When it runs it may take you past another spider before you kill it. This spider is a stationary spawn so you can easily lose agro to it. Pull the second spider to the same spot you fought the first. <br><br>Next is the Stone Spider (SS) room. There are several wanderers that stay in/wander in and out of this room and the SS/PH is stationary in the corner. Pull them all to the same spot and kill them. If you are fighting the SS I suggest you have your disc/mend ready cause he hits much harder than the LDC's and if his stun proc lands on you just FD and wait for it to wear off cause it lasts for FOREVER. <br><br>Next there is a wanderer in the passage to the left from the SS room. It sometimes stops in the SS room so you may have already pulled it. Once it is dead slowly go down the passage and strafe along the corner till you can see one of 2 stationary spiders in the next room. By the level you should be pulling these guys you should be able to agro pull him single. Don't fight him in the hall though because he will be close enough to his buddy in the room he came from that he will not run when he gets low. Unless of course you are afraid of backspawns. Next I fight his buddy in the room he came from but not in a place where there is direct line of sight through the back door which leads to the sol a zone/nox wanderer area. Once he is dead I either start back on the first guy or kill nox/ph. Go back the way you came or you will probably agro a wanderer lava beetle.<br><br>Lava guardians/Imp protectors. I generaly don't mess with these guys cause they hit harder than LDC's and the LG's have a 25 hp damage shield. I remember over a year ago seeing Metopious solo these guys but I think he was pulling with a Nerf bat (pillage enchantment clicky)<br> <p>Serack Doushi<BR>Son of Usagi Doushi the rabbit monk<BR>Husband of Jemaia Doushi my Darlin Princess Monk<BR>Human Grandmaster of the Celestial fists<BR><BR>Mehitts Demhard<BR>Lebel 51 Kraknek Champ<BR><BR>The First Seal, Nameless Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/userackdoushi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Serack Doushi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 606<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/19/02 3:34:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=953.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Permafrost</span><hr size=1> PERMAFROST:<br><br>The main dissadvantage of Permafrost is that the mobs hit HARD. Generaly from 111 to 121. Also if you die you will have more trouble getting a rez =P. The advantages is that there is a very huge zone experience modifier in this zone (I get about as much exp from 5 kills here as I get from about 8 LDC) and it is much less likely to be camped Also where I could solo LDC at 56 I could just barely solo perma at 58.<br><br>I don't bother with the giants here cause some are clerics that CH and that is a pain when the mob has several K hp. I generaly drop down twards the bear pits but there are a few drops you can go down and the one I use has one wanderer that goes by like once every 10 minutes. If you drop down the wrong one you will see nearly a dozen huge white bears around you. If you drop down the right one you will see 2 critters that are usualy off in the distance. Both are wanderers but only one will come anywhere near where you drop down. The one that is not on the big slanting ice block that has a ladder on it. <br><br>The spawn time on these is about 25 or 30 minutes and at 58 I would only solo about 5 of them so generaly I used my mend for nearly every kill. I needed my mend for nearly kill cause these guys are tough! Also since they are wanderers it is tough to lose agro if you need to FD/bind but with fungi I regened my life bar faster than they did (they have much more hp though so as far as hp they were regening faster).<br><br>Pull the wanderer that is not on the sloping glacer and do your best to kill him. Then pull the one on the one on the glacier. Next go up the 2 ladders. From the platform at the second ladder there is a wanderer that goes from that spot up to a room with 2 Icy terrors (they look like icicle tentical terrors) Fight this wanderer at the platform above the last ladder. When it runs it will run twards the ladder but won't be able to go down it. Instill doubt works very well here. Once you kill the 3rd and last wanderer you will have to FD pull the icy terrors. These guys are MUCH easier than the other mob's down here and yet they are higher level(up to 49 where the others are up to 47). Be sure to have your back to a wall because of their knockback and take care that the fast casting of the knockback and 11 hp life tap doesn't interupt your FD's. I consider these 2 guys to be the icing on the cake cause they are so high level and yet so much easier and they are probably why the exp is worth the hastle of killing such tough mob's. <br><br>Oh and because these mob's hit so hard, I genearly play it safe and FD as soon as my HP drops below 400. If you are fighting on the platform just above the ladders there is a hole in one wall where if things get particularly hairy you can jump out the hole and the mob has to path all the way around which will give you the time you need to FD after a failed FD. Take care that an icy terror doesn't knock you through the hole though =P<br><br>Also the way out of the bear pits is to go up past the Icy terror room and drop down the hole in the back.

It just doesn't occur to most people to hunt guards, especially in evil cities.  Neriak guards are excellent XP mobs up to level 54; I recommend you try them out if your usual hunting spot is over-camped.<br><br>Neriak is easy to get into, especially for a monk. The front guards in Nektulos (the badass ones) can be snuck around. They are sufficiently far away from the tunnel to Neriak that you can get behind them by creeping your way up the hill slightly.<br><br>Once inside Neriak foreign quarter, you'll want to make your way to the next zone, Neriak Commons. (The guards in the foreign quarter are too low to bother with for xp) I recommend just running through the zone; the guards are too low to really hurt you. Don't tarry too long though; one of the static guards in the guardhouse is a shadowknight and will HT you if you agro him. The zone is essentially donut shaped, just run around it either clockwise or counter-clockwise till you hit the Neriak Commons zone.<br><br>Once you zone into Neriak Commons, you're ready to go. The area from the foreign quarter zone to the PoD (around the waterfall) is entirely free of guards, which makes it a perfect place to pull to and bind wounds/rest up. ALL of the guards in the commons area are level 40, which means they are still dark blue up to lvl 54. There are a total of ten guards that you can easily pull to the foreign quarter zone, with some simple splitting required at the beginning of the hunt. <br><br>With Fungi/IFS/SCHW I was able to solo single guards without having to use mend. You will not be able to kill all ten guards before they begin to respawn, however. Personally, I brought a partner for a few of my hunting sessions, and it worked out quite well. A 52 pally and I (54 monk) were just able to kill all the guards before they began to respawn.<br><br>I didn't keep track of the XP/hour; it was less than solb bats, but not by much. This camp is perfect if solb is over-camped; you can just make the short jog to Neriak and begin hunting right away.<br><br>And as for the loot, it was crazy. The guards drop about 5pp, a FS weapon, a &quot;long sword&quot;, and often wooden shields/words. The &quot;long swords&quot; sell for about 10pp to the vendors, which is fantastic. I'd say each guard drops about 20pp in total cash and cash loot, although I generally didn't bother looting the shields, as they only sold for around 2pp. I leave those for the noobs/beggars, who are more than happy to scoop them up. Tink bags or a partner to carry the loot are a must; there will be tons of it.<br><br>This hunting spot will trash your faction with various Neriak groups, and raise it with the wierd new factioned NPCs in Nektulos. If this is a problem for you (I can't imagine it is) then just do the red wine quest in Neriak 3rd gate to get yourself non-kos to the merchants/guards again. Easy as pie.<br><br>everquest.allakhazam.com/...?quest=159<br><br>Good luck, and happy hunting!<br><br>Zolmunk  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uchungkuosifu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chungkuo sifu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/20/02 5:41:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=953.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> breaking &quot;lower bats&quot; in sol B</span><hr size=1> enter main bat room (with window dressing bat up high).<br><br>FD in the room, do a camp check, and wait for any roamers (possible nox PH, LDC, roaming bat, guano harvester).<br><br>kill the roamer solo in that main bat room (bat 1).<br><br>turn right and slowly walk down the hallway until you can just barely see the first bat (on your left), the second bat is closer to you, but out of visual to your left.<br><br>target that far bat and /con pull him to your hallway.  kill him in the hall.  if you killed the roamer first, you should get no adds.  if you did not, you may get an add as the bat flees down the left hall.<br><br>now, you just killed a roamer, a bat in the first room to the right (bat 2), and probably another bat in the left hall as you got the add from the fleeing bats.<br><br>*note:  if 2 bats are on you, one will not flee.  the last one always runs, unless you push it into the appropriate corner in bat 2 (see below).<br><br>now, bind up to 70, hit mend, and now kill the second bat in bat 2.  grats on breaking bats.  the pops should be split by an interval of several minutes now.<br><br>the joy now is that you can fight in bat 2 and &quot;push&quot; the bat into the corner where it will not run.

Nothing like the bat flying off at sow speed and u finish it off at low health to get slapped with boiling blood or finishing off a dark blue bat when a wandering bat come by and you can;t seem to shake the aggro, get used to /quitting.<br>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ucedor222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cedor222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/25/02 12:23:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=953.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Level Guide: Antonica (Levels 40 - 60)</span><hr size=1> West Freeport guards (solo):<br><br>Did the below as an iksar with SCHW, SoS and fist, no epic, no fungi, no ID.<br><br>If you've chosen NFP over WFP guards for your faction, you can hunt the WFP guards near the NFP zonelines starting in your high 40s.<br><br>Guard Jendyl is posted near the eastmost non-sewer NFP zoneline.  Usually has a 1hs and shield, sometimes dual wields, when he's a lot tougher.  I recommend you do this with full health and mend up to start.  The guards drop a helm that you can turn into the pally guild for faction and 1, 2, or 4pp.  Also drop cash, a short sword for 1.5pp, kite shield 4pp, sometimes FS and spell research components. I've gotten up to 13pp from one kill, including the helm turn-in.<br><br>Wandering near Jendyl is a greenie, Ledshin, who also drops the helm, and Mizraen who is a carbon copy of Jendyl.<br><br>When you reach 51, or maybe earlier with better equipment, take the sewer exit near the pally guild and head to the potion merchant in WFP.  Be sure you're at full health with mend and stonestance up, because Guard Inofus may be waiting for you there.  If not, he'll show up eventually.  He always has a 1hs and no shield, does not dual wield, but sometimes drops an extra sword, go figure.  This guy is tough and hits for 96 max.  Was almost always doable by me, I only remember having to FD once.<br><br>Once he's down, head out of the potion building area, turn left and take out the green guard by the EFP zone.<br><br>If you turn right, you're near the monk guild, where you may be KoS.  There is also a lvl 30 and lower lvl rogue near there who are probably KoS as well.<br><br>Inofus has a clone near Jendyl's area named Kroon.  If you know where the cloth merchant Linadien sells, head south from that area and turn right (don't go too far left, or you'll hit the caster's guild).  You'll come to the east wall of the militia building where Kroon sometimes wanders to.<br><br>These guys all have a large agro range.  I usually just proximity agro and run to the NPF zone to fight.<br><br>The helms have gotten me to warmly with the NFP paladins, although I started getting the max faction message at amiable, can't figure that one out.<br><br>Only downside to these camps can be the long spawn time, 24 minutes, if you're able to kill quickly and with little health loss.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uverizar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Verizar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(6/4/02 8:55:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=953.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Level Guide: Antonica (Levels 40 - 60)</span><hr size=1> Very suprised this wasn't in here.<br><br>Raster:<br>Once you hit level 44 theres no way I would go anywhere else. The way I see it, its something that has to be done, and is very long, so you may as well get the most experience benefit out of it you can. I went at the very start of level 44, and at the time had average gear (JM, KD, FBSS, average armor like drolvarg mantle, gatorscale legs, gem inalids.. u get the picture). It wasnt easy, but it was very doable if you read the guide, and it also helps to go when someone else is there to get a feel for the camp. 56 hours later I'm still camping raster but I'm level 47 halfway to 48 and still making about 2 yellows in a 5 or 6 hour session. If your worried about not being able to take Raster at 44, don't be, you will be making xp very fast and the chances that he will pop before you level have to be pretty damn low. I died once at 44 when the wanderer was a rare nasty wizard, but even if u die a couple of times, the experience is still very good. You will however need a LOT of bandages at 44 and 45. Everyone else that I see camping it seems to be around level 52 or so, as if they're catching up on their epic. At levels 44 and 45 the camp is a challenge, and at 46 and 47 your still making decent xp. I can only imagine how much more boring it must be for those who wait til 52 to do it.<br><br>Verizar<br>47th Human monk on Brell  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fonkymonky>FonkyMonky</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(6/25/02 1:15:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=953.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Level Guide: Antonica (Levels 40 - 60)</span><hr size=1> Can this be put in the guide section please?
