Cloak of Truth</span><hr size=1>  I played around with this quest last night; didn't get it finished, but got up to the wrappings bit. For you sticklers out there, here's an annotated log (edited a bit as I stumbled across keywords, or found items before I should have).<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:32:23 2001] You say, 'Hail, Miller'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:32:24 2001] Miller says 'Ho there. Whatcha want? Yer interruptin' Arboast's story- he was just in the middle of laying some truth on me.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:31:27 2001] You say, 'Hail, Arbogast'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:31:27 2001] Arbogast says 'Hello there weary adventurer, do you come seeking the truth?<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:31:33 2001] You say, 'I seek the truth'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:31:33 2001] Arbogast says 'The truth is a precarious thing, twisted and torn by those that would deceive for their own nefarious purposes. That is why there are people like me to guide the ignorant masses that know no better than to believe that which they are told.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:31:33 2001] Miller says 'Yeah, you tell em Arbogast! I bet this one doesn't even know what's going on right under his nose in this here city. Like for example, you probably don't even know the truth about about his importantness Phenic Dionicas do you?<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:31:52 2001] You say, 'who is phenic dionicas?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:31:52 2001] Arbogast says 'He that battles what he truly is only truly battles himself. Phenic Dionicas for years has made quite a show of his war on the Vampyres of Tenebrous. This misdirection of truth serves only to keep people from discovering that he himself is a foul demon of the night. Miller and I, for our singular vision of that which is true, are not well liked in this city and so cannot obtain proof for your disbelieving eyes.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:32:08 2001] You say, 'what proof?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:32:08 2001] Arbogast says 'You wish to see the truth for yourself? That is good, you will be taking your first step down a winding road to the only fulfillment this existence has to offer: enlightenment. Take this flask of water, I have blessed it such that it will singe the skin of the unholy. Go to Phenic Dionicas and give it to him, then you will see... you will see.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:32:08 2001] Miller says 'Yeah, splash it right in his unliving face!<br>
<br>
Give Arbogasts' holy water (sorry, didn't think to ID it) to Phenic.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:36:35 2001] Phenic Dionicas looks at you and smiles despite the fact that you have splashed water all over him- he does not appear to be burning at all. 'Oh, excuse me. You seem to have spilled your water, here have some of mine my friend. Good day to you, Shariin,' he says.<br>
<br>
He gives you a bottle of water back.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:37:25 2001] Item Lore: Just plain old water.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:39:00 2001] Arbogast says 'He simply gave this to you? Cunning indeed for him to cover his weakness so thoroughly- he must have powerful protective enchantments in place, no doubt put in place by his good friend and associate, Tsaph Katta!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:39:00 2001] Your faction standing with The Truth got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:39:00 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Arbogast gives you a 2-slot nodrop container called &quot;Silver wrappings&quot;.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:33:54 2001] You say, 'who is tsaph katta?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:33:54 2001] Arbogast says 'When you fake your death to discredit another you only discredit yourself when another sees your death was faked. Yes, you heard me correctly, Tsaph Katta lives on here in this city, can you guess who it is he pretends to be?<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:33:54 2001] Miller says 'Ooh! I know, I know! Nathyn Illuminious!!!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:33:54 2001] Arbogast says 'Yes, yes, I know you know... very good Miller<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:33:54 2001] Miller beams a smile your way.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:32:34 2001] You say, 'who is nathyn?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:32:35 2001] Arbogast says 'Yes, wealthy philanthropist Nathyn Illuminious is simply a guise for the infamous Tsaph Katta, hiding in plain sight. Few are aware of this truth my friend, but no doubt, were you to acquire and peruse ''Nathyn's'' personal memoirs, you would see him for what he truly is. If you can find it, bring it to me, but do not hand it to me in plain sight- we would be wise not to call attention to our business. Wrap it up in that silver wrapping paper, as though you are bringing me a gift... yes, a gift.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:33:17 2001] You say, 'who is nathyn?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:33:17 2001] Miller says 'Grrr that scoundrel, pretending to be someone he ain't! Why I oughtta?<br>
<br>
Go to Nathyn's place, pick the lock and step inside.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 18:54:25 2001] The study locks behind you... You get the feeling you<br>
are not alone.<br>
<br>
A Coterie Servant (well green to me) will spawn. Easy kill.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 18:55:34 2001] Your faction standing with Coterie of the Eternal Night<br>
got worse.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 18:55:34 2001] Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 18:55:34 2001] Your faction standing with Nathyn Illuminious got bette<br>
r.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 18:55:34 2001] Your faction standing with Valdanov Zevfeer got worse.<br>
<br>
Grab Nathyn's Memoirs (nodrop) off the bedside table.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:37:31 2001] Item Lore: Private.<br>
<br>
And combine the book in your silver wrappings.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:39:22 2001] You have fashioned the items together to create something new!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:39:29 2001] Arbogast says, 'Ahh, you have retrieved the memoirs, let me see.' Arbogast opens the book and starts flipping through pages, 'Yes here, you... no, wait it must be back... hrmmm, maybe he... but it must... Well, that was pretty clever of old Tsaph Katta, removing any record of who he truly is- probably did it to cover up the fact that Norrath does not really exist.'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:39:29 2001] Your faction standing with The Truth got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:39:29 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Arbogast gives you &quot;Gold wrappings&quot;.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:40:01 2001] You say, 'norrath does exist'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:40:01 2001] Arbogast says 'You are beginning to see the truest truths as the only true truths now, are you not? That large blue orb that hangs in the Luclin sky from time to time is nothing more than an overgrown comet. What appear to be land masses and other geological features are in actuality powerful illusions cast upon the comet by Tsaph Katta himself so that panic does not spread amongst the ignorant masses. I am not one to spread conjecture, but it is possible that Katta's astronomers have discovered that the comet is hurtling slowly toward Luclin and will destroy all life on the planet, so you can see why he would want to keep the truth about the [Exodus] from his journal.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:40:15 2001] You say, 'what exodus?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:40:15 2001] Arbogast says 'The Exodus is the single biggest lie propagated onto the people of Katta Castellum in the known history of the intelligent races. Hogwash I tell you.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:40:15 2001] Miller says 'A bloody, boldfaced lie!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 20:40:15 2001] Arbogast says 'A story told to children. Tsaph Katta wove together a tale of Seru trying to kill him on the fantasy world of ''Norrath'' and how the entire combine fled here to escape from him... a wheel of lies, do you see how they interconnect? Why, I'll bet that even in Shadowhaven, the very site of this alleged ''Exodus'' and home to one of the grandest libraries you will ever see, not a single shred of reliable evidence regarding such an event could be found. HA! You bring me a book on this ''Exodus'' and Miller here will eat his hat! Especially if the book is wrapped in that gold paper I gave you...<br>
<br>
Go to the Library in Shadowhaven.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:38:26 2001] You say, 'Hail, Rianna Birchard'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:38:27 2001] Rianna Birchard turns to you and smiles brightly, 'Hello, Shariin. Lots of work to be done- books to shelve, lessons to learn... I know it sounds a bit ridiculous, but I feel so at home here.'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:38:28 2001] Rianna Birchard looks your way apprehensively -- she appears to be quite formidable.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:38:33 2001] You say, 'what book of exodus'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:38:33 2001] Rianna Birchard says 'Wow, what an interesting subject- almost impossible to gather hard evidence on, even for me. It seems that everyone was so taken off guard by the sudden change of scenery that no one bothered to keep any written record of the time. First they had to figure out where they were and once they did there was so much disagreement as to what they should be doing- try to get home, stay where they were and settle in or put some distance between them and Seru should he and his people try to follow, which, of course they did. All this lead to the formations of three of the four major cities here on Luclin, all with... oh listen to me go on, sorry. We have only one book on the subject, but Peqi borrowed it just the other day.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:38:56 2001] You say, 'who is Peqi?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:38:56 2001] Rianna Birchard frowns a bit for the first time this conversation, 'Peqi... Let me tell you, I like just about everyone but if that little gnome never found his way back to this library I wouldn't be too disappointed.'<br>
<br>
Peqi can be found a short way down an alley near the bridge to the library. He's across the alley and down a door or two from Aliane.<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:56:19 2001] Peqi Biato begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:59:47 2001] Peqi Biato judges you amiably -- he appears to be quite formidable.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:59:49 2001] You say, 'Hail, Peqi Biato'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:59:49 2001] Peqi Biato says 'What are you doing in here? Get out, no one invited you here, leave me be! Come back again and I'll call the guards. Go!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:59:56 2001] You say, 'what book of exodus?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 21:59:56 2001] Peqi Biato says 'I have books, I have lots of books, books about the Exodus and all kinds of things but they're mine, you hear me? Mine! You'll get that book over my dead body, now get out! Out, I say!<br>
<br>
Significant time gap here as I go LD several times, try to recruit help, etc. I eventually give up, pop duelist and miss my backstab. /sigh He barely scratched me, though (lots of misses, couple of hits for 80ish). Gotta love casters...<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:11 2001] Peqi Biato says '''Over my dead body'' is just an expression, I didn't want to have to hurt you but you brought it on yourself.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:29 2001] Shariin ASSASSINATES their victim!!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:29 2001] You backstab Peqi Biato for 32000 points of damage.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:29 2001] You have slain Peqi Biato!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:29 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:29 2001] Peqi Biato's corpse dies as he lived, with a scowl on his tiny face.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:41 2001] You receive 5 platinum, 8 gold, 9 silver, 10 copper from the corpse.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:44:46 2001] --You have looted a The Exodus: A History.--<br>
<br>
Combine the book in the wrappings.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 22:45:05 2001] You have fashioned the items together to create something new!<br>
<br>
And hand your gold-wrapped book in.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 23:04:40 2001] Arbogast looks taken aback for a moment before collecting himself, 'Get your hat out of your mouth, Miller- this book is a fraud! It was clearly planted there by Tsaph Katta. Look at this, umm... handwriting! Yes, look at this handwriting. I have clearly underestimated his penchant for skullduggery.' Arbogast, completely sure of himself once again, leans in and speaks softly to you, 'Now that you have witnessed these clear, undeniable truths for yourself, how would you like to go on a bit of an expedition for us?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 23:04:40 2001] Your faction standing with The Truth got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 11 23:04:40 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Arbogast gives you black wrappings (again, 2 slot nodrop).<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 11 23:04:57 2001] You say, 'what expedition?'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 23:04:57 2001] Arbogast says 'Ahhh, excellent... I am glad to see your interest piqued. It is the truth that will liberate the masses when the masses fail to liberate the truth. To continue to divine and demystify the truth from the mistruth, I employ a powerful component known to the Akheva as 'Akuel xi ans Vius' which translated means 'Thing that tells Truth'<br>
[Tue Dec 11 23:04:57 2001] Yavik Teralin says 'It translates to 'Gift of the Dark' you fool!<br>
[Tue Dec 11 23:04:57 2001] Arbogast says 'Oh, the foolish and naive, they are the salt of the land... anyhow, bring me two of these wrapped in the black paper you have and I shall reward you, my new ally of truth, with a cherished robe that was given us by Seru himself. Isn't that right Miller? Miller...<br>
<br>
At this point, I ran off to ME and went to bed. =) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushariin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shariin</A> at: 12/12/01 12:29:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujaedengrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeden Grae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/12/01 11:50:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3484.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok, Ok...
