When I started to play since my buddys brother had quit(cancling billing and every thing) and I did not feel like buying the CD's (allthough I did end up buying the trilogy and expantions later on), my buddy just re-accativated his brothers old account. and low and behold his old charaters where still there.<br>
<br>
If I rember correctly VI removes all inactive chars/accounts after only a few months. and nothing had happend on this account for nearly 2 years.<br>

<br>
1.) Keep your CD with the account key.  Even if someone changes the password/account name on you, there's a good chance you'll get your account returned to you upon proof that you have ownership of the software.  Just hope that you regain possession before the bandit has done any damage to your characters or stripped all your gear.<br>
<br>
2.) If you are somebody that has bought &quot;the time a person has taken to level a character&quot; from ebay, don't presume that the original owner might not want to come back some day.  Upon purchase of the &quot;time,&quot; make sure you also obtain possession of the cd's.  That clears two matters up:  It ensures that you're not purchasing something that's stolen from another person, and it gives you the security of knowing that the seller has no recourse if they change their mind later.<br>
<br>
3.) If a friend lets you assume their account, whether it's a RL friend or an in-game one, ALWAYS make sure these things are discussed beforehand.  Many people quit and come back, so ask each other questions, and be HONEST about what you want.  Remember, the person with the cd and the code has final say.  If you want the account for keeps, tell your friend that's what you want and get the cd's.  They'll either give them to you or not.  If you don't have the cd's, then think of the account as a loan and nothing more, because they can come back and regain possession with or without your say.  The thought of leveling and gearing up a character only to lose it...well that stinks, but if you don't have the cd and key that's a chance you're taking, and you should be aware of it.  <br>
<br>
And for all those who think account theft can't happen to you because you're &quot;careful,&quot; well, you're sorely mistaken.  There are things you can do to make it more difficult, but nothing is impermeable anymore, not even your own identity.  That's the downside to the conveniences offered by our technological era.  There have been and always will be opportunists and vultures.  Their whole existence is dedicated to finding loopholes and weaknesses, then exploiting them, and they're good at it.  *shrug*  <br>
<br>
The best form of prevention is knowing what the consequences of our decisions are before we make them.  If that fails, then the best form of damage control is knowing you're not infallible and having the foresight to prepare for those off days.<br>
<br>
Just my two cp's worth.<br>
