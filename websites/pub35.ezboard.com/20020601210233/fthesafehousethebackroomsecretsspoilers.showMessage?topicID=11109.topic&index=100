<br>
Problems are:<br>
<br>
- There isn't 49 bosses in EQ to kill every week.<br>
- Most of these bosses do not require 3h of prep time. A Tormax raid is an hour job for an uberguild. A Creator raid is done in not much more. In practice, the Burrower Parasite represents probably the best raid setup there could be: You need at least 30mn/1h just to arrive to fight setup (depending on how many people you have to recover from the ravine), nearly an hour of fighting the waves, then the fight itself. And the lack of COTH to the fight zone means you need to include gathering time before heading out.<br>
<br>
The concepts announced for Planes of Power don't make me feel very optimistic about it either. You have a linear progression (yeah, 18 keys to get, I'm happy) but can immediately enter your target plane. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarduinbok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arduin BoK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 8:50:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11109.topic&index=101>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &gt;&lt;</span><hr size=1> Yes...thats why Lanys isnt that bad.

On Vallon, it could be pretty ugly when one team or another pushes ahead of any of the others and potentially keeps opposing teams from catching up. If the progression is totally linear, I can see this causing some problems for the weaker guilds/teams.<br>
<br>
On a different but related note, being on a red server, there seems to be less competition for end game mobs. That's probably due to the fact that the server evolution is considerably slower given the barriers of a PVP environment and a lower server population than most blue servers. That said, there's still quite a bit of conflict concerning certain mobs at certain points on the curve (NTOV, ST key mobs, etc.). While I'd expect the points of conflict to shift up the curve as the server continues to evolve and more guilds/alliances move into the ST/post-ST arenas, there does always seem to be a PVP resolution when it comes to these competitions. So in essence, the blue servers have conflicts at the AOW, Burrower, Tunare, Emporer levels, while red servers (well, ours anyway) tends to have more conflicts earlier on.<br>
<br>
As an FYI, 3 teamers (lights) Defiant and their &quot;Euro&quot;partner Ancient Orden are well ahead of pretty much every other guild or alliance on the server. They are the only guilds really into the post-ST area. Trailing them by a few months are Iron Tower (3 team light), the HECK alliance (3 team light comprised of 3 guilds) and X'anit Kven (dark). Ebon Dawn (dark) and Wrath and Vengeance (4 team) spun out of the other major dark guild on the server, the primarily Euro-timed Draconic Tribe. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usvenuce.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Svenuce</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://svenuce.homestead.com/files/blinky.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/30/02 9:15:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uabatoirredux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AbatoirRedux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 9:19:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11109.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &gt;&lt;</span><hr size=1> ok, so now that we've established that some servers have VASTLY different levels of demand for high level content, what are the odds of getting some kind of dynamicly set spawn times based on subscribed accounts?  average loged in accounts?  Average level of characters?  Played time? Average life span of the mob?  Level of the mob? <br>
<br>
I dunno, just throwing out potential variables to base a spawn time continuoum on.  Point is there should be some way to guage the server demand for content and compensate for it.<br>
<br>
Failing that there are a few servers that just cry out for a split.  While I've always personaly been dubious how effective those are, the fact remains that Tunare is at or near the top of the population list night after night in spite of the split with Drinal 18 months ago.  (Can you imagine what it would be like if all those people had stayed!!!, Ironic that many didnt go because they heard Cats n Hats was going and going to &quot;be like Afterlife&quot; and now there are at least 5 guilds on Tunare of Cats+ level)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll hush but I do hope Verant can come up with some way to dilute these populations other than simply rolling out eq2 and Star Wars and saying &quot;go play that instead&quot;<br>

No way would a established guild volunteer to leave a server that they hold such an advantage over.  <br>
Personally, I think they should.  The only reason that Euro/Asian people would want to stay is because of friends (most of whom would be in the guild already) and because they like the significant timezone advantage they have.   Too bad, so sad I say.  <br>
Hell, they'd even be able to race for mobs when they logged on, instead of them being dead already.   What would they have to bitch about?  That they now have to play on even footing with other guilds on a server instead of having a mob buffet set up for when they log in?   I'd really try to be sympathetic, but I don't think I'd do a good job.<br>
