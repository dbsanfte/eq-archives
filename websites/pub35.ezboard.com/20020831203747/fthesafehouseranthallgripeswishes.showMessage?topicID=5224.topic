I'm actually looking forward to that.<br><br>Actually Rant:  Okay, the point of a school is to educate youth to prepare them for jobs and life correct?  Then why do some schools feel it needed to not offer some classes?  I mean, how and we learn if classes aren't available to us?<br><br>Okay, now to explain.  Each highschool has it's own required cources to graduate.  My school requires the usual 4 english/science/history, but it also requires 3 credits of a foreign  language.  That's perfectly fine, i'm all for learning other languages that might be needed later on in life.<br><br>The problem comes up here.  Currently the only languages taught are Spanish, French, and German.  Only two of those languages actually have a 3rd year class.  Spanish and French are the only classes that allow you to get your 3 language credits.  This causes all students who decide to take German to also take another language for a year just to graduate.<br><br>That is just stupid, I signed up for German-1 thinking I would be able to learn enough German to carry out semi-complex conversations by the end of highschool, but with my current German education I can only carry out the most basic conversations.  <br><br><br>   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugyorg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gyorg</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/02 2:23:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5224.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate you school</span><hr size=1> Find a ju-co/community college/other HS that offers it that you can take it from.  Work it out to get credit at your HS for it.  If you want it that much thats what you'll need to do.  HS's just don't have the money to finance lots of years of lots of languages.  Also, it requires finding someone who knows enough of the language to teach the 3rd year. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulirintz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lirin TZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/02 3:20:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5224.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate you school</span><hr size=1> find a german radio station on the internet and start listening to that.  you should be able to pick it up pretty fast from there.<br><br>i know that dosnt help you withyour school, but if you really want to learn german its a good way. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10458 >Veteran Liringlas Lookinglass</a><br>Virtuoso<br>Fennin Ro</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulirintz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lirin TZ</A> at: 8/14/02 3:29:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usorador.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorador</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/02 3:43:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5224.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mediaservice.photoisland.com/auction/Feb/20022169082972078409247.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate you school</span><hr size=1> Woah dood, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  have</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have 3 credits of foreign language?  . . . . . that would so make it hard for me to graduate . . . in 9th grade I was going to try to take two years of foreign language and get them out of the way . . . man that flopped . . .
