Whos in bed with Microsoft?) <br><br>You know I don't really care about the money issue associated with EQ. I have always justified the money spent as being a healthy substitute to spending my nights in a bar to socialize at the cost of $5.00 a drink. <br><br>I enjoy EQ and the time shared playing EQ with my wife is fun and exciting. We both enjoy it very much. However, when I begin to look at EQ's official homepage lately I feel like I am surfing some 3rd rate cheap auction house for roleplaying game novelty items. <br><br>In addition, we now have a very &quot;special&quot; announcement from the EQ peeps who have brought us reason after reason to spend money. <br><br>We can now play EQ on an entirely different level. More exciting, more interactive, new items, endless surprises! <br><br>Thats right friends ALL this can be yours! But, nothing is free. Thats right for ONLY $40.00 per month, you too can take that next step in Everquest and sign up to get added (up to 8 characters) to this new and exciting server! <br><br>I gotta tell you guys, I think you suck. Verant has turned about to be nothing more than a bunch of money hungry loot whores! Leaving behind those who have gotten them where they are today. Sounds oddly enough like some guilds we are associated with in-game. <br><br>Gratz Verant, lead from the front and by example. Now, some may say &quot;Hey, don't knock them. They provided us with a good product&quot; <br>I say &quot;@#%$, we have bought and paid for everything we have ever received&quot;. <br><br>Do I sound bitter? Probably. I have a job, a family, a real-life and yet am very attracted to EQ and what it does for me. I love it. Yet, today I am disgusted to see these &quot;money&quot; improvements being made to EQ wallets when there are so many current and old issues that should be the priority of EQ developers. <br><br>In example, why at this stage of Everquest do we still have epic mobs which are a very rare spawn and can not be triggered. Why when you have achieved an appropriate level and skill to obtain an epic do you still have to compete with numerous guilds on a dragon like Severilous. A very long spawn that for someone who works a job has little to no chance to kill. <br><br>Yes, I am a 58 warrior who is a guild leader on Fennin Ro. Our guild is about 100 members strong (60 active) and our average level is 55. Now, Sev was due today on Friday and I had to work so I begged my guild to go camp Sev in an attempt to kill him before another guild came for him. Did it work, no. Another guild of equal numbers and slightly higher average level also came to await his spawn (As always) and we decided to go do a kill which required no competition. <br><br>My point to this whole thing is that there are some serious CUSTOMER SERVICE issues in present game on present servers that you should focus on Verant; rather than come up with new ways to fatten your wallets. It is so ghetto to just take all the time and money and effort many of us have put into EQ over the years for granted. <br><br>Christ, reward us for the money we have spent and make some of our high end game rewards more balanced. If a person and their guild is MORE than capable of obtaining an epic, don't make them also fight the rarity of a spawn especially when they also have to compete with a number of different guilds for that spawn. It's just not a proper reward for the work we have done. You want it be a challenge, fine. Don't make it unfair. Every epic mob should be able to be triggered. Then, if your guild can't accomplish it, it's their fault and they still need to work. As it stands right now we can do everything right and still get shafted because of your ridiculous ideas concerning how we should be rewarded. Lame. <br><br>Not only the rarity of the spawn but hell, I have a job and so do 60 ga-zillion other EQ players. I cant be on when Sev is due every week. So how far back are you setting me with the epic ? <br><br>Issues like this deserve some real attention if you can break yourselves out of your daily &quot;How can we lube our customers up to get more cash&quot; meetings. Who the hell at Verant is really about customer service. <br><br>How much money is enough, seems like the only upgrades we get ALWAYS come at a price. <br><br>How many servers do we have 30? 40? ----- 2000 peeps per server pay 10 a month. Now you get this great idea to make some uber server with all kinds of hot stuff for 40 bucks a month? I have paid EQ for over 2 years now, purchased all the expansions and upgrades for my computer. <br><br>Why don't you take some time and really reward your customers for what they have done for you and address the in-game issues that would certainly make things more enjoyable and rewarding. Not asking for anything free here guys. I just think we deserve what we have already earned and not have to try to get those rewards while battling unrealistic odds. <br><br>When you Verant &quot;Decision Makers&quot; drive home in the car we bought you and go to sleep in the house we bought you, why don't you think about us. Make an attempt to do the right thing without hanging a price tag on it. <br><br>You can keep your new server and any other crazy ass money making idea you have to yourself for all I care. I have spent enough. Why not just take care of what should have taken care of the last time you made your &quot;mad cash&quot;. <br><br>**If anyone wants to spread this post out and get it to Verants eyes, please do. I tried to post it on their boards however they charge a $19.95 posting fee for each message. Unless you purchase the new EQ PLatinum membership package and for only $69.95 per month you cover your EQ server fee, get 10 post on EQ boards, and a monthly news letter emailed to you. Also if you sign up for 12 months in advance you receive a free EQ wrist watch and T-Shirt, a savings of more than $48.00!!!!!!!!<br>_________________<br>Tuhiaf Elvespanker <br>Guildleader &quot;Warlords of the Badlands&quot; <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uannicka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Annicka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/02 4:38:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4499.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verants Greed before Need.</span><hr size=1> Why do you think the new expansion is called sol?<br>All they care about is that we pay our ten bucks a month.

Dont you think if they &gt;could&lt; do the things that would make cusotmers happier on all servers, that they would? Do you think that they're holding out on you, not because of financial issues involved in such a server/web space ... but because they're being mean and vindicitive towards their customers?<br><br>I've read a lot of threads like this one across a ton of message boards.

From my understanding, he's not complaining that he has to pay for more, but that Verant is more interested in sucking its players dry for 'new cool features' than it is in fixing the 'old, poorly designed and implemented features' that are already out there.  Basically, he's pissed that Verant is spending their time and effort thinking up new ways to get your money than fixing the old ways to get your money.<br><br>What if Verant was in the automobile manufacturing industry?  They design, build and produce the EverCar.  It looks great, you hear rave reviews about it, but after buying one you discover that the doors don't open and close properly, the engine simply stops working from time to time, the tires go flat on a regular basis, and the steering wheel has been nerfed.  When Verant announces that they'll be releasing the upgrade to EverCar 2.0 for four times what you paid for the original instead of fixing the original which you already paid for, how long do you think they'll last in that industry?<br><br>Personally, I think they'll last until about 3 seconds after the first class-action lawsuit is filed.  When they realize that they are /responsible/ for their actions and the quality of their product they will file bankruptcy, disolve the company, and move to Mexico to live off their phat lewts like kings.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrayndtheftauto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graynd Theftauto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/02 9:15:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4499.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verants Greed before Need.</span><hr size=1> I can't quote exactly where I read this, but I was always under the impression that Verant never took into account how big Everquest was going to become when they offered it at a 10$/month subscription price. <br><br>Yes, I hate dealing with the CSR people sometimes, but usualy I am agitated when a &quot;feature&quot; eats up my limited playing time to fix. It happens, I understand it, I just don't have to like it.<br><br>As to the new offering of the 40$/month server- Bravo Verant! Perhaps I'm just in a good mood today but here is my spin on it. <br><br>For the most part, people who have been in the game for over two years are tired of the now static content to them. Ya know- find mob A, kill mob A. Do this, this and this to kill this mob- etc. The exploration is gone, for the most part the thrill is gone, but being the addiction that Everquest is, most people won't leave. <br>I see some of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds moving as a whole to the new servers.<br>I see spawn competition between said guilds lessened. <br>I see room being made for the new up and coming people to do the zones which are new to them- but old to the long time players.<br>I see long time accounts continuing to be played and generating revenue, which helps me by supporting the game I like to play.<br>I see this as a win/win situation for everyone. Less crowding in the high end zones- less spawn competition, more desireability for every class in the game to fill the void of those leaving...<br><br>I'm not entirely sure yet, I just see this as a very good opertunity to give the long time players a new challenge, and open up the world to exploration like it used to be.  <p>Graynd Theftauto <BR>"The other dead meat" <BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umarxxshadowbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marxx Shadowbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/02 9:45:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4499.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verants Greed before Need.</span><hr size=1> I will pay $15 per month if Verant bans all the whiners <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uroxxorboxxor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roxxor Boxxor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/02 10:14:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4499.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verants Greed before Need.</span><hr size=1> wow.<br>40 a month? thats just.. way too much!!
