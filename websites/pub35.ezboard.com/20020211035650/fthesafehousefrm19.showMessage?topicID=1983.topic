I am hoping that giving Assassins a more powerful Detect Hidden ability does not become a justification that: IF Assassins now have a better chance of DETECTING one of the best RvR classes, THEN Assassins suddenly become a viable class since they get a unique ability that affects a powerful RvR class. It would be like saying Shamans are viable if they have a spell that alerts them if a Primary Healer class (only Druid or Cleric) is within visible range. A gimped class that can possibly detect a more powerful one is not a definition of balance, it’s more like an early death warning.<br><br>Month... after Month... after Month... I await to see some real fixes made to Assassins. I tackle the core issues Volume after Volume after Volume, and am ready to cancel my account as well as many other Assassins already have.<br><br>Volume 4.5 is an add to Volume 4:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=22341432">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=22341432</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>This post further explores how Critical Strike is an incomplete skill and analyzes ways to fix it. It also shows Role Theft, and how versatile classes can perform Assassination functions better than Assassins can themselves, even at Melee!<br><br>Archers are versatile:<br>Archers can specialize to optimize Ranged attacks.<br>Archers can specialize to optimize their Melee attacks.<br>Archers can specialize with buffs, and a speed shout.<br><br>Assassins are not versatile:<br>Assassins can not specialize to optimize Ranged attacks.<br>Assassins can specialize to optimize their Melee attacks.<br>Assassins can specialize in Envenom debuffs.<br><br>This Volume will not get into Envenom, because that is a separate issue that needs fixing, especially in terms of damage output and risk vs reward, and the cost of specializing in it.<br><br>Instead, the question of this Volume is: Can a melee specialized Archer become superior than a Critical Specialized Assassin? Can an Archer choose to excel in ranged attacks superior to the Assassin (which is expected) and can they choose to excel in melee to the Assassin (something Mythic didn’t intend, which will become obvious).<br><br>After it is shows that Archers can become superior than the best Melee Assassin: Can an Archer specialize in ways to equal Assassin equal in melee skill, and still be superior in ranged attacks? Yes.<br><br>First thing archers would say is “Why would we choose to specialize in melee, that would be gimping ourselves!” Of course it is, but the point of this post is to show that Assassins are gimps because they have no choice but to specialize in melee and Archers can still do it better. The reverse cannot be said by the Assassin “Why would we choose to specialize in range, that would be gimping ourselves” because the Archer will always be superior in range anyway.<br><br>Through Perforate Artery, a Shadowblade can potentially take out a Blue caster with a 2-h weapon on a good swing, and Infiltrators/Nightshades can do the same to green casters. However, one shots ONLY apply to bottom feeding, which Assassins are forced to do as a result of being a weak class. That is why Casters are chosen to be a brunt of their attacks, not because Assassins are more powerful than casters, but because smart Assassins will only attack casters, and hearing about Assassins kill Casters becomes all you ever hear about.<br><br>Perforate Artery is also very difficult to execute than a rear attack, and still results in many deaths to yellows with after having executed the entire chain.<br><br>Just remember that in these comparisons, Weapon Specialization adds both 66% increased damage output and Styles, and Critical Strike only adds Styles.<br><br>In the first example, I’ll use a level 50 Shadowblade and Hunter, each of which are geared towards full melee specialization.<br><br>Shadowblade:<br>Stealth (28) or (31) through autotrain<br>Swords or Axes (50)<br>Critical Strike (50)<br><br>Hunter(Melee):<br>Stealth (28)<br>Spears (50)<br>Beastcraft (50)<br>Composite Bow (12) by autotrain/neglect<br><br>Shadowblade vs Hunter(Melee)<br><br>STR/DEX weapon vs STR weapon<br>Studded Absorb vs Leather Absorb<br>Evade I vs Evade VII<br><br>* Hunters wins in both Damage Bonus and Armor Absorption, but the Shadowblade has much superior Evade.<br><br>Benefits from Level 50 Beastcraft:<br>Charm Level 40 Animals or Insects<br>Increased Armor Factor<br>Increased Dex/Qui<br>Pet Strength Buff<br>Speed Shout<br><br>* Hunters can buff to Attack Faster, Increase Dex based bonus damage, Increase defense through AF buff and increased Dex. They also can charm a pet, increase its damage, and have the safety of a Speed Shout.<br><br>Benefits from Level 50 Critical Strike:<br>More Combat Styles to choose from<br><br>* Shadowblades get more Style options.<br><br>Q: Are those extra access to Styles what makes a Shadowblade overcome all those melee deficiencies in relation to the Hunter and make them superior in melee? Let’s compare what was gained through specializing in Critical Strike vs Spears:<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Razor’s Edge(39) [Hunter]<br>Medium fatigue cost, use from behind enemy, medium bonus damage, medium duration stun, medium bonus to hit, small penalty to defense<br><br>Backstab II(10) [Assassin]<br>High fatigue cost, use from behind enemy, medium bonus damage, high bonus to hit, medium penalty to defense, use while hidden<br><br>Razor’s Edge can be used in both Stealth and Casual melee<br>Razor’s Edge has less comparative Fatigue cost<br>Razor’s Edge has higher damage scaling from being a level 39 style<br>Razor’s Edge has less defensive penalty<br>Razor’s Edge was acquired without a separate specialization<br>Razor’s Edge factors in 50% Dex into its damage bonus<br>Backstab II has a slightly higher chance to land<br>Backstab II has a follow up chain at level 15 (small bonus damage)<br><br>* Hunters can make SUPERIOR backstabbers than Assassins<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Perforate(21)  [Spear Style, NOT the Assassin Perforate Artery]<br>Medium fatigue cost, use from side of target, medium bonus damage, causes long duration attack speed reduction, medium penalty to defense for next round<br><br>Pincer(8) [Assassin]<br>Medium fatigue cost, Use from beside enemy, medium bonus damage, high bonus to hit, high penalty to defense<br><br>Perforate causes attack speed reduction<br>Perforate has higher damage scaling as a level 21 style <br>Perforate has Gugnir’s Fury(50) as a follow up style<br>Perforate has less of a defensive penalty associated with it<br>Perforate factors in 50% Dex into its damage bonus<br>Pincer has a higher chance to hit<br><br>* Hunters obtain a SUPERIOR side attack than what Critical Strike can offer<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Whirling Spear(34) [Hunter]<br>High fatigue cost, use any time, medium bonus damage, small bonus to hit, small penalty to defense<br><br>Garrote(18) [Assassin]<br>High fatigue cost, use any time, medium bonus damage, causes medium duration movement reduction, medium bonus to hit, medium penalty to defense<br><br>Whirling Spear has higher damage scaling from being a level 34 style<br>Whirling Spear has less of a defensive penalty<br>Whirling Spear factors in 50% Dex into its damage bonus<br>Garrote has a slightly better chance of landing<br>Garrote causes movement reduction<br>Garrote has Achilles Heel(25) as a follow up style<br><br>* Hunters can obtain a comparative Use Anytime style without ever having specialized in another specialization.<br><br>There is no real comparison to Perforate Artery for hunters, which must be done stealthed and while in front of the target. It would be much easier for them to stealth from behind and use their Razor’s Edge, and that even works if stealth fails. Hunters also do not receive a 4-chain Evade style, but they aren’t missing out since they have Evade I anyway.<br><br>* On top of all this style comparison, the Hunter is complete with added damage and buff on a Pet, Self increased defensive buffs, damage buffs, increased speed, and a Speed buff. And they still can pull at superior range and do decent bow damage.<br><br>Now on to Hibernia:<br><br>Nightshade:<br>Stealth (28) or (31) through autotrain<br>Piercing (50)<br>Critical Strike (50)<br><br>Ranger(Melee):<br>Stealth (28)<br>Piercing (50)<br>Pathfinding (50)<br>Recurve Bow (12) by autotrain/neglect<br><br>Nightshade vs Ranger(Melee)<br><br>Reinforced Absorb vs Leather Absorb<br>Evade III vs Evade VII<br><br>* Rangers have superior Absorb, while Nightshades have superior Evade, but by not as much difference as the Hunter/Shadowblade example.<br><br>Benefits from Level 50 Pathfinding:<br>Increased Str<br>Increased Armor Factor<br>Increased Dex/Qui<br>Increased Damage Add buff<br>Speed Shout<br><br>* Rangers can receive the full benefit of piercing’s 50% str/dex damage bonus because they have buffs in both departments. They will attack faster, with improved Armor factor and Dex increasing their defense. On top of the damage bonus from stats, they have a Damage Add buff, and have a get out of jail free card in the form of a speed shout.<br><br>Benefits from Level 50 Critical Strike:<br>More Combat Styles to choose from<br><br>* Nightshades get more Style options.<br><br>Q: Are those extra access to Styles what makes a Nightshade overcome all those melee deficiencies in relation to the melee Ranger and make them superior in melee?<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Copperhead (21) [Piercing]<br>Medium fatigue cost, use from beside target, medium bonus damage, medium duration movement reduction, medium bonus to hit, small penalty to defense<br><br>Pincer (8) [Assassin]<br>Medium fatigue cost, Use from beside enemy, medium bonus damage, high bonus to hit, high penalty to defense<br><br>Copperhead has higher damage scaling for a level 21 style<br>Copperhead has a movement reduction component<br>Copperhead has a much less penalty to defense associated with it<br>Copperhead has Viper’s Bite(29) as a follow up<br>Pincer has slightly better chance of landing<br><br>* There is really no comparison there. Critical Strike offers nothing there. On top of that, the Ranger using this style is going to do much more damage than the Nightshade that uses Copperhead because of self-buffs.<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Black Widow(12)<br>High fatigue cost, use any time, medium bonus damage, small bonus to hit, small penalty to defense<br><br>Garrote(18) [Assassin]<br>High fatigue cost, use any time, medium bonus damage, causes medium duration movement reduction, medium bonus to hit, medium penalty to defense<br><br>Black Widow has slightly less penalty to defense<br>Black Widow has Level 18 and 39 as follow up styles<br>Garrote has a slightly better chance to land<br>Garrote has better damage scaling for a level 18 style<br>Garrote has a Level 25 for a follow up style<br><br>* Both styles are fair. Garrote opens up for more damage sooner, while Black Widow opens up with a smaller attack but ends with a high end level attack. Of course however, it took the Assassin a completely separate specialization just to get Garrote, which is on par with the piercing style that Rangers and Assassins can get through a single specialization.<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Comparing the opening of an Evasion chain:<br><br>Diamond Back(25) [Piercing]<br>Low fatigue cost, use after evading target, medium bonus damage, medium duration stun, medium bonus to hit, medium bonus to defense<br><br>Hamstring(12) [Assassin]<br>Low fatigue cost, use after evading enemy, medium bonus damage, causes medium duration bleed, medium bonus to hit, medium bonus to defense<br><br>Diamond Back has higher damage scaling as a level 25 style<br>Diamond Back has medium duration stun<br>Diamond Back’s stun can land multiple Diamond Back styles<br>Hamstring causes bleeding (but is overridden, bleeds won’t stack)<br><br>* Diamond Back does more than Hamstring ever will, including more initial damage than the bleed can make up for, and a valuable stun component. Now compare the Follow up style in each chain:<br><br>Dragonspider(44) [Piercing]<br>Medium fatigue cost, use after successful Diamondback, medium bonus damage, long duration bleed, medium bonus to hit<br><br>Leaper(29) [Assassin]<br>Low fatigue cost, use after Hamstring, medium bonus damage, long duration bleed, high bonus to hit, small bonus to defense<br><br>Dragonspider has higher damage scaling as a level 44 style<br>Dragonspider causes Bleeding<br>- Leaper’s Bleed will override the Hamstring bleed<br>Leaper has a better chance to hit with a small defense bonus<br>Leaper will go on to a level 44 and 50 chain to add damage.<br><br>* The damage from the initial evading piercing chain nearly matches that of the second Critical Strike chain, and the piercing chain lands a much more powerful punch by the second chain as well. A Nightshade is better off using their Weapon Style Evade Combo than the 4-chain, as it starts using level 25 damage and includes a stun factor with long duration bleed at the 2nd chain. Gets to the 44 faster and possibly multiple times if done correctly. Rangers have a better chance to do so through their self quickness buff.<br><br>For example, the Critical Style chain can accomplish: <br><br>Hamstring &gt; Hamstring &gt; Achilles &gt; Rib Separate &gt; Ripper<br>Or Level 12, 12, 29, 44, 50 for Damage<br><br>Because of the Stun factor, Piercing can accomplish through a single specialization (works even better for Rangers):<br><br>Diamondback &gt; Dragonspider &gt; Diamondback &gt; Dragonspider<br>Or Level 25, 44, 25, 44 for Damage<br>Or Even 25, 44, 25, 25, 44 for Damage<br><br>* In other words, Rangers can get in two (or three) level 25 styles and two level 44 styles. The Nightshade gets in a 44 and 50 style, but 2 level 12 styles and a single level 29 style. Rangers can accomplish this in 4 hits, and do it faster with their quickness buff and cause stun. The last chains of the Critical strike combo only add more damage and continue the bleed, which Dragonspider adds more damage and bleed anyway. Nightshades can pull off evade better than Rangers, but this shows that there is no benefit to any Evasion combo through Critical Strike. It was silly for the Nightshade to think they could fully specialize in Critical Strike and think that they would get any kind of advantage in evading. On top of all that, the Ranger has increased damage through all their self buffs with a separate damage add, 2 buffs that increase defense, as well as a speed shout to escape when things go bad. They can still pull better with 12 in bow by autotrain than a Nightshade can ever accomplish with their single DD spell.<br><br>* Alternatively, the Ranger could have specialized in Celtic Dual instead of Pathfinding. In that case, the Ranger would have increased overall damage output by 32% without any buffs AND have increased access to styles, just as Critical Strike’s only thing it has to offer. A Nightshade could neglect Critical Strike for Celtic Dual in much the same way, and might actually be on par with a Ranger, but no Ranger would knowingly specialize themselves in such a way to gimp themselves, Nightshades don’t have it any other way but to do so.<br><br>To Albion:<br><br>Infiltrator:<br>Stealth (28) or (31) through autotrain<br>Thrusting (50)<br>Critical Strike (50)<br><br>Scout(Melee):<br>Stealth (28)<br>Thrusting (50)<br>Shield (50)<br>Longbow (12) by autotrain/neglect<br><br>Infiltrator vs Scout(Melee)<br><br>Studded Absorb vs Leather Absorb<br>Evade II vs Evade VII<br>Infiltrator has 25% average damage bonus with dual wield<br>Scout has 30% chance of blocking<br>Infiltrator has Critical Strike styles<br>Scout has Shield styles<br><br>* Scouts are not the runaway superior melee that the Hunter and Ranger can potentially become because of the self buffs and speed. Instead, the Scout has to rely on defense and stunning styles. The point of the Infiltrator vs Scout comparison is to show that the Scout can accomplish everything that the Infiltrator can do in melee because of the superior styles granted by Weapon Specialization compared to Critical Strike.<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Dragonfang(50)<br>Low fatigue cost, use after evading target, medium bonus damage, long duration stun, high bonus to hit, small penalty to defense.<br><br>* I won’t even compare this because this is a level 50 opening evasion style that is open to both the Scout and Infiltrator. An Infiltrator can better pull off this style in the first place, but both classes can possibly get in 3 of these off the same evade because of the stun component. However, the Infiltrator can potientailly fully specialize in Critical Strike and a redundant 4-chain evade combo with no stun component. There is also the level 4, 10, 34 Evasion chain as well from Thrusting. A Fully specialized weapon and critical Infiltrator will have a total of 8 evasion styles total, 3 different chains to choose from, talk about redundancy.<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Pierce(29) [Thrusting]<br>Medium fatigue cost, use from behind enemy, medium bonus damage, medium duration bleed, high bonus to hit, medium penalty to defense<br><br>Backstab II(10) [Assassin]<br>High fatigue cost, use from behind enemy, medium bonus damage, high bonus to hit, medium penalty to defense, use while hidden<br><br>Pierce can be used from behind in Stealth or Casual melee<br>Pierce has higher damage scaling for being a level 29 style<br>Pierce causes bleeding<br>Backstab II can be followed up by a level 15 Style for small extra damage<br><br>* Pierce accomplishes everything Backstab II can with added damage, doing more damage than without having to follow up, and can be repeated in casual melee.<br><br>&gt;<br><br>Basiliskfang(39) [Thrusting]<br>Medium fatigue cost, use from beside target, medium bonus damage, heavy attack speed reduction, small bonus to hit, small bonus to defense<br><br>Pincer(8) [Assassin]<br>Medium fatigue cost, Use from beside enemy, medium bonus damage, high bonus to hit, high penalty to defense<br><br>Basiliskfang has higher damage scaling for being a level 39 style<br>Basiliskfang causes attack speed reduction<br>Basiliskfang includes a defense bonus vs high defense penalty<br>Pincer offers an improved chance to hit<br><br>* Both Scout and Infiltrator are better off sticking to their weapon style. Specializing in Critical Strike for styles offered nothing to the Infiltrator.<br><br>* Scouts are not a runaway contender for melee, but they can fight about just as well as an Infiltrator if they chose to specialize that way, and they still have some points for Longbow. The reverse is impossible for an Infiltrator to ever become as effective as a ranged attacker as a Scout.<br><br>==================================<br><br>CRITICAL STRIKE is a defining skill of Assassins that should make them more feared in melee than Archers in melee. It’s a joke right now.<br><br>==================================<br><br>Think of Mythic as a somewhat benevolent king that is responsible for distributing bread amongst the peasants. There are different classes of peasants, some are more “equal” than others.<br><br>Some classes are balanced and get a full loaf of bread from Mythic (Armsman, Bardd). Some even receive a few more slices of bread on top of that (Thanes, Theurgists), Some used to get 2 loafs of bread (Archers) but now get a loaf and a half, and some receive very few slices of bread at all (Assassins, Shamans).<br><br>Mythic can take away a few slices from Archers, and even other classes that have more than a loaf, they will complain but will always be well fed, because they will still always have their loaf. Other classes like Assassins and Shamans may also get thrown crumbs in addition to their few slices of bread. They CHEER at even getting the slightest crumb or additional slice of bread, yet have whatever was added be taken away from them during the next bread distribution (Dex on casting, AoE on Stealth, -rez through walls), and are always starving because they never have had a full loaf of bread. Mythic really needs to toss them the entire loaf of bread to balance their diet, instead of keeping them satiated with the bare minimum to maintain them in their kingdom, and take it away the next time the bread comes around.<br><br>I bought the game based on wanting to play between the Nightshade, Shadowblade, or Infiltrator that they described. I bought the game based on a lie, there is no other way of getting around that. On top of that, Mythic is not showing any true interest in fixing those classes. Instead, they toss crumbs every month, saying in October “Assassins will see fixes in 3 weeks” then “Assassins will receive all their skills by Christmas” then “the proliferation of Assassins show that they are a viable class”<br><br>Maybe no more, for I am looking at canceling my account every day with a greater smirk on my face, I’ve resisted but I’m already looking forward to canceling before Feb 10 when my monthly charge kicks in again.<br><br>Now it is February. You have taken away from Assassins as much as you have given them and have got us nowhere. How many Volumes do I have to keep on posting until you get the picture! I’m not saying you have to implement my ideas by what I posted, but I have revealed Assassin deficiencies in so many ways, you could at least throw something on Pendragon to test it out.<br><br>That brings up another point, use Pendragon as a real test server. As it stands right now, you test out a series of changes in a patch of things you were already intending that go into the game, and then testing balance. Try the reverse, test novel things on Pendragon for a change instead of preplanning everything at your meetings. Feel free to experiment more with changes and not necessarily have to get all the Pendragon changes onto the live servers. To sum it up, Pendragon patches ARE only changes that you have already PREPLANNED that will go live, start testing new ideas more liberally and even things that might not get patched to see their effect on game balance. Throw in those Assassin changes on Pendragon and see what comes of it instead of preplanning that everything on Pendragon MUST go live.<br><br>To Sanya: When you discuss what was posted to the Devs, what do they do with this information? Do they laugh and say “Oh that Ela’s at it again, that crazy Rogue, don’t they know they’re viable?” and dismiss everything? Do they bother to read what was printed out, or do they already have their own vision of what a class should be and have stuck to that for all these months, so all other ideas are filtered out? Do they even bother to test any of this stuff out and try to make comparisons between classes to better balance them?

However, I think it would better serve both your arguments and your blood pressure if you stopped comparing assassins to archers.<br><br>Everyone: Archers are overpowered in PvP.  Changes aimed at making us &quot;on par&quot; with archers will make assassins overpowered and either A) won’t happen, B) will be undone or bring other related/unrelated nerfs as a result of other people complaining, or C) will make assassins as proliferate and disliked by non-rogues as archers are now.<br><br>I can’t think of a tactful way to say this that is as direct, but I mean this in the most friendly way possible: get over the archer envy and you will have more fun.  They are overpowered, they may get nerfed and they may not; if you both want to be an assassin, and want to play DAoC, you need to accept that and be comfortable with it. If you can’t, you are either playing the wrong class or the wrong game, and unless you change one or the other you will continue being unhappy unless archers get nerfed and/or assassins get a huge boost, neither of which is a guarantee.<br><br>Perhaps this is a powergamer mentality, but when I start playing a game, I find out what the rules are and play by them in such a way that best achieves my goals (and if the rules change, which they do frequently in MMOGs, I adapt).  I’ve noticed a very common attitude in MMOGs of trying to change the rules so they fit your idea of what they should be.  Most of the time you will fail, and even if you succeed, chances are someone else’s idea of what the rules should be was totally different (or worse, what it used to be before your petitioned change!).<br><br>There was a similar issue with my class in EQ: Shadowknight.  SKs were perennially underpowered, though we had a combination of abilities such that the more clever/skilled SKs were quite powerful in ways Verant probably did not intend.  There seemed to be two distinct camps: those that absolutely loved the class (and usually recognized that there were, in fact, glaring problems), and those that were eternally dissatisfied and either screamed constantly for changes, or were Prophets of Doom that did nothing but talk about how terrible the class is and how much more fun they’re having with their Warrior.  I see that here. I came to define the two thusly, and here I change back to DAoC: you either &quot;play&quot; an assassin, or you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> an assassin.

Squink got it: &quot;The appearance of class envy is detrimental to your cause&quot;<br><br>Not to nitpick, but my choice of words tends to be very specific, so reading between the lines doesn’t work very well.  The only part that was directed at you, Ela, were the first two sentences: it would better serve your arguments if you stopped comparing assassins to archers (the rest of the post was a statement to everyone regarding general attitude).  I know it is for the sake of illustration, but your points could be illustrated using other classes, or without bringing any other class into the equation, and my immediate impression upon seeing several (all? well, won’t generalize) of your reports is &quot;assassins vs. archers&quot;.  I have personally seen you reply in defense to your own threads &quot;This is NOT a request to nerf archers!&quot; at least three times, so I’m not the only one.<br><br>The previous paragraph stands alone, but allow me to go into more detail.  I assume you welcome critical inquiry.  Your argument, in my perception, is that &quot;even an archer can melee better than an assassin, so Critical Strike should be more powerful&quot;, and your supporting evidence is three main points: archers use superior armor than assassins, archers have buffs that are beneficial to melee combat, weapon skill styles are superior to critical strike styles.<br><br>1. Archers use superior armor. This is one facet of the reason archers are overpowered.  It would make perfect sense for balance if the situation was reversed and assassins used reinforced and archers used leather.  It will never happen.<br><br>2. Archers have buffs that are beneficial to melee combat.  Another facet of archer imbalance: in addition to all their other abilities they have self-buffs.  If archers had this taken away, they would still be too powerful in RvR.  But it also won’t happen.<br><br>1 and 2 are direct comparisons to archers, and therefore weak, in my opinion.  Don’t get me wrong, they are absolutely true, but it’s comparing apples and gold.<br><br>3. Weapon styles are superior to Critical Strike styles.  This point is far more compelling, but the comparison to archers is unnecessary and weakens the argument.  Here you can compare assassins to assassins, or simply styles to styles without mentioning classes at all.  The latter would actually be better, because you could also compare Critical Strike to non-rogue weapon styles such as Large Weaponry and Celtic Spear, without bringing class into the discussion.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A> at: 2/1/02 6:04:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaowyth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caowyth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 2:10:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1983.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ela’s Assassin Volume IV 1/2</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm just tired of the whining.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>People used to say the same sort of things about EQ rogues.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwinderpane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winderpane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 3:20:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1983.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ela’s Assassin Volume IV 1/2</span><hr size=1> Please continue to compare Archers and Assassins.

Something we don't do.<br><br>The whole post was a joke and a bad one at that.<br><br>It consists of basically comparing a general melee spec'd archer vs non-general melee spec'd assassins.  It's cake to make an assassin max that absolutely owns any archer max in melee RvR.<br><br>The best of those maxes don't use CS.  Why is that?  Because the use of CS is striking from hidden.  General melee doesn't involve that.  You don't see these archer maxes running around.  It isn't because an archer is gimping himself by maxing this way.  The number of assassins show that people like playing stealthed melees.  It would make sense that if these so called comparisions held true, there would be very few people playing assassins and they'd instead be playing melee focused archers.<br><br>This isn't the case.  And the reason why is that when it comes to melee, each realm's assassin class owns it's archer class in RvR melee combat.<br><br>This is the first of the assassin volumes I've seen getting ripped into by assassins.

It isn't that much difference than the &quot;Caster in Chain&quot; scenario with Smite Clerics, and Wizards needing some kind of augmentation to better them as nukers than Clerics.<br><br>==========================================<br><br>&quot;One class worst speccing is better than one other's class best speccing&quot;<br><br>==========================================<br><br>For the Archers that get enraged when they read this post and think that it is calling for Archer Nerfs, this post has nothing to do with Archer Archery. It is about Archer Melee vs Assassin Melee, and the deficiencies of Critical Srike as a specialization. <br><br>For those that have a hard time understanding the soft gimp of the Melee Archer vs the Hard gimp of the Assassin, I'll relate things in different words. Anything in brackets shows their parallel. <br><br><br>Imagine there was a new class in Hibernia called &quot;Shieldbearer&quot; [Assassin] <br><br>They can only wear Reinforced instead of Hero's Scale [Leather], but are still expected to take the brunt of attacks. <br><br>They get Evade III instead of Evade I of Heroes [Evade III vs Evade VII] <br><br>They CANNOT specialize in 2-h weapons [Bows] <br><br>They CAN specialize in &quot;Shieldbearing&quot; [Critical Strike] <br><br>To entice them to take up the Shieldbearing specialization, Parry has been removed [Pathfinding/Beastcraft]. <br><br>Shieldbearing DOES NOT add any chance to block with the shield, only the original Shield Specialization does. Instead, it adds a few Shield Styles and some Shield Chains to supplement damage, and these Chains are only executed at the beginning of combat. The first chain introduced at low levels can only be executed in melee if you block the first strike in combat. It is soon overridden by a second chain, and even a third 3-chain that only can be initiated in the first hit in combat IF you block the first hit from the opponent (generally 40% chance to block that hit) [Perf Artery] <br><br>The rest of the Shieldbearing styles hit with the shield with positional styles much like the same way weapon specialization would do anyway. <br><br>Shieldbearers have a &quot;Damage Sense&quot; ability where a warning message appears when a Warrior or Armsman is in visible range. <br><br>Shieldbearers have no 30 min timer &quot;get out of jail&quot; wildcard like the Heroes have with Stag form [Archer speed shout] <br><br><br><br>After a class with this setup is introduced, the question remains, are Heroes better with a Shield Specialized setup (soft gimp) than a Shieldbearer's Best Shield setup (hard gimp)? <br><br>SHIELD SPECIALIZED HERO: <br>+ Heroes wear Scale (better absorb) <br>+ Heroes have Parry (30% chance parry) <br>+ Heroes have Stag Form when in danger (+45% hp) <br><br>SHIELDBEARER: <br>+ Has Evade III (better evade) <br>+ Has more styles to choose from <br>+ Detect Warrior/Armsman <br><br>&quot;Why would I play a shield bearing Hero [melee Archer] if I wanted to be offensive minded? I would rather roll a 2-h or Spear Hero [Bow Archer]&quot; <br><br>This has nothing to do with Hero Nerfs in relation to Shields, rather it has to do with improving Shieldbearer's defensive ability to surpass that of Heros. <br><br>============================================<br><br>Both Weapon and Dual Wield have built in diminishing return factors to counter the lost gains from spending many more points in the specialization for the same gain. Critical Strike has no diminishing returns factor, because there is no benefit to specializing it other than styles. <br><br>Weapon Specialization after 2/3 max (level 33 spec at 50) gains twice as much benefit per point level. <br><br>Dual Wield after level 20 gains twice as much benefit per point level. <br><br>Critical Strike = none <br><br><br>At Level 50: <br><br>50 Weapon Specialization = +66% casual damage output <br>50 Dual Wield = +32% casual damage output <br>50 Critical Strike = +0% casual damage output <br><br>Weapon specialization provides the most gains in casual melee, of course though, it is weapon type specific so it should remain where it is at. <br><br>Dual Wield is an example of a specialization that adds more styles to the arsenal light Critical Strike does. It is victim to some cross-skill redundancy, but it also adds up to a +32% boost to casual melee damage output in all situations compared to minimum specialization. This works very well for Light Tanks, and the skill applies to any weapon, hence it is weaker than weapon spec itself. <br><br>Critical Strike suffers from both cross and inter-skill redundancy. Like Dual Wield, an Assassin with Critical Strike will have overlapping styles. It is made worse if the Assassin has also specialized in Dual Wield. What is even worse is that Critical Strike will override it's own styles through redundancy. On top of this, there is no casual melee damage output that is useful in all situations. An Assassin nearly Voids an entire specialization line upon being revealed, or after that first strike in combat. <br><br><br>If we use Dual Wield as an example of a good specialization that increases damage output in casual melee and adds styles and offers only cross-redundant styles, Critical Strike could use the same kind of scaling factor, in that it has even more redundant style factors, but their Perforate they can pull off is their defining skill. <br><br>If Dual Wield at full specialization increases the chance to hit from 25% to 65% (a 32% boost to overall damage), what equation can Critical Strike use to simulate a 32% boost to overall damage. <br><br>The chance to casually Critical HIT in combat is 10%, thus increasing overall casual melee damage by 10% <br><br>If Critical Strike applied to Critical Hits in casual melee (something I thought was factored in when I start the game), you can multiply the 1.32 Full Spec factor by 1.10 Base Critical Hit factor and you get a final percentage of 45.2%. <br><br>Our goal now is to find an equation that will get an Assassin a chance to Critical Hit from 10% to 45.2% <br><br>If Until Level 30, Assassins receive +.5% to Critical Strike with 30 specialization, that adds to the Critical Hit factor: <br><br>10%(base) + (Level 30 / 2)% = 25% <br><br>Beyond Level 30, the equation shifts to compensate for diminishing returns like Weapon Spec does at 2/3 and Dual Wield does at level 20+, so that there is a 1% gain after each CS level after 30. <br><br>The 20 Levels between 30 and 50 add 20% <br><br>Add that 20% + the 25% from levels 1-30, and you get: <br><br>45% <br><br>Which reaches our goal of 45.2% <br><br>That 10% to 45% increase in Critical Hit increases damage output by 32% much the same way Dual Wield does at full spec. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ela>Ela</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 8:56:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1983.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ela’s Assassin Volume IV 1/2</span><hr size=1> A reply to another post regarding melee Ranger vs Assassin:<br><br>===========================================<br><br>ealaniel: <br><br>As you pointed out ealaniel, Evade and Absorption alone shows that Nightshades receive 14% less damage. <br><br>DEFENSE: <br><br>- Nightshades receive 14% less damage through Evasion vs Ranger Absorbtion. <br><br>+? Ranger Qui Buff add to Evade? <br>+ Ranger Self AF Buff <br>+ Ranger Dex Buff increases Defense <br><br>* The Quickness affecting Evade wasn't included in the original example because it has not been verified, but I seem to evade more often with a Dex/Qui buff from a Druid vs a regular Dex Buff. When I ran tests when I was around level 32, a combination of both Dex and Dex/Qui druid buffs from a full specialized Nurture Druid decreased damage from 80 to 60. Combine that with the Ranger Self AF Buff and that should overcome the base 14% advantage that the Nightshade has. <br><br>OFFENSE: <br><br>+ Rangers Attack Faster with Qui Buff. <br>+ Rangers Receive Damage bonus from Str Buff. <br>+ Rangers Receive Damage bonus from Dex Buff. <br><br>- Cannot supplement a one time DoT or Debuff <br>(38 damage tick x 5 = 190 damage over 20 seconds) <br><br>+ Rangers do get a (9.4 DPS) damage add buff. Over the course of 5 seconds, that adds up to 47 damage (235 damage over 20 seconds), compared to the 38 damage DoT. That alone over the course is enough to do more damage over time than the Poison Dot. Rangers can miss, but Nightshades can both miss landing the poison and have it resisted completely. <br><br>* The Ranger Damage Add alone defeats poison (so much for Envenom). The rest of the buffs add to damage as well. <br><br><br>&gt;&quot;True, but to what extent. Anyone with level 12 bow skill actually tried to shoot anything level 50? I'm thinking that this may not work as well as you think.&quot; <br><br>I never meant to say it works well, this is a Melee Ranger afterall. It was to show that the Melee Ranger has superior Melee and has an extra tool at Range still superior than what an Assassin can ever accomplish. <br><br>The point of showing the autotrain in bows is not to suggest they are powerful, but to show Archers still have some kind of bow ability (albiet weaker) that is superior to anything an Assassin can accomplish, where the reverse can't be said if an Assassin wanted to specialize in range attack and still be better than the Archer at Melee. <br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&quot;To actually *prove* that assassins were gimped vs melee archers you'd need to do an actual *test* for that, something that Ela has never bothered to do.&quot; <br><br>If you can find an Assassin with that setup at level 50 and a Melee Hunter/Ranger of level 50 and they're not in the same realm, I would be glad to see a test set up. It's not something that I can be &quot;bothered&quot; to do, I can't whip up a level 50 melee Archer in another realm to test it out with a flick of my finger, but Mythic can. I'm a gamer that has to follow the rules, I can't set up something like that out of the blue, that's why I'd request it on Pendragon.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=1983.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessage?topicID=2005.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessage?topicID=2007.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1983.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=1983.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=1983.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1983.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1983.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Dark Age of Camelot</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
