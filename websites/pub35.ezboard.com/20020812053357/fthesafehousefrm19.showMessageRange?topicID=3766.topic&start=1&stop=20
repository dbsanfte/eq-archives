From reading the boards, 2 ideas keep constantly showing up on how to deal with buff bots, limiting buffs with a timer or by distance from the buffer.<br><br>I think if we merge both these ideas, we'll come up with a great solution.  Buffs should be limited by both a timer and distance.  By first using a timer, say after 15 minutes a check is made to see if the recipient of the buffs is in range of the buffer (a pretty generous but reasonable distance).  If the recipient is not in range, then he has 2 minute to get back in range or the buffs are lost.<br><br>This would safe a legitimate player-controlled buffer from having to rebuff every 15 minutes or so.  This would also make it a hassle for someone using a 2nd computer from camping his buff bot in the portal while his rogue goes out and tears through everyone in his path.  Just my $.02. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwhyno713.showPublicProfile?language=EN>whyno713</A> at: 7/19/02 11:34:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/17/02 5:17:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A fair change to balance out buff bots.</span><hr size=1> Interestingly, a solution is already in place.  Look at resistance buffs.  They are basically chants.  Go out of range, they go away, come back into range, they're back.  If all buffs were like that...problem solved.  Make all non-resistance buffs targeted chants.  I'm sure there would be other things to consider, but that would solve it.<br><br>Obviously this is a bad idea from the perspective that bot accounts equate to extra profit, so it's unlikely to happen.

This plays a large role in keep defence while roaming around.<br><br>Other than that, the idea of buffs on a range needs to go forward -- not sure how this can get put to the right people, but I suspect that if it was addressed then the outcry for &quot;NERF ASSASSINS&quot; would abate.<br><br>All legitimate assassins out there should keep it in mind that their buffbot handjob using brethren are by their actions motivating the vocal majority of classes out there to get us all nerfed across the board -- something to think about.<br><br>The next step would be to remove the Stun of DragonFang and DiamondBack and make them medium stun 2-step chains at 18 -&gt; 39 (like LeftAxe).  Allow the Infs/NSs their respec where they prolly chose Slash (make Assassin using Slash a Dex-based weapon?).  Infs with Slash are really tough, but at least they are not demigods like Thrust 50 Infs are.<br><br>Anyway, if anyone's got friends in high places, bring up the buffs-on-range topic, get it addressed, but not in a way that hurts people who play Aug main toons (who are grouped and stay close to their group).<br><br> <p>Cheers,<BR><BR>Steppin Razor, BORS/Mid [Lvl 44 5-spec SB (mostly good at all, master of none)]<BR>{Appeal to all Infs out there to drop their Buffbot handjobs... you don't need it, not by a mile}<BR>http://www.geocities.com/nage42/Steppin_Razor.html</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usunraven01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SunRaven01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/18/02 5:26:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A fair change to balance out buff bots.</span><hr size=1> You guys act like assassins are the only ones who move away from groups.<br><br>Maybe Bedevere is just a weird server, but bards are pretty damn mobile characters.

I agree that this would be an unfair reprecussion if buff bots are fixed based solely on a timer or on range by itself.  But thats why I think its a good idea to merge both range and timer, that way we can tweak both variables so a fair constraint can be worked out that will deter buff bots but leave legitimate groups alone.<br><br>Lets say we make the range check rather large (e.g. from PK to MG) and the timer 15 minutes.  This would give a fairly big envelope for groups to work with.  Add to this that you have 2 minutes to get back in range of the buffer after the 15 minutes range/timer check and I feel we have a system that is fair to all.<br><br>Yeah, I feel this is a serious issue and hopefully we can come up with a workable solution that keeps this game fun and balanced for all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaxus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caxus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 12:03:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> I don't really see why people think buffbots will get assassins nerfed.

Its no more cheating than is twinking or powerleveling if you ask me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 6:02:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> It would be cheating if this were a solo game, it would be cheating if DAoC did not encourage a variety of play styles, it would be cheating if it were not part of the game... but it is.<br><br>The proposal in this thread is very much to the benefit of the other popular soloing classes: thoes with speed of some kind.

Just because a few certain players on your server use them allowing you not to be able to solo them doesn't mean that there's an &quot;issue&quot; there.  Annoying as hell?  Yes.  But not at all an exploit or a cheat.<br><br>  To put it in perspective lets say that two roommates each have their own account.  One has a level 50 SB and the other has a level 50 shaman aug specced.  One of their favorite things to do is to go to emain where the shaman buffs the the SB at the portal keep and then the SB goes out and kills people.<br><br>  No matter how you feel about it theres absolutely nothing wrong with this play strategy.  The game is set up this way.  Nobody's cheating.  Whether or not its actually one person playing both roles on two accounts is beside the point because its nobody's business what goes on on the other side of people's computers.<br><br>Also, could someone explain to me how buffbots are going to get assassins nerfed?  I assume people think its because some assassins use buffbots to make themselves more powerful thereby giving people an inaccurate impression of their effectiveness when they get killed by them.  Why do you think assassins are the only classes that use buffbots so that we would be singled out as overpowered?  Almost any class at all benefits from them with the exception of maybe non pet casters.  Do you really think that the devs will just go on peoples word that &quot;this assassin owned me really bad the other day&quot; instead of testing things out for themselves?  And if so i'm sure the devs would consider the possibilities that said assassin was buffed like crazy or that said whiner was just a liar.<br><br>DEV: &quot;Hmmm, lots of people complaining about super strong assassins with 1500 hps.  Thats strange, i could have sworn we set them up to have about 1000 hps at level 50.  Oh well, better nerf those assassins.&quot;<br><br>I don't think so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3766.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3766.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3766.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=20><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3766.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3766.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3766.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3766.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
