I was suprised it stuck and more so when I looked at my mr it had dropped done to about but not exactly 30 .  At 115mr the song stuck 1 in 3 times.  Guess I haven't had the oportunity to fight many bards.<br><br>The song was song of twilight and its base is only neg 15mr at his lvl(56)  I suppose this is another case in which the 1.5x normal resist debuff buff shouldn't really apply.  apparantly the instrument + the pvp debuff buff yields a modifier for this particular song of maybe 5.25.  That gives his instrument a 3.5x modifier.<br><br>The 3 situations I see are are... First with instruments can you expect...<br><br>oclusion of sound unresistable -10mr modified to -53<br>denons bereavement pr save -15mr modified to -79mr<br><br>to lower the players mr (neg 132) that their chance of resisting the song of twilight will never be resisted lowering the players mr by an additional 84 point at 60 bringing the total to negative 216?<br><br>I assume that even if the songs last an ok duration it would be all that a bard could do to keep the player snared so singing songs to dot them down on top of that would be out of the question however I assume that this could be used to snare slow and pk with a partner and I also assume that all 3 mr reducers would be overkill. Would think twilight and occlusion would be quite enough at -137.<br><br>Next assuming the bard wielded weapons in order to actually be able to dmg the player without having to twist more songs. Pre epic making due with just amplification your talking about a 1.9 (multiplied by 1.5 for 2.85 for pvp resist debuffs) modifier according to this thread...<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=564.topic&start=21&stop=21">pub35.ezboard.com/fthesaf...21&stop=21</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>That gives you 71mr with just occulsion and bereavement which isn't too bad or 114. Though I don't think you could even keep up amplification, 3 debuffs AND snare so I don't think its much of an issue unless someone else is snaring or helping you.<br><br>Next... Epic bard with amplification.  This should give you 1.9x 1.8(epic modifier) x 1.5 pvp modifier for resist debuffs. Thats 4.6.  Occulusion and bereavment= -115mr I assume it wouldn't be impossible to sing snare and amplification with that but what do you do after that?  You can't keep your ds up too or dot and going toe to toe with the rogue would be one hell of a mistake.<br><br>I don't see this as too huge an issue with solo pvp however the ability to debuff an ungodly amount (216 is that even possible?) of mr may be too strong for group pvp.  No epic is required just a nice instrument and suddely everyones mr you fight = 0 or negative.<br><br>Info on pvping against or with bards would be welcome.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uriphter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Riphter</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/RathOsiris/Polluxsigmini.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/02 9:56:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/RathOsiris/Polluxsigmini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard songs.</span><hr size=1> I had a Bard on SZek Test and on SZek live(I didnt play much live, I quit game shortly after)<br><br>All I can really say is that a Rogue is probably the easiest class my Bard ever had to fight. If I just tap an AOE song, you lose your stealth.. I can reach the AC value of an equal level warrior(I believe that's it... or it's atleast VERY close). I can deal pretty good damage with dual wielding.. and if you add in the fact that I'm going to be also singing damage songs(I always twisted DDD and Bellow on my enemies), I'm outdamaging you most likely..<br><br>Now add in that if you choose to run.. all I have to do is twist my AOE snare and AOE damage songs and you will be pretty unlikely to escape(AOE snares are VERY nice..).. because the AOE Damage song last I checked cancels sneak/hide?(I am not positive on this, so dont quote me) And the AOE snare isnt going to let you outrun me while I melee you down.<br><br>Bards are a VERY hard class to beat for anyone if the Bard is experienced and knows what he's doing.. Warriors are probably the only class I feared.. and Shadowknights/Paladins.. Purely because Warriors have so much HP, same thing with Paladins(Thanks to LOH).. and SKs Harm Touch hurts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Hope this info is helpful.. and if you find an Anti-Bard tactic, I'd love to know it.. seeing as on my carebear server I'm playing Rogue as main and Bard/Monk as alts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uteuvic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teuvic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/02 2:07:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard songs.</span><hr size=1> Bards can be one of the easiest opponents in Pvp (note the PvP) and/or they can be one of the most annoying.

Without a wind instrument its approx –15MR, with a win instrument your looking at –29MR and with Epic your looking at –26MR.  You hit them with Occlusion of sound and even the most uber-equipped warrior has a good chance of being mezzed 2 out of 5 times.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I assume that even if the songs last an ok duration it would be all that a bard could do to keep the player snared so singing songs to dot them down on top of that would be out of the question<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Nope we have a new Selo’s song that lasts 2 minutes, no need for snare if we don’t want to.  If it lands successfully a few times I’ll stick with it, if not I don’t concern myself with it unless I’m meleeing, in which case Amp + Epic will make sure it lands for an instant: (-132agi, -48AC, slow/snare)<br><br>Keeping Occlusion on you is not an issues, once it is on you and the first successful debuff lands, it will almos always (depending on what song the bard is singing) debuff the needed stats, so landing the song again is almost always successful.  Amplification (as I stated in my other thread lasts much longer than normal songs, so twisting it with other is not neccissary every time, you can skip 3 full twist of amplification as long as you pick it back up on the 4th twist.  This leaves us at nothing but 2 songs while given your above example.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  going toe to toe with the rogue would be one hell of a mistake<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Actually no it wouldn’t.  We (in most circumstances) have more ac than a rogue, maybe not as many hps, but that doesn’t matter if you consider our DS which (with the help of Amp and epic) is possible of just 27 with ONE song. Not to mention bards can stack DS’s (yeah it’s a bug but it works, use it you know you would).  In my test a Toe to Toe (no BS) I won with an epic equipped rogue no songs, nothing but melee loosing a little more than 2 bubbles of health.  With DS up I lost almost one bubble of health.<br><br>Trust me when I say don’t stand toe to toe, our 18 DS song is also a +118 vsPoison (without Amplification but with epic equipped).  Add in amplification and you get a 27 DS a ~ 140 vsPoison<br><br>When I duel a rogue I make sure I have the max DS I can provide, rather it be through my SS bracer and songs alone, or with SS bracer, songs, mage DS, Druid DS, Amplification, your looking at a ~87 DS right there alone. I can keep that on myself and chain cast my SS bp and not have to worry about much of anything but looking pretty to those watching.  That’s melee alone, lets not even talk about occlusion w/Selo’s drum of the march, and the 3 dots.  Or amp + epic + bellows for a chain casting dmg of 78 pts per pulse.  If you have a good strategy stand toe to toe with a rogue, if not stay back and bellow/dot to death its all a matter of how fast you want the fight to be, or what songs you prefer.  If you’d like more feedback I’d be happy to do so later when work settles down.<br> <p><CENTER><table border=1>     <tr>     <td><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10808" target="Jondin's Profile"><img src="http://www.supernet.net/~langston/Jondin_Sig.JPG"></a></td>     </tr>     </table></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upulid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pulid</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/communtychest.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 7:19:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard songs.</span><hr size=1> the guy with DDD and bellow is alittle low to comment. your ac will not match a warriors 30 or 40+ and your songs are not doing nearly any damage. your 3 dots do respectable damage but not enough. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 5:51:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard songs.</span><hr size=1> If you can beat a rogue toe to toe without ANY songs and only lose 2 bulbs of life he or his gear sucks BADLY or he is 10 lvls lower.<br><br>Note when considering all strategies you must consider the fact that you can only play so many songs(duh)<br><br>Strategies...<br><br>Run around and never come into melee range and try to kill the rogue with just songs.  Well songs don't do very good dmg vs high resists.  While this is quite doable the rogue can just leave unless you think your going to play selos, amplification resist lowering songs (at least 2) snare + dd + dots or 9 songs.<br><br>Go toe to toe and expect ds + songs to do him in. Several notes...<br><br>Including other classes ds in this is just wrong its no more a good way to analyze bards in pvp than it would be to analyze rogues who have enc + cleric buffs.<br><br>If your working in occasional selos and amplification + both dmg shields I wouldn't expect you to be able to play much more than that.<br><br>If you try to go for just instruments in this case expect to die or more likely go into kite mode forcing the rogue to zone in disgust when the rogue jousts you with backstabs taking almost no ds dmg or with chaotic stabs for 120.  Btw don't tell me you can't be bsed there is no such thing as a player who can't be bsed.<br><br>If you go for weapons instead of instruments the above still aplies except you will be able to do some dmg to the rogue as well.  Still I don't see you comming out ahead if the rogue is smart.<br><br>The only way that I could see that a bard would be fearsome in pvp at high lvls is with a partner.  Huge lowering of mr + snare from the bard or partner = dead people.<br><br>Also a few things to consider from the rogues perspective...<br><br>Chaotic stab as listed above<br><br>Jousting with backstabs as above<br><br>Poisons, you can resist them with songs but this is yet another song to be played although I guess you can drop it after the initial combat round unless the rogue is joisting with bs and waiting.  Btw as far as I know (and I checked the spdat) there is no song that both adds a ds and pr.  Have to use a seperate song or gear.<br><br>Disciplines.  The primary concern being duelist.  I know you can either run around, DA at 60, or use parry disc but this should be activated along with backstab and although those strategies will minimize the dmg it does you could easily be looking at from 550 up to a TON of dmg just from that initial round of combat with duelist.<br><br>Indoors.  I'm sure you would never duel a rogue indoors just like i would never duel a bard outdoors (hey solution don't duel bards heh) but in pvp this can come up.  Any non selos zone leaves you in a VERY weak position.<br><br>First off how many songs can a bard be expected to twist at once while still maintaining amplification and selos chorus and moving around to fight?<br><br>Next without outside help OR buffs and while limited to the number of songs provided for the above question can you provide the ideal strategy for fighting a decently equiped lvl 60 rogue for...<br><br>A) Pking a rogue even if he doesn't want to stick around.  BTW no rogue will want to stay and play when you try to kite with songs.<br><br>B) Killing a rogue in a situation where he will stick around.  Not including kiting as the only method of dmg because this will lead to the rogue zoning.<br><br>C) Trying to fight a rogue indoors.
