Probably very large.  It's a bit concerning, all things considered.  <br><br>I broke the addiction a few months ago and I feel so much better about things now.  Going to the gym, playing basketball often again for the first time in more years than I can remember.  I wake up in the morning for classes, and hit work after 2 a day, and I'm full of energy instead of feeling tired.   I can stay an hour after work to do things that need to be done instead of rushing home at 6:00 on the dot to log on to EQ.  I see what's going on in the world around me, through the media.  I read again.  I play other games in my free time when I'm not out somewhere.  Things are different.<br><br>It takes a very honest and strong person to admit to depression I think.  I wouldn't be surprised if I suffered under it while I was playing EQ as well.  Not going out with friends, letting life slowly drift away until it feels almost impossible to go back to it.  I'd played other online games before EQ, and although UO did a good job of this as well, it wasn't quite as bad.  <br><br>Anyway.. food for thought.  <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaraxasxev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>araxas xev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/02 10:25:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22154.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Depression</span><hr size=1> Touchy subject :P<br><br>I quit too a few months ago, but even when playing it was strictly a hobby, and I never let it interfere with real life commitments, relationships, and work (well hehe guess there were a few times I was up too late playing).

Once upon a time I was a true EQ addict and there were situations where I felt I needed to escape.  But now I have learned there is more to life than EQ.  I still play on a regular basis, but I don't let it interfere with things that I believe are important in life.  <br><br>I can't say that many people who play a lot of EQ are clinically depressed, this just might be the way that they enjoy their free time.  It might just be that EQ is a place where they are happiest.  I love the friends I have met while playing Everquest.  They are true friends and they give support when it is needed.  I also love my friends and family in real life and they have come to understand that sometimes I just need to &quot;get away&quot;.  <br><br>EQ doesn't control my life the way it did a year ago, but I still enjoy playing.  It's all a matter of perspective and priorities.  If this makes you happy, play.  If you play and you feel anger than maybe there are things you need to look at in your life to help you.  I'm no psychologist, but I do know the addiction that can get to you...<br><br>Playing games is just one of those things that some people enjoy more than others.  If you like playing EQ, keep playing it to the fullest, but don't let it overrun your life and take away other things that you can enjoy... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=quiksilverroxdasox>Quiksilver Roxdasox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 12:14:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22154.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Depression</span><hr size=1> i wouldnt say that the question is &quot;how many EQ players are depressed&quot; but how many people in the united states are depressed. that'd be a pretty large number for people that are just &quot;depressed,&quot; nothing clinical. its kinda what modern society does =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucokoanuttmunkey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cokoanutt Munkey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://binksy.50megs.com/headpic2.jpg WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=100" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 12:28:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22154.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://binksy.50megs.com/headpic2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Depression</span><hr size=1> the world sucks.  eq is an escape, that doesn't suck quite as much.

It's hard holding a coversation when your really depressed, that isnt whining<br><br>2) It keeps you busy. While watching TV or driving my mind wanders to things that depress me, but in eq you can focus on pulling or whatever and it doesnt give you a chance to worry.<br><br>3) You get a sense of friendship, and people rely on you. feeling bad-ass about your character is good. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udawisemonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaWiseMonk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 7:52:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22154.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Depression</span><hr size=1> Me depressed no...........

EQ to me is about challenging yourself to do something you don't think you can and if you fail you can try again until you get it right........

I live a life where I live in an apartment, in an urban area, have 2 kids, am a domestic goddess, and I don't really know anyone as I am not from the city I live.  I fell into a depression when I moved here 300 miles from my family and friends.  I have lived here for almost 3 years but have never really gotten out to meet people as I am shy and stuck at home.  <br><br>Now approximately a year ago my husband discovered EQ.  I nagged him constantly to spend time with me and to do this and that because he would lose track of time playing EQ.  Well I decided to give the game a try and I have been hooked since.  <br><br>EQ hasn't depressed me or made me antisocial I was already.  However I do lose track of time.  I no longer go to the gym, I lose A LOT of time, my house is messy longer then it should be, and I have gained some weight.  However, I do think that it is any different to go to parties, hang out at the bar,  go out with friends, etc etc etc....or rather to just play EQ and hang out with your EQ mates.  I have forged great friendships and I enjoy my characters.  I do wish that I could get out more and get off my arse and work out at the gym.  Cheers to those of you that have the ability to have a active real life, damn I miss going out and tearing up the town!!!

Played EQ like a junky for almost a year and a half. Then I had some relationship problems(yes, EQ can even be sweeter than a GF...rarely) and once that was over, coming back to EQ as difficult. I started to get very depressed thinking about myself and hundreds of thousands of others hunched over their keyboards in a badly lit room, 6 to 8 hours a _weekday_. So I took some time off. I forsook EQ for almost 4 months. I didnt even bother to log back on to say hi to my guild. I hung out with friends, partied, got a job again, started going back to school ect....<br>Then one day, I logged on, went to Gfay and bought something. Started talking with all the people in my guild again. And it felt really good. <br><br>The moral that worked for me is this. EQ does not = Depression. EQ can intensify the feelings of loneliness ect....but it doesnt create them. You bring those feelings to EQ. Take some time off. Remember what its like to have a real life with flesh and blood people, get busy, and when the time comes, and you want to play again, you find that you enjoy gaming again for its ultimate value, its fun, diverting, and you meet online friends. When EQ is supplementing something that is missing in your life, that is when the depression starts.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucobeeblazesummoner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cobee Blazesummoner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 11:32:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22154.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Depressed?</span><hr size=1> lol, seems like every time someone quits playing EQ they become a preacher.  &quot;EQ IS THE DEBBUL!!!!!11111&quot;<br><br>Well, I have always played games.
