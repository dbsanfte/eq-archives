The first one you want for pvp is paralyzing one.  42 second random duration snare + melee slow.  This will serve you VERY well.<br><br>When you get high enough to afford it start buying pumice (5 charges of nullify magic) to remove any magic based spells that do stick and sow potions so you have more mobility.<br><br><br><br>Besides that a lot of pvp is situational awareness and agressiveness.<br><br>Don't get into fights you absolutely can't win, its a waste of time. This especially means avoiding twinked people, people with too many friends around, people with OOR healers.<br><br>If the fight is close stick with it.<br><br>Be prepared.  Go into a zone expecting to pvp or move through as quickly and quietly as possible. Have whatever poison you want applied beforehand.  The right gear equiped.  The right strategies worked out beforehand.<br><br>Be aware. Know where and what kind of people hang out in a given zone. Eiether avoid areas populated by enemies or rush right in and attack.<br><br>Pvp vs people in the right lvl range.  If you want a fight don't pick it in a zone where people 4-6 lvls higher hang out.  Find an area with people lower than, equal too, or not much higher than you hang out.<br><br>Take the initiative.  Attack first don't get attacked. Pick weaker targets first if multiple possible targets are around.  In other words kill that medding wizard before you try the warrior standing around in full plate.<br><br>Often a rogue is in a position that a prepared enemy will waste him.  So keep them off balance and suprised.  Don't threaten just kill.  Don't accept duels. Blow off people that offer.  Move in kill and then get out. <br><br>If you want an easy pvp class start a sk.
