Do you think that the concept of extremely time consuming key quests abused in the Luclin expansion is a mistake?<br>
<br>
11. Do you think that overabusing of RoF type encounters just to force down the throat wasted time on raids is a horrid concept?<br>
<br>
12. Do you think that boss mobs droping random yard trash items (memory spheres, shissar fangs, etc) taking item slot is damn annoying?<br>
<br>
13. Do you think that making lots of triggered bosses despawn in a short period of time and not respawnin inmediatly cheapens this resource that used to be a flavor of really important bosses (aow) and just makes for another damn time eater?<br>
<br>
14. Do you think that the majority of Luclin bosses dropping just two items when most of the moon loot tables are loaded with garbage is a not fun way of stopping the good items to enter the world?<br>
<br>
15. Do you think that the whole master idea behind Luclin high end game (to increase by a factor of ten the amount of time required to have access to boss encounters / obtain good items) is starting to get right out annoying and makin Luclin a really boring and frustrating expansion?<br>
<br>
16. Do you think that the idea of no rent keys that must be camped each time the guild wants to face an encounter is just another forced time eater that makes guild resort to cheap game abuses to get around it?<br>
<br>
17. Do you wonder why lots of people prefer to do Velious for some straight boss mob killing fun instead of smashing themselves in long boring camps or doing the same encounters again and again (grimling war, seru praesertums -yay seru pathing-, commander farming, etc) bazilion times to get everyone in the guild a key?<br>
<br>
18. Do you cringe at the idea of what kind of an expansion PoP will be if its being designed by people whos main concern is to create time pitholes, forced downtime and bottlenecking spawns? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urolemeggido.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Role Meggido</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/24/02 5:35:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23002.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Semi poll about the future of EQ and the 'changes'</span><hr size=1> 1) The ring should be fixed or removed.

<br>
Back in Vox and Nag days you had about 50 people (pickup raid /grin) guys charging a 32k hp mob. It was a plain zerg attack. If everyone did about 600 damage you would win. It usually ended up in a chaos, but someone usually survived and got the killshot in.<br>
Once they raised the hp cap a chaotic zerg attack was not possible anymore. You definitely need a strategy to kill the Vindicator for example.<br>
With Luclin VI did everything they could to introduce the element of chaos again. DT on maintanks, AE FD, AE charm, multiple lvl 60 adds during the fights, AE blindness .. whatever.<br>
So there is chaos again PLUS mobs have so much hps that they cannot be zerged. This is pushing us to the limits which is not bad in principle. We want such a challenge! On the other side, they surely pushed a bit too far in certain encounters like The Cursed or those rings where you have to fight 8 flurries or CH-mobs at once....<br>
Speaking for myself, I gain more pleasure from a well executed MT-strategy fight like AoW than from dealing with chaos in these rings or at The Cursed.<br>

The new ToV is a joke. Realise that more HP dosen't normally make an encounter harder -- just way more boring.<br>
<br>
Ring of Fire was better before, remove the DT's, increase the difficult a bit.<br>
<br>
Where's the working bazaar and the new interface? Oh wait.. they make a new expansion instead!.. Don't take me wrong, I love to see another expansion, but I'd also love to see the latest expansion to be completed before another..<br>

About VI to test things -- yes, they need to start to realise that they have to test their changes before putting em live.<br>

Do you want NToV back like it was before the 'funny' patch?<br>
<br>
no.  wave battles are hard to tune, I'm sure it will be made reasonable in time<br>
<br>
2. Do you want the Ring of Fire in Acrylia back like it was before?<br>
<br>
no, just no more battlemaster spawns after an hour, no more warmonger spawns after 90 minutes, etc..  better chances of getting higher bosses as you go<br>
<br>
Example:  Our last ring (note LAST) was four hours for two dozen potions, a few mend earrings, and exactly ONE higher boss spawn of an underking<br>
<br>
3. Do you think that perma-rooting mobs makes encounters trivial? Vulak, THO etc.<br>
<br>
Absolutely, our DPS soars through the roof - we killed tunare in 2 1/2 minutes with 45 people guys, that is NUTS<br>
<br>
4. Do you prefer the elements of strategy and personal skill over chaos and random outcomes?<br>
<br>
Loaded question - I prefer encounters feeling different from one another, that's all.<br>
<br>
5. Do you think that the concept of deathtouch is a mistake in principle?<br>
<br>
It seemed okay when it was the province of deities alone.  Now it's just stupid.<br>
<br>
6. Do you want VI to finish Bazaar as promised?<br>
<br>
Woulden't call it a priority, too much content in luclin needs fleshing out.<br>
<br>
7. Do you want VI to introduce the Luclin interface as promised?<br>
<br>
Same as above<br>
<br>
8. Do you want VI to test changes before introducing them to the game?<br>
<br>
Loaded question; as a long term Foh member I've probably done more 'unofficial testing' than nearly anyone so I've gotten a bit used to it.  I think they do a great job given the nature of the game.  The test server can't really do much to test matters of balance or encounter tuning - they are just there to make sure nothing dramatic gets broken.<br>
<br>
9. Do you want VI to concentrate on quality assurance (90%) rather than expanding the game (10%)?<br>
<br>
Depends on what you mean by quality assurance.  If you mean finishing existing content, then absolutely.  Luclin is getting close, though.  VI is departamentalized, different teams are always working on different things.   Cazic thule for example was done by the planes of power team, so that doesen't mean that the luclin live team was pulled off of vex thal etc. <br>
<br>
A lot of the reason why Vex Thal is delayed I believe is that its going to be part of the powering up grounds for Planes of Power.  They don't want to have another VT where the entire loot table of the zone had to be completely redone after nearly the whole place had already been wiped out.<br>

When you were fighting Cazic you were always fearing to be the next one to receive the DT. That was a unique feature which added some thrill to the fight.<br>
Nowadays it is abused to interfere with the main-tank strategy. It is simply a cheap solution to mess things up. On the other side it is unfair to the guys who play maintank as there is no random element to it anymore. You know that you will die a couple of times when fighting Shae Vinitras for sure. It is simply stealing exp from these guys, while other classes go through this fight untouched.<br>
<br>
About Rings: For me the 10th Ringwar in EW was an awesome idea. But it got out of hand now. Look at Vulak. 12 waves and counting so far. There is no end to it. We managed to get through all of this @#%$ and as soon as we were finished just another bunch of @#%$ spawned with flurries whatever. VI is overdoing it. Same with Acrylia RoF. 5th boss was a nice encounter imo. Even if you stepped out of the ring it was a good fight. Going further and trying to spawn the 6th boss was a real challenge and only the best could do it. So a minor tweak of shifting the loot by just one boss = robe/earring -&gt; 5th, FT orb etc. -&gt; 6th would have done the trick. The difficulty would have been in line with the risk.<br>
Every ring with a rapid spawn and healer mobs is flawed. If stuff can heal each other while the other stuff is due will end up beeing impossible. Besides that, as I said before...EQ is NOT an arcade game like Galagar or Space Hunter. Waves are cool, but not on every @#%$ encounter.<br>
<br>
About Tunare: It tooks us a week to figure out how to pull her with the zone fully spawned. It took us a couple of days to figure out how to kill her. It took us a while to master these techniques into a three hour operation. That included taking many MANY deaths and burning a lot of midnight oil. It was a triumph of imagination and out of the box thinking and suddenly we have to clear the whole plane again? I understood it as a challenge to overcome obstacles and cut the gordian knot. But VI thinks otherwise. They force us to do it their way...and their way is boring from an intellectual standpoint at least. Pure hack&amp;slash is not why we play EQ.<br>
<br>
About testing I say one name: V'whatever the Cursed! Or should I say,'' ....?<br>
<br>
About Bazaar/Interface: -&gt; false advertisement! Ok, DAoC was out and Luclin had to be rushed to stop the customers from leaving. Why do you think serverscan does not display numbers anymore? It was a shock to VI. Still if they sell us a product that is supposed to include certain features I want to see them. I don't go to BK and pay for a Whopper to receive a piece of bread, an onion and warm handshake. Another example would be to go to KFC and receive a frozen chicken. Then they tell you &quot;Sorry, the Colonel is in his backyard working on the receipe. He should be finished soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
About Vulak: We have worked our ass off to get to the stage to be able to kill him. My guild has killed him like 10 times (Antonius Bayle = new server), so we have proven ourselves to be ToV-capable and suddenly we do not deserve him anymore? What about the folks who were just about ready for ToV? They came too late? Ok, some came to late for a manastone, rubicite, a cryosilk robe or even the Sleeper. But Vulak? This is a bit too much imo. You should not take away something that has been in the game for over a year. THE real problem was not Vulak. It was Vyemm. Ever since they made him slowable with disease slow he was gimpified. The correct step would have been to make him unslowable and everything is in order again. I am not talking about the 'sploit' to pull Vulak with other dragons up. There are other ways to fix this. Certainly not by rooting Vyemm though...<br>
<br>
There are countless other examples, but I think you got the idea. Minor changes would have been sufficient to solve every problem. They cured the patient by cutting off his head. That is not the correct way to do it.<br>

Why? With the implementation of the new chat channels- brell has instituted a channel called auction. Hasnt replaced EC yet as the KMart of EQ, and not sure it will. But the Auction channel means anyone in Norrath can buy and sell.&quot;<br>
<br>
The auction channel is nice if you like making long trips to sell an item,and if you have good faction everywhere.I would prefer an EC/Bazaar solution,since all of the buying and selling takes place in the same zone. Ec's auctions will probably never disappear---it's a staple of EQ commerce,and it's old world,so everyone can use it. <br>
