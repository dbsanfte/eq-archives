To the roleplayers, to the small guild leaders, to those that are still proud of their first Solesk Ro armor.<br><br>This is the game we play. We log in when we get a chance, maybe hoping for one bubble into 32, maybe to get that last spell that requires us to run to Qeynos. This is the game we still have fond memories of. The game that still delights us only because of the content lovingly poored in. This is the game where we remember what it was to first get a short sword of ykesha, when level 20 was such an achivement. This is the game we've played forever, for the people more than anyone else, this is the game we play.<br><br>And it's being laughed at.<br><br>Our nights, our escape, in between letting the dog out and putting supper on, this is our game, our lives at times, because we love the escape. Our roleplays, our desires...<br><br>Yes, they are laughed at.<br><br>They are dashed against the rocks of envy, those green harbringers of hatred and discord, the pillers of what we fear most, by those that do more faster, those that one up us constantly, those we pretend to look up to.<br><br>They are laughing at us.<br><br>We muzzle our envy.<br>We make nice sounds like 'oooo'<br>and 'ahhh'.<br><br>We lie. We are rotten to the core, spoilt by our green green envy, wrecked upon those rocks as we see our fun diminished, fleeting, sorrow on wings, away.<br><br>This is to us, to all those that are still playing a game.<br><br>This is to us, because they... they are not.<br><br>They have grown, they have matured, they say... you can listen to them speak of it as they speak of thier guilds and their achievements. They have learned what we have not, they have... <br><br>Progressed.<br>Evolved.<br><br>We on the other hand are merely content... we play at our pace, love and laugh and live at our own tempo, and yet, by the definition of things that are... we are not good enough.<br><br>Enough.<br><br>This is for anyone that has had a dream that doesn't end with new items.<br><br>This is for anyone that still thinks level 30 is a massive achivement.<br><br>This is not...<br><br>This is not for anyone else. To steal and maim a line, I have seen the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by the advancement of levels. I have seen friends betray, real emotion lost, and love... <br><br>This is not for you after you've reached those goals. After tonight, I no longer talk to the... top. You want to deal with me, you come down to my level.<br><br>This is my game too... you've stopped playing it.<br><br>Yet you still try to tell me how to play the game I love.<br><br>Enough.<br><br>And you, to those that matter still... to those still with dreams and passions, I urge you... rise...<br><br>Not up. Be yourselves... do not envy, do not desire. That is what they want.
