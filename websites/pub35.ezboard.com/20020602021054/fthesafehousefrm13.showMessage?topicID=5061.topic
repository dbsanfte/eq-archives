Unfortunately, the search results did not give me a whole lot of leads. Sooooo, I'm asking for some advice from my fellow rogues.<br><br>What advice do you have for pickpocketing Tani in Neriak?  <br><br>This is what I have gained so far:<br><br>(1)  I know the spawn/despawn times of him (I believe).<br><br>(2)  Somebody suggested giving him a trivial item, so you know when you have picked him clean so to speak.<br><br>(3)  Another person talked about *pulling him to the zone*.  What is the best way to do this?  I do have a necro available to do this.<br><br>(4)  Finally, some rogue in my guild mentioned pickpocketing him &quot;from the roof.&quot;  Does anyone what he was referring to?  I targeted him and went outside and got on the roof of the guild, but I was too far away to pickpocket.<br><br>Any pearls of wisdom you would be willing to share would be greatly appreciated.  The main thing I want to avoid is a bunch of unnecessary deaths if possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usithen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sithen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 1:12:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5061.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue epic:  Request for advice.</span><hr size=1> The roof and pulling him to zone tricks are both considered exploits, and generally cheap by a large portion of the rogue community, not telling you how to live your life, just wanted to let you know.  But the spawn/despawn time on Tani doesn't do him justice, he actually despawns and respawns in a cycle for 3 spawns and any of them could have the parchment on them...  That's when I got it, and that's the way I would suggest everyone do it.  Don't frustrate yourself standing around waiting for the next spawn, you'll just end up thinking, well maybe I'll pick his pocket one more time, LOADING PLEASE WAIT...  <br><br>The perfect method is (according to me anyway), get an SoE and camp your rogue at the zone, just before spawn cycle log your rogue and run him to Tani, if he's camped go play on a PVP server for a while, it's more fun getting whacked on a level 1 character by rats, if not try the respawn cycle until you get the parchment or you are satisfied he doesn't have it and return to your PVP gnomey rogue as the warders are dead on my server too.<br><br>Meff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uilnati.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ilnati</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 1:18:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5061.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue epic:  Request for advice.</span><hr size=1> So, if you pickpocket and DO NOT get anything, is that the time to call it quits (i.e., log for a bit)?

If I'm remembering correctly it was around 7-9pm gametime and it would be VERY hard to retarget him and get to roof and pick more than maybe once before you had to go down and retarget him again. Standing right there I only got a few tries before his next spawn popped in.<br><br>I think I got killed once at 49th PPing him.

That's a tough one to answer, I tend to be the type to make stupid decisions in game when no one else is depending on me, so I'm likely not the best person to ask.  For anyone other than me I'd say after the last respawn keep picking for about 3-5 minutes straight, after that you are pushing your luck.  I got lucky and picked Tani on the first respawn cycle when I got it so I couldn't tell you.  On Founy on the other hand, why not just keep picking 'til he gets mad and tries to kill you, the zone is a hop, skip and a jump away anyhow.  <br><br>Since in retrospect I found this kind of funny I'll give you an idea of my intelligent ideas when no one is depending on me...  On Founy, I had several sessions of PocketPicking on several different nights and he just wouldn't give me the parchment, one of the times I logged on to try it I was just a tiny little bit intoxicated, so I developped this theory that the jerkey little dorf had give it to someone else.  I picked everyone in the area clean, guards included, while waiting for him to despawn after a couple of hours (game time) just picking him, sure I had to zone a couple of times, but it added spice to my beer induced insanity.<br><br>Meff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=5061.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5061.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=5061.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=5061.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5061.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5061.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
