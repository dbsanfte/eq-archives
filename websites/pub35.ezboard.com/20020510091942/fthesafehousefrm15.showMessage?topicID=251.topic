It's simply the fact that were the center of controversy.  We get petitioned on a daily basis for PKing.  I mean the very basic idea of our server.<br><br>None of us XP kill for fun nor go to ninja loot.  Heck we get better equipment on ddaily runs then most the rest of the server gets on their major runs.  But since were going against the grain we get put under the magnifying glass.  Also remember most of our members are power gamers so their time online is more then most people's so their names hold stronger merit.<br><br>The quality of player and trustworthyness of my guild is much more then any other guilds I have bene in.  I think we've only had internal issues with 2 of our members in our entire career.<br><br>Despite all this though, we shouldn't be unfairly treated just cause he are members of a guild that is against the grain of most the server.  We have just as much right to play as everyone else.  The main GMs on the most part are able to handle themselves perfassionally but it's the guides that are on a power trip.<br><br><br>On a recent raid we had a piece of armor that was fairly nice drop for us in the middle of the battle.  So then this level 2 gnome jumps down and loots it while were fighting.  We petition and the response from the guide was as follows.<br><br>&quot;It was your fault for leaving the loot on the corpse&quot;<br><br>The gnome then trained us twice trying to retrieve his corpse causing near wipeouts of our guild.  The GM then assists him in retrieving his corpse, lets him keep the loot, transport him out of the zone (there was no way out for him other then GM help) and gives him a simple warning.<br><br>Now what is with this particular situation?  Why is some level 2 gnome allowed to ninja loot, train repetedly, and cause almost 2 hours of delay on a raid and allowed to get a slap on the wrist less then if he had used a word that would be filtered on this board?  He also gets a piece of armor that a main tank in our guild would have used at level 55.<br><br>Guides need to be filtered better on Tallon Zek.  I'd rather the guide have stayed out of it cause in 5 minutes, that gnomes efforts would have been for naught.  They also act as if they are enforcing a set of rules oficial by verant yet they aren't suposed to be doing anything of the kind.<br><br>Just pisses me off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udarkennvelgarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkenn Velgarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://home.earthlink.net/~rosebug67/_uimages/Innoruuk03.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/14/01 11:53:48 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://d.velgarn.tripod.com/brapier.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PvP server GMs and guides</span><hr size=1> <br>Not on pvp, but damn, that really sucks....

They are volunteering their time, in order to improve others gaming experience.  Can't ask for better motivation than that, even if you don't agree with them.<br><br>If the entire guide staff of Tallon is truly biased against your guild, I think that your best bet is to try to understand why and rectify the situation.  They have a lot of latitude to make judgement calls, and observation tools to inform those judgements.  <br><br>In my experience, treating the gm/guide staff, and other players with respect, generally evokes a reciprocal response.  Again, I'm speaking of life on Vallon, but its a good principle in general.  <br><br> <p><font size=5 color="gray"><b>Wotan</b><font size=3> Shaman Elder of the <a href="http://www.talonguard.org/shanks"><font color="red">Shanks</font></a> <br><font size=2><b><i>It is better to have less thunder in the mouth and more lightning in the hand.  - Apache Proverb</font></font></font></i></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umadelinetz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Madeline TZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/01 9:46:30 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.socal.rr.com/kayden/personalpiccolor.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PvP server GMs and guides</span><hr size=1> The thing about Pandemonium (my guild) is that we PK... we PK every body.  So everyone gets pissed.  But it's suposed to be a PvP server!<br><br>Most guides get fed up with the number of ameatless acusations against our guild and think there is some truth to them but can not do anything about it.  The GMs have the tools to check out the real truth and remian unbiased in decisions but the guides when they do take action, they take it to extreme levels.<br><br>It's like they try to make up for all those times they couldn't do anything about all the acusations because of the rules but are making up for it by making things as inconvenient as possible when they get involved with us.<br><br>There is a definate difference in treatment.  I have a farily high level twink not guilded with Pandemonium yet.  She looses a corpse cause of a bug in sol b.  guide summons it to the zone for her.<br><br>I lose my corpse in the lava cause of the same bug.  The same guide confirms it is in the lava but says she can not summon the corpse cause it's not within her power and I have to get it myself.  Now I knew exactly where my corpse was, cause it ends up there every time this particular bug happens.  But I couldn't get it myself cause well all my Fire resist gear is on my corpse and I would get killed.<br><br>I ended up borrowing my friends character and jumping in the lava to get my own corpse.  Now I have no wanrings agains tmy account.  I'm probably one of the more respected memebers of my guild.  Yet still I recieve lax treaatment cause of my tag.<br><br><br>I just wish they'd pick guides that understand the PvP server situation a little better.  I think most guides never play seriously on a PvP server so they do not know how to handle the constant flaming that happens daily.  I find the better guides are the ones that don't make judgement calls at all and just run around assisting with known bugs and leave the judgement calls to the GMs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthisle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thisle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/19/01 3:29:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PvP server GMs and guides</span><hr size=1> Its no use arguing with Mad.

It should end soon with the hardcoding of pvp though.  Sure they will still go on raids but wont really group.  No longer can they use that human cleric to heal the darkies while fighting humans.

Maybe a different one of our GMs.  Jayda at least handles things professionally but simply there needs to be a iron set rule set for GMs on PvP.<br><br>And our guides need to be shot, rarely are they really helpful.
