<br>
Hey folks, question to those more well-versed in the field of PDA's than I am...<br>
<br>
I'm heading off to university in a few months, meaning I need a new computer setup. I need both mobility (taking it to lectures, etc) and power (gaming...), so the options are either a powerful laptop, or a tower + PDA. Leaning towards the second option due to the costliness of a good gaming laptop.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm really asking for is some overall advice as to what system I should invest in (the only PDA I've ever owned was a Newton MessagePad 130, years ago).<br>
<br>
My criteria are basically:<br>
<br>
-Easy, reliable and fast data entry<br>
-A good software selection<br>
-Ability to compile C/C++<br>
-Good price<br>
<br>
Additionally, other considerations include good battery life, mp3 player, colour screen, etc.<br>
<br>
From the limited research I've done, I'm leaning towards the <a href="http://www.myzaurus.com/">Sharp Zaurus</a>, as it offers a built-in mini keyboard in addition to a stylus, and runs linux (therefore taking care of &quot;ability to compile c/c++&quot; through gcc if I'm not mistaken). Additionally, it can connect to linux desktop systems, which is likely what I'll be using.<br>
<br>
Is there any big reason why I should go with a Palm / MS operating system instead? Any important considerations I've missed?<br>
<br>
Also, any other PDAs which run on open source OS's?<br>
<br>
Any pointers would be appreciated :)<br>
<br>
EDIT: Another factor is HD space... that's a con for the Zaurus, only has 64 megs I think. Also, availability / cost of memory extension cards, that kinda thing. Oh, and to the mod that had to move the thread from logged out, sorry about that, should've posted here in the first place. <p><img src=http://members.chello.at/daveman/nenlogo1.gif></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unenneth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nenneth</A> at: 7/19/02 8:51:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrelkor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brelkor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 8:44:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PDA Advice (especially Sharp Zaurus)</span><hr size=1> I bought a Toshiba e310, and i love the thing.  The sharp is a good product, but will lack in the gaming area.  If you enjoy old NES and GB and GBA games, you want a Pocket PC platform because there is a very good emulator for them, and you can run the games from a memory card.  Like a ton of games go on  64 meg card.  <br>
<br>
About the compiler thing, I'm not really sure of the use of a compiler on the pda itself except to use the pre-compiler to check errors.  Most PDA's have external developement environments to develope pograms for them.  I can write code on my PocketPC and then put it on whatever comp i want, or use it to transport code/documents.  A compiler is a big program and i bet you'll have problems fitting gcc/g++ on the zarus, but don't quote me on that.  cc will probly fit easier<br>
<br>
For me in college a laptop would be good because I always had my backpack with 3 or 4 notebooks/textbooks in it already, but then i couldn't afford that stuff back then.<br>
<br>
edit: yah all the libraries for the ARM and stuff are well over 30 megs compressed. <p><b>Brelkor the Blackhammer</b> The Masta Back Stabba, retired rogue<br>

<br>
And yeah, the compiler would be used mainly for checking warnings / errors. And it doesn't have to be gcc, any c/c++ compiler would be nice.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the reply though... I'm still considering. Any other opinions? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.showPrevMessage?topicID=23.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.showNextMessage?topicID=23.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=2><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.emailToFriend?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.threadControl?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28>Safehouse Workshop</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
