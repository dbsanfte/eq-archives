I have been hacked, lost my stuff and and the person playing as me trained Seekers, one of Druzz ro's best guilds, in the Plane of Fear several times. I lost all EXP in my level, and my equip that i worked so hard for, and they also cussed out a few GMS. Somehow I was NOT ban on the spot for doing that, and managed to get on the next day and see what happened. I petitioned and got it all worked out with the GMs. I got a complete restore and had alot of money on me from where the person who hacked me sold all my stuff. This i gave away in oasis in big contest. as for my gear on my char, Im not sure what Ill do with that...<br>
 <br>
 Ive been a safehouser for a LONG time, just quiet like I said. I started out on Fen ro met some great friends, Darlantan, Sidey, Woodash,Tegolwen, Yarg,Hadeshorn, Hyarth...these rogues kept me goin as a rogue, always giving me something to look forward to, heck Sidey gave me my first SBD. I met other friends, non rogues. Fen ro treated me well. Then i had the urge to move, meet new people..to Druzzil ro in the server split. I met more people, some from Fen ro as well, Like Dlgoth, Rohaisa(sorry if i got that wrong Roh) again im naming rogues, cause I know theyll read this. I also made some enemies, but who doesnt. <br>
<br>
   I know that Seekers were not fond of me what so ever, and vise versa, but i wanted to say that I WOULD never go to that extreme agaisnt your guys, NEVER. To  Vilrotti and Shik, though we may not have liked one another much, I respect you both as Rogues and Im sure your very cool people in Real life. Good luck on gettin 60 Vil, and grats on to you again Shik on 60. I will be rooting for your both in the best of the best tourney. <br>
<br>
   Im sure some people are asking &quot;Why quit? you got your stuff back&quot; Well......try as I might I cant convince the whole server it wasnt me doing all that, so I cant even get a group these days.<br>
<br>
   Well, again I thank all my  rogue friends...<br>
<br>
  Dlgoth, Woodash, Hyarth, Darlantan, Yarg, Hadeshorn, Dake, Sidey, Fykkil, Rohaisa(spell check), Tegolwen. I do aplogzie if I forgot you =(   and most of all               THANK U SAFEHOUSE: without a doubt best site on the net.<br>

<br>
Reason I say this , Yes I know we Rogues don't like to seeing Twinked character, but What the heck you know how play a Rogue and Have proven it.  So why now in a few weeks come back and make a new Rogue have a very trusted freind hand you your stuff to the new Rogue and start fresh.  Yes once agan I know we don't like Twinking, but it would help you to level up faster.<br>
<br>
I know this is not the same, put this way you have a chance to still be with your friends and rebuild your Status.<br>

I never really said much on these boards, but trust me, I was here on a daily basis. It's been fun.<br>
