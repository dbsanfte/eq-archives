Me, Noggel (Frostfire), and our guild raid of 40 or so went down to the temple. This is what we found out:<br>
<br>
A: The Eighth Seal. It identifies as &quot;Will return the Exiled.&quot;  It dropped off of a shissar that was NOT a taskmaster. We can't remember his name, however. He spawns on the third floor of the palace in the basement, above the Prime Educator and Arch Torturer. The passage up to the third floor of the basement palace is sealed by a locked coffin that can't be picked by a rogue. We managed to pull him with Eye of Zomm and also by gravity fluxing to the third floor. Of note is the fact that questionably exploitable spells like Gravity Flux or Eye of Zomm have never before been required to complete a quest- is there a different key?<br>
<br>
B: Rhag'xxxx Spawn Order. Another interesting thing we found was a spawn sequence. In one of the first floor rooms is a named shissar Rhag`Zhezum. He flurries very fast, and is rooted like yelinak. I think he hits for around 400... when he died, in addition to dropping a ton of spells, he caused five new shissar to spawn. All of them have names that start with &quot;Rhag`&quot;, so it's something like a title. Well, we worked our way up and killed them all... 4 of them were guards and the remaining one was similar to the first Rhag`, except he rampages instead of flurries. He died too, and we got even more spells, and Arch Lich Rhag`Somethingorother spawned elsewhere in the zone. We couldn't find him to kill him. We searched the entire dungeon that we could open, including what we needed a rogue to open.<br>
<br>
C: Combinations. We've tried various combinations with all 8 seals in the taskmaster's pouch. NOTHING works. We even tried combining the seals in a forge- that doesn't work either. We think there might be another combine box for the seals, and that the Taskmaster's Pouch is only used for combining the Insignia, Ring, and Idol, as Elder Ganoxx tells us to.<br>
<br>
D: Locked Doors. I know this is a longshot, but there are doors scattered around the temple which are locked and not pickable. We know of four at the moment that we can reach (with a rogue along)... including the one in basement we bypass with Gravity Flux. Has anyone figured out a way to open them yet? It would be helpful to &quot;legitimately&quot; get the 8th seal, so this cast some doubt on our beliefs about the doors. We've trying using the seals and the idol on some doors- this doesn't work.<br>
<br>
E: Elder Tidbits. The Elder asks if we are the crusaders of prophecy, rumored to come out of the mist, sent by their lord. When you tell him you are, he offers to let you know about the Secret of the Key. The exact text has been posted above but I won't get into it here. We know how to get the Idol (drops from a Commander who shares his name with the Idol), we havn't found the Ring yet, and we havn't found the Insignia. We *assume* that the seals somehow lead to the Insignia, since he does say it's a pain to get- and collecting seals is much more of a pain than killing an uncommon spawn. A question for lore gurus- when the Shissar left Kunark, who was the ruler of the Iksar? Also, what Iksar prophecies involve the (green?) mist? Possibly the container we need for the seals comes from the Iksar.<br>
<br>
F: The Rock. While wandering around aimlessly looking for a clue, we stumbled on a suspicious looking rock in the mine area of the basement. if you wait around long enough by it, an emote shows up that says something like &quot;You feel a breeze coming out of the wall by you&quot;.... sure enough, there is a rock in the wall, and it looks pretty shady. If you click on the rock, it ends up turning you around and dropping you a tiny bit back in front of it. I  really don't know what to make of this. You can see through the wall behind the rock and the mines do continue, but with no way to open it...? Our guild ran around the mines for a few minutes and couldn't find any trigger of some sorts to open it that way... it seems sort of like a bug. Maybe verant didn't have time to make the end content of the zone right, so they cut off the zone from that point? It seems kind of odd for a rock to just turn you around and plop you down. Then again, maybe we just didn't find the trigger or something.<br>
<br>
G: Unitemized Nameds. The Taskmaster Zhe'Vozh, the Prime Educator, the Arch Torturer, the Disciple xxxxx (Can't remember his name), the Shissar Assassin- all dropped nothing for us. Are these simply not itemized, or do they have rare drop quest pieces?<br>
<br>

You say, 'Hail, Elder Glanoxx'<br>
Elder Glanoxx looks like he's been sick for some time.  He looks at you for a moment and motions for something to drink. <br>
(Pop him something to drink)<br>
Elder Glanoxx says 'Are you here for them... are you here to release us? <br>
You say, 'I am here to release you'<br>
Elder Glanoxx says 'The ones that keep us here... the ones who defy the gods.  They must be destroyed.  I cannot recall a time outside of this place, but I believe the stories.  I trust that we are from somewhere else.  These creatures claim to be gods.  They claim to have created us from the filth of the mines.  This cannot be.  I have seen the face of our true @#%$.  He told me of their blasphemy.  He came to me and handed me the knowledge of how to reach their Emperor.  He taught me to resist the prying magic of the fanatics.  Are you the crusaders of prophecy... the ones who walk in the mist? <br>
You say, 'We are the crusaders of prophecy'<br>
Elder Glanoxx says 'Then take my knowledge... the knowledge of our lord.  I will not last much longer.  This sickness will kill me like the others.  I will tell you the secret of the key. <br>
You say, 'What secret of the key?'<br>
Elder Glanoxx says 'There is a pouch to be found.  It was specially made and requires three separate components to function.  Seek out the Idol of Zazuzh and the Ring of Zeruzsh.   These items are kept by the Emperor's must loyal Taskmasters.  Place with them the Ssreashzian Insignia.  This item will be much harder to acquire.  I am sure you will be successful... our lord walks with you.  Please be swift. <br>
<br>
And has anyone attempted combining these thingies off the taskmasters with other items from the zone? <br>
<br>
Also of note, Verant took the zone down for an &quot;update&quot;.  This could have itemized a previously empty area *cough* or fixed a key part of the quest.<br>

When you zone in it appears to be a dead end, but if you click on the wall (just happens to be the opposite side of this rock) it pops you into that room in the mines.  So it's techincally a one way, backdoor entrance into the temple, and since the entire rock is the trigger, if you click on the front of it (in the mines) or the back of it (on the side with the zone to The Deep) it ports you to the same spot, in that room in the mines.<br>
