The mobs are placed exactly the same in each house: 2 on the 3rd floor, and about 7 or 8 near the Praetorian's chambers (1 on each teleporter). Eye, Heart, Shoulder: all level 60. Eye contains Ranger NPCs, Heart is Enchanter and Paladin, Shoulder is Mage (pretty sure) and something else, Hand is level 66 Warriors and Paladins, who can Enrage. They hit fast for about 180's, and their high level makes them hard to chant. Having Tash and a Shaman help <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> a lot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br><br>One of the mobs right inside Eye house is level 62 and sees through invis. There are also multiple class Guild Leaders in each house - they HURT, beware..<br><br>Hope this info helps. I strongly suggest you mess around with the zone and learn it's pathing. There's a lot of glitches that can either save your ass, or get you dead (hi stacking mobs near Praetorian's chambers).. stacking mobs is cause by running into a side room while aggro on a certain floor, or clicking in and out of the Praetorian's chambers. Take a few days and mess around with a monk (if you have access to one) or a rogue, get to know the zone well, it will be your home for a few weeks, maybe months.
