I had run through the Karana Plains on my way to see just how much the people of Qeynos hated me, and felt the tickling in the back of my throat...some strange allergy to all the griffons around, perhaps, I thought.  The farmers glared at me when I ran by, so I gave them a wide berth.  It seemed decently normal from the river's edge, though a little...green.  I figured it to be verdancy from the rain.<br>
<br>
By the time I returned, I had fairly exhausted Blackburrow and had my scars and my skins, and a nice lariat even though I couldn't control it yet.  I could kill elite gnolls while drunk and not have problems, so I'd thought it was time to move on.  The bugs I'd seen while running along the river....those, I thought, might be something to practice on with my whip.  The guards actually smiled at me when I stopped by the great stone bridge, and I couldn't help returning it; human or not, they still seemed to indicate I'd have some success.<br>
<br>
I chose the tower out in the plainsland as my hunting ground; its height afforded me a view of the surroundings so that I could see those griffons before they saw me.  After paying my respects to the local gypsies (which mostly involved handing them money behind their backs so they could say they'd never traded with me), I stepped out into the grassland.<br>
<br>
I should be sharper than this mentally, I suppose; I'm an elf, with presumably all the smarts of my race, but it would be lying to say I usually have a clue.  The tickle I thought was an allergy became a cough, or a chill; more than once, I completely wiffed a backstab on one of those mindless, plodding bugs due to a sudden sneeze.  It was the damp, I thought....but I'd been in swamps and had no problems.  It was the griffins!  But I'd never had allergies in the Commonlands.  Maybe some pollen or something from those treants.  The guards shifted nervously when I commented on the greenish air, and looked at each other significantly, but they were closemouthed.<br>
<br>
It wasn't long before I started getting the point, though.  Actually, I didn't get it, it got me.<br>
<br>
I was lounging in the shadows of the tower, half-asleep as I waited for blood to clot and mandible-cuts to stop aching, when there came a faint human cry from outside.  The guards murmured something and fiddled with their swords.  I poked my head out and listened again...  Off behind the tower and down the hill, it sounded like one of the farmers was screaming, something about a curse and swarms.  Apocalyptic fellow, I thought, and snorted, and ducked back into the tower to continue my nap.<br>
<br>
About a minute later, the guards exclaimed in panic and hustled into the rear of the tower.  I blinked my eyes open; the pair of them, who I'd seen take down huge griffons and even dare to contend with giants, were crammed as far away from the door as they could get.  I stuck my head out of the tower again, curious by now.  It was getting darker, but surely trained Qeynos militiamen weren't afraid of the dark, or the tripe that farmer had been shouting.  There was some movement coming down the road from the west, toward the gypsy camp, and I squinted to make it out.  Bugs.  It looked like a bunch of little bugs.  The guards were afraid of bugs?  I looked back; the pair were still quailing in the corner.<br>
<br>
It seemed like the bugs were going to follow the road, so I slid my way down the rain-slick hill and took up a spot nearby, to take a look at this.  The days had been full of beetles and griffs; anything unusual was interesting.  I muffled a few coughs in my sleeve and wished for a decent cleric around.<br>
<br>
A few glimmering carapaces crested the edge of the hill and I thought, they're afraid of this?  But then there were more.  And more.  They spread across the grass like dark fingers, a rustling and chittering blanket of insects.  I backed up to a tree and pulled myself onto the first branch, entranced.  I'd seen bugs swarm before, of course, but this...it was almost unimaginable.<br>
<br>
Then another movement on the hill caught my eye, and I was suddenly glad I was not up there.  A bug, a monstrous insect the width of the tower and the length of a pair of kodiaks nose-to-tail, had come over the rise; around her, the swarm gathered like royal robes.  Little insects were racing in and out of the tower; the guards must have gone up to the top, or else they were already dead.  Either way, they weren't fighting.  The plainsland, which had been speckled here and there with other adventurers, was clearing out at an alarming rate.  The swarm scurried down the road, and I could see the grass disappear in their wake.<br>
<br>
There were too many of them to fit the road; the queen mother, indeed, was wider than that small dirt strip.  I climbed higher, trying to hide in the darkness of the leaves as they scraped by the tree and tore away bark in long strips.  They were tumbled all over each other, skittering on each other's shells until it looked like the whole earth was moving beneath me.  The queen mother brushed against the tree with a great grind of chitin against wood, and I felt it shiver through every branch and bone.  I could have lowered my feet just a bit and set them on the mother's shell; if I hadn't figured she would bite my legs off at the knee for it, I might have.<br>
<br>
A warcry snapped my attention up from the swarm beneath me.  There, on a ridge just out of range of the bugs, was a barbarian in just a kilt, raising his fists in challenge.  I gaped.  I always new barbarians were insane, but really...  The swarm definitely took note of him, though.  As one, it surged forward, with the huge form of the mother pushing its way to the front.  With another gesture of defiance, the barbarian turned and bolted.  The entire swarm followed.<br>
<br>
I stared.  I climbed higher to try to watch him go, but he vanished behind a hill; a few small streams of bugs apparently lost interest and drifted away from the main group to attack some of the gawking adventurers.  I was sure I'd seen the last of him, when he appeared again over the hill he'd first crested, and ran up the road, still trailed by about fifty bugs and the queen.  Still stark naked but for that kilt.  I started laughing so hard I nearly fell out of the tree, especially when he looped around once again and headed toward the stone bridge, losing small bugs in pairs and threes.  I don't know what happened to him after that; I jumped down from the tree once I could control my amusement, and watched the others clean up the babies.  I kept an eye out all the rest of that night, though, and resolved to pay more attention if the farmer got hysterical again.<br>
<br>
My supposed allergies were becoming a bit of a pain; there was the rash that made my shoulders itch like someone was staring, and the ripples of blurry vision, and of course the sneezes that made backstabbing something a bit tricky.  The air, too, was wrong even to my untrained senses by now, and the rain left a thin film of contamination on my armor.  Hanging out behind the tower and trying to recuperate from a run-in with a young griffin, I happened upon a barbarian, a shaman, doing the same.  After a few comments on the bad weather, we decided to work together a bit.<br>
<br>
It was then that I learned of the third part of the curse...something I would hear in full from a farmer later.  The wildlife had tended to ignore me throughout my prior hunts, but my partner was no so lucky.  A grizzly jumped him while I was wiping beetle ichor from my dirk, and it whirled on me when I hurried to his aid.  The smell of the thing was awful, like rotting meat, and when it roared its maw and tongue were flecked with white foam.  It fought like a mad thing, too, and managed to clamp its teeth onto my whip arm while I was opening its jugular with my blade.  I thought it was fine at first--it didn't hurt any more than normal, I could flex my fingers and everything--but after the shaman and I had sat to rest for a bit it started to ache.  I peeled off the bracer to take a look at it, and to my surprise it hadn't healed a bit.  It was oozing a little, festering.  The last time I'd seen that was fighting undead in the desert, and I was more than a bit concerned and glad for my healer partner.  With a bit of salve and some magic, it seemed all better.  The experience made me nervous, though.<br>
<br>
I started looking around.  More and more, I spotted the white foam and the manic gleam in the eyes of beasts, even the griffons.  The druids I encountered, both the locals and the adventuring types, all seemed traumatized in some way; there was a horror to the set of their faces when they looked around, and a grimness I hadn't even seen in the halflings in Nektulos.  The next time the farmer cried out, I caught the name Bertoxxulous and felt a chill inside.<br>
<br>
That time, I was not so lucky as to have the shelter of a tree.  I was barely out of the tower when the slope was suddenly flooded with swarmlings, and riding their crest was the mother, with mandibles as sharp and gleaming as any spectre's scythe.  I stopped in shock, and then she was on me.  One bite should have cut me in half, but Bristlebane must have been too amused by me right then because she just gave me a glancing blow and body-checked me into the tower wall, then stampeded off to try to kill someone else.  I'm not ashamed to say that I bolted as soon as I regained my senses; I had no desire to become dark elf cutlets any time soon.<br>
<br>
The swarmlings left their trail of devastation to the stone bridge once more; off across the hills, I could see jagged lightning streaking down from the murky sky as some magic-user battled the queen.  As I reached the spires and relative safety I saw an arm of the swarm had broken off and was swirling around a short, desperate figure.  Looked like a dwarf, and a paladin to boot.  I was sorely tempted to just lean against one of the spires and watch the show, or maybe move up behind her for a little bit of racial revenge, but...  There but for the blessing of the Bristlebane went I.  So I waded in.  My leg armor got scratched up a bit, but the little ones were not much of a threat without their mother.  Vicious, though.  When it was over, the paladin and I stared at each other for about a minute; my blade and whip did not leave my hands, nor did she let down her axe.  Finally, she gave a curt bow and turned away.  More than I'd expected to get, I'll say that much.  I went back to my roost at the tower feeling gory and extremely lucky.<br>
<br>
Since then, things have been a little strange.  I hunt around the tower, and every now and then I spot some great beast and find myself warning the others, like it wouldn't be perfectly reasonable for them to die if they didn't notice it themselves.  I actually threw a knife at a young griffin mauling a pair of gnomes; the guards finished it for me, but not before I'd taken a few knocks.  There are folk in my guild who worship the Lord of Storms, and they talk often of revenge on Bertoxxulous and his minions for this corruption.  I'd never volunteer, but I almost think I'd agree to help if I were asked.<br>
<br>
Maybe there's a fourth part of this curse.  Something about a social conscience.  Damn them, all I wanted to do was steal things and make money.<br>
<br>
Next thing you know, I'll be a regular treehugger....<br>
