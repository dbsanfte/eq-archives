First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<br>
<br>
Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<br>
<br>
All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<br>
<br>
I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input so far.<br>
<br>
Alan<hr>Rogues:<br>
<br>
ITEM: Evade.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Evade was broken when the size of the hate list was expanded for NPCs. It has to be fixed this in such a way that there won't be too much of a change from the way that Evade worked prior to the hate list change. This will, however, 'nerf' the skill a bit compared to how it works now.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Damage Shields and missiles.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Thrown weapons will cause a damage shield to damage the thrower. This seems wrong from a constancy standpoint, especially since damage shields do not cause damage to an archer in this fashion.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Locked Chests.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if locked chests were introduced into the game. Making them static would, obviously, be pretty silly. But they could drop off NPCs.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Report Backstab messages to the group.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It seems like this might be able to boost morale and allow the rogue to be even more impressed with his own skills.  If this is added, though, it would be good to also add a filter for it to reduce spam.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Sneak and Hide functionality.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Hide is cancelled when you loot, shop or trade. But the buttons don't 'ungray', and you don't get a message that tells you that you've stopped hiding. Perhaps this could be changed. And perhaps sneak could break in the same fashion, since sneak currently does not break in these circumstances. Perhaps consistency here would be good.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Haste for missile weapons.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: How about allowing haste to affect the speed at which weapons are thrown or bows are fired?<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Illusion Masks.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: The illusions can't be clicked off by the wearer. Is this intentional?<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Hide/sneak overwriting invisibility.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: As it is now, when any invisibility spell (including invisibility to undead and bard songs) wears off, a hidden rogue will become visible. The wearing off of the invisibility spell also takes out the rogues hide invisibility. Is this as it was intended?<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Increased Safefall.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: How about increasing the safefall skill cap. Not enough to overtake monks, but enough to allow a bit more leeway for the running rogue. A slight increase for post level 50 rogues might be in order.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Sneaking in water.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: For some reason you can sneak and then move into the water and continue to sneak. But you can't begin to sneak if you are in the water. This should be consistent. Either sneak breaks when you enter the water, or you can start sneaking while in the water.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Stackable Poisons.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: This is a pretty common request. They would like stackable poisons, or perhaps the ability to make multi-charge poisons.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Poisoning in Full Screen mode.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It seems that applying poisons can't be done in full screen.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Sneak skill increases.<br>
<br>
Sneak is a continuous skill. But skill increases only happen when the skill is first started. Perhaps it should work more like swimming, and give a skill check at regular intervals.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Speed increase while hide and sneaking.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Allow the movement increases to start earlier, say at 41st level. There have also been requests to allow a larger speed increase overall.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Tracking.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Many rogues have asked for some form of tracking, ranging from full-fledged tracking to dungeon or city only tracking.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Sense Traps.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTIONS: Perhaps the range of this ability is too short. Some also think that the reset time is too long, making it tedious to look for traps, and easier just to trigger them and deal with the consequences.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<hr>ITEM: Stun with Backstab.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: A sort of backstab, but with blunt weapons. So if the rogue is behind the opponent and uses his backstab while wielding a one-handed blunt weapon there would be a chance to stun the target. Such a backstab attempt might also do normal (not backstab) damage, to compensate for the stun chance.<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<hr>ITEM: Poison on thrown weapons.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: How about the ability to apply poisons to thrown weapons.<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item at this time.<hr>ITEM: Soulbound Lockpicks.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTOIN: Rogues would like to have lockpicks that they can't lose. Perhaps as the result of a quest.<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<hr>ITEM: Apply Poison Animation.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: How about making the rogue crouch when he applies poison in a fashion similar to Bind Wound, so they don't need to stand after applying<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item <hr>ITEM: Throwing Weapons.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if there were some longer range, stackable throwing weapons.<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item <hr>ITEM: Set Traps.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It would be interesting if rogues could to set traps. Something like a pet that would spring out an bite the next thing to come by. Only one at a time, hard to acquire components…<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<hr>ITEM: Hide/Sneak across zone borders.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if zoning did not break sneak and hide.<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item <br>

It starts out speaking about a NERF. A plain and simple jab at the functionality of the rogue class. I read the other classes lists and they all spoke of the same things...<br>
<br>
1)Increased defensive abilities<br>
2)Increased hitpoints and resistances<br>
3)Increased number and effectiveness of spells<br>
<br>
Then I look at the rogue list and we are looking at an entire different thead. Ours is based primarily on downgrading the rogue with the evade nerf, with a few primarily trade skill and &quot;convenience&quot; bonuses to calm the tide of hatemail I am sure Kendrick is receiving.<br>
<br>
Either way, if the ranger list is at all accurate looks like Rangers just became the new melee gods with a 252 defense, new spells, more hitpoints, along with raises across the boards and a hate reducing spell.<br>
<br>
Fun stuff.<br>

HIDE SNEAK ACROSS ZONES IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BALANCE ISSUE!!  Its just STUPID to have to request an invis from another class to do what we are expected to do as a class, and death due to server lag and LD when we are doing everything &quot;right&quot; about scouting is just BOGUS!<br>

But the two suggested nerfs to sneak worry me a lot.  Breaking sneak when you talk to a merchant, trade, or bank?  Stopping sneaking when you hit water?  hope you don't have to cross a stream in enemy territory.  I hope this is an Absor list and not a Dev Team list.  Jebus help us if they go through with that. <p><font size=+1>- <a href="mailto:nymm@deluded.com">Nymm</a></font><br><small>Prexus, <a href="http://deluded.com/poison/">Rogue</a>, 1 ea.</small></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kendrick>Kendrick</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grandfather Rogue</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/01 6:33:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Talk Item List - Absor</span><hr size=1> Relax, I'm going to sell Absor a clue about the sneaking bit, nothing will change there, and there's a decent chance we'll get the hide button to ungrey when trades break it or spells wear off.<br>
<br>
As for the sneaking and water, expect that to stay the same as it is now.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that what Absor posts is just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> his</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> summary of each of the topics, it goes to the Live team for any changes.  <br>
<br>
Absor will be the first to tell you he's not all knowing, and he may phrase some things that don't sound correct to players knowledgeable about a class.  Don't sweat it, he's learning, and the gaps in his knowledge are in no way a threat to the players.  <br>
<br>
You need to realize that Absor doesn't touch the game in any shape, size or form, he's the Community Relations Manager.  He works closely with the Live team, brings your concerns to us (which we're generally aware of in the first place), then relays things from us back to you.  <br>
<br>
People expect him to have the same intense knowledge about every facet of the game for every class and race in the game as they do, often neglecting the fact that what they know is usually only focused on a class/race combo or two. <br>
<br>
The perfect candidate for his position would have had to play every class to 60, in every race combination, in uber guilds, small guilds, no guilds, twinked, untwinked, on every server, at all times of the day, and have completed every quest implemented.  <br>
<br>
Since that person doesn't exist, you'll have to be patient with Absor.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzulian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zulian</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif  BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/01 6:38:29 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/Rhinoblast/Tornear.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Talk Item List - Absor</span><hr size=1> You should see the warrior's list, they have like, all good things.

And I sneak underwater a TON.  I have damn good swimming and decent sta so can do it.<br>

<br>
i still worry of dmg output with evade getting the knife though. as for Absor, thats ok but people listen, and they believe him when he says that outrageous stuff! That isn't good.<br>
