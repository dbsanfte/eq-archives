The transatlantic slave trade was financed and insured by the trading houses in London, New York and Boston--as well as continental cities of the Hanseatic League. Those same trading houses are now the big banks of N America and Europe.

How much African Ancestry do I have to have to qualify?  How much Native American?  Latino?  <br>
<br>
What if my african blood predates American Slavery Era?  How can you tell who's ancestry was derived from Slave Stock?<br>
<br>
Slavery has been around FOREVER in one form or another.  Its still around today!  Look around the world and you will see it.  Its not limited to a person's skin tone either.<br>
<br>
There is no way this issue can be resolved justly.  I personally feel no more guilt about American Slavery then Roman Slavery, Egyption Slavery or Mohawkian (sp?) Slavery.  Virtually every culture in every era has utilized it.  <br>
<br>
Does that make it right?  Im Biased.  Ive lived in Freedom most of my life.  I'd just as soon keep it that way!<br>
<br>
Let the Past Go (wish I could follow this advice).  Live in the now.  But NEVER forget the past.  Learn from it, so that the mistakes are never repeated.<br>
<br>
So in summation.....No.  Reparations should not be paid to the decendents.  I don't even endorse &quot;a ticket back to africa policy&quot; because they arn't africans.  They're Americans.  Just plain old Americans.<br>
<br>
And just to set things straight, all the black people just didnt get together at a meeting one day and decide to take this action.  Its only a very few who are pushing this.  I think most of it stems from the mule and 5 acres of land that were never paid out at the end of the civil war.  There might be a case in that but I would have to read up on it, my main historical focus is on the Early Roman Empire and World War 2.  I kinda just skimmed Reconstruction Era America. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvetecprocrustesadm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vetec Procrustes Adm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/19/02 9:16:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1309.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Slavery</span><hr size=1> I'm with Alexyi (and just about everyone else) 100%, but I do think that we have to consider where this issue is really coming from.<br>
<br>
I think it's stupid to argue about slavery at this point, there is no one alive that had anything to do with it, however, we are not so far removed from a heavily prejudiced society.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are people on these boards who remember having seperate drinking fountains at schools and segregation on busses. It was everywhere in the south, and it wasn't that long ago. So when we say that our society should not be paying for the mistakes of the past, we have to remember that it's not just people generations ago that have been hurt, it's people that we see in the supermarket, or on the street. <br>
<br>
I can't imagine what it would be like to be thought of as a lesser person because of the color of my skin, but since there are some people who have experienced that, I'm willing to cut them some slack with things like this.<br>
<br>
Should they be paid money, no. But should we be conscious of the world that these people were forced to live in not so long ago, and try to understand their residual anger and frustration? I think so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uanarkhan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>anarkhan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Anarcho-Monk</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/20/02 7:47:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1309.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> We shall overcome, one day . . .</span><hr size=1> American chattel-slavery was very different than slavery ever practiced anywhere else in history.<br>
<br>
Slaves in the Roman, Persian, Hittite, Babelonian, and Greek Empires actually had rights. It was a crime to mistreat your slaves. In many cases, a man could murder any of his wives or children legally, but he could not murder his slaves. <br>
<br>
In the Bible, it says that slaves are to be regarded as members of your household; same as your wife and children.<br>
<br>
Remember a few years ago when Jimmy the Greek got in trouble for talking about how southern slaveholders bred their slaves for strength and stamina? Well, he was right. After the import of slaves was outlawed, slave breeding plantations began springing up everywhere. These people were treated not like members of the household, but like cattle. The plantation in Mandingo was a slave-breeding plantation.<br>
<br>
The US Constitution actually describes them as being  three fifths of a human! The slaveholders actually used science and technology to justify and streamline the slave breeding process. Just as the nazi use of science and technology to justify and streamline the 1940's Holocaust was what separated them from other ethnoracial purges, the American use of science and technology to dehumanize Black slaves condemns the American culture to a collective guilt that cannot be easily assuaged.<br>
<br>
This was all because they were of dark-hued skin and regarded as distinctly subhuman because of that skin color.<br>
<br>
Even a token payment to slave heirs would show that America is a just and repentant nation.<br>

Sometimes one would watch the other play. So on my first TV turn, i flipped it to CNN, and a reparations rally was on. The shit being spewn there was ridiculous. Things like "Saddam Heusein (Spelling is way off) is not a terrorist, he is a peaceful man who is not a threat to this country. I'd like to talk about the real terrorists, Christopher Columbus (who did slaughter quite a few native americans, but what does that have to do with African Americans?) Thomas Jefferson, George Washington." Needless to say i cracked up at this, and called my friend in the room. The next guy up went on for five minutes speaking only "black power" over and over again. The next spoke about "I am not here to pin the tail on the donkey, but i am here to pin the tail on the honkey" I even went to the extent of calling another friend and telling him to turn on CNN.  Well....it turned into this crazy woman gyrating about and talking about "puff puff pass" as if that had anything to do with reperations.<br>
<br>
Now, in my opinion, skin color means absolutely ass. I dont care if you're black white purple or anything else, it means nothing. I agree with reperations, to any living slave. hmm...lets see....there are none. These people were blatantly racist in their comments and none of the arguments had a firm foundation IMHO<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The debate over whether the government should apologize for slavery is gaining in scope and importance. Tony Hall (D-Ohio)) has proposed a bill requesting that Congress apologize to African Americans whose ancestors suffered as slaves under the Constitution and laws of the United States until 1865. <br>
<br>
According to the Random House Dictionary, an apology is &quot;a written or spoken expression of one's regret, remorse, or sorrow for having insulted, failed, injured, or wronged another.&quot; <br>
<br>
We know that slavery was morally wrong. <br>
<br>
So, the question boils down to this: <br>
<br>
Does the government regret upholding such terrible exploitation and oppression while preaching democracy to the rest of the world? <br>
<br>
Does the government have any remorse for passing laws that allowed white fathers to sell their black children on the auction block? <br>
<br>
Does the government regret its role of legalizing the attempt to torture a people and beat then down to the level of a draft animal? <br>
<br>
The most heated battle concerns reparations- financial amends for wrongdoings. Although the bill doesn't call for this, and the president believes that would be out of the question. <br>
<br>
In 1988, Ronald Reagan issued a formal apology to Japanese-Americans for their internment in US concentration camps during World War II. The government also paid reparations- $20,000 apiece- to those Japanese-Americans. After World War II, Germany not only apologized for the Nazi Holocaust but made over $60 billion in restitution payments. Earlier this year, Clinton apologized to the survivors of the Tuskegee syphillis experiment. In the 1970's the government paid $10 million to the surviving victims and their families, and offered medical treatment to those who suffered as a result of the experiment. With these historical episodes as a backdrop, an apology to ancestors of those who suffered as slaves doesn't seem out of the question. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It has to be dealt with. That is why I don't want to abandon affirmative action without an effective alternative when there's still so many people living at least with the aftermath of discrimination.&quot; -President Bill Clinton<br>
<br>
&quot;It's only emotional symbolism. If you want to see a great apology for slavery, go to the Lincoln Memorial and read Lincoln's second address.&quot; -House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, (R-Georgia)<br>
<br>
&quot;To me, it's a moral issue. When you hurt somebody, nothing solves the problem at first like a good, old fashioned apology. Then we can begin to heal. If you don't say that, the whole issue lingers and lingers.&quot; -Represenatative Tony Hall, (D-Ohio)<br>
<br>
&quot;An apology for slavery is a meaningless gesture with no meaningful commitment to deal with the impact of something so serious as slavery.&quot; -Reverend Jesse Jackson<br>
<br>
&quot;We should have an apology for what's happening today- the poor quality of schools, the danger in schools, lack of opportunity.&quot; -Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Solid argument here.  Although I don't feel money should be given, an apology is in order.  Any other issue concerning schools or lack of opportunity is an issue concerning rich vs poor, not white vs black.  There are still millions of poor white people (far more than poor blacks believe it or not) with little to no help from the government.<br>
<br>
I feel that giving money to individuals is pointless.  The money will end up not helping anyone, and simply be wasted on the majority.  The government will have to raise taxes to recoup the lost revenue, and in the end, get that money back anyway.<br>
<br>
So am I considered a &quot;good negro&quot; by thinking logically? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=281768>Tettsuo Otomo</a> Grand Grasshopper of the Celestial Fist<br>

False logic based on meaningless theory, and false interpretation of the Bible is what was used.  The truth is, it was all about money.  They could have employed their own, but they didn't.  They wanted cheap labor, so they used slaves.  The tried the Native Americans, but they proved incapable of the work and too hard to keep (the Native Americans knew the land and were able to runaway and live).  Blacks were the best choice at the time.<br>

Did you know that many of the scholars and men of knowledge at that time studied in Egypt?  The people of Egypt are dark-skinned.  Logic is not, and has never been a white creation.  Blacks had the first civilizations, schools, libraries, hospitals, etc.  If you ever look at Greek art in comparison to Egyptian art you'll see <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   A LOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of Egyptian influence.  If if you're basing the study of logic on Greek philsophies, then you're studying Egyptian philsophies.<br>

What history are you reading?  Maybe you should search outside of the American school system for your knowledge of history.  Every country promotes itself in their history books to instill patriotism.  The white man isn't stopping you from doing yer own research, cuz the white man has been putting that information in the libraries for quite a long time.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  A People's History of the United States - By Howard Zinn</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a good book to get you started.<br>

No, the education system is in place to help him.  You can benefit from it by using it as a base.  The information you learn in school isn't false, just taken from the White viewpoint, which they have the right to do.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Of course the White man's viewpoint will come out of those who use White man's social context in which to think.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
To think only at one end of the spectrum is never good.  Keep and open mind and try to understand both sides of the argument to truly understand something.  I always try to do that...
