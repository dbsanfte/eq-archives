<br>
Simply put casters have many many ways of disingaging from combat without death and pure melees have none other than pulling the plug.<br>
<br>
Divine Aura<br>
Harm shield<br>
Shadowstep<br>
Yonder<br>
Gate<br>
Spirit of Cheetah<br>
<br>
and the big one...<br>
<br>
Running.  Due to melee range issues if poison has worn off or has been resisted its very hard to finish anyone who wants to run.<br>
<br>
Fact is a classes pvp success isn't just determined by the numbers of wins and losses but the extent of those wins and losses.  If you win 19 out of 20 fights but got not one kill and during the one loss you died and had your breastplate looted you not only lost but lost big time.<br>
<br>
It is essential that a class have some means of disengaging from some fights without dying.  With no means to disengage a class becomes useless in solo pvp not least because of the 2-4 member gang bang squads that are so prevelent.<br>
<br>
Now that I think of it this position may only be valid on rallos zek and only because of item loot.  On teams servers the difference between forcing someone to leave the zone in defeat and killing them would be a lot smaller, the fact that rogues have a difficult time finishing off non poisoned oponents (or at least I do) would be less meaningful,  and death to a group of 4 wizards would be less meaningful but for those of us on rallos zek who wont go around fully bagged anticipating defeat ,it is.<br>
<br>
It also occurs to me that perhaps i haven't explained this as well as I could have and perhaps you who read this see this as a defense of cowardice but until you have had to play in an environment where you have to fight again and again when a single defeat means the loss of something expensive and or hard to replace and at the same time watch countless casters shadowstep run or gate away even at very low hp I don't think you'll get it.<br>
<br>
Do NOT nerf melee gate )). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwolandgrauensturm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woland Grauensturm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/2/01 4:59:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> <br>
I find it ridiculous when melee players complain about PvP. At least on Vallon Zek, they dominate the high level gameplay. I was doing well pet kiting a level 60 paladin yesterday with my 56 necro pet that had MR buff (so it resisted or broke most roots), well, except that the pet took heavy damage from the coldain ring dmg shield, and that pally eventually turned to pet and smacked it with a few hits from his epic. Note - pally fled eventually, which isn't very common.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
No, the big problem in PvP is the huge advantage that hybrids and melee's have towards casters and priests. Given how PvP works on the coin only servers, it is a joke that spell damage and pet damage is reduced to 66%, while melee damage, damage shields and archery, does 100% damage. <br>
<br>
All sorts of damage should have the same reduction. That would be a huge improvement for PvP balance.<br>
<br>
<br>
I do agree with some points on the list though, like bards poofing pets, and line of sight abusing.<br>

Nerfing all melee dmg down to 2/3 at all lvls would be horrible for the melees and hybrids.  As far as pvp being dominated completely by hybrids and melees in the high lvl game I just don't see it.  Maybe because I'm 54 and it really changes at high 50s and 60, maybe because melees can't wear as much droppable armor all the time on rallos, but I just don't see it.<br>
<br>
The only unbalancing factor in melees favor at lower lvls is the gear available to twinks and you clearly can't balance the game with twinks in mind without screwing over the people who aren't twinks.  Now if we could just get some lvl restrictions on items so lvl 20s couldn't wield a trak tooth or a blood point...<br>
<br>
Personally my view is if your a necro and you think rogues are overpowered in pvp you are lacking in skills.<br>
<br>
pyrocruor 2000 dmg dmg dot<br>
Cessation 1000dmg debuff dot<br>
vex 1100 lifetap over time.<br>
Ebolt 1100 poison dot<br>
Deflux 310 lifetap 3 second cast<br>
DMF +70 pr and levitate<br>
Scent of Terris fr dr and pr down by 50 in pvp<br>
Splurt 1800 dmg dot<br>
<br>
Here are a few tips...<br>
<br>
Know who your enemies are.<br>
<br>
Watch your zone list for enemies.<br>
<br>
When a known enemy apears in the list use your pet to target him as described above.<br>
<br>
Never hunt at a zone line.<br>
<br>
Try never to hunt anywhere easily accessable to someone at the zone line.<br>
<br>
In a dungeon where the rogue is sneaking through since you can target him from anywhere you can test to see if hes in range from time to time.<br>
<br>
You may want to make a hotkey that goes like...<br>
/pet attack name<br>
/pet back off<br>
/target name of your current pet<br>
/assist<br>
<br>
Then hit it from time to time and try to cast.  If your enemy is sneaking around in a dungeon to reach you he will probably agro a mob when your spell breaks his hide in any high lvl dungeon he will most likely die.<br>
<br>
If no mobs are around or its outdoors he should have your pet on him and dots that he wont be able to dispell without prenerf pumice.<br>
<br>
Even if it doesn't go like this you can shadowstep and work the terain in order to keep from dying to his dmg and meanwhile even if you can't cast much you should be able to get some defluxes off while your pet works on killing the rogue.<br>
<br>
If you get a good shadowstep off you should easily be able to even cast a dot that he wont be able to get rid of without ditching your pet.  Of course the rogue could potentially manage to finish you off (hint try not to show your back)<br>
<br>
Heres another idea shaman dmg shield potion + banshee aura thats a 43 dmg shield at 60<br>
<br>
The rogue is surely not helpless but to describe melees as needing a nerf to 2/3 dmg is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Strategies for the rogue include dragging the pet off , killing it, then healing up with a velious bp.<br>
Rooting the pet with nets farmed in velious.<br>
If the necro is inclined to cast a lot of pumiable dots and doesn't have a pet up let em then step out of range and pumice em off using up their manna. (yes this requires a dumb necro)<br>
Fighting repeatedly then backing off and healing with mrylo or velious bp<br>
Suprising the necro and wrecking him.<br>
Catching him indoors supposing he doesn't start casting before you come into sight via the pet target thing.<br>
Luring him into somewhere shadowstep wont take you very far and hurting him.<br>
Pre nerf pumice if you've got it.<br>
Training the pet on some npc that hates necros (ok this is kinda cheap)<br>
Running past agro npcs but sneaking letting them run straight to you visible and agro.  The pet will get killed by the mob and the necro will take some dmg before fding or trying to gate.  If you don't want to cause them exp death you can let them gate or fd...or not.<br>

Pet kiting. This is where a pet class runs around in a circle with their pet on a melee who can't hit back because of the melee range bug. This is extremely lame since the melee has no chance ot hit back.
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Explain to me, how is a mage for example, going to kill a rogue - without the ability to kite you with his pet? you can kill him in close to one backstab, or in a few attack rounds, he cant channel spells through dual wield, and all his spells only does 66percent of their damage against you, not counting your ressists.<br>
<br>
No thats right, he cant.<br>
<br>
[quote] 
Levitate. 2 things. 1) hovering over water and casting on people who can't hit you. 2) floating way the hell in the air where you can't be hit.

Solution- Either improve pumice or make it so you can't cast any offensive spells while levitated like scale of wolf
[/quote]<br>
<br>
yeah its really unfair that one of his spells actually works as intended, he can fly, you cant. tough luck, atleast you arent suffering from a gimped highly ressistable damage output.<br>
<br>
[quote] 
Shaman dmg shield potions. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these being around except for the fact that they stack with druid and mage ds. This brings the druids potential dmg shield from 38 to a ridiculous 69 per hit.

Solution-Make the potions and druid/mage ds the same spell line so they wont stack.
[/quote]<br>
<br>
One of the few things casters can use that actually has a use against melees. as a druid my damage shield is nice, but its just not enough, any halfassed melee can kill me easily even though its up. using a potion he actually have to use a pumice or two before killing me, heavens forbid it. i do agree that it might seem insane, but if you think about it, all it does is to make people think a bit before going into combat. making hitting autoattack against a caster not meaning instant win anymore :P<br>

Supose they made it so players had to be in line of sight like mobs, so when you're casting a spell on them and they run around the corner it says &quot;You can not see your target from here&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well lets say you're a wiz trying to kill a warrior in a dungeon (we all know it can't be done, but lets pretend he's low on hp from a mob or something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). You begin casting, he runs around the corner, &quot;You can not see your target from here&quot;. He runs back, hits you for a round or two, you begin casting, he runs around the corner. See my point, it's like the water exploit. You HAVE to be standing still for 6.1 seconds or whatver to get a nuke off, he can hit you while running.<br>
<br>
Another example. If it worked with harmful spells, it's probly gonna be the same for beneficial spell. Cleric says &quot;CHealing %T&quot;, warrior runs around the corner chasing un snared mob, gets an add, &quot;You can not see your target from here&quot;. Cleric has to wait till the warrior is back in his line of sight before attempting to cast another complete heal, if the warrior can live that long...<br>
<br>
The gap between melee and casters is so huge it's not even funny. As a chanter I can't even dream of damaging an even con melee. A 55+ rogue can kill me in one double backstab and a couple hits. I can run around the corner and tash and dispell exploiting line of sight, but not like I'm gonna get one of my nukes to stick. Even if I did, you think I'm gonna kill a 55-60 melee with my leet 350-400ish nerfed dmg nuke?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukwaij.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kwaij</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 2:56:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> melee dmg should be nerfed in the same lines as spell casting. all those dot u mention are reduced with to 60% and u forget about the resist chance.<br>

What lvl?<br>
<br>
Are you one of those casters who play in all no drop thus sacrificing your effectivess for safety?<br>
<br>
What guild are you in?<br>

Are you really dumb enough to believe that casters are THAT badly off at all lvls vs all classes?<br>

i dont think the sollution is to nerf melee dmg by 60%, but hey, you dont have to be stepping on people toes calling them dumb @#%$ or whatever, when they actually know alot more then yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utakaraetaekmoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Takarae Taekmoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/02 11:11:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/Takarae/fullsize/thief.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> This entire discussion is eventually going to end up on the fact that PvP is Verant's joke to its players.  It's been given  very little thought or effort balance wise.  In the end, EQ PvP will sadly always be a sidetrip to the 'real' game of EQ, the PvE.<br>
<br>
I could only hope that Verant would one day decide to sit down and put PvP through the hoops to figure out what's broken and what's not, and what's gotta change.  Hope they come here for a peek at where to start. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Nerfing melee dmg = nerfing all melee and hybrid classes in all situations to a ridiculous extent.<br>
<br>
If I come here and post that cars run on tooth paste and shaving cream either they damn well should or I should expect to be flamed regardless of how long I've been a mechanic.<br>
<br>
Your friend doesn't know as much as he thinks he does including how much his own spells are nerfed by in pvp.<br>
<br>
The only melee dmg that is extreme enough to even take a look at is that done by various discs.  If any of these are overpowered then its grounds for looking at these discs and not every melee attack at every lvl.<br>
<br>
Its also possible that certain hybrids are overpowered not because of their uber melee dmg but because of the combination of spells and skills available to them.  If you think that is grounds for discussion fine.<br>
<br>
Its also possible that the performance of melees in uber gear should be looked at.  However even if uber melee performance is way overpowered this is NOT a reason to nerf all melees nor is it a reason to buff up every naked caster pk who dings quading by increasing their spell dmg across the board.<br>

Your input basicly isn't valid in the slightest here.  Hey my input on how to run a raid in tov or pull for said raid wouldn't be very valid either despite the fact that I've been part of many smaller scale raids and pulled from time to time.<br>
<br>
What we started with was lvl 40+ rogues wielding serrated bone dirks /laugh.<br>
<br>
The day they nerf my melee dmg down to 66% is the day I delete my rogue because I will not be able to play him on RZ pure and simple. In fact the that day would probably be the same day every real rogue who worked hard for their lvls and not a few rouges quit in utter and total disgust. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dunkelheit>Dunkelheit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/02 3:53:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Aerimus again</span><hr size=1> Hey Aerimus,<br>
<br>
I think the problem that we both have is that rogues are not the ones I have in mind when I think of 66% nerf with melees. It is main tanks that dish out HEAVY damage. <br>
<br>
Rogues are beatable, dispell, sick pet and you are done. If Rogues get the jump it may end bitter. <br>
<br>
BTW, they nerfed caster dmg because of the wizards one shot kills a long, long time ago. But Necros and Chanters and all others have been nerfed, too. <br>
So melees MUST be nerfed and rogues just have the sad end. <br>
<br>
BTW, what other classes in 50+ do you play except your rogue?<br>
<br>
I play 54 Necro, 50 warrior, 54 Druid and my SK is growing fast. So I can tell you from all sides, what classes own in PvP and what not. And guess what... Necro looses most fights...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uulynvindix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulyn Vindix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/29/02 8:37:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Some issues with the arguement</span><hr size=1> De-nerf caster pvp damage and leave melee damage as is.  Presumably this would be a less horrifying &quot;equal playing field&quot; for dedicated melee pvpers.  <br>
<br>
All these paper arguements about a fully buffed, DS potioned FM necro against a level 60 that with 9 golem wands and full ToV gear are not very productive.  Banshee aura does 11 damage at level 44.  It's duration is so short as to be almost useless and I'd be even less inclined to PAY for a DS.  The fact is that you have to sit around getting hit on for the DS to pay for itself, which means dying, or wasting a damage skin/harmshield.  Unless I am fighting ONE particular low damage per hit melee, why would I bother with all that fufera?  If I was on a blue server duelling a rogue, sure.<br>
<br>
People don't spend 400pp in expendables before every fight - it's hard enough keeping buffs up that are important and &quot;free.&quot;  Similarly, noone actually uses necro debuff lines or nonsense like that.  That screams pve to me, people talking about theoretical uses for highly resistable spells that are a waste of time and mana in pvp.<br>
<br>
I don't feel I'm &quot;weak&quot; as a Nec on SZ, just more vulnerable than some people expect.  I can't use 15 of my wonderful spells every fight because I can only mem 8 in the first place, and tons of them don't land on anyone worth talking about anyway.  But any old even con who fears my pet and starts wailing on me puts me in an awkward position.  People go on and on about shadowstep, but it isn't something to bet your life on.  <br>
<br>
Also, do to things like casting on the run and pet kiting it's usually helpful to use an exterior camera, but assuming equal jboots or sow potions, this means a lower speed than a strafing melee.<br>

Un nerfing spell dmg would hurt casters more than help them. At least 50+. Should a chanter seriously be able to kill any caster in 2 nukes? As a chanter I think that's pretty messed up ;p <br>
<br>
As a bard I think nerfing melee dmg would be very very bad. Only thing that allows me to melee moving targets is selos. With my warrior I can only hit someone if they're stuck or rooted or afk or retarded or something, no one stands to fight a warrior. Melees can do alot of dmg very fast *if* they can hit you. If they did 30% less dmg or whatever they'd be more of a joke than they already are.<br>
<br>
The only people that think melee dmg should be nerfed are people who have never played a melee 50+. Tell me honestly, how many times have you died to a solo pure melee? Now how many times to a solo caster? And people think we should nerf melee dmg and un nerf casters... ok... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
