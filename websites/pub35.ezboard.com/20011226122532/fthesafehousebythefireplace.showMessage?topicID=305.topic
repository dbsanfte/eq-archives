<br>
I began the day just after dawn, awaking by a large oak in the middle of Cazic Thule,I thought to myself &quot;Did I actually sleep here?&quot; shrugging a called out to some fellows about me, seeking some partners to begin my ritual killing of the lizard men. Gathering a stout group of members, Isanene, a woodelf female my eyes shall never forget, I believe she dabled in some mystic arts, for when her elegant form morphed into a wolf I was truly shocked. Next I turned to the large stout barbarian hailing me, his name Anguish. Another of the finger wagglers, his profession though to me remains unknown. Seeing my friend Night, I quickly brought her to our fold. Her dark elven clerical abilities were none surpassed. I saw a bright light shine from the corner of my eye, turning quickly I needed to shiled my eyes from the glow off the plate of the human paladin requesting our help. Onee he said his name is. Ah no bother, simply a paladin, not worth my time to remember. Suddenly a large shadow fell over our group, trembling I turned, fully expecting to be stricken down in my spot, but was simple Naraz, my troll friend. His ability with a sword never ceased to amaze me, but at the same time he was a finger waddler as well. I heard him mumbling something about dark arts but never bothered to ask. Seeing we had a hearty group we conversed on which section we should try and overtake, to control the population. Many places were brought up, but we finally decided to overtake the dreaded Avatar of Fear himself, avatar to Cazic on this plane. Quickly decending down the tunnels, we came upon the upper pool. Knowing the beasties below would not hear the fighting, we started to work on the three lizard guards. We all enjoyed lizarf kabobs after the fight.... Our resident fingerwagglers then cast invis on us all (except me cause I dont trust magic, I will find my own way) and dropped into the pool, unseen by all to gather our wits. Setting ourself against a far wall, we spotted the dreaded Avatar, his grotesque body forcing me to turn away. With a cry myself, Naraz, and Onee all ran straight for the Avatar confident of our eminent victory. A sudden skeleton hopped into the fray, the Avatar turning it, streaming a deafen crack that sent the bones flying, and the battle was begun. As Naraz drove his longsword into the beast's gut, I leapt upon its back, piercing my dirk into its neck, it quickly fell to our feet, no real damage was received by us. Glancing over the body my heart was pounding, I searching frantically for the fabled Ravenscale piece he was rumored to carry but I saw nothing. Glancing to the Avatar's hand I saw a three bladed claw, slipping it off his hand and into my pack, I retreated to our party. By the gods luck the members of my party offered it to me for my excellent attack. Bowing, I stowed the claw away for better use. Resting we waited, not sure what else to exxpect this night when a loud cackle was heard from over head. Looking up into the green bubble of water I nearly fainted, for there was the face of god Cazic himself. With a wink the ground shook, and the Avatar of Fear rose from the dead, ressurected by that damned deity. Setting back into the battle to begun again, Cazic had obviously offered more power to his avatar. For with a mighty swing he cleaved Anguish in two, that young barbarians cries shall haunt me to my grave. Then we sat upon him, cleaving hacking blasting til there was no more. Once the Avatar had fallen again, I searched his form. With a gasp I thought my heart would stop, there resting upon the Avatar's broken body lay the Ravenscale chestpiece, snatching it I ran back to my group. Looking to the gods they decree the paladin, Onee should receive it. I thought my heart would break, holding out the garment with my head held high, I congratulated Onee. &quot;Keep it&quot; he says &quot;All I want is that claw&quot; my heart lept with joy as I thankfully handed over my earlier prize, offering thanks to all the members of my battleworn group as we sat in for more fun at the expense of whatever that damned be god could throw at us.<br>
<br>
(Thank you all who were in my group. If you need me ever just say. Special thanks to Onee, Anguish, and Insane, Onee for giving me the CG for the claww, Anguish and Insanene for telling me if they won I could have it.)<br>
