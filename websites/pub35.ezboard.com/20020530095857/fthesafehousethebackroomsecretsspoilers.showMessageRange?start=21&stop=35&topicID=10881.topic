It may not be an "exploit" per se, but rather an unfortunate side-effect inwhich the benefits outweigh the negative.<br>
<br>
Suffice to say, Yelinak was not rooted for the express purpose of letting people raise their skill on him while he sits there trying to kill you. Wether you feel it's ok to skill up on him is pretty much a judgement call. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uewanakanach0king.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ewan aka nach0king</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/29/02 5:08:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10881.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summon Shissar Fang item</span><hr size=1> I don't need to skill up on him, my archery and throwing are both plenty high.

They should probably add some ranged DD spell of some sort, or even a bow, to these mobs to make this sort of thing less likely.<br>

But, I don't see a bug here.<br>

<br>
Grimling Prince (name escapes me) - Hollowshade moor.<br>
Light blue to 46. Tough little bugger, first time we tried to take him out we had to zone (unorthadox group.)<br>
Came back, cleared the guards. <br>
&quot;Hey, let me try something ...&quot;<br>
DoT, Nuke, wait, no summon<br>
&quot;Okay everyone, DoT and Nuke the hell out of him but don't engage.&quot;<br>
cast until oom<br>
Okay, send in pets, pets knock him down to run stage.<br>
Beat the hell out him with melee, dead, very little risk if you have enough casters.<br>
<br>
Funny thing though, the Defenders that spawn in Hollowshade during various parts of the war ... green at level 46 ... summon!<br>

Verant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> deliberately</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> made some mobs perma rooted in response to certain tactics but in doing so created different tactics you could use against them.<br>
<br>
Anyone remember when the implemented the FD chanages to 35+ mobs?  There was bitching at the time.  The reason was to stop certain exploits (according to Verant).  In doing so they simply created more potential exploits however (a skilled FD puller can use the 35+ thing to their advantage to split mobs).<br>
<br>
Exploits are like that Qeynos thing where you stand on a wall and shoot something that can't reach you but you can damage it.  Thats a pathing exploit.  Deliberately changing the monster so it doesn't move is quite something else.<br>
<br>
Anyway the above is just the tip of the iceberg.  What some naysayers don't realize (or want to acknowledge) is that there are fundamental flaws in EQ's game mechanics that cannot be retrospectively corrected.  Enter EQ2...<br>

<br>
Since Yelinak got rooted, how many guilds shoot arrows on him before engaging to build some aggro up?  Well, most of them.  How many were banned/warned for doing it?  None I know of.<br>
<br>
You could say the same about kiting being an exploit.  How much risk is there for a druid to snare, root and DoT a mob?  About none.  If snare resists, they will just outrun and gate/zone.<br>
<br>
There is a very simple way to prevent this, however, if Verant really frowns upon this practice - make the mob a caster or an SK, problem solved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udrakinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drakinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 2:27:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10881.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1> so about how rare are these things? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwyenx2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wyen x2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 2:29:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10881.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1> 70+ hours in the mines..I've seen a whopping one drop. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=10881.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=10881.topic&start=41&stop=57>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showPrevMessage?topicID=10881.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showNextMessage?topicID=10881.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10881.topic&index=35><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.emailToFriend?topicID=10881.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.threadControl?topicID=10881.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10881.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10881.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers>The Back Alley</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
