Verant employees made so much money their knee deep in coke and getting even more greedy!!!!    It should NOT cost 39.99 though...  I imagine a lot of people WOULD PAY  14.99, though...   Thats probly what VI will end up doing...   <br>
<br>
will that be bad?  i might pay 14.99 for "better" everquest...  *shrug*  DAOC sucks and im tired of EQ....       DAOC might be better once i upgrade from my @#%$ ass P2 400, Voodoo3.<br>

A few of those high-up in Verant Interactive....  Sony..  are making a <b>HUGE</B> amount of money,...  How many hundred thousand subscribe to EQ?  i forget?!?!?<br>

Verant is trying to make it look like a new game, but its exactly the f***ing same!!!<br>

I agree VI has some screwed up methods.  In fact, I was probably as critical of the Luclin release as anyone on this board.  It was an amateurish clusterfuck.  But I don't see how that has any bearing on this.<br>
<br>
But there is a vast difference between an expansion and this new service.  Sure they will add new stuff to this new server first, but to start it is basically the SAME game.  There won't be any new bugs to work out, just the same existing ones.  The only in-game differences are server population, and size and presence of the CS staff.  Even the worst airline can add a first-class cabin to their configuration and not have it affect their coach-class service.  Whether they do First Class well and whether it remains worth it to those who pay for it is another matter - but it doesn't affect the rest of us who don't use it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 2:49:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'd like to agree</span><hr size=1> I thought this initially too Kuurus.....til I started reading through the additions. There are no new elements of play, but there is going to be a hell of alot of new things included. Maps that you can bring up at will in game, personalized web pages...egads, I cant even remember all the extra frosting they are going to put on this. <br>
<br>
So no, there arent going to be any new &quot;game&quot; bugs. What there will be is stuff like people crashing to desktop cause of error codes, and things of that nature coming along with all the additions. They, hopefully, manange to resolve these issues quickly =/.<br>
<br>
I dont think this should be a problem, but I have a gut feeling it is going to be. CS and the debuggers are always been over worked. Having them divide their time between 2 types of server(because I think as time goes on, Legends and &quot;coach&quot; are going to be come very different) is going to make everything work slower.<br>
<br>
My final post on this(finally). I am completely frustrated with the game designers and their marketing counter-parts for the choices they have made. I feel like with every new continent that comes out, they leave behind a host of issues and inequalities that a good 4 months of not thinking about new shiny things could resolve. But instead they are plugging away for more money, and in my mind EQ Legends is the epitimy(sp?) of that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uirontaail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irontaail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/10/02 5:04:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Havent decided yet ...</span><hr size=1> I have considered it, and still am, but not because I like the features, which I think should mostly b on all servers free, but because I like the concept of a dynamic quest server, and a changing world ... <br>
<br>
For example ... I would like to b part of a server that has GM run quests that actually effect the world in general. Maybe like when the 10th ring war is won by one side or the other, lets say the Dorfs win, that a new Giant King comes up and a civil war breaks out in Kael, which again the players might b able to influence the outcome, and either take over the throne or lose in the attempt .... it doesnt really matter to much if the new NPC's really get changed other then names ... ie Tormax, might have been over thrown and the new king is named Racmaen or something. Even more exciting to me would b if some of the changes that wanted to be introduced into the regular servers were done through dynamic quests in the Legends servers ... like when Splitpaw was changed .... would have been cool to have a Legends quest that was all about some Named Gnoll leading a revolt to make to take back the area. This is what Im hoping the Legends servers will b like .... but alas<br>
<br>
Atm Im not changing servers yet, until I see that this is indeed what the Legends servers are going to b about .. I dont like a static world where every other week 2 guilds split all the major named N ToV, Yel, Tormax, etc ... it gets boring after a while when the world doesnt change at all .. no matter HOW good you or your guild becomes. <br>

Say your guild convinces you to come back or something.  Would you be forced (hehe) to play on the Legends server for a whole month, or would they transfer one of your characters back whenever you want?  (with the caveat that you couldn't ever transfer him back to Legends for free again afterwards) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showPrevMessage?topicID=2702.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showNextMessage?topicID=2702.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=124><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2702.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2702.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2702.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2702.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
