I mean, will some creatures attack only until you are incapcitated then run away, and others attack then incapacitate then kill you?<br><br><br><br>Yes. Some creatures are killers. Many creatures just incapacitate you and then wander off, and still other creatures will only kill you if you are near their lair.<br><br>BaleKlocoon<br><br>    quote:1st page? <br><br>Correct!<br><br>UrbanBohemian<br><br>    quote:Also will other creatures trigger the AI of other creatures, eg will a wandering Rancor aggro a lair of Worrts? <br><br>It depends on the creatures involved. In some cases, the lair's inhabitants will flee. In other cases, some might attack while others flee. In still other cases, they'll all attack (sometimes immediately and other times not). Oh, and sometimes they'll just ignore the other creature.<br><br>    quote:And will even peaceful herbivores get aggressive if we get too close to their lairs without actually harming them?<br><br>Currently, yes.<br><br>Khaldun<br><br>    quote:Interesting, thanks. This basically describes 'train' behavior. What happens if you take a potshot at the worrts when they're getting close to the point where they usually would break off pursuit and turn for &quot;home&quot;? Will they chase you further? <br><br>When they decide to break-off pursuit and return home, they at least *start* to return home even if you're still shooting at them. If you continue shooting at them though, they'll attack you again instead of returning home.<br><br>    quote:What happens if someone else shoots at the train who wasn't involved in the original provocation? Will they switch targets?<br><br><br><br>They might. It depends on how angry the creature is at you, how hard they were hit, and how far away from home they are.<br><br>ViRTuaL22<br><br>    quote:First page maybe? <br><br>Yes!<br><br>ShadowRecon<br><br>    quote:Nice! I'm just wondering if a species, like the worrts, will all have the same AI settings? Or will each species have a bit of randomness, a range, for there AI's settings? So that every encounter with the worrts won't always be the same.<br><br>Currently their settings are all the same, in terms of which variables and flags tell their AI how to act, but there is a bit of &quot;randomness&quot; built-into the AI system. Overall, we want Worrts to act like Worrts, so they can't stray too far from the baseline, or they'll just all seem random.<br><br>Gianthatr<br><br>    quote:awesome...Just wondering if you can tweak the AI to attack a group of people or will they just attack the first person that threatened them? <br><br>They attack based on who they are the most angry toward. Combat makes them angry. Seeing their friends attacked makes them angry. Hitting them makes them angry (and hitting them harder makes them more angry). Attacking their lair makes them angry, etc. So, its possible for a number of things to alter their current target. A group of players attacking a group of creatures should see various creatures fighting various players, rather than all the creatures ganging-up on the first player to shoot at them.<br><br>Jer-Lo<br><br>    quote:If you attack smaller creatures from a long distance away -- sniping, if you will -- will they attempt to determine where it's coming from and then pursue from a distance?<br><br>Yes, but if the distance is considerable then they might only react if you actually hit them. Or if they are too far from their lair (if they have a lair) then they might flee back to it instead.<br><br>valder<br><br>    quote:important question, i think: will a creature defending it's lair move out of sight of said lair?<br><br>Sometimes.<br><br>    quote:how far out of sight?<br><br>Not terribly far.<br><br>    quote:is it adjustable?<br><br>Everything is adjustable.<br><br>    quote:will it depend on the aggression level of the creature, the amount of annoying you do to them (the amount of damage they've done to you?) or a combination of those?<br><br>That's a good idea. Currently it's set at a specific distance for all creatures, but that sounds a lot more natural to me. So hold on a second...<br><br>...there. Just changed it so now the creature will chase you a distance based on how angry he is.<br><br>    quote:with lair creatures if you hadn't pulled far enough away from them, would they have followed indefinently? or would they have turned back at a definite distance from the lair?<br><br>Well they would have turned back at a definite distance from their lair, but now it depends on how angry they are at you.<br><br>blasterdude110<br><br>    quote:I understand why you are using a 'default' AI coding and just changing variables to save time and make the code more efficient, but that leaves me with two questions:<br><br>    Will there be enough variables to change so that each creature feels different, or will they all seem very similar aside from how quickly their irritibility develops?<br><br>    Are there any creatures or mobs (such as stormtroopers) that will use a totally different AI coding?<br><br>The AI scripts are layered on mobiles, with higher-level scripts overriding the behavior of the lower level scripts.<br><br>So we can start out with a basic AI (flee when you are scared, attack when you are angry, a short list of things that make you fearful or angry, etc), and then apart from simply flipping switches to change the basic behavior (like making an AI 'carnivore' as opposed to 'herbivore'), we can also put in overrides for specific behaviors that we want to see.<br><br>For example Tusken Raiders have the basic AI script, and then a Tusken Raider AI script sitting on top of that. When they take a Bantha as their companion, they actually attach a &quot;tusken bantha&quot; script to it, and that serves to override specific behaviors.<br><br>This allows us to use totally different AI, but in strategic places - rather than writing an entire new AI script from the ground up, we can just override the two or three or twenty things that we want to be different.<br><br>The basic AI script is itself fairly robust: covering herbivores, carnivores, most basic NPC behaviors, herding, stalking, lair-defense and pack behaviors.<br><br>Whitefeather<br><br>    quote:Thank you shug for this, but my questions are if worrts from another area nearby from a different lair would go aggressive if you attacked this lair. If not what if the lair is within visual range? Is there a minimum distance two lairs can be? What about for same creature lairs?<br><br>It depends on the type of creature, and whether you're also fighting other creatures of the same type, or just blowing-up an empty lair.<br><br>Vampir<br><br>    quote:Is there a max number of NPC mobs that can come after you? <br><br>Not yet.<br><br>Gerbon<br><br>    quote:In this situation you fired at the lair and the worrts chased you for a bit. But what would have happened if you had destroyed the lair?<br><br>They would have continued to attack him.<br><br>    quote:Would they chase you indefinitely until you killed them, or would they go back to where the lair was and just mill about until they get killed? <br><br>If they're chasing him, then there's a range at which they'll turn around and go back home - back to where their lair used to be. Then they'll become very sad, because their home exploded.<br><br>lazyimperial<br><br>    quote<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I love it. Will they build a new nest if you leave enough alive? 8 worrts and some time and you'd have a new nest to worry about if any females were left alive. <br><br>Not currently, but that's a pretty neat idea.<br><br>Xnexus6X<br><br>    quote:A very fun read, thanks Shug. I cant wait to be standing in Izzizz's shoes. (Wait, I dont think Trandoshans wear shoes, do they?) If your in a group and 1 person attacks thier lair, will they agro on the rest of the group or stick to the person that agroed them? Does the default AI recognize groups?<br><br>We don't have grouping in yet, but probably creatures won't attack based on whether you're in a group. Rather, it'll be based on seeing you actually help attack their home.<br><br>Hsalis<br><br>    quote:[snip description of training mobs onto poor innocent players]<br><br>Creatures away from their home location (whether they have a lair or not) will return to their home location rather than attacking anyone.<br><br>Eros<br><br>    quote:If a mission is to destroy there lair would it be as simple as having one character lead them off and your buddy blast away?<br><br>    Will the AI take into account several charaters around the lair and adjust their attack accordingly, say by simply raising their aggressivness to anyone around them instead of attacking one player?<br><br>    If the the train does take off after character #1 would they know that their lair is under attack and go back?<br><br>    I can see problems with all the situations, but thats a topic for somewhere else.<br><br>I think we can get it reasonably balanced so that all of the creatures can't be led so far from the lair that none of them are around to defend it.<br><br>BabyRancor<br><br>    quote:Sounds better and better all the time. Question - Do creatures make a call or howl to alert their comrades, or do the mobs just start to swarm?<br><br>    My thought is that a nice loud unmistakable noise would be a great addition. Let's you know when you're in real trouble.<br><br>Typically not when a lair is attacked out-right. All the creatures that see it attacked come running to defend it. Otherwise, virtually all creatures go &quot;alert&quot; and look around when they are threatened, and &quot;threaten&quot; you (roar, etc.) before they attack.<br><br>waIkingcarpet<br><br>    quote<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> oes this mean that other animals can make the worrts nervous too? Like if a big carnivore approached? Please please please say yes... to see a flock of worrts scatter out of the way of a Krayt dragon would just be.. amazing. I mean they would not just stand there after all.<br><br>Yes, creatures react to each other, carnivores eat herbivores, Banthas flee in terror when they see another Bantha being eaten by a Krayt Dragon, etc.<br><br>Jahdow<br><br>    quote:When a Mob has been angered or feels threatened will it be aggressive to all PC/NPC or just the protagonists?<br><br>Just the people that he is angry/agressive with. If you shoot a creature it won't get mad at someone else.<br><br>    quote:If a PC out runs a mob and then returns to the site where he/she angered it will the Mob remember him/her and attack again, if so is its ability to remember based on its intelligence, or will it just have a heightened aggressive nature for a period of time.<br><br>It'll have a heightened aggressive nature for a while.<br><br>    quote:When Mob group AI is activated will any mobs in the area instantly target the protagonist or, for example if it cant see the protagonist, will it focus on a another creature that is raising the alarm and investigate before it targets the protagonist?<br><br>The behavior is all directed fundamentally by the Fear and Anger lists. If it can't attack the person it wants to attack, then it looks for someone else that it is &quot;angry&quot; toward.<br><br>Grator<br><br>    quote:How will the Npcs or creatures with projectiles (like blasters or some acidic spit or something) chase you? Will they fire off a shot or two, follow, fire another shot etc. or will they keep firing until your out of range then follow?<br><br>They try to keep within range of their weapons. If they're a safe distance from you then they'll kneel or even go prone (so as to get a better shot at you). If they have a melee weapon and you get close to them, then they might even holster their blaster and whack you with their melee weapon.<br><br>Vaugerant<br><br>    quote:debug versions of the game we actually displayed messages from the creatures like “You’re making me nervous!”<br><br>    Will creatures actually display these type messages?<br><br>That was just for debug purposes. They don't do that any more.<br><br>RunsWithScissors<br><br>    quote:1) Do creatures run away if they're hopelessly outmatched?<br><br>Not yet. They'll flee if they're getting seriously wounded, though.<br><br>    quote:2) Is the AI set up for migratory or herd animals with no fixed &quot;home&quot;?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>There ya go...!<br><br>-Raph Koster<br>Creative Director <p>Brother Lenardo Draconis<br>GrandMaster of the Celestial Fists<br>The First Seal<br>The Nameless<br><a href='Http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=329805'> Magelo</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugassire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gassire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/30/02 6:13:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: something i saw on SW:G - an AI FAQ from the developers</span><hr size=1> Sweet Jebus, if the ai comes out half as good as in this text, then I might actually be tempted to say that this game will kill eq. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udemulix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>demulix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/30/02 8:35:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: something i saw on SW:G - an AI FAQ from the developers</span><hr size=1> aging times, aging AI... hopefully theyll actually make a good AI work well outside of sports games... <p><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/demulix/fullsize/sig.jpg></img><BR>Gwyvrn Phantomfists<BR>56 Master<BR>Fennin Ro</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=419.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showNextMessage?topicID=419.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.emailToFriend?topicID=419.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.threadControl?topicID=419.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=419.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=419.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Proposed Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14>Other Games</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
