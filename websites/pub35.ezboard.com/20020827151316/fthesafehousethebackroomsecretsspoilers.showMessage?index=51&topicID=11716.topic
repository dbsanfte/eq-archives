But in mistmoore jail it's the same idea.  The mobs in the cells are VI rooted and you can use the same tactic as the original poster did vs. Arch Lich.  I did it in my 30s with a friend of mine..only damage we took was spell damage.  I never got banned, warned, questioned...or you may say..I never got caught?  I still don't think this is an exploit.

Because there are other strats that are easier, and work better. They just require a smidgeon of skill and ability.<br>

Like I said-- let them use it. AL is the key to learning how to destroy luclin, and if they want to gimp him so that they can sc0re phat lootz they would not be able to get, let them.

<br>
So I assume by saying this pre-debuffing any perma-rooted mobs is TOTALLY out of the question.  That would be such a dispicable exploit it would make you sick, right?  So you step up and take your licks, THEN debuff?  Grats for you, but not everybody has to choose to fight that way.  It is NOT an exploit to predebuff.  Just as running away from a mob is NOT an exploit.<br>
<br>
I've ran from kael arena to WL zoneline after a train with mobs summoning me back to the train, then I tuck and run again, should I have just sat there and 'take my licks'?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but you are either totally inexperienced in high level content or play a class like a necro that just clicks manafeed every fight regardless of combat strategy.  Limit your posts to manafeeding threads as that would be more of your expertise.<br>

<br>
Actually thats exactly the point, you totally didnt understand what I posted. The things he listed seperately arent illegal, but exploiting melee damage/pathing (or lack of) by doing those actions on a mob IS. Just like the things I listed arent illegal seperately, but shooting someone in the head obviously is. Reading comprehension is a good skill to have<br>
<br>
&quot;Calling someone an exploiter who defends these &quot;questionable&quot; tactics is also broken logic. Guilty by association cause I defended the original poster?...never seen the arch lich.&quot;<br>
<br>
These tactics arent questionable, they are outright exploits. Honestly if you think they arent, and feel the need to defend exploits (and exploiters) then id guess you are a cheater yourself and have something to hide. Whether or not you have used any of the things listed yourself or not is a moot point when the reason that I responded to your post was because of the content of your post. I dont know you, nor do I know or care if you never see AL and it doesnt matter because it was you who piped in with your obviously baseless opinion.<br>
<br>
I hope anyone who runs out and starts trying these exploits (tactics!) ends up taking a permanent holiday from EQ. These mobs are doable without using bugs in the game (which is against the EULA so all you anyone saying &quot;they made it like this so its ok!!1!&quot; can go jump). If you arent ready for them then thats too bad for you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzotha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zotha</A> at: 8/8/02 8:58:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uainmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ainmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 10:13:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11716.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arch Lich, HP, Creator</span><hr size=1> What is the bug in this case? <br>
<br>
The Eula states this:<br>
<br>
You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the in-game &quot;/bug&quot; command or via the eqtesting@soe.sony.com email address.<br>
<br>
Is the Arch Lich being rooted a bug?  Is the fact that the Arch Lich can't hit you out of melee range a bug?  Is the fact that a caster or hybrid class can generate more aggro out of range than a warrior can a bug?<br>
<br>
Those of you that haven't killed the Arch Lich both ways (as I have) cannot possibly measure the effectiveness of either strategy against the other.  Saying that SK tanking Arch Lich makes it &quot;easier&quot; or &quot;harder&quot; is silly, he's trivial either way once you have killed him either way.<br>
<br>
(And yes, my guild has killed Emperor many times, and is halfway through Vex Thal, so killing Arch Lich either way has not &quot;crippled&quot; us) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uainmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ainmer</A> at: 8/8/02 10:34:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udagnyblazestorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dagny Blazestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 10:46:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11716.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arch Lich, HP, Creator</span><hr size=1> &gt;(bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), <br>
<br>
The bug is that the mob doesn't hit anyone but the SK even though the SK is out of melee range and the summon timer isn't up and there are plenty of targets *in* melee range that it could be hitting in the interim.  This is a bug in the aggro list coding that &quot;grant[s] the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game.&quot; End of story. My guess is that this will be fixed shortly so permarooted mobs will turn on others in range between summons when the top aggro person is out of range. Another solution is to just make the whole room in melee range but that would be more of a hack than anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 11:42:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11716.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arch Lich, HP, Creator</span><hr size=1> Good post Dagny.

The amount this exploit makes the encounter easier by is of no consequence, the important thing is you are cheating to accomplish it. Stopping a monster fighting back using agro lists and safe spots is cheating, its really rather simple.<br>
<br>
&quot;still rampage a given number of tanks&quot;<br>

That given number is 1, who needs less then half the healing of the person with agro. So basically you are getting away with using 1/3 orso of the healing power and mana consumption you would normally use for the encounter. I dont care if anyone follows this amazing guide, but I sure as hell would laugh if I hear about Verant warning/banning any guilds for using this. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzotha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zotha</A> at: 8/9/02 2:15:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uacutex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acutex</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 2:07:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11716.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arch Lich, HP, Creator</span><hr size=1> Uh hi, he DOES fight back.

 Yeah cuz agro management on rooted mobs isn't easy enough already? Only mobs this would make harder would be AL and IV because of their knockback/stun/blind. It would make every other rooted mob in the game much much easier.<br>

YOUR logic is flawed because the end justifies the means, not the reverse. Obviously shooting someone in the head is illegal. You conveniently changed "shooting someone with a gun" to "Shooting a gun".<br>

<br>
Hi. <br>
<br>
In one situation, you are using the summon timer to reduce the dmg output of AL by 1/2 or more.  The other situation, the summon timer is a means to prevent escape.  The diffence between the 2 situations is in 1 situation, you want to get away... The other, you are working around the coding to win a fight.  Not at all the same.  When you decided you wanted to run for the zone, you decided that you couldnt kill whatever is chasing you.  AL just cant chase you.<br>
<br>
You remember City of Mist?  That was an exploit because whatever you were killing couldn't path to you and fight back.  The similarity between CoM and AL would be, people using these tactics generally couldnt kill either of them if they could fight back.  The difference being, mobs dont summon in CoM.  Still was pretty funny when one warped down and killed whoever was there though.<br>
<br>
I know you're gonna tell me its not the same, blah blah, AL hits the SK every 12 seconds, blah blah, might get stunned, blah blah.  The point is, while the SK is out of range, your entire raiding party is beating on Arch Lich with no risk of death (aside from the AE) until the summon timer resets and summons the SK.  Once summoned, it takes less than 3 seconds to get out of range (i know i know &quot;What if he gets stunned!!!1!&quot;).  Using this tactic, Arch Lich spends more than half the time standing there with a dum look on his face when he should be beating on someone.  I'm pretty sure thats not what was intended when they made this encounter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uemodius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emodius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:28:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11716.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hah</span><hr size=1> [quote]Emodius... he wasn't saying that 2 legal things being done together should always be illegal, but instead arguing against the original poster who was saying that what they did was legal because they were doing 2 legal things (not in those words, but the argument he made).

<br>
Man you are so far off it isnt funny:<br>
<br>
"he wasn't saying that 2 legal things being done together should always be illegal"<br>
<br>
ns. He also did not however specify. And it is clear that what he was saying was that just because two things were "legal" together doesnt mean they are illegal. His analogy was flawed and just wrong. It completely ignored the end justification of intent, and outcome, and instead myopically focused on two random things, and a result that happeened to be illegal, so no I didn;t prove his point, because he didn't have one. <br>
<br>
"He "conveniently replaced" shooting someone with a gun with shooting a gun, in order to MIMIC the original poster. "<br>
<br>
In fact that he failed to parallel what the original poster did. <br>
<br>
"To illustrate further, if you bent down to lick your stamp, and it caused you to veer off the road and hit an old lady, would your actions be legal then? "<br>
<br>
yes. nothing illegal was done in that situation. The only thing you would get sued for int hat scenario is negligence, and that could only occur of the lady were hit or nearly hit. If you merely lost control of your car and that resulted in no injury or damage then nothing could be done. Thus the REASULT is the determinig factor, and not the contributions. Adding a random Criminal act as a contribution (shooting) which results in a ":bad" end (murder) is not the same, and therefore he was wrong, and I did not support his failed attempt. That isn't BS. I READ what he wrote. It is freakin simple to understand, and I am sure we all read far more complex things all day. It was simply a poor analogy.<br>
<br>
[quote]Which is exactly why you couldn't just tell the cop "hey, I was licking a stamp, and driving my car, both of those things are legal[/quote] <br>
<br>
As prevously pointed out, the end result, murder  ( or injury lets not play childish semantics), is the end result. With the SK moving out of melee range, there is nothign "illegal". There is no "exploit" so no, the parallels are not there.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
I just looked back int he thread yet again. Because Z didnt mention which if the score of "gimps" he was refering to, I cannot pick what he was quoting. It stand that in his example he intentionally changed the  (admittedly) flawed logic of Legal + legal = legal. **It CAN = equal, but doesnt have to, but in this case it does. ** this leaves room for debate, because that is all the posters have said who are pro this strat.<br>
<br>
In his example, where he poorly attempted to "mimic" the posters (I mean, it was an anaology or parellelism after all, that IS what they do =P) he said this:<br>
<br>
Legal+Legal=Illegal **it CAN = legal, but doesnt because I changed the end result to somethig which is expressly forbidden, and clearly wrong** This leaves no room for debate, because he intentionally picked a clear cut end to a means that was illegal, and messed up in general to suit his purpose. He conveniently left out that the act of pointing the gun made the flow:<br>
<br>
Legal (being in a bank) + legal (shooting a gun) + illegal (pointing the gun at the teller before shooting it)= illegal. <br>
<br>
Odd how that third part was left out. So no, he is wrong, and he has yet to show how this is an exploit. <br>
<br>
This differs from the encounter in which the guild got banned in that in this case the ability to hide form the "AE" is intentional beond the pillar, and there is no Z axis exploit being used, which is in reality what they aforemtnioned guild was cited as being disbanded for. There is no axis exploit here. Furthermore, we live in an unfortunate situation where Verant wants you to do encounters "their" way, and if you dont, and clearly undermine thier intent, they will smoke you. There is no clear evidence the encounter is not meant to be done in this way. It is clear hiding under the bridge was an exploit however, and while I dont think  that guild should have been disbanded, it happened, and was justifyable, but that is a whole nother can of worms.<br>
