using el salvador as an example is poor - WWII with japan attacking china (japan being the US's enemy of course) it would make sense to support the nationalists, who were fighting the communists and the japanese yet we didnt. (though that can be construed as isolationist policy)<br>
<br>
expansionist? we put up military bases in foreign countries - not for self serving purposes, rather to ensure stability (or try to) how much land in europe or asia did the US annex immediately after WWII?<br>

and why are you  defending the russians? the red army was brutal, the soviet leaders were brutal, the entire economic system was brutal to those living under it.

<br>
You didn't address the statement <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> directly under that statement</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> which said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, there were other issues that were equally important. It's easier to say &quot;Slavery&quot; because that issue is a sore spot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But you didn't read that, nor did you address it.  You read one statement, and took it at face value without evaluating it in context.  This is why this thread is so laughably ignorant.  <br>
<br>
Slavery was a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very big issue</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. In fact, I am going to say that Slavery was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> most important issue. Why?<br>
<br>
Well, the north and south fought over economic differences. The south was still turning out farms, ranches, and plantations.  The north turned out a lot of factories, and had substantially larger cities. When Lincoln legally abolished slavery, he effectively <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> cut the legs off of southern industry</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Voila. War. <br>
<br>
The south wanted to be autonomous, because they would have to start PAYING their slaves to do the labour they were doing now.<br>
<br>
This is the CENTRAL ISSUE of the civil war.  There ARE other issues, but this is THE MAIN REASON.  Economic and political differences, revolving around the legality and use of slave labour to drive the economy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next issue:<br>
<br>
Who is worse, Hitler or Stalin?<br>
<br>
I forward that Hitler was worse, due to the methods he used. Stalin killed, I believe 4 million russians and 8 million ukranians. The Russian deaths were from the purges he held after he stomped out any resistance to his power, and the ukranian deaths happened because he ordered that region to be starved to make them accept him.  <br>
<br>
The difference is in the way Hitler murdered people, and the reason behind it.  Hitler ordered mass executions, and ordered an entire 'race' of people to live in squalid conditions not fit for animals. It's like the difference between a murderer who shoots a man in the head, and a murderer who locks a man in the basement and slowly poisons him over the course of several weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next issue, symbolism.<br>
<br>
Like it or not, the south was represented by the confederate flag. And, the confederates held a racist agenda.  Slavery and that flag are going to be linked, in the minds of americans and quite a bit of the rest of the world, forever.  I don't take offense at somebody wearing or flying that symbol, just as I don't take offense at somebody wearing a swastika.  Lying to yourself, or forwarding the idea that the confederate flag and slavery are disparate is dishonest, and revisionist.<br>
<br>
I think quite a few of us need to take a centrist view of this.  The three issues we have come up with have been regarded in black and white. Is the swastika good or bad. Is the confederate flag good or bad.  Was the war fought over slavery.  <br>
<br>
Yes and No. Yes and No. Yes and No. Those are the answers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umongomfh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mongo mfh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 9:58:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7176.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Well, the north and south fought over economic differences.

<br>
The war had already started when he &quot;abolished&quot; slavery, &quot;abolishing&quot; slavery did not start the war. The north could not support itself without the souths resources to feed the northern factories. If the war was about ending slavery, don't you think that the Union states (they are fighting to end slavery after all) would of abolished slavery in the states controlled by the Union BEFORE ending it in the southern states? They didn't, slavery was allowed within the union states,  and in areas of the confederate states controlled by the union. If you read the copy of the emancipation proclamation that I posted, it is fairly clear that it is done as a tactical move and not a humanitarian one.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   However, there were other issues that were equally important <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I am not denying that there were other issues contributing to the civil war. I am arguing that revisionist history has labeled Lincoln as a great liberator of oppressed men, and that he led a nation to war to liberate the slaves.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
as far as the other tangent the thread seems to be taking...<br>
Stalin, Hitler, Sadam Hussein:<br>
All nothing more than butchers. Killing someone for their ethnicity or religion  is evil. Numbers killed and the means of doing so are of no difference.<br>

All you can actually do is debate the facts.  Facts are neutral until your mind, or my mind decifers them and we develope an opinion.  One fact is that there are a large number of people who associate the confederate flag, the swastika, and the Soviet Flag with horrible atrocities; and that if you display these symbols you carry both the good and the bad (although the bad burns much brighter in people's minds who see it as bad) that these carry.<br>
