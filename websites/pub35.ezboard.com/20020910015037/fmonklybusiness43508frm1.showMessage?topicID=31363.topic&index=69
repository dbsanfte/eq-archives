There is a huge difference, Mend has a recycle time that takes several minutes, A Pali can celes or wave of prexus during combat several times in that time period. <br>
<br>
Paladins are suppose to be masters of undead fighting not pure melee, and with slay3 they are just that. Ive seen Pali's critical for over 5k with slay3 versus undead mobs.<br>

a level 52 character can excuse himself from the arguement, as you know nothing about the high-end game at all.  Come back when you have gained 8 levels and some AAXP and have managed to play at least one other character class to 55+  You will have at least SOMETHING to offer.<br>
<br>
Roughly same damage as a warrior?<br>
we do 75-80% of the damage of warriors.. as programmed by Verant.. remember melee balancing?<br>
<br>
I am satisfied with my damage output as a SK... My rogue is happy with his damage output as well...<br>
This is fine and balanced.  Rogue is better at Melee damage... this is not a problem.<br>
<br>
Knights cannot tank anywhere near a Warrior against raid mobs... this is due to defensive...  It could be argued that this is &quot;according to plan&quot; if this is the case, then fine... then we just need a role for the knight. (not gonna touch this here, most of the newbie monks wouldnt have a clue what I mean)<br>
<br>
My rogue tanks nearly as well as my SK in XP conditions...  and while grouped with my rogue we have done most places with a monk as a tank...  who needs a plate class? (this includes warriors - and indeed hits them even harder than knights!)<br>
<br>
Defensively, in the places where Knights tank, rogues and monks are nearly as good at taking damage.<br>
<br>
I have seen this solo, I have seen it in groups, I have seen it as two different classes on either side of the coin. (60SK/59ROG)  All it takes is the average appropriately leveled and equipped monk in place of the average plate class, and you will see what I mean.<br>
<br>
If you have something useful to say, please back it up with your experiences...<br>
<br>
Spells function as skills...  spells cost is mana and spell recovery time... skills cost are recharge time... they both are abilties with a cost...<br>
<br>
Monks have mostly innate abilities with no cost...<br>
(as designed) with a decet array of activated skills.<br>
Knight classes have mostly activated abilities with a cost and a decent array of innate abilities...<br>
<br>
the end result should be two different classes with disadvantages and advantages...<br>
<br>
The SK disadvantage is low damage output<br>
The SK advantage is supposed to be overall Toughness<br>
(Armor, Vampiric Regen spells, spells that make the SK hard to kill, etc)<br>
<br>
my rogue's disadvantage is SUPPOSED to be relatively easier to kill than my SK (this is not really true to any great degree)<br>
my rogue's advantage is incredible damage output and even MORE incredible damage output from behind..  along with utility skills...  My rogues damage output is quite noticeably better than my SK... why is my SK's tanking ability not even noticeable?  Add on top of this, my rogues spellbook (backpack) is full of some nice utility spells, and I never have trouble procing an offensive (non-rclick) spell like SLOW at all...<br>
<br>
<br>
A monk's disadvantage?  I havent found it yet...<br>
<br>
A monks advantages...  #1 or #2 damage output, tied for 2nd best tank in game... incredible array of utility skills, most well-equipped monks have an array of spell-functionality anyways using their skills and equipment.<br>
<br>
I am not unhappy with a monks abilities... they are fine...<br>
<br>
what DOESN'T work is when a monk is a better choice for a group due to having higher damage AND the same tanking ability as a plate class.<br>
<br>
The knights have accepted their lesser damage role.<br>
Why shouldn't monks be lesser tanks than plate classes?<br>
<br>
PE is only a small part of the equation.<br>

Therefore you have no clue WHAT you are talkin about.&quot; Guess what, my 52 monk is hardly the first char ive played, he is just my current main, I have played a necro, druid, and bard all to 50 +. Not counting the druid its 55+. <br>
I DO know whats going on in the end game and sorry but you are wrong if you think that sks and pallys cant tank just as well as warriors on high end raid mobs. There are very few raids that REQUIRE defensive to fight, most can be done easily without. Now let me start bringing up the points that warriors have made in regards to luclin fights. Most of them seem to last for upwards of 30 minutes. Yeah that 3 minutes of glory out of 10 is really special huh? The fact of the matter is, that unless you are fighting the aow or something where you NEED defensive to live a paladin or sk can be mt just as well if not better due to all of your options for holding agro.<br>
As for dps. In a raid situation a warrior will NOT be going for pure dps, they are going for agro, which means eb proccing weapons with barely decent ratios. I have read through NUMEROUS parses where even the non mt warriors are barely outdamaging the paladins so somehow I doubt that you are doing only 75% of the damage a warrior is doing unless you have yet to equip yourself with one of the MANY insane 2h weapons that drop from mobs NToV or above.<br>
As for a raid role, I cant help you there, sks havent had too much in the way of an important role although if the new spells go live you soon will have the role of casting all the hate spells on the mt you can. Tanking ability? Yup, id say mitigation wise warriors, pallys, sks, and monks are all roughly equal. Is this because of a fault in the monk class? No, its because of all the insane all/all gear that drops from everything in the high end game now. Is that right? Id say no because as you said, monks shouldnt be equal in mitigation to a plate class but once again, blame vi for putting in incredible gear that any melee class can wear.<br>
To sum up, knights CAN tank 95% of raid mobs just as well as a warrior AND they have the advantage of better agro building to make a pally/sk tank an even better idea. Knights CAN come awfully close in damage to a warrior, much closer than 75%. No monks SHOULDNT be equal at mitigation to a plate class but you cant blame the monks for all this wonderful gear that anyone can wear. My level does nothing to change the fact that these things are true.<br>

In a seb group recently I had to act as tank with ac buffed to 1150 and just under 3k hp and max haste with chanter and cof.  It was all I could do to keep aggro off a 51 rogue and off the chanter casting slow.  Add in the cleric chain casting celestial elixr and it was quite busy, our guilds 53 pally with gear/weapons that cost about 20k less than what I'm wearing/using tanked better.  So i do not want to hear that pallies and SKs cannot tank, if you cannot tank with what you have i suggest you play another class.  Personally I do not like to tank, I was made to deal damage and tank in emergencies/survive pulls.  If the new aa skills assist me with that then I will gladly take em.<br>
