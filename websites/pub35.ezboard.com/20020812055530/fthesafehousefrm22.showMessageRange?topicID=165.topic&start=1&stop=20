And, I must say you guys are crushing all of my hopes. These observations made(in the 'I Hate Stun/Mez' thread) about killing a smite cleric are...discouraging...to say the least. Just the other day, I thought I had found a viable way of dealing with a smite cleric. But, after reading the posts of you, more experienced assassins, it looks like I just got lucky. And, ran across an inexperienced gamer or got a lucky crit off. CRAP!!<br>My kobold critblade is only 22nd lvl. And, doesn't have the more infamous styles and combos(G/AH, PA, etc...). Though garrotte is coming next level(drools). As brief as I can make it; I BS2'd an orange smite cleric with my 2H sword. Sword is non-magical. Used snare poison. Switched to 1H sword/shield(both magical). Thigh Cut,  using disease poison. At this point he either stunned or mezzed me. I don't know which. He backed away and nuked me. I used sprint. Switched back to my 2h while running. Hit him with 'Assault' and ran through him to be out of his LOS before hitting 'stick'. Switched back to 1H/Shield. He cast something else which hurt. I smacked him with 'Assault' again. At this point, neither of us were looking too healthy. He then panicked and tried to run away.  Disease kept him from running very fast and I was 'stuck' to him. I had almost no endu, or no endu left. But, finished him with a couple more swings.<br>Now this was in the newbie BG. So, inexperience may have been a factor in this encounter. I have a 41st lvl troll warrior. And, 30th troll skald. So, I am not unfamiliar with meleeing. <br> The factors that I know were in my favor were that (1.) I knew the specific target I was after. (2.) I could envenom my blades specifically for that target before entering battle. (3.) And, of course, stealth and being the one that actually initiated the fight. I am not highly specced in envenom. Only at lvl6. I didn't really expect to live through the fight. And, in fact, didn't live much longer after his buddies turned around. :-) I was 'taking one for the team', so to speak. That cleric was a key factor in the Alby tanks ripping our tanks apart in a decent sized battle. About 20~ Albs against 20~ Mids. And, I was just hoping to tie him up long enough for a skald or healer to get behind the lines to mez him. <br>Mistakes on his part(1.)Not healing himself. Also, he took his time about backing up(cocky bastard); instead of turning and running and then re-facing. That's why I don't know if he stunned or mezzed me. The stun could've been wearing off and the nuke hit was simoultaneous. Which would make it just a coincidence. Or, he mezzed me. Nuked me and broke his own mez. <br>(2)He didn't call for help- just plain stupid. RvR is a team sport, IMO. And, no one seems to be worth over 2rps apiece in the newb BG. So, it wasn't worth the thrill of a solo kill when he could've just typed 'on me' or 'help'.<br>3. Not using a stealther bodyguard. And, believe me, I do alot of that kind of work out there and I've never hurt for action. :-)<br>But, what I had truly hoped was that the combination and order in which I chose my poisons were a major factor. Snare, for obvious reasons. Disease to knock down his stats and make him have to waste time and mana to heal himself or have his spells severely affected when trying to support his tanks. Remember, I didn't expect to actually *live* through the fight. Just needed to inject the 'nasties' into his sorry backside and hope we prevailed. And, I could get a rez. <br>BTW, we won! And, they ended up chasing the Albs back to their PK. Of course, I was one of the very last  to finally get a rez... They decided to camp the Alb PK for awhile- which is a useless waste of time; instead of coming back to the bridge and rezzing those of us that had died- for you peeps familiar with the BG area.  And, I very nearly released out of frustration over lack of team attitude. My attack was coordinated with the others' main charge through groupchat. So, everyone knew what was going on. <br>So, am I completely wrong about how the disease poison would affect a caster? I've seen the poison tests. But, don't remember seeing any tests performed on a caster. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukeynonokey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keyno Nokey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 2:53:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dealing with Smite Clerics</span><hr size=1> Sounds like you got lucky, good timing on your part.

You need to raise rejuv to 11 to get the first instant (40% heal). Don't get the second instant (group heal) until 23 in rejuv.<br><br>Even with not having an instant he did make a mistake. After he mezzed you (clerics don't get instant stuns) he should have moved back to max range, smited, stunned, smite, smite, then melee with drive evil (PBAE shout on a timer).<br><br>Smite clerics are nasty. IMO thier lesser dmg is offset by their cc abilities. <br><br>Of course I don't fight any cc class.

My 41st warrior, of course, stands almost no chance against one. With My skald, I've learned to just skald stun(really a mez) them and leave them for later. But, that's makes me feel like a complete wimp when I do that. I've also been able to counter with my skald songs. IMO, the skald is the best class in Midgard for dealing with those evil beasts. I've used my speed, 2h hammer, DD's, snares, and stun to some good effect out there against them. But, again, that depends on who sees who first. What has been cast, etc.... Also, the kills were all in the BG's. I don't know how I'll fare against them in later levels. Probably, just as poorly as every other tank class. :-)<br>But, since this is a rogue forum, I was more concerned about my critblade. And, figured you more experienced killers may be able to guide me. Is there anyone that knows what effects disease poison would have on a smite cleric? Or, have a guess as to which poisons they think would work best against them. I use a 2h sword to BS2(with snare)/Thigh Cut . Then switch to 1h/shield(disease). I rarely use L-A. And, don't really ever plan to. LA 8- and, emergency use only. <br>Or, am I going to have to deal with them as a SB the same way I deal with them as my massive, over-muscled troll warrior....see what *might* be a smite cleric...run away like a little girl from an icky spider. <br>Any data on other casters would be welcomed, also.

Just like the healer class in Midgard. You can talk to healers and they will tell you they are broken (I agree I have a level 31 healer). But the class is powerful.<br> <br> Bards have power in their ability to spec in a manner that fits how they wish to play, it is a very flexible class. To many people this means fun.. this means power.<br> <br> If I lead you to believe that any of these classes were &quot;overpowered&quot; I am sorry. What I was trying to show is that &quot;many&quot; of the classes out there are POWERFUL in some way. And as such, assassins are well within the curve on classes and power in DAoC.<br> <br> Healers need some love.. Bards need a good amount of attention from mythic too. But these classes are indeed powerful to the point some are already saying they are overpowered on their own boards. Just go read them.. so many classes have people on their own boards crying for a way to &quot;prevent&quot; a nerf, because they are not use to having power like DAoC gives us.<br> <br> Just for information.. If anyone does not already know.. Mythic is not looking to &quot;balance&quot; classes. They have always said that they were trying to make sure that &quot;REALMS&quot; were balanced. And that is why things are the way they are. <br> <br> It's not &quot;even&quot; melee for each realm or &quot;even&quot; magic for each realm. It's an offsetting of the two. Balancing magic against might and brut force, that's what they are doing. A good hint at this is to look at what the relics are.. yep each realm has 2.. a power (magic), and a strength (melee) relic. That is the balance folks.<br> <br> Mid is to the melee side of the balance tables.. and hib is to the magic side of the balance tables.. with the lovely Camelot of alb sitting right in the middle of the balance tables. So on your server, which way is the table tilting? Now take a look at all the servers and see how your realm is doing there. It's just something to think about.<br> <br> As many games in the past have found out.. trying to balance classes is just to much of a problem for any game that plans to keep adding new content for their paying customers. By having the &quot;vision&quot; to look at the big picture and only balance 3 realms against each other, you can do much much more and allow some classes to be powerful and fun to play, and not cookie cutter for all the realms.<br> <br> I am rambling..
