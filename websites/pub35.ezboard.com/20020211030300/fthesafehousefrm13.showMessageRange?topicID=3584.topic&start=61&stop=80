<br>
- Epic parts can be done prior to 50, however if there are any of the infogiving NPCs that don't respond 49- levels, you don't get much done when nobody did the spoiler for you.<br>
- Rogue epic can be done by the book (not faking) at level 50. At least all the NPCs that I interacted with, responded clearly out loud at 50, though I dinged to 51 before fighting the general. However I got the box and all from Stanos at level 50 so I bloody well assume he'd reward me for giving the quest too.<br>
<br>
Even though some epic mobs might respond before level 50 I'd vote those being bugs by Verant and they actually tried to do it so that epic mobs require level 50 (not 51) to interact with.<br>

Some of them (shaman epic for instance) are designed to be started at an early level (30+ or so) and be worked on as the character progresses in levels over time.  Others are designed to only be started after the character has reached the 50+ stage of their career.<br>
<br>
I imagine all zones in all expansions will be fair game as well.  The epic quests for the other classes took characters to all existing parts of the world at the time they were created.  For example, the shaman epic has steps that take place in Freeport, Ocean of Tears, The Hole, and City of Mists (multiple steps in the CoM, including the final fight).  The monk epic has one major fight in Mines of Nurga and the final fight in Lake of Ill Omen, though it has its early steps in places like Erudin.  The epic quests were put in before the release of Velious, but I imagine that had they been implemented later they would have included some Velious content as well.<br>
<br>
The beastlord epic will likely take place in all parts of Norrath and Luclin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucrokevi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CroKevi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/4/02 4:02:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3584.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Epic NPC..?</span><hr size=1> <i>Alhareen the Just says 'Hail and well met, <b>CharName</b>.

<br>
All the epic quests EXCEPT THE ROGUE EPIC (100% of the rogue epic can be done on Antonica, Faydwer, and the Plane of Hate; see <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://matt.waggoner.com/ragebringer.html)">matt.waggoner.com/ragebringer.html)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> require you to have access to the old world (Antonica, Faydwer, Odus, and the original 3 Planes) *as well as* Kunark. I don't know why this is, but I do know (from an inside source <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) that the developer who designed the Rogue epic didn't want people to necessarily have to buy Kunark in order to do the expansion.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic... since you have to have Luclin in order to be a Beastlord, it's reasonable to think that the BST epic MIGHT have some components on Luclin. The might NOT put any parts on Luclin, though, since it would be kind of unfair to Beastlords since there will probably be a lot of people who don't have Luclin yet, so Beastlords might have trouble finding enough people to help. (Maybe not, though, I'm just saying they might have taken that into consideration when creating the quest.)<br>
<br>
Granted, all the epics required you to have the Kunark expansion (except Rogues), but the epics weren't implemented until 4 months after Kunark came out, so that meant there was a lot more time for people to get Kunark-enabled so that they could help out. (There are already beastlords in the high-50s, so it's not like no Beastlords are ready for their epic pieces.)<br>
<br>
I think that the BST epic probably DOES have parts in Kunark, since it's been 20 months since Kunark came out, and the vast majority of players will be Kunark-enabled by this point. I can't prove this, but it's my opinion. I don't think it's reasonable to make any conclusion about whether the BST epic has parts in Luclin, however (I'll take the audacious step of assuming it won't have any parts in Velious, since none of the other epics do. Although I wonder if the BST Velious armor quests have been enabled in Kael/SS/Thurg.)<br>
<br>
But, I guess we'll find out eventually, won't we? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uyalum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yalum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/4/02 7:01:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3584.topic&index=71>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Epic NPC..?</span><hr size=1> Just to nitpick, the Paladin epic doesn't require Kunark either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udroledefiantdagger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drole Defiantdagger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/4/02 8:25:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3584.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Epic NPC..?</span><hr size=1> Thread about the BST epic eh?
