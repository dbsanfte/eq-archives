Also realize that when GROUPED, due to the group xp bonus being a multiplier rather than an additive, the difference in xp gained per kill will indeed be higher, especially when at the full 36% bonus for being in a full group. Same goes for the zone experience bonus. Ideally one would want the highest ZEM bonus and GEM bonus as high numbers in both of those multipliers would make for a very large difference in the numbers. This would explain why full groups in Sleeper's Tomb are raking in so much xp. The higher multipliers will widen the gap between mobs farther than it appears above. <p><b>Raviel Darkfyre</b><BR><table style="filter:glow(color=Red, strength=3)"><font color="black" size=2><b>Insidious Blood</b></font></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uijusth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ijusth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1712<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/5/02 9:53:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=309.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hard Data on Exp change</span><hr size=1> ok but how do these numbers look for 56-59 and also 51-55 players.  It all seems to be based on differential and by definition the 60 player will have the widest differential (13 levels on the chart) from a 47.  A 55 will find the 47 a harder challenge but will we find the points the same?  We shouldn't but are the points in the linked table a fixed amount.  Of course if they are fixed, since the amount needed per level is relatively smaller the increase per kill becomes larger. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzikoz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zikoz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 508<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/5/02 9:59:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=309.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hard Data on Exp change</span><hr size=1> Evilnight, I agree we need to talk about it.

This total information should then be the basis for determining whether we solo or group and at what level and against what targets.  Perhaps these new xp mods hit the level 60 crowd most.  If as a level 55 I only see a 10% reduction against a level 47 I think I can live with that but if I see a 70% redux just like the 60s do that would sux.  It would basically seem to force the 60 to go after a level 52 for equivalent xp (ie 8 levels less).  Of course a level 52 isn't as easy a target but isn't that the whole point of thing - to make it harder not easier?  If you want it easy stay fighting those low risk items.  You want fast xp then take a risk solo or join a group.<br>As previous posts stated now that grouping will be more desireable more groups will occur.  Personally I think it might make sense to go into allakhazam, look in each zone and find as tough a mob as you think you can handle, determine spawns and risk and go fight them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uevilnight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EvilNight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 944<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/5/02 11:27:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=309.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.johncscifisite.com/spaceballs/rasberry.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hard Data on Exp change</span><hr size=1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pre Patch&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Post Patch&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Level&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Solo XP&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Group XP&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Solo XP&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Group XP&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Difference<br>47&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 198810&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 270382&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 69538&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 94572&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 34.98%<br>48&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 207360&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 282010&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 82944&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 112804&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 40.00%<br>49&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 216090&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 293882&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 97240&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 132246&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 45.00%<br>50&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 225000&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 306000&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 112500&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 153000&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 50.00%<br>51&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 234090&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 318362&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 128749&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 175099&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 55.00%<br>52&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 243360&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 330970&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 146016&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 198582&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 60.00%<br>53&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 252810&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 343822&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 164326&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 223483&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 65.00%<br>54&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 262440&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 356918&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 238820&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 324795&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 91.00%<br>55&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 272250&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 370260&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 265443&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 361002&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 97.50%<br>56&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 282240&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 383846&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 293529&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 399199&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 104.00%<br>57&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 292410&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 397678&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 0&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 0&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 0.00%<br>58&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 302760&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 411754&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 354228&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 481750&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 117.00%<br><br>These numbers can't be quite right... they don't reflect reports we are getting from folks.

If anyone has some solo numbers we could use that are from AAXP and before the patch, we could probably get a better look at the governing formula by comparing it to AAXP numbers now after the patch. <p><b>Raviel Darkfyre</b><BR><table style="filter:glow(color=Red, strength=3)"><font color="black" size=2><b>Insidious Blood</b></font></table></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uevilnight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EvilNight</A> at: 9/5/02 11:32:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=phungkuu>Phung Kuu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/5/02 11:37:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=309.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> How do you do an AA baseline?<br><br>Exp points are Exp points.

I haven't had a chance to play much, but I did get a few kills in. I grind in PoM, and until yesterday, every blue con kill in the zone gave me 1% AA Exp. Most of the mobs that I fight are level 55+, so I'm focussing on the high end here. The first 2 kills I did (Chuckles the Great and Brenn in AiW4) gave me 3% AA Exp each. The third kill (Grenn in AiW4) gave me 4% AA Exp. These were &quot;solo&quot; kills as I had my cleric bot ungrouped as usual. I could see some rounding errors that would make me get 2% exp under the numbers posted here, but I'm not even remotely close to that. The modified exp for 56-58ish mobs (Grenn/Brenn) was on the order of 300% of the old experience, no where near the 117% claimed here. I'm guessing whatever zone this person was in got a huge ZEM nerf, or they missed something else critical.<br><br>I'm looking forward to trying some 60-65 mobs and see how those go. <p><center><p><map name="GrasMap0"><area href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21306" shape="rect" coords="75, 4, 396, 53"><area href="http://www.archonsofchaos.com" shape="rect" coords="154, 87, 399, 131"></map><img border="0" src="http://home.attbi.com/~jemalino/grashopa.jpg" usemap="#GrasMap0" width="400" height="174"></p><BR><font size = "1"><i>"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!" </i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usoladan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soladan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 634<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/5/02 11:52:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=309.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hard Data on Exp change</span><hr size=1> Okay..I don't have exact numbers to post, but last night our guild was doing ToV for armor drops.
