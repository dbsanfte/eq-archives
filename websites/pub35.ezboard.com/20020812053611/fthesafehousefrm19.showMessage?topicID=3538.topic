It would render the archer completely invisible to stealth unless the assassins or opposing archers were almost right on top of the person. <br>

Not gonna happen anymore....<br>
<br>
Those that are grouped usually hang tight with their group and therefor arent a target, until outright battle starts :)<br>
<br>
If you think see hidden sucks, imagine  watching an archer walk towards you, pull his bow and hit you for 600+ while hidden :) You only get it for 1 minute every 30 but when that happens theres litterally nothing we can do (again, if we are also solo).<br>
<br>
This change forces grouping which I think is a good thing. OK, Ill admit it, sticking solo archers is fun too :)  <p><center><br>"I am still learning" <br>

<br>
Sorry, Aurelius, but I have to call BS.  Archers in tight RvR groups suck just as much as they did in tight PvE groups, for the same reasons.  Watch what they actually do sometime.  They get one bow shot off before the actual combat commences (that shot fails more often in RvR than it did in PvE), then end up in melee because the game won't let them shoot at melees, but melees sure love them.  Since they didn't spec to be melee-fighters, they suck in melee.  Sure, they can still shoot at casters, but they are considered just as soft as casters as far as easy RPs go.  Let's face it, Mythic designed them extremely poorly as far as close-in fighting goes, which is what they end up being forced into.  The revenge mindset rampant right now doesn't allow archers to fall back like casters (not that casters last long either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I don't long for the days when archers were demi-gods of the battlefield.  They needed to be brought down to mortal level.  Mythic said they'd fixed them on several occasions.  Each time, they missed the mark because they ignored what seemed obvious to everyone in the community, that full spec stealth plus range was too much(Side note: Mythic is doing the same thing to Smite Clerics.  Community complains of the CC abilities, so Mythic nerfs smite.  Go figure <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That's for another forum, though).  Mythic finally addresses archer stealth and removes its effectiveness for archers without giving them their spec points back.  Right now, archers have almost all of the weakness of robe casters, without the advantages.<br>
<br>
Maybe when the vaporware respec goes in, archers will stop complaining so much.  They'll be able to remove all points from stealth, just as the new minstrels are doing, and spec enough melee to last more than two hits.  As far as Scouts complaining that they can no longer scout, I have no answer short of ripping out SH and going with another solution.  I've always favored limiting archers to half, or one-third, spec in stealth and making Detect Hidden more powerful.<br>
<br>
I've played a robe, an archer, a minstrel, and a couple of assassins.  I like to think my experience is balanced enough to look for class balance, instead of the revenge-seeking I see rampant in the areas of the community.  Let's not let our glee at being able to gut archers now blind us to class balance.  If we do, then we're no better than Mythic and their ham-handed attempts at balance. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uromeosix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RomeoSix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/13/02 3:31:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uadman2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adman 2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 1:13:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3538.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't think archers have it that bad</span><hr size=1> Um couple things. <br>
<br>
We made archers to solo. If we wanted to group we'd have rolled another class. It's not fair to totally alter our playstyle this many months in.<br>
<br>
Play a hunter in a group sometime. We're worthless. We can't scout. We can't get a shot off before the tanks in the group kill the enemy. We have lousy defense. Worthless pets. No group buffs.<br>
<br>
And when I'm by myself and I pop truesight and see an assasin, I crit him and get a second shot before he closes and I still get pounded to death.<br>
<br>
Hunters, who already were lame due to taking the biggest brunt of the damage nerfs, are now nearly worthless and hardly enjoyable to play.<br>
<br>
Most would agree, just get rid of see hidden and truesight... and make detect hidden the skill it should have been. <p><img src=http://members.aol.com/nycdamian/seeksig3.jpg>

<br>
Most archers I know have a reasonable spec in blades because of the assassin threat.  They have something like 30 in blades  +items which makes them deadly against leather.<br>
<br>
I personally think Hunters are cool because they have lots of options in combat.  If I rolled an archer, I would choose a Hunter.  However at this point, I think I would spec lower in stealth than people have in the past because it is now more valuable to have good melee than be invisible for an archer.<br>
<br>
I do think the beastmaster line needs some work to make it more attractive.  In concept it is cool but apparently in practice it is unpopular.<br>

<br>
You've obviously never played an archer.  If an archer tries to fire at a target that is meleeing, they receive a message to the effect of &quot;You can't get a clear shot!&quot; over and over again (they receive this about 90% of the time).  Once that target is out of melee, the archer can fire freely.  If you've been around for awhile, you should remember the archers complaining sometime back that tanks were keeping melee-mode on all the time when traveling, thus preventing archers from shooting them.  This is yet another reason why casters are primary targets of archers.  Casters can't be in melee mode if they want to cast.  Combine that with casters' paper armor and you have easy pickings for an archer.<br>
<br>
As for archers having a good melee spec, that may be true for new archers rolling up now.  What about the established archers, though?  They don't the option right now of speccing high melee.  Their points are spent.  If Mythic ever puts in the respec, that can change.  Right now, it can't.<br>
<br>
The question about Hunters was their evade level.  It's Evade I.  Even a lot of the archer-haters admit that hunters are fairly gimped right now.  Light armor, pitiful chance to evade, short range for bows, low chance to find a pet, and it'll be grey if you find one, and a spell line that is pitiful.  All archers are hurting, but Hunters are the beaten red-headed stepchild of archers.<br>

We all agree: Hunters are gimped. Sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  edit:</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Yes, you can shoot things in melee, just not with a critical shot. That's why a while back they toned down archer's PvE bow aggro a LOT, because before the mob would be half dead and when you'd pop it with an arrow it would come STRAIT for you. Now, unless you pull, it's a harder to get aggro off of anyone with arrows. Really glad they made that reduction. I don't really like to stand in a group and shoot things with my bow though, it wastes waaaay too many arrows. Plus my melee is good and it's easier to take aggro off the healer with my swords. <p><BR>

Why is it that hunters have lame pets again?  Is it that there are no monsters that are worth 'mastering' or is it that your spell won't permit getting a good one.

At low levels, a Hunter can get up to a blue pet.  By level 20, you can only charm greens.  By the time a Hunter is ready for full RvR in the frontier (lvl 40+), I'm told that all pets are grey.  I never got that high, so I can't say from personal experience (my Hunter went inactive sometime ago).  On top of that, pets of the proper level are scarce in the frontier.  This is assuming that you go full-spec Beastcraft.  If you don't, then your pets may conn lower sooner, as the spells are capped in level mob that can be charmed, and have to be replaced with higher spells.<br>

I seem to remember a post where the devs admitted that pets are meant to be merely fluff when it comes to RvR.

<br>
Hunters get Evade 1 while Scouts and Rangers get Evade 3. Mythic has said this is an &quot;oversight&quot; from beta when Hunters had Evade 1 and Chain Armor. The armor was dropped to studded and evade was never increased.<br>
<br>
Hunters pets are 80% or 85% of their level, I forget which. The highest level pet a 50th hunter can have is level 41 or green. These are few and far between, the pets are usually gray.  Pet agro on finding stealthers is extremely low and the couple commands for pets do not work well at all. Matt Firor has stated that pets for hunters were just a &quot;novelty' so things won't get better.<br>
<br>
Hunters bow damage is the worst of the archer classes.  While Scouts and Rangers can get the fast bows of Hunters to shoot fast Hunters can not have the slow speed bows that the other Archers have so the damage is lower by a decent margin.<br>
<br>
Hunter Melee- Where to start? Hunters are the worst melee Archer class by a decent margin. The Hunter and Ranger TL and various Hunters and Rangers tested melee between the 2 classes and rangers with low weapon spec and low CD spec can out melee Hunters who use spear and have a high melee spec.  Spear has decent front loaded damage on the first hit if there is no delay but is way too slow to compete with Assassins, Ranger CD and Scout Shield Slams then Crits.<br>
<br>
So basically you end up with a class that has the worst defensive abilities (only slightly better then cloth casters vs other Archer and Melee classes), Worst melee abilities, and poorest Bow damamge of the 3 Archers.<br>
<br>
Hunters can be fun to play, even being repeatedly ganked by gray assassins who see through stealth and lead groups to kill them. But, compared to the other Archer classes and melee classes are pretty bad off.<br>

<br>
Pets, even grey ones, are extremely useful if you play them right. I've taken down red casters by throwing a grey pet on them first.<br>
<br>
But pets are a pain to deal with because they're hard to find. At 48 I can find blue pets, it's just very very rare. I can find green ones fairly easily.<br>
<br>
Pets were supposed to be what made up for our low bow damage, but you don't see too many hunters using them due to the various reasons such as the fact that if a guard patrol finds your pet, they make a beeline for you no matter how far away you are. Things that need to happen to hunter:<br>
<br>
Evade 3... NOW!<br>
<br>
Access to higher damage bows: Scouts and Rangers not only have higher delay bows, they have Mastery of Archery, which speeds up their bow draw times to near-hunter speeds.<br>
<br>
Summonable pets: that are at LEAST yellow con to us.<br>
<br>
A group buff added to our Beastcraft line: nothing uber, just something to make a group desire a hunter in PvE and RvR<br>
<br>
I call for thse 4 changes, as well as the elimination of See Hidden and Truesight. It was a lot more fun before 1.50 - Assasins owned me just fine with Detect Hidden.... now they just farm free RPs from me. <p><img src=http://members.aol.com/nycdamian/seeksig3.jpg>

<br>
This is a skill that is TOO POWERFUL!!!!!!!!! It only costs 8 points where true sight is 10 points. It is a passive skill where true sight is an active skill with a 1 minute duration and a 30 minute recycle time. And level makes NO DIFFERENCE any longer for detection. <br>
<br>
Normal detection by an assassin or other player is based on level and stealth differences. I haven't played with it much to determine exact ranges, but it does make sense that if a lower level character with low stealth is more likely to be seen by an even level character with maxed stealth or a higher level character. I am more likely to get ganked by an assassin before I get it from another archer, happens to me ALL the time. And detect hidden does work, kinda anyway.<br>
<br>
Now with see hidden, you can get an assassin to L1 R8 by whatever means, and now that assassin, no matter what his level is, and see every archer and minstrel out there.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel that one of two things should happen. <br>
<br>
1) Remove both true sight and see hidden in their entirety. (my personal choice)<br>
<br>
2) Modify see hidden such that it has some function with stealth skill. Such as increasing detection range or reducing effective stealth skill within a certain range.<br>
<br>
Just my thought and opinions on this. <br>
<br>
Flame if you will, but you won't change my mind on this.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/utanglebones00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanglebones00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/02 11:58:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3538.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Instead of nerfing see hidden..  </span><hr size=1>  See hidden is WAY too powerful.
