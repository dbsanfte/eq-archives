I'm a 31 NS. Im in a guild where everyone is 40+ so I can't even get a group with guildies. Soloing is something I would normally enjoy, but in this game it is a living hell. And I have no choice, I am forced to solo. And finding places to solo, things to hunt is becoming harder and harder. Now that the logs with the Dampwood Mites are all grey, I can't seem to find anyplace to solo where I don't get killed peroidically by a mob that pops on me or wanders in, while Im fighting another . And of course they don't do this at the beginning of a fight they wait till near the end when I am out of stamina and/or low hp and run slower. So I end up wasting about two hours out of every three.<br>
As for damage, well, I have all yellow armor and weapons, player made enchanted. I am currently 100% Piercing spec. And I have to stick to blues. Yellows are to iffy.<br>
I dont know what to ask for to fix this. More damage? Not likely. I think I would settle for a way to escape. Sprint sucks. Having a backup weapon with snare poison on it is no good. I am always so close to dead by the time I get it swapped out and administered that I still run as slow as the snared mob, or get killed by its huge attack radius.<br>
Now, since there are level 50 Nightshades out there, obviously levelling is possible. I just wonder if anyone has done it completely solo? Has anyone ever made to to lvl 40 solo the whole way? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utalchi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talchi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 9:50:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Fighting Infils and SBs</span><hr size=1> I have to say, and again I have a level 35 NS, that I can fight yellow con infils and sbs and win. But, its very close and I have to get the PA jump on them. If they get the PA jump on me, then I die, but they normally have 3/4 health, while I would only have 1/4 when I get the jump.<br>
<br>
My starts are as follows, I am going off of memory also. All are with items.<br>
<br>
Stealth 38<br>
Pierce 28<br>
Envenom 32<br>
CD 9<br>
CS 29<br>
<br>
Now, I also have a level 45 Warden, 38 Druid and 25 Ranger. What does that mean, means I have cash to give this guy. Buying and having awesome equipment, I use the jewel from DF the one with +5 envenom, makes a big difference. If I didn't have that, things would be much harder. I got about 4500rps in the level 30-35 bg with this guy, in a week. Now, the guild I am in is small, everyone is over level 42, so no groups with them, well very rarely. Spamming for 30-60 minutes in DF, CM looking for a group is not what I call fun. Flagging myself as LFG and killing blues in DF is not fun either.<br>
<br>
Now, I started a keen on Guinivere, without the financial funding, it's going to be much harder. The only advantage is there are a lot of keens and I can prob get a group.<br>
<br>
But, go to a server where there are few hibs, create a shade, even join a guild, but make sure its a small guild. See what it is like to try and level without Pling or without money. It's hard.<br>

My best Bard DD shout is lucky to hit 100 damage against most yellow cons due to body resist.  Your shout will be cold resist, which also means void/darkness resist.  People will be stacking up to the nines in cold resist.<br>
<br>
My DD shout is rated at 114, yours is 62, a little more then 1/2.  If I'm DD shouting for maybe 100-120, you'll prolly be hitting for around 50-60.  The damage for this shout should be upped.  Either that or more functionality added to your magic line.<br>

<br>
After all he has the perfect group to level himself with so he hasn't faced a lot of the problems nightshades do. I'd like to see him use his detaunt styles in RvR anyhow.<br>
<br>
Wait he'll just respec.. which wasn't even going to happen for most of the time the rest of us have played nightshades.<br>
<br>
Anyhow on the one-shot no longer stay hidden thing, while it being gone won't kill me, I'm more bothered by the principle.<br>
<br>
The give the reason for taking away something is that we didn't need anything more.. so shouldn't that have meant we should stay the same?<br>
<br>
It's like saying you don't need anymore soda cause you're glass is full, so I'm emptying your glass. That's the sense that makes.<br>
<br>
Also it has been said we'd be complete when disguise came.. but it's not coming so we'll never be complete?<br>
<br>
And in any case, when both Shadowblades and Inflitrators (our competetors) say that we are rather weak, that's gotta say something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 10:54:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fighting Infils and SBs</span><hr size=1> BTW, I meant to add pretty much the same thing Maiya and Stryfe said -- fixing the variance of the shout wont really help the Shade much.

PLZ listen to Elaa.<br>
<br>
Improve our shout dd, and not just the dmg variance. It needs to make up for our other offensive woes in some way and that means it needs to do more dmg period.<br>
<br>

Being annoyed by this bug I am, but after a few days of it bugging the hell out of me, i just simply learned the simple art of clicking on sprint before stealth.  Unless i'm being chased down by the 5 skalds who would rather all use their shouts on me than chase me down with speed.  but in that case it's irrelevant.<br>
<br>
<br>
My biggest thing would be the lack of shade items (cs mainly.)  The DF merchants having stealth items for infiltrators and not for shades though seems pretty dull and raises a question to my mind, is that are they thinking when they decide who to give what?<br>
<br>
Itemguy1:  <br>
Man those infiltrators sure have more points than the other two assassin classes.  what kinda items should we have available in Darkness Falls for them?<br>
Itemguy2:  <br>
stealth stuff man!@!<br>
<br>
Also, that the 30 epic reward for Infs is a cloak +2 stealth and 13 to dex (maybe wrong on dex.)  Me wearing the Cloak of Obscurement that was so much fun to run around and spend all that time on.<br>

<br>
Pretend you're Taco, Mr. Ranger TL, and just lie about how terrible our class is. We can't solo grays without a group, our attacks actually heal instead of harm our opponents, our arrows, er poisons always miss, er are resisted, and the whole Nightshade community (say we make up 25% of every server) is going to cancel their accounts if they don't met our demands, and we'll get their little dog too! Make sure to mail this to Sanya and don't send in TL reports anymore since TL reports get ignored by Mythic anyway.<br>
<br>
If we're going to draw up some pathetically easy requests for Mythic to perform, since we know they won't actually program anything difficult, we should <b>demand</b>  a dramatic increase in our spell damage. Give me the code Mythic, I bet I can do it for you... <i>Jalena backspaces over lousy damage number and types in improved damage number, saves file, and emails it to Mythic.</i><br>
<br>
If pretending to be Taco doesn't work, we'll just have to all send nice little letters to Sanya (since she's the only one at Mythic who seems to matter when it comes to class changes) with titles like: DISGRUNTLED NIGHTSHADE, or maybe NIGHTSHADE SPELLS KILL OUR OPPONENTS, BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY DIE LAUGHING AT HOW PATHETIC THE DAMAGE IS.<br>
<br>
And yes, like everyone else who plays Camelot, I'm thoroughly annoyed with Mythic. Unlike everyone else, I have enough of a sense of humor to still joke about it.<br>
<br>
Oh, I almost forgot: There is only one other major problem. <b>Leveling sucks!</b> If Mythic wants to watch hamsters run on a treadmill, I promise to buy them a gift certificate for Pets R Us. The experience curve from levels 41 to 50 was obviously hand-crafted by Satan and his little helpers. I ask Mythic to exorcise themselves and tone down the amount of life I have to waste to get close to being balanced at level 50; especially since anyone below level 50 in RvR serves no purpose but target practice.<br>
<br>
P.S. Take nothing serious about me but my underlying points: Increasing our spell damage is easy and it would benefit our class, thus Mythic should do it or the poodle gets it.<br>

<br>
im sure stuff is great for you in your optimal daily group at level 10 or whatever your current level is, but this game changes so drastically past level 42, by the time you rolled around to being that level, your wonderful insight on level 10 class balance would most likely have put your class in the shitter had you any input to its balancing.<br>
<br>
it takes some brass balls to simply assume that every nightshade except you has specced their class to 50 incorrectly, and that is the sole reason for the class's weaknesses.<br>
<br>
take the 40 base str/con shade against the 50 base str/con kobold.  they are already down 10con worth of hp, down 10str worth of damage, and kobolds have higher base hp per level, and also have the option to starting their class as a norseman, who has 60 base str and con.  nightshades get to pick between a 40 str/con elf, or 40 str/con lurikeen, and would be hard pressed to find +75 worth of items in con and possibly strength to even come close to caps.<br>
<br>
toss them a @#%$ large variance shout and call it even?  not hardly.  the class needs help, and anyone who thinks otherwise is below level 30, or sees the world through some very nice rose colored glasses. <p><a href="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=38056&raceid=10&classid=44">Dither Disgustipated</a><BR>

<br>
i can tell you for a fact there is nothing wrong with nightshades...when i stopped playing evlimeca on galahad she was the number one ranked ns across all servers...nothing is wrong with them in rvr...i also play on the same server with the number one ranked sb across all servers, after the la nerf, he knows that fighting me is a big a chance on death for his part as mine.<br>
<br>
i rerolled my ns, yes and right now im 34 pierce 30 crit 17 cd 10? venom i think and 8 stealth (autotrained)<br>
i plan to be 40 stealth 40 crit 40 pierce 17 celtic dual and 37 venom when odne..so i will be almost the same tmeplate as my shad on galahad....which is probably the most balanced shade tmeplate you cna ask for.<br>
<br>
is it hard to level no...the nightshade makes a superior puller to any other class in hib especially at low levels with champ spells taking so much mana, i dont have great gear and still light tank to pull aggro off casters/healers and do a fine job at it...<br>
<br>
the problem as i see it is that the average nightshade contributes nothing to his group that someone else isnt doin better...most shades dont pull..they stealth before pull crit a mob and expect to not get aggro after doing alot of dmg...imo this isnt the way to play the class...funny enough i play my way and level fast, as for my spec..it was jsut to get higher dmg in pve, nothing sotps you from pulling or light tanking with lower pierce/cd than i have now....the only thing that stops someone is themself.<br>
<br>
as for tweaking the class i'd wait until respec and see how badly we do against infs with 50 pierce....also remember plz zedia that alot of shades want to go out and solo...which means theyre buffless usually hitting buffed opponents...which shouldnt be a fair fight anyways....solution do like everoyne else in th game and get a group..it's better rp's anyways, i used to push like 20-23k a day of soloing, in a grop i can break 40 someties 50..highest single day i made 56k...i don't see how a weak class can steadily perform at a rate like that.<br>
<br>
<br>
dither i really think alot of the difference in the classes is made up in rsa....where the nightshade has a huge advatange over both the inf and the sb...viper is ok..it makes sure anoyne dies...but wild arcana is a consistant killer.....im not exactly sure how your stealth run speed or vanish stack up to either of those abiltiies. I've played the game past 42..a level a day is no problem..on my original shade i averaged a bub an hour at 49 before the exp increase, doing glimmer strikers and warshades in ez. <br>
<br>
i'll let you peeps think what you like tho...tweak the class give us more abilities, and i'll make number one shade again on the new one whee....but even then i'm sure some kooldood will come and tel me i don't know what im talking about again... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udivsgaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>divsgaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 5:13:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> btw</span><hr size=1> also please keep i mind when you post about all the things i wont have to encounter, that i've already played when perf could be blocked, when pets didnt stop chasing, when perf didnt stop bt, played with no 2.2 played with no shout, played thorugh a huge poison nerf, played when cs styles did half damage,played with no rsp, no battleground for free rp's, 1/2 my dunegouns itemized, no exp bonus, less quests. and still i managed to levle to 50 and stay on my servers top 25 through all of this....<br>

and of course there is more than one way to spec a shade...but there's always going to be one thats more effecient than others.<br>

i really dunno what to tell folks...im not the only one who erolled as a shade..there are people from albion on galaahd rerolling who are 33 now and im only 34...thisis the first time they've leveld...shout dmg isnt going to fix getting gorups..and we dont need to be buffed in rvr. if you want to fix pve, give some sort of regen, possibly buffs...do something other than saying here you go heres more dmg...our problem isnt dmg, it's utility...and right now the only thing hleping with that is a weak dd that doesnt pull much aggro, and a weak shout that pulls nearly none. if you fix it the problem youll find is that the mob you ping with shout will get aggro on the shade who's sitting there beating on it scoffing at the idea of using scorpion because no dmg bonus then he dies in 3 hits. how much fun will that be?!?!<br>

<br>
If you suggest hard solutions, Mythic will ignore you. If you give them something easy to do, that will help you solo your way to 50 they might listen.<br>
<br>
Mythic refuses to allocate the resources to make any sweeping changes, so you have to suggest brain-dead easy things for them to fix.<br>
<br>
When you ask for new spells, skills, abilities, etc... Mythic just puts that on the backburner. The way Mythic has handled disguise should be everyone's clue that Mythic is done with us. If they can get Joebob the Graphics guy to adjust some numbers in a spreadsheet and make the Nightshades quiet down for a few months, they just might do it.<br>
<br>
But they're not going to pull Sterling Superdev over and code anything new for us. There's no incentive. They're not going to have a brainstorming session to figure out how to help the Nightshades be more group-useful. Again, there's no incentive to waste that much time on us.<br>
<br>
And honestly, with the dang Trade Window bug STILL plagueing the game. I don't want them wasting the time on Nightshades. I want guild housing, I want better RvR rewards, I want spellcrafting... and I also want them to spend an hour giving my Nightshade some less humorous spell damage.<br>
<br>
You've gotta nickle and dime developers for changes. Asking for about tree-fiddy all at once doesn't go over well.<br>

Shadowblades, with LA, have a much easier time of this, because of the superior design of LA.  An easy solution would be to take the LA design and apply it CD(read: copy the LA code to Hibernia[Albion] and rename it CD[DW]).<br>

<br>
It's not a perception that the Nightshade is bad, it's the perception that a Hero, Druid, Bard, or Warden would be 3 times more useful.<br>
<br>
Too many chefs spoil the soup, and too many classes spoil the game. You end up with classes that are not balanced in terms of the roles they can assume. Assassins have one role they are strong in: damage. Even when you add in the lessor roles of pull, debuff, and scout. It just doesn't add up.<br>
<br>
Similar things happen in other realms.<br>
<br>
In Midgard the optimals are: Warrior (tank/damage), Healer (heal/CC/buff), Runemaster (bubble/damage), Shaman (buff/heal/damage). (Only the Runemaster is a popular class to play, hence Midgard's problems--everyone wants to be a hybrid.)<br>
<br>
In Albion: Cleric (heal/damage/buff), Armsman (tank/damage), Theurgist (bubble/damage), Sorceror (CC/damage), Minstrel (regen/CC/damage). Notice how everyone has a damage component here... everyone plays to do damage, all the classes in Albion have the chance to dish out some respectable damage.<br>
<br>
It's not just Nightshades/assassins that have difficulty getting groups. But there's only 7 roles to play in DAOC: Tank, heal, crowd control, bubble, damage, regen, and buff. Assassins don't do any of the roles better than all the other classes, and thus we're second, or third pick for open spots in groups.<br>
<br>
So when we say the Nightshade is weak, and it is... our damage is below where it should be... we are really referring to the fact that in PvE Nightshades have low utility for groups when compared to the necessities provided by Heros, Wardens, Druids, and Bards.<br>
