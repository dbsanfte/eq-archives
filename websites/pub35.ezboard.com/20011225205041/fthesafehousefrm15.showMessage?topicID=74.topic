I wasn't taking advantage of hide, but he wasn't healing either just straight melee so we could work on our tactics.  The problem was I would maybe do slightly more damage but he had around 400hp more than me so it just wasn't enough.  Especially with me only getting two or three bs's in during the whole fight.  A little after that I fought a rogue of the same level and owned him but he also had about the same hp as me.  Should I just avoid straight melee encounters with tanks or am I doing something wrong?  The hp seem hard as hell to overcome.  After we were done really fighting we tried it out standing straight toe to toe, with him lowering his hp to only around 200 hp more than mine, then I completely owned him which isn't much of a surprise seeing as I have duel wield and I actually had three more ac than him.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Any adivce vs tanks would be appreciated. <p><hr>

Since toe to toe (without moving I assume) you owned him, but running around and using tactics he beat you.  He may just be a better meleer than you.<br>
<br>
Aside from that possibility there are alot of things that come into play against melees.  Surprise is the first, and if you can get a poison snare or even dot off on them it will help immensely.  After that it's all about your technique (and some luck in landing good backstabs).<br>
<br>
I've fought higher level melee opponents that I beat b/c I landed great backstabs, and I've lost to a couple lower level people because all my landed stabs were horrible.<br>

A lot of it has to do with luck.  Now am I am finding the more I practice the better I am getting.(big suprise huh?) It is a lot easier for me to practice with a friend than with a dark because if it serious I am less willing to try new tactics.  I will just keep working on it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/useanieconnerie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seanie Connerie</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/seanieconnerie/port.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 1/11/01 3:02:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucoyoteblack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>coyoteblack</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/11/01 6:49:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need some help fighting melees</span><hr size=1>      Did you try mixing up different tactics. Circle strafe is great but if the pally knows of this he will spin with you. Try adding 2 more tactics<br>

Jousting: Timing the swing of that big one hander just stay out of range of it when it swings and jump and attack with you low delay weapons.<br>

<br>
You could try instead of Circle Strafing, jumping through him and turning, to land a backstab hopefully before he can turn around. I usually use this since I still get disoriented when I use the circle strafing.<br>
<br>
Then there's poisons, potions, item effects, procs, ect. Or you could try staying close to them if they're medium or large sized to try and stay hidden merely by their bulk.<br>
<br>
That's about all I can think of right now. I've had precious few opportunities to hone my skills against other melees. <p><br>

Never sued one myself hehe, so I don't know if there is a casting time or if it's instanct, and whether or not you can make a 10 charge potion with them. When I get some cash I'm going to try it out though, as it'd be awesome to get down to a bubble then click my 10 charge potion a few times and get some health back.<br>
<br>
I think it's just the normal heal spell, not anything special.<br>
