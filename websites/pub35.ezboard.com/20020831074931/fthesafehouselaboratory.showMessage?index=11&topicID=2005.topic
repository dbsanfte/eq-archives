<br>
Granted, poisonin' does have its uses in the game.  Hell, I believe since Rogues are not exactly meant to fight a mob head-on, the intentions for poisons are either to escape alive or to catch a mob off guard with it so that its death is possible.<br>
<br>
However, the problems that I've seen with poisons have been either duration, resists, and/or the application factor.  There are NO SET FACTORS that determine what will insure full duration of the poison.  I've heard that the Apply Poison skill is supposed to be the determinin' factor in whether a poison lands at full duration or not.  Verant nor anyone else in the EQ staff has determined this to be true, so we can only assume that it's merely for the success/failure of the poison coatin' the weapon.<br>
<br>
This makes the world of poisonin' unreliable and very sporadic, causin' many Rogues to rely solely on damage distribution.  If the tick check continues, there's no way to determine how long the poison duration is supposed to be with certain mobs.  Why bother usin' them if a poison like Lethargic Bliss (Snare for 5secs a tick with each tick per level you are) when it isn't gonna last?  Same for any DoT.  The only &quot;fullproof&quot; poison seems to be the DD ones and there's a 50/50 chance for that.  You either hit or don't, haven't seen any partial damage for that.<br>
<br>
If that isn't worse, there's the Apply Poison factor.  It's a joke to work.  I've been fail free since 80 and apparently you can apply poison with a skill of 80 for a poison that's gonna take 200+ to make.  I'm not a genius or anythin' but wouldn't it be harder to poison a weapon with a poison that's very hard and thus very toxic?  Plus, Poison Mastery is goin' to serious waste.  See, it takes you a lot of points to get to Poison Mastery 3, the epitome of poison application with applies takin' 2.5-3 seconds, and yet, you have to SIT?  I don't think it takes sittin' to apply, whatever.  But I firmly believe that at Poison Mastery 3 you should be able to apply by just standin'.  That would make it SOMEWHAT worthwhile at this current state.<br>
<br>
Thin's they can do to make poisonin' better?  Well the first is removin' the tick situation.  What they should do is perform one check that will take place durin' half the poison's duration or somethin'.  And they should make the resist take place with REALLY high poisonin'.  I think it's rather messed up that someone with 50 resist and is a few levels lower than me can resist my poison and hit me full flush with a spell e'en though I have 100+ MR.<br>
<br>
Another thin', make Apply Poison a factor.  Sometimes I think the resists and the short durations stem from the fact that I haven't coated it enough.  Might start applyin' 2 doses of the same poison just to be certain.  There was a game that determined whether poisons would hit or not based on the application skill.  The equation was poisoned food or drinks were equal to the percent of the skill.  Like if my poisonin' was at 70, then I had a 70% chance of success.  Poisoned weapons had a 1/4 chance of that percentage.  So if I was a 100% poisoner, my weapon had 25% chance of landin'.  Now that would be a bit ridiculous with the poison-buff thin's goin' on, but sometihin' similar that would increase it to a 5% chance when maxed out and a 10% chance per hit with Poison Mastery, it would be lovely.<br>
<br>
And one more thin', poison is supposed to be subtle and a gradual decrease in the person's life.  It disturbs me when I see a poisoned mob jump at me the moment I poison it when it's my first touch.<br>
