<br>
I tried to change my password and billing information (extension) and everything seemed fine. The next day, neither password worked.  I receive the &quot;invalid station name or password&quot; message when I try to login. Obviously there is a glitch in their password authentication program, but I'm worried about exactly how to proceed. <br>
<br>
So, now I'm stuck.  Trying to get your password reset takes some doing.  I originally set up this account almost 3 years ago.  I've moved 4 times since then and had 3 different isps.  When you try to get your password reset, Station will mail your password to the e-mail address you used when you first registered.  Needless to say, that's long gone.<br>
<br>
I'm a little paranoid about calling Verant at all, because I'm afraid that without having access to that long closed e-mail account, they might do something crazy like ban my account on suspicion of hacking. <br>
<br>
Can someone who has gone through the password recovery/reset process let me know what to expect and what I need to have available?  I know all my billing info past and present, I know my billing address when I set up the account obviously.  I know what my e-mail adress was back then.  I know what the password was before and what I changed it to now, although I don't think they can ask that. <br>
<br>
Help!<br>

<br>
It was kind of weird when I made the changes and that's what led me to think that it was a glitch.<br>
<br>
I changed the password and received confirmation it had been changed.<br>
<br>
I then went to billing, while still &quot;logged in&quot;, but not in game.  There I tried to change billing and it wouldn't accept the new password.  It did however take the old password, so I changed by billing.<br>
<br>
I then went back to the login screen and had to put in the new password to play the game.<br>
<br>
The next day neither password worked.  I thought that maybe because I tried to change billing and my password at the same time, I had caused the passwords authentication between the Verant EQ server and the Station Billing server to have a little hiccup. <br>
<br>
So, perhaps I didn't explain it enough initially.  <br>
<br>
Now, I'm fearing the worst <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm not too enthused about calling Verant and telling them that they should suspend my account.  Unless things have changed, I thought it was now standard Verant practice to flat out ban any and all accounts even suspected of being hacked.  Has this changed or was my perception incorrect?<br>
<br>
I guess in any event, just waiting for it to magically fix itself isn't the best idea.  I'm pretty sure I have the original jewelbox somewhere. I know I have the cds for sure.<br>
<br>

It is policy that they suspend the account for a few days in order to file a report of some kind about the problem. Banning is usally not iminent.<br>
<br>
If what you are telling us is true then you should really have no problem getting control of the acc back.<br>
<br>
Goto: www.station.com and try and do a retrive on the pass - they will send you a temp one. If it doesn't work then you have been compromised and I would suggest calling Verant immediately.<br>

I fixed it by calling CS, giving them my billing info and the CD-KEY's and they reset my password then all was good.<br>

<br>
Let them know that the original email address you registered it under isn't valid anymore and to have it changed.  Also, have them reissue you a new password (it will be long and annoying) under the new email address.<br>
<br>
If you aren't the orginal owner of the account, it will be difficult.  I recently decided to reactivate my an old account but the email address was old.  Call CS up, find out that someone had the account for almost a year and its been traded a few times.  Provide all the information they needed and its back with me. <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=00DD00)"><a style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFFF66; text-decoration: none" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=118288>Souldreamer</a></div>

<br>
Thanks everyone for helping!  I had to contact my old girlfriend who had somehow ended up with old jewelcase when we /split.  Good thing she didn't hate my guts after she moved out.  Anyway, I'm back in business.  Customer Service guy was great and was happy to help me out.<br>
