but recently ive noticed that high lvl monks use h2h and 2hb as well as 1hb, and i shall soon reach those lvls.<br>
ive read a few posts on this, but not sure what i should use to practice, or where/what to practice these skills<br>
im 45 now, and not sure if fists and a bamboo bo will do any good damage on mobs that are light blue or greater, but i cannot afford to buy better yet as im saving all money for some schw, hehe<br>
should i just wait to buy the wraps, then buy some weaps to skill up? if so, what weapons would be good that arent too much money?<br>
also, what mobs should i use my horrible skills on, solo or partnerd up, without killing me or my group? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uwyntercrystalbow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wynter Crystalbow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/19/02 1:34:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1519.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: weap skill neglect</span><hr size=1> Well, not certain if this is newbie monk material, but I'll give my take on this at least.  My suggestion first of all is not to try to build up underused primary weapon skills in a group at all unless the area is laughably easy.  Most groups if you they are not hunting in a too dangerous area won't mind if you ask them nicely if you can hang around them and build your weapon skills on something they are fighting by using quick but undamaging weapons.  (Key word there is not dangerous.  Any area that requires crowd control is off that list.  Generally if they are only single pulling.)  For 2HB the bamboo bo of course.  Your goal is skill, not damage.  For H2H I recommend getting a pair of fists of wood (Uncommon drop off of sensate reishi elders in Paludal caverns) which is 5/20.  Yes, I know the damage stinks, but your goal in that case is speed, not damage.  You don't want to irritate the mob too much anyway.<br>
<br>
As far as skilling up goes at your season, though things will be light blue at 30 and start being blue at... I believe it is 34 but don't quote me on that.  So use that as a yardstick.  Sol A has a few mobs around that level I believe, though look around on guides to get a good look at what you are looking for.  So if you are just soloing your fists should work fine on very low 30ish mobs, but I can't really help you with 2HB.  I've neglected that skill myself, unhappily.\<br>
<br>
Moral of the lesson even though it's been repeated many times before:  Keep your weapons skills maxed.  I'm going to be off to Dalnir's soon myself to get a Bo because I'm guilty of that as any.<br>

<br>
Actually, groups are the best place to build up the neglected skills. Because in a lot of XP grinding situations later on, the mobs ARE laughably easy, and lowering YOUR DPS doesn't affect the outcome of the battle.<br>
<br>
Generally, if you're pulling mobs for a group, your DPS is going to be lower anyways, might as well build your skills while ya can.<br>
<br>
&quot; Most groups if you they are not hunting in a too dangerous area won't mind if you ask them nicely if you can hang around them and build your weapon skills on something they are fighting by using quick but undamaging weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most groups don't mind this at all. Works great for ARCHERY too, for any of your alts. Something to keep in mind. BUT, don't worry about damaging weapons or not. ONE monk versus FOUR tanks and a nuker ... you won't KS them.<br>
<br>
&quot;(Key word there is not dangerous. Any area that requires crowd control is off that list. Generally if they are only single pulling.) &quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, Dreadlands was where I picked up my 2hb skills. And that place requires crowd control when executed properly. Really, by the time you get up there, you'll know when it is a good time to bust out the Bamboo Bo Stick or whatever, and when not to.<br>
<br>
For h2h skillups, I still say FISTS work best. But I'm an old softie that way.<br>

<br>
As for places to train, you can either go up to a group and ask if you can practice your weapon skills on mobs they pull and they'll usually say it's ok, as long as you don't KS.  Otherwise, if you've got a great dmg group you can sometimes practice your skills in your own xp group, just make sure to ask your fellow group members if it's okay before you make the switch to a weapon you're not too good with. <p><center><IMG SRC=http://namsun.homestead.com/files/eqpics/namsunsig2.jpg><br>
