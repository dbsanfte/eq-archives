<br>
Hopefully they'll give monks something that will compensate for this nerf.<br>
<br>
When the nerf went in place I got on my monk, was in KC, so I pulled a drolvarg sentry (dark blue con). Had some cleric buffs that put my HPs at 3043 or so.<br>
<br>
By the time the drolvarg was dead, I was down to 890 HPs, so it did roughly 2153 points of damage in the fight. Almost every hit he landed was for 80 - 100.<br>
<br>
The week before I was soloing these, unbuffed, not even SoW`d. My unbuffed HPs is 1999 HPs, and I could usually kill a drolvarg sentry and have about 45 - 65% health left. Meaning they used to do about 900 - 1300 HPs in damage.<br>
<br>
Yes, I did this multiple times to make sure the first one wasn't a fluke. From my results from 5 sentrys, all dark blue, they were doing about 40% more damage than they used to. I'll do more testing, assuming I can find clerics to buff up my HPs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p><BR>[55 Master] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28617">Jagfist</a> (Human)

<br>
But i also see the other side<br>
<br>
General EQ day<br>
<br>
get a group standard makeup, warrior monk cleric drui/sammy caster of some kind whatever, lets just look at the warrior/monk<br>
<br>
i lvl 37 he lvl 34<br>
i have 770 ac not sure what his is<br>
i level maxxed on dual wield double attack and 1hs wielding JboM and Centi Longsword taunt also maxxed<br>
<br>
he has 2 KD's<br>
<br>
Not only does he out damage me that i can handle, lose taunt, hey just keep reminding him to fd(which he wouldnt do) so i get it back, but i get damaged worse than him in the long run as well<br>
<br>
to sum up, with max skills available to my warrior at the time  a monk 3 levels lower than me could out hit taunt and had higher defensive abilities than myself. IE - he replaces my role as a tank<br>
<br>
Now after patch, group with the same monk, and he is bitchin about his nerf, see it from my side, sorry but i will tell you all what i told him, change the way u play and move on.<br>
<br>
Monks were never meant to be tanks, and that is what they were before this patch. this puts the roleplaying aspect of the game back on par. I do agree they overdid it, but it needed to happen.<br>
<br>
You all think u have been hard done by, think about all the mid level warriors that kept gettin passed up because monks could outtank us at lower levels<br>
<br>
just my 2cp<br>
<br>
Dont just look at it from your side, look at it from the non twink/average equip warrior that is trying to do his job and failing caus the monks were way overpowered<br>

I've struggled over 54 levels...grouped when I can, but I had to do a lot solo because of RL constraints (I'm a physician). I was really having a great time, making a difference in the guild and enjoying the game. <br>
     I logged on the other day and with fairly good gear (fungi, sshs, Amy Staff) got my ass handed to me in KC by sentry's (the same ones I solo'd a day before). Went outside to DL and found that things were just as bad even with the light blues. I looked to my guild for support (I can't imagine being anything but supportive to others if this happened to them) only to find none. People were openly bashing me in the guild channel, I just wanted to be sick.<br>
     I don't know much about visions and where things are going, but I do know that I'm upset that I've paid into something for over 3 years to have this happen. Its hard to actually cancel my accout, but if nothing changes in the next week then its Verant's way of telling us politely (or rudely) its time to leave (don't let the door hit you in the butt). I'm not sure what they want, but I guess its not my money anymore. I too will never buy another product from this company and strongly encourage others to do the same.<br>

Didn't play him much till the winter though, mostly because I was too busy for EQ. But after that, I started playing him quite a lot, and found myself really enjoying it. This was, of course, before Kunark. I didn't like what Verant did to the design of the game with Kunark, but it wasn't enough to get me to stop playing.<br>
<br>
But then more things happened. I'm sure some of you remember how Verant player wiped Test. I was pretty horrified by that, and it was somewhat more personal to me as I sometimes played on Test. Then came other brilliant things, such as the Mystere banning incident. If I didn't have some friends who played EQ, I would have quit over that. <br>
<br>
As time went on, I found I was enjoying playing less. And I realised that there were no more goals I had that I could attain, given my playstyle, social habits, and decidedly casual/roleplaying guild. The raids I was invited on were entertaining enough, but I watched as people left behind all of their principles when it came time to dole out the loot. And it got worse as EQ became more and more item centric.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure exactly what it was, but I stopped playing. And then I finally cancelled my account this summer. I didn't enjoy playing Everquest anymore, my friends weren't playing it as much, and my online acquaintances had sort of drifted away. Then there was my belief that Verant didn't care about its customers, and didn't even know how to design a game to be rewarding. I decided, last month, to renew again, just to give it another shot. And then I read the rather large nerf announcement. I barely even had to think about cancelling again. <p><center><img src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/pratte1/RaotSigpic.jpg">
