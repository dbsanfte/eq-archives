<br>
"-he ability to raise resists with points is not an upgrade it would cost more time exping than camping better resist gear would."<br>
<br>
No, now you can have naked resistance, though on a lower scale then on a wizard. This is gearless resists, which count, even if it is very little (which I stated from the beginning barely counted becaue of cost). It does count though.<br>
<br>
"-I know enough about pvp to know that full spell dmg at 1-50 would be a mistake."<br>
<br>
Agreed. That's why I'm asking for it to taper off, not to remove the reduction across the board.<br>
<br>
"-BTW I'd be easily in favor of any measure that would eliminate any means of 1 shot kills in pvp."<br>
<br>
and then<br>
<br>
"So if a wizards with 1k hp and a 600 dmg mannaskin up gets hit he loses half his skin and is still at full hp on a single bs and is STILL at full hp minus skin on a double."<br>
<br>
Are we comparing maximums or minimums?<br>
<br>
"If you don't have skin up well thats your fault those peridots you use to cast it don't cost any more than my poisons."<br>
<br>
This is not an equivelency. Do you constantly wander around with poisons loaded? I don't mean ready to be applied, I mean you always keep your weapons poisoned. Tho obvious answer is no. Just like I will skin myself before PvP, you will poison your blades before PvP. We do these things when we are picking the targets, not when we are the targets. So, irrelevant point.<br>
<br>
"-I think its sad that people point out the fact that x rogue can take x wizard down to 1 bulb of hp when it requires so many conditions to come out that way and is a gross overstatement of rogues actual power."<br>
<br>
I think it's sad that people point out the fact that x wizard can take x rogue down to 1 bulb of hp when it required so many condistions to come out that way and is a gross overstatement of wizards actual power.<br>
<br>
"The problem is you are understating the limitations of rogues abilities and overstating yours. Like implying that requiring the wizard to get 4 spells off in order to kill someone is a ridiculous expectation. As a 55 rogue I don't think lures are too powerfull but I do think that if caster dmg improves by a full 50% it WILL be at that point overpowered."<br>
<br>
Only asking for the 33% reduction to be slowly removed until it's gone at 60.<br>
<br>
"Mannaburn will one shot rogues rangers bards monks wizards enchanters mages necros druids shaman and beastlords."<br>
<br>
I haven't seen anything more then speculation on what exactly manaburn will do. Let's not factor it in until it's factored in.<br>
<br>
"Instant evac will make it impossible to kill a wizard"<br>
<br>
What? And HT makes it impossible to kill a shadowknight, right? LoH makes paladins never die too, I'm sure. It's kinda labeling to say wizards can't die because of something they can do once every 72 minutes, assuming they have climbed the skill tree that high.<br>
<br>
"While these abilities ARE on a timer does it really matter? If its grossly unbalancing it doesn't matter if you can't do it very often. In 1 5 hour play period you could one shot 4 people with mannaburn and escape from 4 situtions that would otherwise have died in with instant evac. Generally speaking in most play sessions do you need to kill or escape much more than that?"<br>
<br>
It is still on a timer though, regardless. Furthermore, almost none, if any, of those things have actually been tested in pvp, so this is pure speculation. In truth, most of this debate is null, because there is no conclusive evidence either side can rely on yet, simply because it does not exist.<br>
<br>
As I recall, the exact same thing happened when disciplines were issues, before we knew the limitations on them, except it was all the other classes complaining because "rogues are pvp gods" syndrome. People were even freaking out about assassinate, which we later found out doesn't even work in pvp, and even if it could, wouldn't be able to be used outside one single server: sullon zek.<br>
<br>
I don't mind debating any of this, and I'm enjoying it, but we really do need to realize most of this is mere speculation =/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/26/01 12:55:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=553.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:</span><hr size=1> Actually I have poisons up for most pvp fights because I know who my enemies are and watch the zone list.  These are normally a low lvl snare poison that I can make from vendor bought components btw.  <br>
<br>
As far as fighting wizards even when I attack them they often have skin buffs up and I would consider a 600dmg double a damn good hit considering I don't think I've ever hit for more than a total of 700 unbuffed.  Btw the chance of getting a 6 or 700 hit on a person who is not sitting is reasonably small.<br>
<br>
Double bs at 55 are around 40% figuring 1/3 melee hits miss then around 17% of the time you get 2 hits which both land. if 1 in 5 is at the highest end of the range then 1 in 25 or 4% of the time would both hits be at the top of the range.  So in other words its like 1 out of 150 attempts where we would get a hit for 700 or 800 dmg on a standing person.  Thats sort of like the chance of getting 2 critical lures in a row.<br>
<br>
We can leave out the alternate advancement @#%$ for now because its unneccesary to the main point of the thread which is if the spell dmg nerf should be lifted.  I cannot speak for any other class but rogue in the 50+ game but from MY perspective as a 55 rogue with a lot of experience AS a rogue in pvp the spell dmg nerf is fair.  You as far as I know never played your rogue to 50 canbik and although I don't know the lvl of your wizard on SZ my guess is hes not 55 now nor I bet is he even over 40. <br>
<br>
Here is a brief description of rogue vs wiz pvp as I see it at 55.  Both classes lean heavily towards offense and suprise and both have the ability to deal a large amount of dmg to an unwary foe.  Indoors the rogue dominates for the most part because he can interupt a large portion of his oponents spells.  Outdoors shadowstep and levitate give the wizard the advantage.  In all cases the high offense and low defense means any mistake carries a heavy price.  This means either the wizard being caught and backstabbed in midcast or the rogue letting the wizard get away and get a spell off.<br>
<br>
Things that effect the outcome...<br>
<br>
Levitate outdoors. Counterstrategies- pumice it Limitations to counter- You will probably take dmg while pumicing.<br>
<br>
Shadowstep outdoors. Limitations- may take you to far Counterstagies watch for the particle effect where they reapear. Try to hit em with snare poison in a vally or other place where ss probably wont take them very far.<br>
<br>
Poisons. Put these on whenever you think you MIGHT need them. Counterstrategies- Wear pr gear, use cure potions or ss away if possible.<br>
<br>
Nukes delivered by an ambushing wizard. Counterstategies- Pay attention!<br>
<br>
Catching the wizard medding and backstabbing. Counterstrategies- Pay attention!<br>
<br>
Huge slow dds.  Counterstrategies wear fr cr gear and never let them catch you offguard or have that long to cast.<br>
<br>
Skin spells.  Put these on whenever you think you MIGHT pvp and think the fight will be challenging. In addition if you are able to disingage you can recast it.  Counterstragies lead off with a pumice and pumice more if  you can manage it without getting nuked.<br>
<br>
Sneak and invis.  If your oponent doesn't have see invis up, and doesn't have a perma see invis item or you can pumice it off sneak or invis can provide you with valuable time to positon yourself for a nuke or backstab and avoid dmg.<br>
<br>
The only thing that really is wrong with rogue vs wizard pvp is the lame line of sight exploits...<br>
<br>
Think of it this way removing the spell dmg nerf means the wizards do 50% more dmg this is as bad as giving the rogues they fight 1/3 less hp to deal with the currently nerfed nukes. In other words like 800hp at 50 1100 at 55 and 1200 at 60. Try to imagine trying to pvp like that?<br>
<br>
In case you didn't understand that say rogue00 is 60 with 1800 hp.  Say wizard00 nukes him to death with 300dmg nukes. Would take 6 casts.  Now remove the nerf and that nuke hits for 450 and takes 4 casts.<br>
<br>
Now lets leave the nerf in but say rogue00 now has 1200 hp and is nuked to death with 300 dmg nerfed nukes. Takes 4 casts.<br>
<br>
In other words a lvl 60 rogue facing nukes not subject to the spell dmg nerf will be killed JUST AS FAST as if he had 1200 hp vs nukes subject to the spell dmg nerf.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know how I could put it any more clearly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukambic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/26/01 1:11:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=553.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kambic.homestead.com/files/gate.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:</span><hr size=1> http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2627.topic<br>

It would give casters who already suffer from being very weak in the high end PvP game a relative boost in power. It would also lower the problem with bards destroying other melee classes with damage shields only. It would fix the overpowering ranger archery. And last but not least, its a nice, easy and generic solution that I think appeals to the Verant coders. <br>
<br>
This discussion can't focus on specific war stories on how cleric XXX killed warrrior YYY and therefore invalidates the suggestion to nerf melee damage. <br>
<br>
I'm fairly sure that everyone that plays on either Vallon or Tallon Zek agrees with me, that balance in PvP is heavily tilted in favour of melee. That's why I'd like to discuss how to best solve this problem, instead of whether it exists or not. <br>

Damage shields are the single biggest reason for rogues getting their butts kicked in PvP, I'd say (without having played a rogue to high levels in PvP). Right now they do 100% damage. The effect is that even weak damage shields will mess up a rogue when fighting for example SKs or rangers. If I fight a pally, my pet (hasted) typically beats the dust after 2-3 minutes, from a simple Ring8, which I find a bit silly as well. <br>
<br>
I don't care if instakills are timed or not, if they are disciplines gained for free by dinging, or gained by spending AXP. They still have to be calculated into the equation. <br>
<br>
Rogues aren't the top of the foodchain in PvP right now, in my opinion. Others disagree with me and claim that rogues are arguably the strongest PvP class out there. But that doesn't change my view, that melee damage / archery / dmg shields should be nerfed in PvP, as an overall balance improvement. <br>

People who say nerf melee dmg have obviously never played a melee 50+ and people who say remove spell dmg nerf have obviously never been killed in 2 casts from a 60 wiz. <br>
<br>
Ice spear of Solist does 750ish dmg pvp. With my chanter, when I've been fully dispelled, I have about 900-1k hp. Sunstrike kills me in one shot~ Pretty much every fight that I don't start, I am fighting completly buffless (thx insta cast golem wands) and usually am not wearing my resist gear in my own team's zones. Wands are recharable for a price, and money is not an issue 55+. Removing the spell dmg nerf would mean I get hit for for 1200 dmg in 4 seconds. It takes me longer than 4 seconds to stand up, target the enemy, and cast an interupt spell. Basicly I would die every time a wiz zones in and I don't notice them right away. I don't see the challenge in that.<br>
<br>
Nerfing melee dmg is a joke. Sorry but if you get PK'd by a monk or warrior you are either stuck indoors, rooted/ snared, afk, or an idiot. Melees own high lvl pvp because they are hard to kill, but it's next to impossible for them to solo pk you. Just because one or two melee classes are dangerous (like they should be) does not mean that all melees should suffer a nerf. A 60 rogue, warrior, SK, or whatever should be feared, not be tanked by lvl 55 chanters ;p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/16/02 7:48:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=553.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:</span><hr size=1> Only one thing to say...YES!

<br>
EVERY melee will destroy you in seconds if you don't catch him outdoors and he is alone AND you get the chance to jump him. <br>
<br>
PvP in HL is DEFINITELY imbalanced. Yeah you all talk about wizzies making some insane damage, but to give you a hint, wizards are not the only caster class.... mages e.g. are casters, too and their pet was hit by the PvP nerf, TOO. Melees can prevent caster damage with Resistance.. where is the robe, which gives casters 1k AC to prevent melee dmg???<br>
<br>
I have seen monks hit for 300dmg in 0.1 secs and I have seen rogues double backstab for 1k damage, SKs HT for 1,5k!!!! And this is not rare, because casters have weak AC, so melees WILL hit for max dmg OFTEN. What is the point? <br>
<br>
Casters have been nerfed, because Wizzards could destroy others with one shot. This was PREKUNARK. Postkunark melees are able to do the same, so they MUST be nerfed. <br>
<br>
If you play on a zek server you know where the fights will often be.... in dungeons... and a warrior whacking casters for double 200 is not very funny. Bards destroy you Rogues because of his DS. <br>
<br>
Manaskin costs 1 Peridot btw and lasts about 1 hour average, counting in that mobs often hit you. I never have that up as a caster.<br>
<br>
I play a HL rogue and I destroy every caster... I play a HL necro and I have nearly no chance against melees in my level, can you say golem wands? <br>
<br>
Rogue is by far not the best PvPer... SKs are... !!! Rogues are great, but they don't have tools. One invis and they are screwed.<br>
<br>
Now you own any caster in game and you are lucky that you are no caster, I feel with you, that you are afraid of loosing your status and have REAL fights, not destroying casters in one tick. But come on, it is all about competition. <br>
<br>
Try and play a caster or simply believe those who play casters. <br>
<br>
And to those who say don't play casters or don't play in high levels... *laugh* come and we play quake a bit, so you see how good you are, when the odds are EQUAL. And tell this to the enchanter mezzing the mobs whacking on you.<br>

Melee vs caster obviously needs a fix, casters generally can't touch melees and melees can't touch moving casters. But nerfing melee dmg is not the answer! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 7:38:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=553.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *sigh*</span><hr size=1> &quot;EVERY melee will destroy you in seconds if you don't catch him outdoors and he is alone AND you get the chance to jump him.&quot;<br>
<br>
First off I think the seconds part is kind of an exaggeration...<br>
<br>
Next lets break this down....<br>
<br>
Alone...You think you should be able to quad kite melees maybe?<br>
<br>
Outdoors...So casters own outdoors (see this statement)<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been chased around by lvl 60 warriors with SoC speed horse, primal weapons and ToV gear, and they still can't kill me as easily as a wiz could.&quot;<br>
<br>
and melees have a big advantage indoors. Isn't that called balance?<br>
<br>
And you get the chance to jump him.  Learn to jump people more.  As a pure offensive class you like me will do best when you take the initiative.  You like me pay the price for your powerful offense with weak defense.  Most fights you are either jumped or you jump someone.  As an offensive class you wont do well when your jumped.<br>
<br>
In addition a few minor points...<br>
<br>
About going around a corner to avoid a 6 second spell.  6 seconds is a long ass cast.  Has it occured to you that if they just meleed you for the whole 6 seconds you would be interupted anyway?  I don't see that being used much as a pvp tactic.  I only see it as a nerf of LOS exploiting.<br>
<br>
About harmtouch, its 1k in pvp at 60, sick indeed but lets not exagerate k?<br>
<br>
About double 1k backstabs with disc (every 30 minutes) unless your caught siting with your back to your oponent. A very disagreeable position to be caught in by ANY class vs any other class btw. You will see double 1k backstabs far less often than you will see back to back crits with lure of ice which would by the way have the very same effect on a rogue sitting or standing (DEATH).  This isn't even taking into acount the ungodly damage of mannaburn.  <br>
<br>
About describing melee dmg.  If you say you can hit for x dmg, x being the max hit.  You will give a wildly incorrect idea of the actual dmg done in combat.  If you wish to rationally debate melee dmg its far better to deal with the average dmg and take into acount misses.<br>
<br>
If you want to rationally debate it perhaps you should go on to describe how and why your dmg done to dmg taken ratio is out of whack in all or most situations rather than exagerated ranting.<br>
<br>
In other words if a 60 rogue starts with 1800-2000 hp and you begin with 1200 hp + 600 dmg from a mannaskin (btw if you don't know how to use your rune type spells in pvp you shouldn't damn well be playing pvp) Also note I've suggested golem wands be nerfed.<br>
<br>
The question would be why can't you do between 1 and 1.11 dmg for every point of dmg you take on average.  Clearly you most likely can't fighting a prepared oponent indoors but not all of pvp is indoors nor are all your oponents prepared. Pick your battleground and take the initiative.<br>
<br>
<br>
You didn't adress the fact btw that I suggested nerfing both golem wands and the bard charm exploit.  Nor adress the nerfing of the pet assist trick.<br>
<br>

It simply should not work in PvP at all. Intant kills should not work in PvP. Or at least appropriate rewards should be removed from manaburn kills (RZ=corpse unlootable just as it is after HT, SZ=no insignia, not sure about VZ/TZ). <br>
<br>
Full PvP damage to spells? There will be no casters left on PvP servers other than wizards, not enough hps to take that kind of damage. <br>
<br>
As far as nerfing melee damage on any level... NO NO and NO. I made a career pking people on RZ at level 24(I do have 2 characters at 55+ nowdays). As a necro I fought twinked people who hit close to 100 at 24, at 24 100 is  1/3rd-1/4th of my unbuffed total hps. And nevertheless I've killed and looted quite a few of them. I am flexible enough as a caster to get away and use range and LoS advantage against most melees. I don't know about fights in the open(give necros need tracking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but in towns casters are not killable by melees 1v1. <br>
<br>
The absence of casters from ToT teams speaks against ToT format not weakness of casters.  If you are confound to arena where you can't move freely you can't get away, your opponent knows exaclty where you are and movement debuffers don't stick because of uber mr, you can't get a spell off. I guess manaburn would *balance* arena environment for one class of casters while screwing everyone else outside the arena. <br>

&quot;And on a similar note to Aerimus ersonaly I don't think rogues are not meant to fight solo PvE or PvP. Time to make some friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll respond as if that sentence actually makes sense...<br>
<br>
Points...<br>
<br>
-EQ rogues are killers.  Due to game design reasons in pve they cannot do this solo.  This isn't true in pvp.  While their are issues that make it hard its perfectly viable to get solo kills in pvp as a rogue.<br>
<br>
-Your dismissal of solo pvp is premature and foolish.  If you want to kill anyone you better be able to stand up for yourself without 3 friends.  If you don't want to run like a whipped dog every time a caster zones in you better be able to stand up for yourself without 3 friends.  For a class with weak defense a strong offense is a neccesity.   Some classes are not good at getting kills but these classes are generally speaking strong defensively.  Thats called balance.  <br>
<br>
I think melees are neither as badly off as our exploitive necro here would think nor as well off as some envious people that want melee dmg nerfed think they are.<br>
<br>
100% spell dmg and 66% melee dmg are both foolish concepts pure and simple.  Pvp does have problems and more problems in fact each time verant adds on to EQ but this is NOT a solution. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unerezza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nerezza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 3:02:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=553.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *sigh*</span><hr size=1> buh.
