<br>
Well here's where you reach the crux of EQ: by the games design, you don't deserve by virtue of being a customer the right to have or experience anything no matter how much you want it.  I don't mean that in an offensive way or anything.  Some would actually laugh that you are taking it for granted that you just reached 50+ "a couple weeks ago" and are already anxious to get your epic.  You've played for 8 months?  Slacker!  Some have been players for more than 2 years.  ;)  Some want to see these epic quests reserved for those very "hardcore" players.  The ones who have probably already built up quite the reputation for themselves (and their class) on the server already. <br>
<br>
<b>"Wouldn't you like to be able to obtain this weapon with reasonable ease?"  </b><br>
<br>
Who wouldn't on the surface, but I think Wend's answer is "no!"  She wants it, and it arguably should be, VERY tough!  Would it upset the people who couldn't obtain it in their current guild/level situation?  What DOESN'T?  You know how many 60 necros are still on their epic?  Camping the KoS like he was the damn frenzied ghoul with their guild?  <br>
<br>
The point to make is--these are supposedly epic quests.  The quests of a lifetime that take constant dedication and take you all over Norrath in search of "the artifact".  If this was an epic quest, then yes, YOU wouldn't have a ragebringer.  It *would* be on those envied "people from beta in the largest guilds" and arguably it should be.  Hard = Pride IMO.  Make the quest hard, and then you give the quests completion an epic feel, a sense of accomplishment.<br>
<br>
I recall my post a while back about me completing the "impossible" when I got my Ragebringer.  I acquired mine through the friendship of my now current guild.  In many ways the Ragebringer has two different states of difficulty: impossible or cake, with no shades of grey.  As time has gone by I quickly learned to look at my epic quest as a whole as I was no longer in a rush to complete it (I believe I was the owner of the 7th or so on the server--before anyone had even solved the monk quest btw).  In that time I think I've seen about 15 more Ragebringers enter the server, heck maybe more.  But I definitely know that you won't see nearly as many warrior or, say, necro epics around. <br>
<br>
This is why some old-timers don't receive the news of "83 generals dead on Ownz0r Ro" very well.  And it also explains why some are pissed at our epic for a different reason: "Why Don't You have your Epic?" posts are almost the next in line.  I sort of chuckle when people inspect me and say, "Wow is that the epic?"  I almost feel like replying, "No I don't use the burning rapier anymore, this is my Ragebringer." <br>

<br>
well the problem is in the quest design.....you can't really blame us just-hit-50-rogues in being able to complete this quest so easily, because it's verants fault that the quest is so easy. the change in kith spawns made it easier to make generals, harder to get kith robes. not sure what's worst.<br>
<br>
your problem is that it's too easy, and you don't really want us quickie-rogues like myself (8 months vs. 2 years) to get ragebringers, and I kinda understand this.....I guess you'd rather have the quest being harder. but it's kinda hard to only make it accessible for those who've played 2+ years....i mean, what skills can you possibly have learned in that time, that can be used for a quest.....talk to an npc, farm the stuff he asks for, job done. pretty much anyway.<br>
<br>
the thing is, even though I've only played 8 months, i have started from scratch and try my best at getting levels, killing stuff, getting stuff, etc.....so it would also be a flaw in the game design if you'd only be able to do an epic if you'd played for a very long time.<br>
<br>
there is a general 'bug' in the game.....good quests can't be solo'd. you can't solo dragons, mobs that summon (51+), etc., you need a lot of help. that's where quests like bard and warrior epic becomes almost totally lame, because you NEED to be in a bigass guild or have a very high reputation and be able to get stuff like dragon scales, stuff from high up in poa, etc.<br>
<br>
you guys could do this, and would be very proud of your epics still, but the rest of us would be left out in the cold......even though we've worked from newbie to 50+ we'd be stuck with damn trak tooth and crap. it's not really fun, but getting a ragebringer means getting lots of RH groups in seb and invitation to raids on 32k mobs for example.<br>
<br>
so, I guess it kinda sucks for the old-timers, but is great for the 'latecomers'. what's kinda sad though is that twinks with little dedication can get it too, but I guess you gotta take that along. I haven't noticed a lot of 50+ twinks in fennin with RB really, and those I talk to are in general not twinks....not that I care really, that's just how the situation is.<br>
<br>
btw I made this post to cheer at all the rogues, and because i think it's cool a lot of rogues came together.....we were all from non-uber guilds (ok last time I'll use the word uber in this thread) and did this with pretty low resources. so :P<br>
<br>
oh, and bronus....wow I think you made wendolyn even more happy :P lol <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugospelunknown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GospelUnknown</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/10/01 9:10:35 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=www.regenerationx.guildhappy.com/tn_gospel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 7 Generals dead on Fennin!</span><hr size=1> Heeh, true the rogue epic is pritty easy, but so is the monk and shaman quest, and some would consider the enchanter epic pritty easy too.<br>
<br>
Really alot of the epic weapons have lost much of there presteage(sp).  Hardest quests are still the warrior and mage.  And with new mobs and drops in the game the warrior is getting easyer every day. In the end the weapons will be outclassed and replaced(well maybe not the ragebringer)as the game gets older and older, but hey, i still own arguably the best weapon I can get.  True though, I would probably be more proud of my Edge of the nightwalker(because it's rarer) except for the fact that I won it in a roll instead of haveing it awarded to me.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unotwen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>notwen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/11/01 6:12:01 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/bbiggs/raven.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 7 Generals dead on Fennin!</span><hr size=1> I guess I'm in a different position from both sides here...<br>
<br>
2 Years playing, turned 50 months ago, still level 50.  Mostly due to lack of time over the past 4 months, but still I kinda qualify as old-timer and &quot;just turned 50.&quot;<br>
<br>
Will I feel pride once I finish my Ragebringer?  Hell yes.<br>
<br>
I'm in a small tightly knit guild, which has alliances with several other small tighly knit guilds.  When I finish my Ragebringer (which will likely be quite a while now that Kedge Robes are much harder to come by), I'll feel proud that so many people not even in my guild were willing to put aside an hour or two out of their game to help little old me.  I'll fel pride that my itty-bitty non-uber guild was able to build such strong alliances...I'll be proud that my actions in game have resulted in lasting friendships with those who were willing to come running to my aid when I needed it.<br>
<br>
Rarity of the item be damned.  The Ragebringer quest might be easy and fast compared to others, but it doesn't result in any less pride for me.<br>
<br>
Most epic quests that are labelled &quot;harder&quot; really aren't really more *difficult* as much as they are more *time consuming.*  Ok, so your guild killed Uber_mob_X for the thousandth time and this time you got lucky that it dropped Epic_piece_00.  Not more difficult, just not as common.<br>
<br>
And yes, some are ridiculously &quot;hard.&quot;  My opinion is that the *epic* should be in the meat of the quest, not the &quot;difficulty.&quot;  As such I feel like the Ragebringer quest is one of the best. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uslapus1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slapus1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/11/01 8:41:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://microsoftninja.virtualave.net/portrait.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 7 Generals dead on Fennin!</span><hr size=1> 30-35? i doubt it<br>

Removing my moderator hat now...<br>
<br>
I do see Wendolyn's point.  I completed the quest when it was still relatively new.  I do think the massive influx of Ragebringers cheapens the experience of others who did it earlier.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I'm also sick of the target being moved by Verant.  Woven Shadow armour was very common at one time - then they badly nerfed the drop rate.  It took me about 9 months to assemble a suit of it (not even full suit, I'm minus one bracer), where the uber-guilds got a much easier run at gathering it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unotwen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>notwen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/01 5:39:25 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/bbiggs/raven.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 7 Generals dead on Fennin!</span><hr size=1> I'm going to repeat what I said last time in a much nicer manner so it isn't in violation of Safehouse PNP.<br>

DarthEnder:  How dare you judge someone based on the fact that they are doing a great quest for an incredible weapon?  Simply because YOU have some rapier fetish it means others who want a Ragebringer have fewer &quot;principles&quot; than you?  This is simply unbelievable.  I think, at the heart of your issue here, is your unrelenting need to taunt Prod.  Here's a clue for ya: YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY WANT A RAGEBRINGER.  You want to continue on being the Rapier Master, FINE, no one is stopping you, or insulting you for it (disregarding a jab here or there in retaliation to your preceding insults)--but that doesn't make anyone else who /does/ want a Ragebringer less principled than you! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushehabaldean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shehab al dean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/01 2:33:40 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://forzaq8.net/everquest/personal.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 7 Generals dead on Fennin!</span><hr size=1> you know slapus , your not the only one that can flame other guilds for there job<br>

It's just that....epic. I do honestly wish the quest was harder. Of course, it's easy for me to say that because I'm only one Kedge robe away from completing it myself. But I agree, we Rogues do get that sense of accomplishment from completing this quest. But I doubt we feel it in the way other classes do. <br>
<br>
No, I don't think it should be obtained with ease either. And when you look at the quest, well, it's easy. I'm in no way uber, nor do I wish to be. I'm in a small guild of all rogues, so I obviously couldn't drag them alone and take out the general. But it was still easy to call on friends and people who were bored to come in and take him out. Should it be that easy? I guess it depends on the person. I will admit, it was nice to finally get that behind me and I did feel proud that I had done it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I go back to what Verant said. They are epic weapons. They are not meant for all. It seems the RB is starting to define the Rogue. It's getting to the point that it seems like you aren't a true Rogue without wielding an RB. That's just how I see it. And no, I don't think having an RB defines you as a Rogue. I'm only saying it seems that way. I wish it wasn't like that. I can say that personally I will still feel that sense of pride when I get mine.  <p><font color=#990000>Dehnyen Avidsoul</font><BR><a href="http://sanguineblade.8m.com">Sanguine Blade</a>-Bristlebane<BR>

I understand you may not have realized that being not as well versed in the goings on of the Safehouse, so I have refrained from saying anything to humiliate you.<br>
<br>
Your quite welcome. <p><font color=red>

Not...as well versed in the goings on of the Safehouse?<br>
<br>
Um, I've been here much longer than you.  I'm quite &quot;well versed in the goings on of the Safehouse&quot; and your tired little personal campaign against Prod.<br>
<br>
And perhaps you should read your comments again.  Their implications ARE not that it is directed just at Prod...not that that would excuse anything anyway.  In fact your very first one which has since been deleted read as an insult to *6* other Fennin Rogues in particular. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthewerejackal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Werejackal</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ctsystems.co.uk/personal/icon1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/18/01 8:54:09 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.ctsystems.co.uk/personal/face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...wha!?!</span><hr size=1> What part of &quot;...stay cool and be nice to each other&quot; do you guys not understand? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukezzek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kezzek</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/smallPadlock.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asst.
