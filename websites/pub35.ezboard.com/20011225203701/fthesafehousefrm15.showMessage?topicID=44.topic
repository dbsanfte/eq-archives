Additions would be great.. since i've not been jumped by alot of classes..<br>
<br>
Druid - <br>
    If snare resists, just stay on him.. always swing around back for the BS when it lands... if snare does stick.. then.. you should either follow after him slowly with throwing items.. or wait till he sits down to med.. hide/sneak.. hope he loses targeting.. and then either bind wound, or go around back for the backstab.  Oh, dots.. gotta hate 'em.. but with these guys.. if you get them to low health.. you might be able to die from a dot, and save your coin/item... (happened to me once.. i was thrilled =)<br>
<br>
Wizard -<br>
    If the inital root lands, then sorry.. you're dead, unless you have some pumice on you.  If not, then stick on him.. dont let him leave your attack range.. and worry more about interrupting his spells than about backstabbing.. save your backstab for when you see &quot;a wizard beings to cast a spell&quot;... and.. if you think you can pull it off.. go around back and backstab.. if not.. just hit the button so it interrupts him.<br>
<br>
Mage -<br>
    Well, still havent been jumped by an earth pet and lived to tell about it... havent ever been jumped by a mage without an earth pet up.. so..... not sure about that one =\<br>
<br>
Necro -<br>
    Same as druid.. with the added annoyance factor of the pet..... life taps........... etc<br>
<br>
Enchanter -<br>
    Whoop-t-doo.. you've got yourself a doosy here.  You will most likely be blind, mezzed, debuffed, and possibly whirled before you get a chance to do anything.  If you have pumice, dont be afraid to use it.  When you wake up out of your dazed/debuffed slumber... go straight for him.. once again.. save your backstab for the interrupt.  The enchanter has alot of stuns that he/she can use to just get rid of you for a while with.  Kind of a hard one to win here.... Also have very low hp, and Rune.... cursed rune.<br>
<br>
Rogue and Warrior -<br>
   If you're being jumped by one of these, they're probably extremely twinked, or have a friend hideing behind a bush with a baseball bat.  If this is the case, run.  If not, try to stay out of jousting.. mix up your routine.. circle strafe for the backstab as SOON as it recycles..<br>
<br>
Paladin or Cleric -<br>
   Blind, nuke, melee.  Thats basically their strategy.  Paladins can melee better than the cleric, but the cleric does everything else better.  Just be carefull here, if you get to 2 bubbles, just run.. they will have a hard time killing you, or rooting you(if you have a decent MR)..<br>
<br>
SK -<br>
   Treat like a warrior, but remember.. they have harmtouch.. so they could really really hurt you really really quickly. They usually start off with their flashy spells... hopefully darkness resists.  Even if it does, the guy is still going to run at you and start jousting.  They often carry big weapons.. so they will just run up.. smack.. and run away.  Very annoying.  Just get away if the snare dosnt resist.  If it does... try to avoid their big weapons.<br>
<br>
Others -<br>
   Dont have any experience with them... not sure what i missed... if anyone has any suggestions.. it'd be very very helpfull to all of us.... hope this saves at least one rogue's &quot;uber-phat-lewt&quot;.<br>

Pray you resist those dots, and just stick on them. If they are dotting you, you can bind wound as only spells with a dd component to them will break bind wound. Try to BS when applicable, but you might want to save it as a bonus attack if you have slower weapons.<br>
<br>
Bards -<br>
Never been jumped by a bard, but I hear if they know what they're doing they can be hard. They are fast as greased lighting, and over time can do plenty of damage to you. Generally if you run from them (even though they can easily follow you) you will have ample time to get somewhere safe or pull the plug before their spells have done too much damage.<br>
<br>
Rangers -<br>
Chances are these guys are going to be twinked with some yaks or other fast 1h slashers. Watch out for snare, but other then that treat them like a warrior. Might want some slower weapons if they have damage shields.<br>

<br>
Anyhow one question. Why did the chanter not use the &quot;chanter-snare&quot; the combination of cripple (or her levl 49 equivalent) and weakness? That lowers your strength to the point that depending on your current str and encumbrance you are either effectively snared, or worse yet, rooted.<br>
<br>
This leads me to another question. Are PvPers typically loaded up to their ears in pummice stones? <p>Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.<BR>Sun Tzu - The Art of War<BR><BR>

I actually have a decent amount of money atm, but 15p for a single stone is expensive.  The problem is that I hate to waste it, so I have a hard time deciding when to use it and when to just admit defeat heh.<br>
<br>
Regarding bards, don't even bother unless they actually want to fight (which it seems they don't).  They can break a root/snare (including poison) with a single note of their song, which I consider extremely unfair, and will usually just run around so you can't hit them while they sing annoying little "scratch" songs.  Scratch songs being little tunes that hurt like the scratch of a kitten but build up over time.  <br>

She hit me with mes first thing and then some debuff before my snake friend helped me out....hehe<br>
I can't remeber what she hit me with but I have a unbuffed str of 160 (higher since I got WS brestplate that night!) so encumberance is never much of a factor.<br>
She never had much of a chance after that, she charmed me when she was under a bubble of health asked me to stop so I did, bandaged her some and let her zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Their songs dont cancel root. Root just doesnt overwrite their song, it stacks.<br>
<br>
If their song isnt up, then they are screwed. As long as song is up, there is nothing you can do tho.<br>
