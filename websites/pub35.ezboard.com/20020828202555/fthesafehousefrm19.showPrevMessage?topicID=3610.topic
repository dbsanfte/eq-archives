After a brief break because of connection issues I went out to RVR last night.  First I found a group at the Uppland gates.  There were 2 casters there and I figured I could suicide strike one and kill it quick before its friends could kill me, collect the 500+, ride to uppland and do the same to the other one for about 1500 rp for 10 min rvr.<br>
   I move up to an orange caster and perf for 250!  Only 250 and against a mage!  I barely take 1/4 his health, and his friends kill me in 2 hits.  I figure this must be some freak occurance, cause according to the vnboards I should be able to one hit the caster, then melee down 1-2 tanks before they take me out.<br>
   I get back on the horse ride to uppland, walk right back up to the mage and perf for 250 again.  This time it takes them 3 hits to kill me so I guess I am doing better.<br>
   Then I roll out to emain.  I see a blue plate wearer, and think easy kill.  I line up the perf, but lag and get target out of view.  I figure he is blue, still no problem.  I start to doublefrost and get +63 style bonus.  +63?!?!?  I hit mobs for way more than that, and this is rvr with a blue con.  He actually gets some blocks and parries and I evade not once.  I actually start to loose the fight and try to run, but it turns out I had forgotten to apply snare poison, and get hacked to death by a blue con 1on1.  I have 45 L. axe with items.<br>
    My personal experience as a SB does not stack up at all with the stories that I am hearing about assasins soloing tanks with no problem at all.<br>

<br>
Thats true, but i do not think having a Shaman with you around (especially when<br>
youre sneaking around) is the standard situation.<br>
<br>
In every game i know by now the classes get rated on their maximum performance,<br>
most people miss the fact that only a slim percentage of players really are that<br>
effective.<br>
<br>
I am not really effective,  i have no shaman or healer at my disposal, so every<br>
&quot;fix&quot; which slightly affects the &quot;effective&quot; players affect me to, with an greater <br>
impact.<br>
<br>
i hope you understand my meaning, dont want to explain further =)<br>

<br>
good you posted your stats. Please try the following <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
- get yourself an arcanium bastard sword of qual 97+<br>
- get yourself an arcanium small axe of qual 97+<br>
- if you like 2h, get the darkness falls 2h (yeah the high one for diamond seals) or get an arcanium great sword of qual 99%+ (a lil higher damage than df 2h, but 35% bonus rules)<br>
- enchant the weapons<br>
<br>
now go out again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
you can also perf with your two 1h weapons (something i do to apply 2 poisons on perf). You sacrifice app. 150-200 dmg cap but you apply 1 more poison earlier. Should you now also have prepoisoned backup weapons, you should notice some nice damage, when you switch weapons in combat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
 <p>But as always: only my five cents ;-)<BR>
