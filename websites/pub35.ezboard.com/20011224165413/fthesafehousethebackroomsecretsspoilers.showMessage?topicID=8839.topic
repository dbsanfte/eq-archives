<br>
Alternate Advancement<br>
<br>
The alternative advancement system allows anyone who has purchased and installed EverQuest(r): Shadows of Luclin to further customize their high level (51+) characters. Customized features include things such as minor permanent statistic and resistance boosts, unique skills based on your class (warrior, magician, etc.) or archetype (fighter, magic user, and priest), and general skills available to everyone. These skills include anything from enhanced metabolism to improvements in skills already available to your class.  You can also gain a title for your character based on the choices you make when enhancing your character.  These titles will be visible to other players. <br>
<br>
Gaining these alternate skills and powers will require the expenditure of experience points.  You will be able to funnel incoming experience either into your alternative advancement pool or into your standard experience pool. You can even choose to have a percentage of your incoming experience go into each pool.  Once enough experience has entered the alternative advancement pool, you will receive skill points that may be used to acquiring your enhancements. When you acquire the proper amount of training points, you will have the option of choosing which enhancement you wish to gain.  Some enhancements may have prerequisites.  A prerequisite is a skill or skills that you will need to obtain before you can get the enhancement.<br>
<br>
Experience loss due to death suffered by the character will be taken from the &quot;Leveling&quot; experience pool, it will not impact your alternative advancement pool.<br>
<br>
You can access the Alternate Advancement menu by clicking on the ADV button in the inventory screen.<br>
<br>
Note:  All characters will be able to open the interface screen for Alternate Advancement.  But only those that actually purchase the Shadows of Luclin expansion will be able to earn any of these abilities.<br>
<br>
Also Note:  EverQuest is an evolving game.  We may add new abilities or change existing ones at a future date.  We will, of course, attempt to keep changes to a minimum and will update this document to reflect such changes.<br>
<br>
Unlocking Archetypes and Class Abilities:<br>
<br>
There are three types of Alternate Abilities:  General, Archetype and Class Abilities.  Each is a stepping stone for the next.  Attaining a certain number of General abilities is required before you can learn any abilities from your Archetype.  Similarly, you will have to attain a prerequisite number of abilities from your Archetype to start gaining abilities from your Class group.   There are also level requirements for each of these levels.  Keep in mind that you can't gain any of these abilities unless you own Shadows of Luclin.<br>
<br>
These requirements are in addition to any prerequisites needed for some abilities.<br>
<br>
General abilities:  A character must be level 51 or higher to open up the General abilities.<br>
Archetype abilities:  A character must have spent six skill points on General abilities and be 55th level or higher to open up the Archetype abilities.<br>
Class abilities:  A character must have spent twelve skill points on Archetype abilities and be 59th level or higher to open up the Class abilities.<br>
<br>
Skill Levels and skill points:<br>
<br>
Once you have gained enough experience points toward alternate advancement (enough to fill the experience bar) you will earn one skill point.  It is these skill points that allow you to purchase alternate advancement abilities.  Each ability will require a certain number of skill points to purchase one skill level with that ability.<br>
<br>
Every ability available through the Alternate Advancement system has a skill level associated with it.  For many of these abilities there is only one skill level, meaning that once you purchase the ability you have attained all the skill available for that ability.  But several abilities have more than one skill level.  Gaining a second or third (or more) skill level in an ability will improve that ability.  However, it is important to note that a second skill level is usually more costly than the first, and the third more costly than the second.  That expense is rewarded, however.  If additional skill levels cost more, the skill level also means a greater increase in the power of that ability.<br>
<br>
Let's look at two examples:<br>
<br>
Improved Natural Strength has five skill levels.  However, each skill level for this ability costs one skill point.  Each time you raise your skill level with this ability you gain two points of strength.<br>
<br>
Healing Adept (from the Priest Archetype) has three skill levels.  Each skill level costs progressively more skill points.  The first skill level costs two skill points for a 2% improvement in healing spells.  The second skill level costs four points, but improves that percentage to 5%.  The third skill level costs six skill points, but raises the percentage to 10%.<br>
<br>
Titles:<br>
<br>
Upon attaining enough skill ranks with the Abilities of each type (General, Archetype and Class), characters will be granted a title to show their efforts.  The title for anyone meeting the requirements for General Abilities will be given the title Baron or Baroness.  Other titles will be given as the character progresses through their alternate advancement, but we don't want to spoil the fun by giving them all away here.<br>
<br>
Ability Types:<br>
<br>
There are two types of abilities, passive and active.<br>
<br>
Passive abilities are always on and always have effect.  Most abilities are passive.  In fact, all General and all Archetype Abilities are passive.<br>
<br>
Active abilities need to be triggered by the player.  Every active ability has a Refresh Timer associated with it.  This indicates how long it will be after using the ability before it can be used again.  Refresh Timers are given with two times, in game time and real life time.  For every minute that passes in the real world, 20 minutes passes in the game world. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Important Note:  Some Archetype abilities are restricted and can only be acquired by certain classes.  For example, Spell Casting Mastery improves the use of specialization skills.

<br>
Example:<br>
As a shaman a good skill would be the AE buff.<br>
<br>
This skill is a class specific skill. It costs 9 points.<br>
To be allowed to choose this skill i need to spend 12 points in the archetype skills.<br>
To be allowed to spend points on archetype skills i have to spend 6 points in general skills. <br>
<br>
Summing this up, i would have to spend 27 points to get the AE buff spell.<br>
<br>
That is, i will have to level through lvl51 27 times for a skill usable once every 72 minutes. True, i get some general and archetype skills in the process, but imo hardly worth the time investment.<br>
<br>
It would be faster to powerlevel up an additional priest class to help with the buffing instead.<br>

Whoah, did I miss that before? 2 hell levels worth of exp for 2% increase in healing?<br>
<br>
Ok went back and reread, and am sad to see the level restrictions as well. I must have missed that too. Well, I guess 9  51-52 exp worth won't be too terrible to earn as a 59+ char, so Class based abilities won't be too terrible to learn. I guess I just didn't realize the level restrictions. I thought the skill levels were open to all lv 51+ who took the time to learn them. I was hoping to enjoy them before my Rog's career was close to being over at 60. If the aim was to give players more reasons to keep playing at 60, I guess this would help for a bit, until they actually learned the skill. Just being able to wipe yourself from a hate list every 72 mins isn't exactly going to keep lv 60s occupied. But oh well, enough whining. I'm, just really dissapointed that I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to learn the &quot;Archetypal and Class&quot; skills till I was 55 and 60.<br>

[edit: is this level/point info new? I must not have read closely enough before, but I am just so dissappointed right now. Oh well /shrug.

&lt; just my observation ..

Does anyone have the numbers handy, and can compare the number of experience points available in level 60 and those in level 51?  I would guess that 51-52 is equal to some percentage of 60 but not the whole thing (and level 60 is a pretty fast level to max).  I dunno if that is how it will work, does anyone know exactly?<br>

The hard core players will be able to get a point every 1-3 days probably, there are people who have done 59 in a week for example which would in this case come out to around 4 points.

<br>
If indeed it is much easier for a lv 59-60 to gain skill levels than it is for a 52-55 or so, exactly what is my motivation for struggling through general skill levels at lv 51-55, especially, and also 55-59? If each skill pt is earned with the same exp it takes to get from 51-52, that means that a lv 60 would be able to learn skills MUCH Faster than a lv 51-55 at least, right?<br>
<br>
[edit: just reread the official thing, and it doesn't mention that 51-52 is the amount of exp needed for each skill lv. So, if that isn't the case, than there really isn't much point in arguing and whining until we actually know how MUCH exp it takes per skill point.]<br>
<br>
Why would I EVER choose to put my exp points into general skills, or even archetypel skills until I am closer to lv 60, when it is not only easier to gain skill levels, but also possible to gain skills that actually make a difference in my play?<br>
<br>
Hell, the only General skill, as a Rog, would be well, really heh, none of them. First Aid would be cool if I could solo. Regeneration is ok, but 3 HPs MAX? Ok, I see that there is also an Archetypel regen skill, for 3 more HP per tick. Well, I still don't see the point in taking time to earn 3 HP/tick instead of actually leveling up to a point where those skills would take much less time to learn in the first place. Since we know stats make nearly no difference except Str, INT, and WIS, not sure who would rather earn those pre-60 instead of actually leveling up. It'd be much faster to camp an Idol of the Thorned than earn 10 pts in STR in lv 51 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I don't mean to be so negative, but it seems that the fundamental flaw in this system is that it makes no sense to earn skills before at least lv 55, when you can learn skills faster, and have access to skills that are actually worth spending time on. I guess it's nice to have the OPTION of earning skills at 51, but it just doesn't make much sense to actually put your exp into them, when you get more benefit from leveling at that point, as you don't have the option to earn the &quot;good&quot; skills. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=emryss>emryss</A> at: 12/4/01 8:00:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaladhim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MalaDhim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/01 7:57:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Official Skill Infomation from SoL CD (WARNING LONG)</span><hr size=1> Many of you are mussing up the math.<br>
<br>
1.) you MUST use 6 points in General skills before you get ANY Archetype skills<br>
2.) you MUST then use 12 points in Archetype skills before you get any Class skills.<br>
<br>
So, the quickest route to Escape is (an example)<br>
<br>
3 level 51's worth of exp into Natural Run Speed<br>
3 level 51's worth of exp into Natural Regen<br>
<br>
12 level 51's worth of exp into Combat Fury (crits, maxed)<br>
<br>
9 level 51's worth of exp into Escape<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
27 level 51's of exp to get Escape, usable 1 every 72 min.<br>
<br>
Hope I'm not the only one a bit saddened by this.  Was hoping they'd make it hard to get these abilities, but this is extreme, even for Verant.  Honestly, I was hoping for more like 15 levels (total) to get the Class skills.  At the very least, make the road to the class skills long, but once they are unlocked, make them easier to acquire.  /shrug<br>
<br>
Oh well, the one thing they have done, is ensure that only the TRUE PL'ers will have any of the archetype / class skills anytime soon.  Honestly don't know if I'll stick aroud long enough to see them myself, hehe<br>
