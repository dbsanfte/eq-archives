(As if you guys need another opinion)<br>
<br>
At present, if a mob requires 60 people to kill it, you'll see quite a few (5, 6 or more) rogues.  This, in Verant's eyes, kills class diversity on the top level raids.  After all, (this example for illustration purposes only) why have a ranger when a rogue does twice the damage and doesn't get killed for it?<br>
<br>
It therefore followed that the game designers concerned about this decided that some mechanism needed to be introduced which would have the end result of effectively limiting the number of rogues present on such encounters.  Significantly reducing the effectiveness of Evade has obviously presented itself as this limiting mechanism.  With the arguments put forth, the three-rogue death sequence looks like a real possibility, making me think that Evade has been tuned to this point so raid leaders have the choice of either only including two rogues, or limiting the use of additional rogues which means that in the end you may as well have only brought two along and grabbed some additional warriors and clerics instead (after all, with the extra time it's going to take to drop the boss mobs you'll need the extra tanks and healing) because it'll be as, or more, effective to do that than have more rogues.<br>
<br>
In conclusion: rogues are considered to be too additive in a multi-group raid setting.  Six rogues were nigh-on six times as good as one rogue.  Modifying evade is the mechanism chosen to forcing diminishing returns on the efficiency of rogues added to a raid.<br>
<br>
The result: There probably will be fewer rogues on raids as it becomes inefficient to use them.  This sounds like it's in line with Verants desire to make epic battles more challenging and to increase class diversity on multi-group raids. <p><HR align="CENTER" width="50%"><BR><img  src="http://www.top-hat.demon.co.uk/Images/tibissig42.jpg" usemap="#tibissignew8f631b" border="0" alt="Tibis Heartseeker"><map name="tibissignew8f631b"><area href="http://www.fdsoftware.com/eq" coords="142,154,298,174" shape="rect" alt="The Reapers of Fate"><area href="http://www.wolverineinternet.com/ring/wardens.php3?orderby=server" coords="142,134,298,154" shape="rect" alt="The Safehouse Ring"></map></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukarlek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karlek</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/01 8:24:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.main-rheiner.de/homepage/julius.makanec/karl/skarsaur12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> NO EVADING:<br>

1. The overzealous young beta rogue whose name starts with letter K reports that a rogue that can hide after a backstab to avoid mob hate is overpowerful. Hide is disabled as means to avoid mob hate. EQ Rogue loses his fighting style from D&D (hide/backstab... repeat) that meant cunning and skill and no tanking.<br>
<br>
2. Rogues have no armor, they get hated, they die left and right. There are few rogues, they suffer for *years*<br>
<br>
3. The beta rogue K.. gets more power, influences Kunark design and gets rogues EVADE ability that mocks up D&D functionality with 2-button 'skill' of backstab and hide.<br>
<br>
4. 10E16 rogues get pwrlvlded by 10E8 guilds. Suddenly, its no more 3 of us on the server, but megatwinko halfling that wants my trakanon tooth (joined group minute ago) that I pulled out with my bloodied (MY BLOOD!) hand, covered in banded and ravenscale only at lvl 48.<br>
<br>
5. Beta rogue K, now working for Verant, gives us Ragebringer. All rage over it, nice present, me don't need it anymore at all. It has both damage AND proc.<br>
<br>
6. 10E16 Ragebringing evading rogues bring down the 'balance' of 'vision'. Evade gets nerfed. Or will be.<br>
<br>
7. 10E16 twinko rogues (in fact all dr00ds and necros heheh) rage over Verant and beta rogue K. <br>

What they all get is only rage.)<br>

<br>
You didn't tell me anything I don't know, and I'm not sure where your example is going.  Nothing you wrote seemed to respond to my post.<br>
<br>
Summary of my point:<br>
<br>
Evade nerf is obviously intended to reduce rogue damage output (if it was only about us &quot;dropping off&quot; the list, the change would not have needed to be as severe).<br>
<br>
This is accomplished by either:<br>
<br>
1) A reduction in backstabs due to rogues tanking more (and therefore facing the wrong side of the mob).  This will happen to rogues who continue their current tactic of pushing the BS button every time it refreshes (pretty much all rogues).  They will be constantly at #1-#2 on the hate list, and a failed evade will mean a lost BS attempt while you tank another round.<br>
<br>
or,<br>
<br>
2) Forcing the rogue to change tactics, and withhold Backstabs at the beginning of the fight while they pre-emptively evade.  Then using Backstabs in moderation.<br>
<br>
Net result is lower damage, no matter how you look at it.<br>
<br>
And then there's the uber mob multi-group dilemma.  Multiple rogues will have even a harder time of getting their backstabs in, because either they will be holding back from BS'ing, or else they will be alternating with each other on the top of the hate list until all but one or two are dead.<br>
<br>
Back to what you wrote, not really sure I understand your point.  Sure, the people attacking the front of a mob lose a small bit of damage due to ripostes and dodges...but what does that have to do with rogue damage? (Other than when the rogue is tanking, which will obviously reduce rogue damage output even more.)<br>
<br>
When I'm limited to frontal attacks, I'll do a little over 1k damage/minute.  If I can backstab, I do over 4k damage/minute.<br>
<br>
Note this is post-55 with double backstab.<br>
<br>
Again, the fallout from this nerf will be that rogues will no longer be able to press that BS button every time it refreshes with near-impunity.  Rogues will have to be more conscious of their damage output, and resist the temptation to click that button every 5 seconds or deal with the wrong end of the mob.  If you are in a single group and can time your evades off a primary tank, it's not really an issue.  But in a multi-group high level raid it's a serious concern.<br>
<br>
Net result is less damage any way you slice it.<br>
<br>
Guessing somewhere in the range of a 40% damage reduction, based on my own combat style.<br>
<br>
<br>
I had a preview of this change last night in Sirens Grotto fighting underwater.  Evade was next to impossible (maybe once a fight if I got really luck) as I was constantly swimming to get to the back of the mob when I got a respite from tanking.  I'd only get maybe 3-4 backstabs in each battle.  And I took more damage in the underwater fights than any other time during the night.  With limited evade and only a couple backstabs I spent a heck of a lot of time tanking.  I cringe every time the BS button is up and I can't press it, but we're gonna have to get used to that.<br>
<br>
On the plus side I picked up a new 20 AC cloak to replace my HBC.  With the changes to work as I expect, I'll need the AC.  A week ago I wouldn't have even considered that replacement.<br>
<br>

<br>
That's exactly what rogues do now.  Click click click click click every time it refreshes.<br>
<br>
That's the problem that Verant is addressing with the nerf.  By forcing us to keep that button un-grayed longer it means rogue damage is contained.<br>
<br>
And a side effect will be as TibisHatter said, diminishing returns for the more rogues you have on raids.  Once you have maybe 2 rogues, you're just as well off having a ranger in that spot.  Which is good for class diversity.<br>
<br>
I'm the person in my guild who determines fight order, and group composition on raids.  This is going to affect the job I do greatly.  More than 2 rogues means the 3rd+ will be waiting in a support group until one of the first rogues die before they will be allowed to move in.  Rangers and lower level monks will take the place of the 3rd+ rogues in the primary groups.<br>

<br>
All the players on the raid were experienced, bonafide characters.  <br>
<br>
This test mob hit for 350 max, level 65, quad attacks, and flurries, 200000 hit points, with no spells.<br>
<br>
One Rogue died in the first run, and that was me. <br>
<br>
I had all hits/misses/spells on for logging, and was using a Willsapper and Ragebringer to jack up agro.  I died about 3/4 of the way through the first fight because battle spam from 30 players made me miss the fact that I was being beat on, and screwed my evade timing.<br>
<br>
Second run, no rogues died, most were evading early and often to keep agro down. <br>
<br>
Third run, same deal.<br>
<br>
It works, and works well.  More agro than before, yes, that was the intent.  Piles of dead rogues after every raid, no, that isn't happening. Massive reduction of rogue damage output, no, that isn't happening either.  <br>
<br>
We've got nearly 2 weeks before we patch the changes to Live, I intend to keep testing, and have Test Server rogues logging fights and noting Evades via a hotkey.  <br>

what i dont like is they change something after it's been this way for so long and they try to disguise it as a simple &quot;modification&quot; when the changes they've been outlining will destroy the skill's use <br>
<br>
it should have been nerfed a long time ago is the point, not after it being this way for so long, or at least when the hate list was expanded, and it should be changed back to a compromising position, not at the very bottom of the hate list, but certainly not at position #2 on the hate list if u are number 1 ....<br>
<br>
rogues can build up 500 hate in like 0.01 seconds<br>
heck a MISSED double backstab is like 234809340923892834 hate<br>

As I said in a previous thread, I have serious misgivings about the evade change, but it's good to see that it's being tested in &quot;real world&quot; conditions.<br>

Thanks again for the update. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwendolynkeplegrobal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wendolyn KeplegrobAL</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendhead.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/01 2:09:07 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendside.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> Ok... so the new evade skill was tested and rogues didn't drop like flies.  That's encouraging.  I'd like to see 8 rogues in a 50 person raid vs. quad 425 Dain or vs a triple 800 tormax.  Either way, I'm pretty much spent on this argument.  I await the live implementation... with a silent prayer for the rogue class...<br>
<br>
Signing off on the evade nerf...<br>

Evade had been well covered here and I am pleased to see that kendrik has started some real testing.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would like to broach a couple other things in the hopes that kendrik is reading, and to get some opinions. They are small tweaks that make sense and are not a problem to implement.<br>
<br>
*The Sense Trap Skill needs to be looked at. With the implementation of new traps in velious this skill has become something in the rogue arsenal that can really be put to use. The problem is that the &quot;sensing&quot; radius of the sense traps skill is tiny. This coupled with the fast the the recycle time of about 5 or 6 seconds makes this skill almost worthless..better to spring the trap and deal with it rather spend 20 minutes in a tiny area trying to sense a trap. <br>
<br>
--The Fix: Increase the sense trap radius by a good amount and drastically lower the recycle time . Sense Traps is a skill that you should be able to use on the fly while dungeon crawling, not sense, wait 5secs, take a step, sense, wait 5 sec, etc etc.. I would like to see this as something that I can click constantly in a strange dungeon, if something turns up I can yell stop and proceed to disarm without having to seriously slow down my group.<br>
<br>
*Poison resist: Being masters of poisoning and poisons you would naturally think that our poison resist would gain in  power as we gained in level. Somebody that handles poisonious snakes all their life stands a much better chance of surviving the poison than somebody who does not. <br>
<br>
--The Fix: give us 1pt of poison resist a level. warriors get magic resist, give us poison. not much to ask<br>

I still think between 2-3 is a fancy way of saying #2, and that is too high on the list. Keep doing checks and let us know how it works out.<br>
<br>
And I still want to know how much you had to reduce your damage output to keep from dieing.<br>

First off, the request - please also let us know what kind of an effect the evade change will have in some common xp group situations, and maybe some not-so-common ones.  Ok, now my question - Does anyone have a clue how this will effect a two man group, especially the druid/rogue kiting combo?  I remember doing the hill giants of rathe back when I was level 28 up until I hit 35 with a level 33-37 druid friend of mine, and we had a blast!  We died some when sow would run out, or ld's would happen, and agro control took some time to learn, especially when I would get better weapons, etc.  It was a great place to hunt, and took alot of skill to get down just right, where he nuked as little as possible, and I attacked as much as possible, while still keeping the big stupid oafs chasin' his tree-huggin' butt all over the place.  Could we do this now?  Would I have to do less damage?  Would he have to burn more, or would it even matter?  I can't even make a guess on this one - anyone else feeling up to the task? <p><p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=37752">Darkrok Shadowwalker</a> - Redeemed Dwarven Rogue of 40 Missions, <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Action=Journal&Jid=4546&Id=37752">Merchant Extraordinaire</a><br>

<br>
Your forgetting that moving from the top of the hate list to number 2 is a last resort.  I know when I do raids now I hang back a little at the start to make sure the warriors have a little agro before I jump in, I do not go to the top of the agro list then evade to 120 hate.<br>
<br>
It's not a good thing if you get to number one on the agro list at any time during the encounter. I think the main thing is the 10% hate reduction (or min 500 hate reduction) from pre evading.  If this works well then we should be ok, and even if we mess up and get to number one we can stop attacking and escape to number 2. <p>Falesh<br>55th lvl Scout<br><a href="http://server5.ezboard.com/bsanguineblade"><font color="#FF0000">Sanguine Blade</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a> <b>8</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2064.topic&start=201&stop=217>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2075.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2087.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2064.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2064.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2064.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2064.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
