I can solo blues... semi-often i guess i could say, but the xp is so bad, and it brings me to like 20% health and no endurance every time.  heh yes, yellow/blue armor/weapons.  My damage compaired to others is just silly, i really have no use.<br>
<br>
RvR is fun though when i get to kill a grey enemy, other than that, any blue or higher it's really really tough to kill them if they're not sitting or paying attention.  <br>

I'm just kinda hopeful they make the class a tad more interesting in the future, it was cool at first but now all i'm good for is scouting... shoulda played a ranger heh.<br>

I play a Nightshade in Hibernia, and 2 weeks into the game, I'd been through 3 of 5 dungeons completely (Muire, Spragg, and Money Dungeon 1).  And they aren't really dungeons, just 8 connected rooms with no real design or anything of interest.  Add to that 2 dungeons have no items, and it gets kinda weak.  <br>
<br>
Several tradeskills aren't in, rogues aren't finished, many skills that were promised aren't added yet (climbing, disguises, etc.)  They just didn't get enough in before they released it.  In the spring with the expansion, it will be what it should have been at release imho.<br>
<br>
2)  Broadcast - No one uses the lfg channels, especially above lv20.  It's 10 times harder to find a group in DAoC than in EQ.  This can be very frustrating.  I miss /shout badly.<br>
<br>
3) Grouping is the *only* good way to get exp.  Unless you are a solo class and gimp yourself for group and RvR (like a druid ignoring heal and putting all points into pet), grouping will bring exp 5 times as fast as soloing.  Granted, I am a Nightshade, but I can solo high blues very easily with no risk of death with 30% endurance and half health left.  Even then, the exp is so slow that its pointless.  It's better to run around for 2 hours lfg and getting in one for an hour than to solo for 3 hours.  That would be fine if they had a good way to find a group, but as it is, it gets very frustrating.<br>
<br>
I would be willing to go from one end of the realm to another to group, but my lfg flag won't show up way up there, so they will never know I'm looking.  Also, lfg flags don't show up in dungeons, which is exactly where you are trying to go to half the time.<br>
<br>
4) Mob aggro is brilliant.  Very interesting, and good improvement, although my one complaint is there is no skill to pulling anymore.  You get a number of mobs based on your parties strength, so who cares which mob you tag?<br>
<br>
5)  Travel I think is fine.  Bards and wardens can make you run fast, and you are never more than a 30 second run from a horse.  You can jump off a horse and catch another one to get exactly where you need to be.  Very rarely do I need more than 2 horses, so its only 10s.<br>
<br>
6)  RvR I have problems with.  If you get in a raid, or in a group defending against a raid, it's fun, but that doesn't happen a lot, and its a crapshoot whether you will get in one.  If you go solo or with a single group to raid, half the time you die to a mob and have to release with exp loss and never even see another player.  If you get to other players, half the time they are purple and you all die in one shot, and the other half the time they are grey, and you kill them all for 5 rps total.  About once a year you find an even con group and have a good fight.  They need to fix this so that there is a much quicker, easier way to get in fights with people your level. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ugarouin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garouin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/26/01 1:45:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They need to fix this so that there is a much quicker, easier way to get in fights with people your level.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

But I now have not logged on to EQ for 5 weeks (cept for the odd login and chat - not to play) - and I still have no desire too.  Dunno hitting 60 kind of killed it a bit for me.  Only thing left is wait, prep, raid, rinse, repeat. Getting so many togeather takes so long.  Oh there is quests which are... well not exactly exciting. I even left my epic alone till 60 so I had something else to do - and not even that worked for long.<br>
<br>
I can do loot camps in certain dungeons since I don't need the xp, but that gets boring now too.  The graphics look really badly dated as well as the interface - hopefully SoL will fix as I feel im going back to Windows 3.11 when I log into EQ to chat.<br>
<br>
Camelot ain't perfect but after nearly two years of EQ it's very welcome.  Tagging along on massive raids with 200-300 of my fellow norsemen with seige weapons nailing forts is beautiful to see, even if laggy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Well.. Sort of.  I like the larger varity EQ has in armor textures, but EQ has had almost 3 years to add more:  Go back to the original EQ and there's nothing.  leather, chain, and plate.  DAoC is only a few months old and already has multiple graphics for all of those.<br>
<br>
And SoL Models.. ugh<br>
<br>
I personally prefer my cloaked Highlander cleric in black over my Monk in 2 year old armor graphics (Goldenstar = Shiverback, I mean).  And their standing graphic.  I look like I had a giant do something to me that I'm not allowed to talk about in detail here..  Sitting Graphic?  Atleast make it natural.  I know I'd rather sit in DAoC's style over SoLEQ's style.  Hey look!  I manage to crush both balls this time!<br>
<br>
The leveling thing is killing me though, I can't convince myself to start up again:  I've been 37 for almost a month, I guess after 59.6 levels in EQ, it starts to get old. <p><center><img src="http://ajantval.homestead.com/files/rid.gif"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uxenix1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xenix1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1606<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(1/7/02 6:03:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's been five weeks, how does DAoC rate now?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> i like daoc but frankly the leveling thing bores me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I have to say the biggest problem is lack of open channels in which to communicate.<br>
<br>
Yes there would be a lot of pointless talk just like there is in EQ.<br>
<br>
But ask yourself, how many times have you been helped by someone in OOC or Shout? Given a Loc, told where to get your spells, told what to do and what not to do? Esp when you first start playing.<br>
<br>
Without it DAOC is a very lonesome place.<br>
<br>
I play the game when I am tired and I don't want to talk to anyone, when I am in the mood to chat and be friendly, I will log on EQ. Unfortunately if I was an unfriendly person I wouldn't be playing a Multi Player game.<br>
<br>
It kinda defeats the object of the game to be multi player, but to have terrible communication. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uizaikon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izaikon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(1/13/02 4:30:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> It's been five weeks, how does DAoC rate now?</span><hr size=1> I played DAoC for about a month and just got bored.

It just doesn't compare to EQ.  I played it, I saw the graphics, and truth be known THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE NEW SOL MODELS IN EQ.  I honestly think they could have done better if they would have used Legos to build the chars in DAoC, at least then they wouldn't be as blocky, and they'd probably run faster too.  But then again, it wasn't the graphics that made me not like the game.  It was the fact that the game totally blew.  <br>
       Why did it blow? Well, the main reason was that it was very lonely.  For all I knew, I would have been paying 10 dollars a month to play by myself.  I mean I was surprised to not hear crickets churping in my speakers, or see a tumble weed go across the screen.  No OOC, no SHOUT, no AUCTION, and even though there is BROADCAST, you can only use it in town. Which brings me to my next point.<br>
      I couldn't even go into a town and hit any of my arrow keys without doing a full 90 degree turn.  Framerate was that bad.  No joke.  And I'll be the first to admit the computer I have is out of date, but from what I've read people with better computers than mine were having trouble too.  I don't know maybe they've fixed that by now.<br>
      Anyway to wrap this up (so that the avid fans of DAoC can flame away), DAoC is a poor interpretation of EQ and it bites.  Why play DAoC with it's 10 or so dungeons when you can play EQ, which I'm sure has close to, if not over, 100 zones.  Maybe, in a couple of years, I'll play it again to see if it's any better, but that's only if it's still around by then.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Yeah I know I was harsh on the game, but maybe someone who plays EQ will read this and save 50 dollars + 10 more a month.  Just my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/udailyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dailyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/5/02 3:52:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's been five weeks, how does DAoC rate now?</span><hr size=1> Just to throw in my couple cents on this topic.  I played EQ for a year and a half before DAOC came out and decided that RvR sounded like a blast.  Played camelot for 4 months and am now back playin EQ.  Camelot rocks if you are new to this type of game.  Leveling is simple, death is relatively painless, and getting decent equipment is not a monumental task.  You can solo pretty well with most classes and most classes have something to bring to a group.  The downside is that if you are an experienced player things can get old quickly.  The world is much smaller and there is simply less to explore and do.  It was fun for awhile, but lacked a challenge and really lacked substance imho.  RvR was alot of fun for awhile, but even that got old.  Most battles were simply hack at the nearest enemy and wait for a rez.  With 100 realmmates running through Albion, fort taking became virtually risk free and simply a matter of wacking on the gates for 15 minutes then taking 3 to kill all the npc defenders inside.  Now before folks start telling me I don't know what I'm talking about, I did rvr extensively.  My chars are not low level.  After mudding for years, then playing EQ for a couple,  Camelot just didn't do it for me.  I must confess though, I'm much more impressed with Mythic as far as willingness to work with players to improve the game than I am with Verant.<br>

<br>
I think the lack of high-end content other than RvR is why I left. Hey, if RvR is your bag then that's great. I thought it would be mine too, but it isn't. It seems mostly pointless in that victories and losses in RvR don't really affect the way you play the game day-to-day.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that they should set up a special server that completely redoes zone boundaries between the home realms and the frontier realms. Instead of making the frontier gate fortress the only point of entrance into an enemy's home realm, make it just a large, well-defended castle with a decently sized force whose job it is to patrol the whole border area. That way large parties could sneak into the home realms and wreak havok.<br>
<br>
If the idea of massive PvP battles as the be-all-end-all turns you off, then DAOC is not for you. Once you get to level 40 (the level at which I quit), you will have, in my experience, explored every nook and cranny of every zone that you could possibly visit (without cheating and sneaking into the enemy homerealms, theoretically supposed to be impossible). In 44 levels in EQ I have maybe explored 1/4 of the game.<br>
<br>
The one gut feeling that I missed the most in DAOC was the feeling that I was immersed in an absolutely vast and immense world. Norrath is king as far as sheer size and amount of content is concerned. Yes, quality should win out over quantity, but in EQ's case, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> variety</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is king. There are so many different areas, with so many different pulling strategies required. So many ways to die. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  DAOC is rather boring as far as this goes. The first xp group you join in DAOC will work more-or-less the same as an xp group that you will be in when you ding 50.<br>
<br>
The thing is, there needs to be a more tangible reward for putting in the amount of time needed to get to level 50 in DAOC, because the content is exhausted so quickly. EQ seems to have perfected this because of all the high-level loot that is available, although I'm sure that there are people who are bored with EQ because they have &quot;seen it all&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's really in the eye of the beholder. I think that you are going to choose the game that rewards you the most psychologically, and EQ happens to be that game for me. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showMessageRange?topicID=209.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=209.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showNextMessage?topicID=209.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.emailToFriend?topicID=209.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.threadControl?topicID=209.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=209.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=209.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14>Other Games</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
