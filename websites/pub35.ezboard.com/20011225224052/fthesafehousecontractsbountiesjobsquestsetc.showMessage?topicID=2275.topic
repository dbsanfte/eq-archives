Don't do this.  Any of this.  I mean it.<br>
<br>
First off, at the general slaying, I somehow lose all knowledge of exactly what the heck I'm supposed to do, and somehow managed not to see the monk's &quot;wait here, I pull it to you&quot; message, and like the gibbering newb that I'd somehow turned into, I went and got myself nice and cozy in the cabin for no apparent reason; so I died without even trying to hand in the 'gimme general' doohicky.<br>
<br>
The dark elf the raid force had left alive for our purposes took forever to actually finish the deed; frankly I was getting tired of him missing me, so I did the old sit repeatedly trick to help him a tad, he looked to need it.  Much embarassment followed my res, and every rogue in the game told me their version of what I was supposed to be doing, so the next time I managed to get it right, even with six skeletons of various makes, models and casting ability staring straight at me, or nuking the fd'd monk (honestly I should have aborted--I got kinda lucky there).<br>
<br>
Then the fun camp for Vilinus; as it would happen, three generals had died like clockwork, and *TWO* of them dropped ye old ultra-rare cazic quill...wouldn't you know it if MY general wouldn't be the odd-man out, so I have to scrounge up a bunch of overpriced robes and set off to pester newbies in west karanas for a few hours in /ooc.  Things like 'stay away, if you agg the brigand I will be sad.'  That damned 'a brigand' musta sat at the bottom of the hill mocking me for hours before his more worldly brother 'a brigand' finally showed up, and naturally proceeded to run halfway across the zone to fight bears.<br>
<br>
I didn't know, and still don't know, if Vil's spawn is independent of that brigand or not, but I wasn't taking any chances; I consumed a few sow potions over the course of an hour and killed everything that even thought it could be mobile within a mile while praying that bloodthirsty brigand would stay alive long enough to make it till the Small one showed up.  Which he finally did, and there was rejoicing as I turned in robes that would have made a level 50 wizard drool a year ago.<br>
<br>
Finally, Vilinus satisfied, cazic quill in hand, generals pouch in hand, I am off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of--oops, wrong movie---I'm off to see Stanos.  So I hail Anson, who was handily hanging around waiting for me, and spawn our friend in the green pants and red shirt.<br>
<br>
Now at this point, I know exactly what the more observant rogues are thinking: &quot;Fool!  Where is your jagged diamond dagger?&quot;  And this question did in fact cross my mind.  Unfortunately, that crossing occurred AFTER clicking the 'give' button to fruitlessly remove my recently hard earned pouch and quill from my inventory.  <br>
<br>
Needless to say I was heartbroken.   The most utterly stupid thing I could have possibly done, at the absolute worst stage in the quest imaginable--when it was over.  There was whining, shouts of NOOOOO, gnashing of teeth, mountain dew flung at high velocity to the furthest wall, and cigarette butts everywhere. I was left with time to consider my options while re-loading everquest (I'd also managed somehow to lock up my interface with a careless click of one of those 'web enhancement' keys that I've never figured out how to disable).<br>
<br>
An eternity later, I get back into the game and Stanos is still up!  And desparate inspiration had struck me.<br>
<br>
/who showed me three people in the zone, myself included, so I did a shout for assistance, and a kind level 21 cleric seemed willing to help.  Between spurts of spam-hailing Stanos, I actually manage to talk the newbie up into the smugglers den and get him to take over, while I run to the bank for my jagged diamond dagger.<br>
<br>
And then I proceeded to spend several hours in east commons, chugging brews until the screen was so warped I thought I was rapidly turning my monitor off and back on, and wander aimlessly trying to actually hit decayed skeletons in this inebriated a state.  I eventually gave up on that and repeatedly hit F8 and shot arrows.   Much faster way to take out decayed skeletons, orc pawns and sergeant slate.<br>
<br>
Oh, and that level 21 cleric received my trusty trak's tooth in gratitude.  Who says level 20's can't earn 10k cash.<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't there something more?&quot;  Biatch.  I'm going to have endless fun taking your head now Stanny.  I'm going to take your head just so I can /emote jumps on Stanos' head.  I'm going to try to EAT your head. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukarak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karak</A> at: 5/24/01 6:53:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usquinkmcpoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squink McPoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/01 7:25:18 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nother Ragebringer on E'ci, and a dire warning</span><hr size=1> You know, normally these 'Lookee my new toy' brag posts make me wish I had the 30 seconds or so that it took me to read them back.<br>

<br>
KNOWING how the General's aggro is, KNOWING what items you need to turn in, KNOWING exactly what you need to do to finish the quest.<br>
<br>
IMO, if someone can screw up SOO Badly, forget an item for turnin, have a LUCKY LUCKY turn in to the general and STILL pull it off, well...<br>
<br>
IMO, you don't deserve the Ragebringer, and a story like this just boggles my mind and devalues the epic weapon even further.<br>
<br>
---<br>
As an example, I 'PRACTICED' the hand in to various mobs for about 5 hours long before I got close to the hut in Kithicor, and I spent a few hours on a couple occasions watching the spawns, chatting wtih other rogues who had finished their quest (I was within the first 5 I think to get mine on DR, so was still pretty 'uncertain'), and the night of the big fight, I was there 3 hours before the raiding party showed up, practicing clearing the house, figuring out which one would be up, which to do the turn in with, how far to space them, what do do if something didn't go right, etc...<br>

Something that's entirely in the spirit of the Safehouse I might add.<br>

Every so often 'epic luck' should fall in a player's favour; after all, prodigious luck is often a characteristic of the heroes of fiction we know and love. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujarobethorlock.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarobeThorlock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/01 1:25:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nother Ragebringer on E'ci, and a dire warning</span><hr size=1> Lol Sanlen!!

I had NO idea you had to go through all of this!<br>
<br>
After giving you the Ishva and you said you had an oracle on the line, I had to log to go eat with the Fiance..<br>
<br>
You really had to go through some trauma.<br>
<br>
I don't agree that you don't &quot;deserve&quot; an RB for your mistakes and I applaud your posting here for others to read..<br>
<br>
I was one of the types, however that had checked the cabin out before hand, was ready, had gone over the hand off a million times in my head and was really probably overly prepared.. <br>
<br>
I had the Jagged Diamond Dagger in my pack, ready to go just in case the fabled cazic quill did drop..<br>
<br>
I'm glad we could help you get your RB.. Wish I could have helped you avoid all that other BS.. <br>

Good story and good post though.<br>

&quot;Epic luck,&quot;  I rather think that turn of phrase applies.  Oh, and I managed somehow not to even see 'jagged diamond dagger' in the quest walkthrough, even though it being displayed to me on my other computer all night.  I think 90% of my brain just decided to switch off.  The handoff itself was nothing like what I was imagining.  I was imagining something like just the dark elf and no wanderers; not a monk flopping around with two caster skeletons on him while screaming 'give him the box already' <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukarak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karak</A> at: 5/24/01 4:55:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalqanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malqanar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/saladin/malqanar.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/01 10:04:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/saladin/malqanar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nother Ragebringer on E'ci, and a dire warning</span><hr size=1> So Woodash, did the first person (Kaylum?

Son, what are you smoking? I am stunned... he didn't read any strategies or practice b/c it was UNKNOWN how it would go! As a matter of fact, if I recall correctly, a few of the first final turnins were failures b/c they underestimated the General, and quietly and FAST redid the entire quest up to the General AGAIN, to try to get the FIRST RAGEBRINGER (ha ha, Rangebringer?) sheesh, can't even comment any more on that one...<br>
