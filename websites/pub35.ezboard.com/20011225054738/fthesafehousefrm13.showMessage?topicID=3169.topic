Necro's job was to really really tick Renux off by shadow vortex'ing her alot, and then run around.  Shaman malo'd, buffed us, and did a few heals now and then.  The 57 rogue and I were on snare duty with our trusty ol' SBD's while the transferred rogue just tried to stay as low on the hate list while hitting renux with the daggers we gave him since he had no armor.  After running around for awhile, we finally got a SBD proc to land on her, so we swapped in real weapons and went to town.  The necro wasn't on snare duty since it takes too long for him to cast it and he needed his mana for keeping aggro with shadow vortex.  Anyhow, the snares he did try were all resisted.  All in all, it was a goofy fight that we almost didn't win, but then again, that's pretty much the standard for us.<br>
<br>
Actually, I think a rogue and a necro or SK could take her out if you are careful and patient.  Before she was immune to fear, our tactic was for the rogues to hit her with instill doubt and land snares with SBDs while she chased the necro around.  We killed her a couple of times that way.<br>

And 4 of my best friends in game are rogues. Needless to say, we do everything for each other. I Have done renux , 7 times I figure. 1st time we tanked her with 2 groups and it went very well.<br>
<br>
The last 6 times we did with quick pick up groups. However,<br>
tanking is much more fun, but you get what you can get.<br>
And this way falls right in line with us shifty types.<br>
<br>
Druid (recommend 55+)<br>
Cleric<br>
1 tank (if it goes wrong)<br>
Other than that, all rogues :)<br>
<br>
Sow everyone, buff everyone, then spawn renux.<br>
Have druid snare her, then dot her. Kite renux around and<br>
wait about 10 seconds for aggro to fly, then all melees<br>
attack her from behind while druid continues to kite.<br>
Usually aggro will stay on druid, and it's a painless <br>
and efficient way to kill her.<br>
<br>
~As for fearing her, I have heard rumors that fearing<br>
her don't work anymore. Can anyone shed some factual<br>
light on this. What I was told was that in the cases where<br>
fear succeeded, it lasted only a couple of seconds.<br>

Plan was to spawn him, I tank while shm malo's, tries to slow, and druid tries to snare.  Then we snare kite, etc..<br>
<br>
Didn't work out that way - spawned renux, druid attempted to snare, all resisted, but druid did manage to kite around un-snared renux while the shaman malo'd and finally landed slow, from that point we just straight tanked her once i regained aggro, fight took about 4 or 5 minutes, cleric ended up at around 50 mana, had to reslow her once i think, but once she was slowed it was a cakewalk.  Also before fight we made sure to buff poison resist by the shaman and i put on a couple pieces of resist gear.

Stayed just out of her reach with Sow / wolfform very easily and I followed her backstabbing happily. <br>
<br>
Took about 30 minutes just the two of us, but other than a few moments where we were afraid the snare might wear off before he could recast it and get it to stick... it was easy =)<br>
<br>
This works on any Melee only non summoning mob where you have some room to run around, me and him have &quot;soloed&quot; the giant dino in oot (allisaures?) englyks the giant in ew, and anything else that caught our attention basically....<br>
<br>
Hope it helps, when I read about renux I knew I could take her with just my friend if I ever found her - I was very happy to see it work out. <br>
<br>
Honestly - When you take the Ranger's amazing ability to get aggro and turn it into a strength instead of a weakness -  they're an incredible class. Every whining ranger is just an example to me of a player who can't understand all they can accomplish. <br>
