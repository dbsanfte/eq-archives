<br>
This continues a myth that was never so.<br>
<br>
Monks have always been good tanks. Pre-Kunark, during Kunark, in Vellious and in SoL.<br>
<br>
It is not something we have to apologise for. We have always (since Rogues were rijigged) done less damage than the Rogue and more than the Warrior, and tanked better than the Rogue but not as well as the Warrior.<br>
<br>
It is the last part that is failing, not because there is something wrong with Monks, but because there is something Wrong with the way in Warrior abilities are capped (everybodies actually).<br>
<br>
We do not have to apologies for being able to tank.<br>
<br>
We do not have to get into comparisons with Hybrids over melee prowess... WE are the pure melees, we balance with the other pure melees, and then Hybrids are related to that.... They are PART Warrior, and part their &quot;parent&quot; class.<br>
<br>
The reasoning of the problem is simple lets not confuse it.<br>
<br>
The issue of balance is among the pure melees, do not let the Knights muddy the issue.<br>
<br>
Warriors, Monks, Rogues... we balance those three FIRST... then we worry about relating the Hybrids to that.... if not we got a bunch of Tank Mages running around. <p><hr />

<br>
Here is a novel concept, stop trying to cuddle up to verant.<br>
<br>
What I read here is you saying, O great and wise verant please alter the nerf to pass me over and stick it really hard to the monks that went before me and invested hundreds upon hundreds of hours getting loot I don't have.<br>
<br>
Just so we are crystal clear, you don't speak for me.<br>
I do disagree with your 'opinion'.<br>
<br>
Phased spider carapace as a problem item?  it has a weight of 5.0, items of that nature that monks can wear are self limiting anyway since they severely cut into your available weight limit, going over that limit would negate the ac benefit anyway.<br>
<br>
From a game stand point, the absolute most damaging choice designers can make is to remove the ability to wear no drop armor people have had for over a year, making them suddenly have to go camp new cloths.   I don't know about you but all my 'old' no drop armor was grats delete.<br>
<br>
It's bad enough I'm going to log in losing 30% of my mitigation and get crippled with a new lower ac softcap, but you are suggesting instead I log in wearing the emperor's new clothes.<br>
I've put in way too much time into this game to have someone render me butt naked in a patch, thanks tho.<br>
<br>
I notice you said you don't have any ntov + armor, so I suppose this is why you think stripping it from others is a good idea?  After all if they by some incredibly sad miracle took your advice you'd wake up patch day without a downside.<br>

We've met in game, remember?  I'm not kissing Verant's ass (lol like they'll somehow reward me), I just sincerely believe that the problem is over-accelerated mudflation due to poor design.<br>
<br>
The items are the problem.  They can fix them a number of ways.  Raise their weight (and a PSC at 5 isn't that limiting.  Lots of monks use Tstaves still...).  Reduce their stats.  Change who can use them.  I think all of those are valid ways of addressing the issue, and depending on the item a different fix would be called for (ancient wyvern hide armor is a good example of something that should be made monk-only and have its stats lowered).<br>
<br>
I know a lot of monks wouldn't like this change.  I wouldn't, many of my items would become nerfed or unusable.  However I feel that this is a better solution than gimping us on a combat table, one that will ALWAYS gimp us.  Fixing these items is a short term nerf; in the long run we'll be just fine.<br>
<br>
Regardless, please don't take this so personally.  Obviously many people have different opinions, and some folks share mine and some folks share yours.  Let's not have it be something to be hostile over.<br>

<br>
This patch has just annoyed me a great deal.<br>
<br>
We lost mitigation, we didn't gain anything, certainly we don't avoid more that was just a rumor.<br>
<br>
I have no faith in Verant to understand the real effects of their choices,  I never main tanked big mobs.<br>
But supposedly because I could tank something like the creator (which slowed a shaman could tank thank you), I'm overpowered.<br>
<br>
The people hardest hit by this are the monks without Good gear.  <br>
<br>
As for taking it personally, I take the nerf personaly yes.<br>
I don't take bonestrikers position personally, nor do I have any ill will toward you.  The only person I find annoying here really is Daesun the ranger who joined this board just to talk about how happy she is this happened.<br>
<br>
The reason I'm outspoken is I don't for a moment imagine the people at verant will do anything to fix this unless people make their feelings well known.  Three years I've played this game, now one morning I wake up to find out that I'm not supposed to be what I am, they nerf my ability to take damage while at the same time improve the defense of plate classes and in pop will give those plate classes with 3 levels of planar toughness (not sure of name) for a 8000hp warrior that means 1200 more hp.<br>
Surely improving them was sufficient.<br>
<br>
I just fail to see why they needed to nerf us while at the same time pump up the other classes.   I'd have no objection to the plate classes getting more hp, but why do I have pay money to buy an expanion in which I become less than I was, while others look forward to being more than they are?<br>
What exactly do monks get in this expansion other than shafted? <br>

Retro nerfing this is almost like randomizing the loot you're wearing. Not even VI could be insane enough to do that on a large scale. Or could they ? After seeing last nights 'retuning' I'm not so sure. Just got confirmed again that they do no testing whatsoever. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">
