<br>
Next, mages aren't supposed to kill warriors with just nukes thats why they gave you a pet and a dmg shield.  Saying that you can't kill a warrior with only your nukes is like saying that warrior can't kill you if if bags his main hand weapon please...<br>
<br>
Now back to rhainvs persistant complaints...<br>
<br>
&quot;Casters = not a threat to any melee unless exploiting los or in groups or something.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Oh bull If my main char was a caster I would be insulted by this load of @#%$.  You play a chanter on a server where everyone wears their resist gear all the time of course your going to have a lot of trouble. Mages, Wizards and Especially Necromancers are a lot more prepared to put up a fight vs melees.  Enc on the other hand is I believe a good anti caster class and an awesome group pvp class from what I've seen.<br>
<br>
I hear the same argument again and again about lifting the pvp dmg nerf and yet the only valid point I've seen is the fact that casters can run oom casting on some classes.  In what way does that mean you need to do dmg faster? Seems to me the only neccesary solution would be a larger manna pool which would adress the issue of dmg over a long period of time as well.<br>
<br>
Another thing you need to stand still for 3 to 6 seconds yes but you don't need to be hit for 3 to 6 seconds!  A caster needs to get a bit of space before trying to get that cast off if you do it right you can get your spells off without taking too much dmg per spell especially on those short casts.  Casters in my experience often suffer from one of two problems.<br>
<br>
A) A. S. S. Arnold Swartzenegger Syndrome (sp) otherwise known as BOSS (balls of steel syndrome) This is where the caster is under the delusion that they are a tank and they will just stand there while you beat their ass trying to cast.<br>
<br>
B) R. S. S. Richard Simmons Syndrome.  This is where the caster keeps interupting himself even in cases where he may well have channeled the spell with very little dmg taken. (this is sometimes acompanied by girlish shouts of suprise and alarm) In the end they take far more dmg from repeated failed attempts to cast than they would otherwise have taken and end up retreating.<br>
<br>
Finding the right balance between these two extremes is a big part of playing a pvp caster I think.   I know you have it rough as a chanter but maybe you aren't seeing the whole melee vs caster argument clearly and even more importantly perhaps your ignoring a set of strategies (or understating them) that could be a lot of help vs melees (pet dmg, dmg shield dmg, levitation, charming).  I do not think you are meant to take melees down with just casting and I think those other strategies exist because of this.<br>
<br>
I would suggest perhaps you speak with a good pvp chanter on RZ named Tsunammi(sp again).  I remember I was so confidant that I could take a chanter that I dueled her in probably one of the worst places to fight a caster lavastorm and lost due to a combination of leviation, pet dmg, and dmg shields even with quite high mr somewhere in my upper 40s(level NOT mr).  I may do more dmg now than I once did but I don't see those strategies mentioned above as much less effective if used right. <br>
<br>
In short from certain people here I have seen nadda but complaints and exaggeration as to the power of melees and gross understatement as to the usefulness of casters in pvp. If ANYONE has any doubts perhaps you need to speak with some RZ casters who do very well for themselves as it is.<br>
<br>
NO to nerfing melee dmg and NO to removing the pvp dmg nerf. I do NOT think a wizard needs to kill me in 3 rather than 4 lures nor do I believe that my dmg should be reduced to 2/3 making it take 1.5 x the current length of time to kill them and giving them THAT much longer to nuke me.  I love my rogue but it is a hard class to play in pvp I don't need more of a challenge thanks.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=454.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=526.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=518.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.threadControl?topicID=518.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=518.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=518.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
