Anndazzadarian removed the leather belt from her waist and slipped the pouch off of it, tossing the belt to the bedding in the corner. There was a strange anticipation, like opening a secured box, not knowing what treasures might be contained with in.  She licked her lips and pulled the strings open to the black leather pouch, her young face spread with a wide grin, amethyst eyes sparkling with pride as she looked upon the shiny black statuette inside.  Reaching into the pouch she pulled the figurine out with long dainty fingers, and stroked the cool ebony surface.  It tingled against her flesh, there was something magical about it, but it was not why she stole it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Such material things meant little to her, she did not care about magic or riches, she liked it and now it was hers.  Pressing it to her pink lips, it tingled more on the soft flesh of her mouth, but she always kissed her winnings, such prizes were the affection of her heart and deserved such treatment. Anndazzadarian dropped it back into the pouch and went to the make shift blankets and worn out feather mattress that was her bed.  She tucked it into the folds of some of the blankets and sat cross-legged on the bedding.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The smile remained wide, her white teeth in contrast to her blue-black flesh, of her Teir-Dal heritage.  A mirror did not speak kindly to Anndazzadarian, she was told she was ugly, and unfit by her family, yet every eye that fell upon her coveted her beauty.  A pretty face with slender, fine features, her nose a slight point, lips soft and full, the blush color seemingly brighter against her dark supple flesh.<br>
Nearly out of her teens, she was one of the most desirable females in the city of Neriak, a firm tight body and full breasts that in the right clothes would catch every man’s lustful glance and every woman’s jealous stare.  Though her clothes did little to flatter her body. Black leather and full sweeping cloaks were her choice of wear.  Black as the shadows she embraced as friend and protector.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Anndazzadarian pulled the leather cap from her head and a storm of waist length white locks spilled from underneath, covering her shoulders, back and chest, like a snow-white shawl.  Though no more than five and a quarter feet tall, there was strength in her long limbs, her back and shoulders.  Not the strength of bulging muscles a warrior possesses, but a more subtle strength of muscle endurance.  Muscles that could keep her poised on the face of a wall, unmoving for times the strongest warriors could not even comprehend. <br>
She kicked off her boots and tossed them to the side of her crypt like room of stone. Meagerly decorated, with little more than a wash bin, bed and, of course a stash of acquired items, it was all her parents would allow her to have.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Too tired to remove the rest of her clothes, the night had been long, the task trying, she flopped to her back to sleep.  The mission had been trying, but now in the glory of her success of her greatest theft, it was all worth it.  To have the black statue of Innourok she had coveted since a young girl was now a reality.  It almost seemed a dream, the whole event, sneaking into the temple of the @#%$ of hate and stealing the precious ebony statuette.  Past guards, clerics and worshippers, lost in the shadows of the underground city, moving in the gloominess, stepping with grace and silence and always patient.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The effigy had little value to her, as did Innourok. What had the @#%$ of hate ever done for her?  For all she was concerned he did not even exist and if he did there was no worth in worshiping his hateful ways.  Hate killed and Anndazzadarian was tired of all the death.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her leather halter dug into her flesh, the clamps burrowing into her skin, but she had suffered with the discomfort for hours this night, falling a sleep with it on would not be so bad.  Tomorrow she would sneak to the bathhouse and relax in its steamy waters and refresh her tired muscles, and bruised flesh.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The smile on her face did not fade as she closed her eyes, lying upon the bed, one of the fallen, a Teir’dal that did not believe in the @#%$ of hate.  Sleep was becoming an over whelming force, but a most welcome one. Anndazzadarian was content, she won her prize and it did not matter, at this moment that her parents forced her to live in squalor while her brother had a room in the main house, with a bed, books and even an armoire filled with fancy clothes.  Stealth was her skill and she was its master she thought, as sleep came over came her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The abruptness of it was the worst part, not the crushing blow to her mid-section, but the suddenness of it coming as she slept.  Anndazzadarian gasped in pain and for breath and for a moment, the blackness consumed her.  It was a darkness like that of having her eyes closed, even her superior vision could not see in complete darkness, though the faint glow of a phosphorus lichen was more than enough to light the way for a dark elf.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She heard the hiss of a woman cursing, and then another blow struck and her world spun away.  The blow this time was to her head, splitting her flesh, warm blood trickled into her eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Panic swelled in her breast, and the desire to curl into a ball and cry, excepting the beating, began to overwhelm her.  Fitting she should die in the dank cellar, the thick musty order of a crypt had made her feel macabre in life as if she was already dead among her people, now she would be.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You little despicable whore,” a woman cursed slamming a staff into her stomach again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She knew that voice, knew it all to well, but catching her breath was all that mattered as she flailed about trying to suck in air.  Her heart was pounded and tears rolled down her cheeks, her vision clearing as the blows had stopped.  The statue Anndazzadarian thought, she had been found out and the high priestess of Innorouk came for her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ann you have been a disappointment to your family, but this is intolerable.  Give me the statue and you shall die only once.  Lie and you die slow and painfully every day for as long as I live.” The Priestess hissed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ann began to wail, she knew the horrors of her people, their evilness truly not understood by most of the other races of Norrath, or they would strive to destroy every last one of them.  Her death would be long and hard but if it only came once it would be a blessing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It is here,” Ann croaked out between gasps and sobs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then give it to me.” The priestess demanded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ann, as quick as her shocked and battered body would allow, found the statue and handed it to the high priestess of Innourok.  The woman slipped it into her robes and then handed her staff to a handsome young man at her side.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You think you skills are good, your pride has brought this on you.  I shall be honored to serve the great Innourok and end the miserable existence of another unbeliever.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The young man handed the priestess a whip, its length woven with sharp barbs along the flexible length, barbs meant to tear the flesh.  Ann wept, there was nothing else to do, but weep and hope for a swift death.  She tried to remember where her dagger was, so that she might take her own life, but what good would that do.  They would just raise her from death and it would be worse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Terrin strip her. I want her to enjoy the whip on her flesh.” The woman grinned as she gave the order.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The young male went to the duty in silence.  The high priestesses orders were not to be questioned and it was not like he had to seen torture before, he had administered such punish even as a young boy, but this was somehow different.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The room was silent, except for the sobs of Ann and the crunching of leather as she was stripped bare, waiting for the inevitable pain that would come.  Lashes that could rip flesh, cut muscle like a sword, and even break bones.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  As a child Ann had seen many enemies fall to such punishment.  The high elves had always seemed to suffer the most, but how could any such suffering have ever been considered lenient, it was all the worst it could be to the one receiving it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was an ordinary event, children taken to an execution, to see the power of hate, what it could do, how enemies would fall to it, and the terror it would sow across the lands of Norrath.  Ann still remembered the first death she had ever seen.  It had been a halfling caught in the Nektulos woods.  A prisoner’s execution was a social event for dark elves, cheering on the death of their enemies, praising their dark @#%$ for bestowing superiority on the Teir-Dal.  Ann was sickened by it, she was not suppose to be, she should have been cheering it one like the other children, but could not, instead cried, seeing the poor creature being forced to eat his own flesh.  What could have been done so horrible that he deserved such a fate.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was the first time her parents told her she was an embarrassment to the family, the first time beaten for her weakness, beaten because they wanted her to be strong, as Teir’Dal should be.  The only lesson learned was to hide her feelings; her true self in the deep shadows of her soul and never allow others to see it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ann let out a sudden moan, jerked from the floor by her hair.  She had not even noticed being stripped naked and bound with rope, but now felt the nakedness, not the nakedness of flesh to eyes, but nakedness to the bite of the whip.  The rope was fastened to a steel bracket, so she would remain upright even when no longer able to stand on her own.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “May Innourok take your soul,” the priestess said and the first snap of the whip struck.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ann screamed, she did not want to scream, but could not refrain.  The barbed leather tore flesh and wracked her body with so much pain her knees crumbled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ha! What weakness.  One strike and you fall.” The priestess hissed.” You never were worthy to be Teir’dal.  Now I shall take that honor from you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Again the whip snapped and split the flesh of her back.  Blood ran from the first wound, slick and wet on her back, running over her buttocks and down her legs.  Blackness was overwhelming and she felt consciousness escaping her.  They would never allow that, but she hoped for it, prayed for it to any merciful @#%$, that would listen.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A third strike, this time across her hamstrings, only the rope holding her upright.  Her mind whirling, in blackness, her body throbbing with pain, she could take no more, flesh torn, muscle split she did not want to beg, begging would only make it worse, but how could she not.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother I beg you, stop.” She weakly cried out.<br>

<br>
Part 2: A Shard of Mercy<br>
<br>
        The priestess lowered her whip, her face a twisted mask of hate and lust, splattered with drops of blood. Enraged she grabbed a fistful of Ann’s hair and jerked her head back.<br>
        “The only thing I wished I had stopped was the day you were conceived. You are nothing, a freak, defected at birth and an embarrassment to me. I should have you quartered and hang your stinking carcass from the walls of the temple.” She hissed her upper lips quivering with the tightness her face muscles.<br>
        For that moment the pain that had ripped through Ann’s body was gone, as a nauseating wave of numbness enveloped her. For her nineteen cycles of life she had felt an outcast, different from others, subjected to ridicule and torment, but she never felt her family did not want her. They were Teir’Dal, no mercy for the weak, their hateful spiteful ways always to make her a better dark elf, but alas she was truly unwanted. The whip did not crack on her back to punish her for weakness, she was the enemy, no different from the halfling tortured so long ago.<br>
        In an instance the agonizing pain crashed on her like a thundering wave pounding the shoreline. The whip fell again and Ann screamed, her eyesight faded, blackness enclosed and her mind slipped into unconsciousness.<br>
        “Wake her Terrin. It shall not be so easy.” The high priestess ordered handing the whip to the young Teir’Dal. “When she wakes saw of her feet, and let her dine. I vaguely remember she appreciated such punishment when but a child.”<br>
        “As you order, your enlightened.” The young male answered.<br>
        “A shall be washing her stench from my face. Have her healed at the temple and come for me before continuing with the punishment.” Ann’s mother said turning from the room.<br>
        “The temple?” The male asked.<br>
        “Do you question me Terrin.” The woman glared at the young man.<br>
        “No your enlightened, I do not, but…” He fell into silence.<br>
        The woman took at deep breath her ruby eyes flaring. She expelled the air slowly as if she was trying to hold her temper. Her lower lip quivered slightly until she pulled it between her teeth. The young man lowered his eyes afraid he overstepped his bounds.<br>
        “But what?”<br>
        “It’s just that she has been such an embarrassment to your family, that I thought it would be better she disappeared.” Terrin said cautiously.<br>
        There was a silence, for a moment, a time span that seemed to last forever to Terrin, his fate in the balance. There was no doubt the power of this woman, or her insatiable lust for hatred and he was not sure where this would leave him.<br>
        “Go on, Terrin.” Her voice was overbearing like the executioner asking if there were any last requests.<br>
        “If we let others know of her betrayal, it will be a mark against you as her mother. Others will use this to wrest you from your deserving position of high priestess. Others already speak of her weakness and lack of faith. If they truly know she was an unbeliever it will strengthen their position.” Terrin said cautiously picking his words.<br>
        “And your idea?” <br>
        “I take her to the East Commons and feed her carcass to the lions. We let it be know Anndazzadarian went to Faydwer to prove her loyalty to her family and Innourok.” Terrin swallowed hard, unable to read the thoughts of the woman glaring at him.<br>
        Ann’s mother let out a deep evil laughter, a twisted smile crossing her lips. Terrin felt a wave of relief swell over him. He knew this laughter well enough. She was pleased. Terrin stood firm, even though he felt himself tremble inside and he nearly had to hold his breathe to keep from shaking when she rested a hand on his shoulder.<br>
        “You are a wise boy. One day you will be a leader, one who will bring much glory to the Teir’Dal. Be certain to gather all her belongs and be rid of them as well. There must be no clues of this.” The woman turned from the room a low snickering laughter expelling from her.<br>
        Terrin waited until she was gone before turning to the battered girl hanging from her wrists, blood oozing down her back and legs. There was little care in how he pulled her limp body down or how he threw her on the bed and wrapped her in blankets, bundling her up, and packed everything of hers into a large cloth sack.<br>
        Ann did not feel the pain, or the jostling of her being thrown about, wrapped in blankets and carried from the only home she ever knew. Occasionally a pain tore at her, knocking her back into unconsciousness for the brief moments that she had woken from it.<br>
        Several times she felt the black pull of death coming for her, but she welcomed it and feared it at the same time. If Innourok took her soul the punishment would be never ending, but if her soul was lost there would be nothingness.<br>
<br>
        Terrin was quick and careful to get out of the city of Neriak with Ann strapped across the back of a pack horse, rolled in canvas, like the roll of a large field tent. Few paid him any attention as he passed by, just another young Teir’Dal following the duty of the great lord of hate himself.<br>
        It did not seem that way to Terrin. He felt every eye was on him, the guards looking suspiciously on as he passed by. He waited to see a cleric come from the darkness and demand to see what was on the second horse, but it did not come to pass and in time he was riding south in the Nektolus forest, bound for the East Commons, the land of the humans.<br>
        The forest was dark, the canopy of trees twisted in a wicked weave fighting to reach the sun light above, shadowing even the smallest beams of sun light from entering the woods. Even at noon with the sky blue and empty of clouds, beams of sunlight did not penetrate the woodlands as if some vile curse of darkness drank the light before it could reach the grounds, but there was a faint glow of light. It was like light through heavy drapes. At night the darkness was that of a cavern deep underground.<br>
        The path Terrin rode was well traveled, even though it went to the hated lands of the humans. Many dark elves traveled those lands to sow their hate and bring the downfall of the other races. Humans were one of those races, but not the truly hated. They were foolish tolerating the Teir’Dal, though with suspicious eyes. It would eventually be their down fall, but for now it was more to the advantage of the dark elves not to be at war with them.<br>
        When Terrin crossed the bridge and entered the long gorge that passed out of the valley the Nektolus forest was securely tucked away in, he felt somewhat of a relief. Relief to leave behind the thoughts he was being followed, relief that what he had suggested did not back fire leaving him to a far worse fate than Ann.<br>
        It was nighttime, the time of the Teir’Dal, born of hate and forged in darkness they could see as well at night as day. Their sight surpassed all the other intelligent races and rivaled even many of the wild animals of Norrath.<br>
        Still it was not a safe journey, not for a lone dark elf to make. There were always the potential for wild animals or the foolish human who thought he could make a living at adventure. One maybe two would not be a problem, but they seemed to often travel in larger groups.<br>
        Then there were the death fists orcs. Barbaric, but dangerous, fierce warriors in a constant war with the humans of Freeport, but also would not think twice of killing a dark elf, surly to dine on their flesh in hopes to gain the infinite intelligence Teir’Dal possessed.<br>
        Terrin’s mare twitched her ears and snorted nervously as they moved further from his homelands and into the commons. The dark elf slowly looked around in the darkness his eyes penetrating the gloom. He could not see it, but he felt it, somewhere close by, a presence.<br>
        He pulled the reigns hard on his steed and the beast jerked its head at the sharp brutal bit the Teir’Dal used. There was no doubt who was in control and it was a control gained only by pain and punishment.<br>
        Terrin slipped out of the saddle and let the reigns drop to the ground. The packhorse behind him looked around wide eyed, snorting nervously at what ever was out there. This was as good as any place Terrin thought.<br>
        “It seems your stench of blood has attracted the animals already.” Terrin said releasing the binds that held Ann to the horse and dropped her to the ground.<br>
        A slight moan escaped her as she hit the hard pack ground. “Well you are still alive. Stronger than I would have ever thought you could have been.” Terrin said kneeling over the bundle of blankets.<br>
        He loosened the binds on the cloth she was wrapped in and uncovered the blood and sweat covered form of Anndaradazzian. Her breath was so light only taking her wrist in his hand was he able to know she still lived.<br>
        “Tonight I was weak. I showed mercy and I don’t know why. I am sorry it had to end this way though, we could have ruled this world, sister.” Terrin brushed the caked white hair from his sisters face, his own eyes an impenetrable portal of darkness.<br>
        The horse jittered more nervously. Something was near, Terrin could sense it. Close but hidden well, stalking them, patiently waiting to spring. He could feel the eyes on him, almost hear the snarls of a beast, likely a wolf on the trail of blood. It was circling. Terrin stood and checked his sword in its scabbard. Listening for sounds, only the hoot of an owl and the chirp of crickets could be heard, the musical night song keeping the lonely traveler company.<br>
        Suddenly it was closer. Terrrin wielded about, it should have been close enough to see. Nothing. Breath came a little quicker to the dark elf. He was a warrior trained to kill, fear was not an option, yet his pounding black cancerous heart told otherwise.<br>
        It flashed before him, a streaking figure, white in the darkness. Then it was gone. He tried to follow it but could not. A branch snapped behind him, he whirled about and there it stood, white as snow, nearly as large as a bear, fangs bared, nearly close enough to spring on him. Again it began to circling, vanishing into the trees, as if it was as black as night.<br>
        A white wolf should not be able to hide from Teir’Dal eyes, yet it was gone. Terrin drew his dagger and knelt next to his sister taking her hand in his own, panic nearly taking control. His heart raced with fury, far from the safety of Neriak, far from the power of his mother.<br>
        “I spared you torture sister, but your life I can not.” He drew the dagger across the tender flesh of her wrist, standing even as knife still sliced, not turning back to her, his mind only on being free from this place, away from the prowling wolf.<br>
        White flashed in the corner of his eyes, a scream nearly escaping the warrior’s throat. Panic was upon him as he pulled himself into the saddle his head snapping back and forth. Steel drew across leather, the sound a frightful tone, the blade lightly vibrating in the warrior’s hand. The way home was lost to the frightened Teir’Dal, his head twisting in a panic trying to find his bearings.<br>
        A deep howl ripped through the air like a war bands trumpet. Others answered in the distance, voices in the dark, talking in unknown tones of the smell of flesh and blood. The pack horse bolted, Terrin’s steed jerking forward under him, but a quick hard yank on the reigns caused it to rear back, with what sounded like a scream escaping its throat.<br>
        Then Terrin laid sharp spurs into the beasts side and it bolted, crashing through trees and brush. Terrin felt the fetid breath of death in his face, a white flash before his eyes. He ducked, as the massive beast bowled into him leaping the height of his horse. Terrin managed to twist to one side and keep from being unsaddled, but he lost his sword. His horse thundered away for home.<br>
        The wolf trotted into the clearing where the body was, cautiously sniffing the limp corpse, the scent of blood heavy in the air. The wolf circled the fallen Teir’Dal girl as if sizing her up, who she might be and why she was here. Turning away, in a bound the wolf was running from the clearing, back into the night.<br>
        A moan escaped Ann’s lips, low, nearly inaudible. The wolf stopped, but did not turn as if it was deciding if it should return to the girl. He continued into the woods.<br>
