I'm not going to be like those freaks in Independence Day who welcome the aliens then get blown to pieces (hehe), but oncec when camping with my family in Vermont we had to go brush our teeth at the Camp grounds' bathroom. As we approached the bathroom, we saw a levitated stark white girl in a torn wedding gown and one long braid. It didn't even notice us and just continued on it's path towards the woods. It was pretty freaky, but I didn't fear for my life or anything. <br>
<br>
    The UFO story was just like me and my mom and brother in the car coming home from my grandma's house. We were driving in sort of a road not a lot of people travel on, but an established road nonetheless. All of a sudden we saw a huge floating object just camped about 30 feet above us with lights all around the edges of the thing. It was twighlight, so the black object sort of blended in with the night sky. But, it hovered there for like the amount of time it takes to blink twice and then it was gone traveling east in a flash. I didn't say anything at first because I thought I was just seeing things, but after we drove another block I said to my mom,&quot;...Did you, uhh, see anything back there...?&quot; And then she immediately answered, &quot;Yes!&quot; and said she didn't know if we saw it and didn't want to scare us (me and my bro were younger). My oblivious brother missed both occassions of the UFO and the ghost. I don't care if you call me crazy....I know what I saw. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ponzicar>Ponzicar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 2:46:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8887.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghost caught on video ?</span><hr size=1> Wow, either that is a perfectly clear picture of a ghost, or an extremely blurry picture of some mundane object.

<br>
I was over at his house for the evening, and it was about 1 in the morning.  I got hungry, so I decided to stir up some grits.  I heated the water and then poured it in with the grits, putting the cup of water down to stir.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the cup move.  My friend, by this time, was in the kitchen with me.  I told him to shut up and pointed to the cup.  We both watched it move at least 3 inches across the countertop.  Not all at once, mind you - in small jerks.  It wasn't as if something hit it from the side once, it went sliding, and just stopped.  It took about a minute or two for it to move as far as it did.<br>
<br>
We felt around the cup for any moving air.  There was none.  Nothing was turned on that would vibrate the counter and make the cup move.  There was nothing making that cup move.  It just moved.  I put something else in the same place and it didn't move.  After I finished stirring my grits, we refilled the cup with warm water to about the same level and put it in the same spot.  Didn't move.  It was just that one time.<br>
<br>
Was really weird, that's for sure. <p><p><br><i>56, <b><font size=+3>ROGUE</b></font></i><br><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">Safehouse</a> Ring Warden, <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=166265">All-Around Action Hero</a>

<br>
Personally, I'm going to put this at the bottom of my list of possible real ghost sightings. Simply because it's a bit TOO classic. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to get into the ghost argument as there are literally hundreds of different explanations as to what they are, where they come from, and if they exist and I really don't feel like going through them all. <br>
<br>
As for the UFO thing. I'd say, it's about a 50/50 chance that they have come to earth. Considering the vastness of the universe, the age of the universe, and the amount of time it took our species to get where it is, you would think that somewhere out THERE there would have to be a race that is far older and far more technologically advanced that they may have found a way to travel halfway across the galaxy in the blink of an eye. The part that makes it unlikely that they came here though is that they would need some way of detecting us. The universe is a big place. It would be pretty high odds against them just stumbling across us.<br>
<br>
Assuming they are here, you say &quot;well why don't they just introduce themselves.&quot; Personally, if they are here, and are keeping themselves under wraps, that alone would make them intelligent enough for me. Maybe you have been in a cave the past few thousand years but the human race isn't exactly ready for aliens. We still don't have the race issue among our own kind sorted out yet! You have any idea how it would be if aliens were thrown into the mix. It would be nuts.

I have a story similar to Trolo's.  Once in high-school, I was sleeping over at a friend's house.  We were staying up late in my friend's bedroom, talking.  Suddenly, her mother's purse flew through the door.  We were astonished.  We peeked in at her parents and they were asleep in their bed.  There was no one else in the house.  It was very strange. <p><html><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=234198>Pualani</a><br>Rake, <a href=http://www30.brinkster.com/djseng/SotO>Scream of the Owl</a><br>Torvonnilous<html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukroemagnon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kroe Magnon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/happy/jestera.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 12:33:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8887.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://macmorrigan.homestead.com/files/funnyraven.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghost caught on video ?</span><hr size=1> eh the image doesn't move like a bag caught by air.

   And about the ghost, we saw the ghost in Stowe,Vermont where there is an old legend about &quot;Emily's Bridge&quot; involving a girl committing suicide off the bridge when her husband ditched her on the wedding stand in the 1830's. And judging how the girl we saw was in a wedding dress, it is pretty obvious the stories are linked. There is a lot of info on Emily's Bridge on line (I think). I'm not making up a story to get you guys believing in ghosts or anything...I'm not THAT lame. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukroemagnon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kroe Magnon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/happy/jestera.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 2:58:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8887.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://macmorrigan.homestead.com/files/funnyraven.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghost caught on video ?</span><hr size=1> Heh growing up in Maine like I did, or most anywhere in new england you're likely to have at least one &quot;ghost&quot; experience.<br>

It's not that, it's that the New England area has a lot of ghost history.  I find that often, when watching those ghost shows on History Channel, there's a lot that are based in New England.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's not what Kroe meant, but that's how I interpreted it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uslikkrogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>slikkrogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/4/02 10:00:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8887.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghost caught on video ?</span><hr size=1> That, and New England was settled long before places to the west.... so that equals longer timeline for tragic events, ghosts, etc...<br>
<br>
(This is one thing that sucks about America - You go to Europe and you can find haunted stuff *everywhere*)<br>
<br>
I do somewhat believe in ghosts, or at least 'paranormal' activity.  My friend was watching his girlfriend's house, and always said to watch out for 'Fred' when I went over there with him (I don't remember the name, so Fred will do)<br>
<br>
Basically, as long as you treated the house nicely and talked politely to Fred whenever you felt his presence or noticed some objects' movement, etc... he would be nice to you.<br>
<br>
Apparently, a couple of that girlfriend's friends, during slumber parties in the past, had got slapped around and beat up when they tried to ignore or be rude to Fred.<br>
<br>
Also, my brother-in-law's grandma, who lives in England, has a house built upon the remnants of a wall from an old cathedral (as in 1000+ yrs).  This is a 'good' type of 'haunting', as the wall is extremely peaceful.  Sometimes, you can hear the old chanting and prayers at the wall, and it gives off a sense of holiness and peacefulness (instead of the typical creepiness associated with ghosts)<br>
