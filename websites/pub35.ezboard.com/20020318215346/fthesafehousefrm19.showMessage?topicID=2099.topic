<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Nightshade Overview</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As an assassin class, our primary strength is our ability to choose our fights. This requires stealth, timing, and patience to properly acheive. The payoff for this is that we have the element of surprise and therefore first-strike capability. <br>
<br>
However, once this advantage is used, our major disadvantage is that we are vulnerable due to being very close to the enemy, wearing very light armor, and having in most cases no means of escape. Which is balanced. <br>
<br>
The expected tradeoff is that our first strike needs to be deadly, it needs to strike fear into our enemies, it needs to be worth the time and effort and skill required to successfully setup the attack. We have very small margin of error. When successful, our first strike needs to accurately reflect this fact. When this expectation is met, and we can solo blues effectively as an alternative to grouping (which also needs to be viable, some suggestions included), then the class will be balanced in my eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Miscellaneous</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These are issues that don't fit specifically into a solo/group/RvR situation.<br>
<br>
a) Ground targetting. This system is very clunky in its current state, too many button presses required to acheive results. <br>
<br>
I suggest that this be made into something easier to manipulate. Some assassins use it to get the mob turned away from them, some use it to get mob turned towards them, so that functionality needs to be addressed if ground targetting is changed. My personal suggestion would be to make it mouse-based. Point, click, get ground target via mouse, viola. This would change distraction skill from a 5 step process to a 2 step process.<br>
<br>
**b) Climbing - mileforts are lacking climb points.<br>
<br>
c) Disguise is still not implemented.<br>
<br>
d) Items that have a plus (+) modifier to evade and backstab are giving no effect in actual use. Suggested fix: backstab modifiers changed to critical strike modifiers, evade modifiers changed to dex modifiers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PvE Solo</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
After getting a good deal of feedback from the player community, we are in a much better position to solo blues than we were at the time of my last class report.  Almost all Nightshades that I've spoken with have reported being able to take on blues using styles and winning the fight.  There are still outstanding issues however:<br>
<br>
a) Weak opening style damage, relative to difficulty of setup. (see critical strike spec path section for better details)<br>
<br>
b) Evade is random, one fight you can survive a yellow if you evade 80% of the hits, next fight against a blue you can die because you didn't evade once. If evade could be something that we could count on at least during soloing, it would greatly help the class defensively. But it is random and streaky, hence soloing becomes unreliable when we hit a dry spell with our evades. If there was a way to increase the chance for an evade the longer we go without one, this would go a long way towards solving the streakiness problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PvE Grouped</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Once we are able to find a group, we do contribute to the group with melee damage. However, none of our skills are group friendly, and we have nothing that stands out that would make anyone think: &quot;If only we had a nightshade with us.&quot; .. until they head out to exp on the frontier that is, but that's a different section. In order to get to the levels where we can RvR successfully, we need lots and lots of PvE time, both grouped and solo, so we need to be viable here.<br>
<br>
a) Skills that we presently have that aren't very group/dungeon friendly: <br>
<br>
i) Poison (10 second post-combat reload timer) - groups tend to pull faster, and if we try to poison we lose out precious melee time. Combined with 5-6 tick poisons and 4-5 round mob fights, by the time we sneak into position or move into position and attack, by the time the poison would have run it's course, the group is on the next mob already. Useful however on single pulls or in slow groups. If this timer would decrease as envenom spec increases, this would help the problem a great deal.<br>
<br>
ii) Groups pull purple mobs, the higher purple it is, the farther away we have to be depending on stealth, to hide so that we can use backstab/perf artery. Tightly packed mobs, baf/linked pulls and tight spaces make this a hard feat to accomplish at times. No suggestions for improvement, I feel it's balanced as is, but this does present somewhat of a problem in groups at times.<br>
<br>
b) The Critical Strike line having no de-aggro, anti-taunt style has been brought up as a concern. The solution is already in place, bring your weapon skill up to 8 (blades) or 10 (piercing) for a de-aggro skill. Weapon skill shouldn't be totally neglected anyway. This bullet is intended as a reminder only, no problem exists here.<br>
<br>
c) First strike damage (backstab/perf artery) is nominal for difficulty to setup in a dungeon setting. (see critical strike spec path section for details)<br>
<br>
**e) BUG - when stealthed, BAF adds still beeline for the rogue, not all the time, but it still happens and it shouldn't, not if we are stealthed when the pull occurs. This item is also in the stealth section.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Spells</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We are supposed to be &quot;strong spellcasters&quot; according to the manual. We at the present time have *a* spell, whose only use after level 20ish is for pulling. It has decent range and does nominal damage, not enough to make it preferable to a crit strike lead-off, but it's a good alternative to sitting out of combat once endurance is all gone. Suggest no change to current DD spell, but have plenty of suggestions for spells to add.<br>
<br>
a) Spell to light up your enemy, make them extremely visible for a short time, think faerie fire (submitted by vn_vindraxyl on VN boards)<br>
<br>
b) Night Strike - Turn off torches of enemies within XX radius and make it appear as if it was nighttime for XX minutes/seconds to them.<br>
<br>
c) Blanket of Night - 30 foot radius black fog (or maybe force very very dense fog on their screens for XX minutes/seconds)<br>
<br>
d) Self only stealth speed buff (only stealth speed, normal run speed not affected)<br>
<br>
e) Shadowstep -- short-range emergency teleport<br>
<br>
f) Silence spell -- prevents target from using /yell (PC) or calling for help (NPC) for xx seconds<br>
<br>
g) Dim Vision -- make target have a hard time seeing on their screen<br>
<br>
h) Will 'o Wisp -- Summon bobbing blue light at target (PC/NPC/ground), it moves randomly around for 20 seconds before disappearing.<br>
<br>
i) Brighid's Gift -- Lights all torches in a AE radius<br>
<br>
j) Faerie Dance -- Makes target dance uncontrollably, losing 25% endurance<br>
<br>
k) Silent Blade -- Target's battle chat not displayed to others for 15 seconds<br>
<br>
l) Night Vision -- think torch with larger radius, but others don't see it (i.e. looks like we have torch off)<br>
<br>
m) Globe of Darkness -- AE static globe, blind while inside, short duration<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> RvR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is, with a few minor/general bugs to be worked out, where we shine. I feel that we are balanced here. Our targets are generally archers and casters and other rogues. Our &quot;counter&quot; is other rogues and higher level anything if we get too close to them, due to present implementation of detect hidden and stealth and level.<br>
<br>
**a) Detect hidden - This skill was tweaked in v1.45 patch to give assassins an advantage vs. targets with stealth lower than our level.  However, for targets with stealth equal to or higher than our level, there is no advantage to having the detect hidden ability.  Minimum detect range needs to be doubled for classes with the detect hidden ability, and feedback gathered to see if this puts us on track. I think that this tweak would be sufficient.<br>
<br>
**b) (2/7/02 - I have not heard of this happening anymore, leaving it up for one more report as a potential bug) When unstealthing and restealthing quickly, sometimes (unable to reproduce yet) if someone has you as a target, they don't lose you as a target. Even though you are still stealthed. And attacks are able to be successfully launched on a stealthed character that is well outside of possible stealthed visibility range. <br>
<br>
c) Poison and bleed damage make it impossible for us to restealth until the effect expires or the target dies. This gets us killed more than anything else in RvR, and one of the largest issues with assassins and RvR, from our point of view. This should be considered a bug, and one that affects all RvR assassins using their skills in the course of normal RvR. Please fix this asap.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SPEC PATHS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Assassin classes are unique in that they have 3 skills which are interdependent on each other in order to be more successful. Crit strike spec path requires both weapon specialization to raise average damage as well as damage variance. Crit strike also requires (less so in PvE, more so in RvR) a high degree of stealth in order to remain stealthed for the styles that require hidden openings. This is acceptable, if and only if the the combat-affecting bugs are corrected for our classes. My feedback suggests that people like having options available to them to make them unique, but they do not like having broken options. I think that making envenom or stealth or any other skill level-based would be a mistake and a band-aid fix, the glaring problems would still exist. Instead, I highly suggest fixing what is wrong with the spec paths that we *do* have, making just about any template viable.<br>
<br>
It is worth noting that assassin classes are unique in that we have one spec path (stealth) that has no direct bearing on our combat abilities, but is interconnected with another combat spec (crit strike), and almost a requirement to be effective at our role in RvR. Points spent in stealth makes us more effective at RvR, but are points that we cannot spend on increasing our PvE abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Stealth</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Generally regarded as vital for RvR. Also needed in PvE for solo and group work to some degree in order for mobs not to detect us as easily before our first strike lands. There are currently several benefits to maintaining a high spec in stealth:<br>
<br>
a) Reduces the &quot;cannot hide, enemy too close&quot; radius.<br>
<br>
b) Increases, slightly but in RvR every foot and inch counts, movement speed when stealthed.<br>
<br>
**c) Detect Hidden -- Right now, the person's level that is looking for a stealthed player is compared to the stealthed player's stealth skill to determine range at which the stealthed character can be seen. We do get a range advantage for detecting a stealthed character whose stealth skill is lower than our level.  However, there is a &quot;minimum detect radius&quot; that is the same for all characters, regardless of if they have detect hidden or not.  This minimum detect radius needs to be doubled for characters with the detect hidden ability.<br>
<br>
d) Danger Sense -- Right now danger sense alerts you when you or anyone in your party has been spotted by an enemy NPC scout. A valuable skill to have, but the potential for its usefulness is so much higher. <br>
<br>
BUG - the danger sense message color should be able to be changed, right now it is default white and unalterable, making it very hard to see during the heat of battle. <br>
<br>
Ideas for modification:<br>
i) Give message when first spotting a stealthed PC enemy.<br>
ii) Give message when first spotted/targetted by enemy PCs<br>
**iii) Give message when enemy NPC aggros you.<br>
<br>
e) Bug: when porting to enemy frontiers, if you are stealthed during the port cast by the NPCs, you are left behind.<br>
<br>
f) Bug: Mobs (and pets) ignore stealth when chasing us. If we are running for 10 seconds and stealth, the mob does not lose target and proceeds to catch up and re-engage us in melee. <br>
<br>
g) Distraction - suggested improvement would be to change the small pebble we toss into a small flame, or colored smoke, or a minor firecracker-type explosion. Not only to make it slightly more aesthetically pleasing, but also to aid our group in seeing where we are when stealthed, making it obvious why an enemy suddenly stops and turns, and making this possibly useful 'in the field' in RvR. Options are a good thing.<br>
<br>
**h) BAF adds are still attacking a stealthed rogue. This needs to be fixed, now that damage reveals a stealthed rogue, this hurts us in group situations.<br>
<br>
**i) (fixed since last report) Bug - getting hit when stealthed does not cause stealth to drop.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Weapon Skill</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
**We need confirmation as to whether piercing weapons are still 1/2 str, 1/2 dex dependent or if they were changed with the 1.44 buff/stat patch to be purely str dependent.  This is a question that many, many, many people would like the answer to.  It has never been officially clarified.<br>
<br>
No concerns here other than the fact that crit strike damage's dependancy on weapon skill to increase average damage and damage range is not widely known. Consider this a reminder that neglecting your weapon skill will have a negative impact (or not much of a positive one) on your character's damage output and range.<br>
<br>
<br>
**<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Celtic Dual</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Changes since my last report made this a spec path that is viable.  Celtic dual is still not in line with the midgard left axe spec line due to the random number generator (left axe swings every round no matter what), but much improvement has been made to this skill since my last report.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Envenom</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Envenom is a skill that only the assassin classes get. It allows the assassin to poison their own weapons.  Most nightshades have some degree of specialization in this skill. In the lower levels it is a fairly balanced skill, but as the skill progresses, there is another instance of diminishing returns for spec points spent, compared to something like weapon skill. <br>
<br>
Specific poison type issues:<br>
<br>
THE major problem with envenom is that it does not scale upwards in damage/effect as spec points are put into it to make it worth the increasingly high spec point cost as spec level increases. This point cannot be stressed enough. To illustrate this point: The level 1 DoT poison is very effective against level 1-5 mobs, it's a noticable part of combat. The level 5 poison is relatively important on mobs level 5-10. The level 10 poison's 18/tick damage on level 10 mobs isn't too bad, but it's overall percentage of combat damage is lower. This trend continues, until the effect of poison on PvE combat isn't a large part of combat (this happens around level 25-30 coincidentally) and melee damage and CS styles take over as the major part of combat after the initial hidden strike.<br>
<br>
a) DoT poisons, every 5 levels in envenom they go up 3-5 points in damage per tick, they last 5 ticks. Generally speaking they do approximately your spec level in envenom in damage per tick. Regarded as needing a boost here, 3-5 more damage for 5 ticks is at best 25 more damage for a non-trivial amount of spec points spent.<br>
<br>
b) Snare poisons. Lasting 35 seconds and any damage breaking the snare, these are not used very much at all, especially by the dual wielders as dual wield is unpredictable and you could get lucky (unlucky) and have dual wield succeed and break the snare that you just applied. Also to have this work it is a 'twitch' factor as you have to turn off attack to avoid hitting the PC/mob and breaking it. Bleed damage and poison damage break snare also, adding to it's difficulty in use.<br>
<br>
c) Disease poisons. Not as often used, but being able to halve the healing on a PC for 1 minute and more is valuable in specific situations. The -str component could stand a bit of a boost, it's rather minor in it's current state (starts at negative 9, appears to take 5 more away per disease poison upgrade). But this poison has it's situational uses and other than a str debuff boost, no other changes suggested here.<br>
<br>
**d) Weakening poisons. The changes since the last report to the way buffs and debuffs work have crippled the enervating con debuff portion of the poison on player targets.  Where it used to take off 200 or more HP, it is now taking off around 50 HP.  There is also the issue of it taking off MAX hp and not affecting CURRENT hp.<br>
<br>
<br>
General issues with poison:<br>
<br>
a) The post-combat timer on reapplying a poison is too long for group situations, and generally for hectic RvR as well. If this could be decreased based on spec level, it would help the envenom rogues in groups somewhat.<br>
<br>
b) In groups, the mob is usually dead before the dot poison has even gone 3 ticks. I cannot see a fix for this without making it more powerful in RvR, but it has been noted as a concern.<br>
<br>
c) Inventory space is valuable, and poisons only stack to 40. Increasing stack size would be minor improvement, but a nice one.<br>
<br>
d) A good idea for a new poison would be a combat slow poison (attack speed reduction). This would be a very group friendly poison, as well as assist our solo efforts. Care would have to be taken however if this were changed/added along with other improvements to maintain balance. Also note that this could be seen as THE reason to train envenom, furthering a gap between envenom and non-envenom rogues. Nevertheless a decent suggestion for improvement to this spec line.<br>
<br>
e) A way to /macro poison application has been requested by many.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Critical Strike</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
a) Our opening style on mobs is very weak considering the time and effort involved in setting it up. Typically this takes off 10-15% of the mobs health when it lands. It does hit when lined up correctly just about all the time on orange and lower con mobs, but the difficulty of setting it up and the unpredictability of mobs/players causes it not to land often. We then have to sprint away and start setting up all over again. <br>
<br>
What it takes to setup a successful critical strike first attack (backstab/perf artery):<br>
(i) find viable target<br>
(ii) stealth and move slowly to catch up to mob, at walking speed<br>
(iii) distract if needed (which has a 3 second timer before any other action can be taken, which is just *barely* enough time to get in range/arc to stab before mob moves again, making misses common)<br>
(iv) if lucky complete successful backstab/perf artery for less damage than (just for comparison to show us underpowered) a rangers average crit shot, or a 2h melee's normal style damage.<br>
<br>
Our opening strike needs to be something that is feared and more deadly than its present state. In the eyes of almost everyone that plays the class, this spec path and opening style is the one that is thought of when the word 'assassin' is mentioned. We should be striking hard and fast making no mistakes during the setup, and be rewarded for the time and effort needed to setup a perfect opening strike.<br>
<br>
b) Our new 4-style chain based off of a successful evade (starting with hamstring, then leaper, then rib seperation then ripper) is near worthless to most assassins for the following reasons:<br>
<br>
i) When grouped, to use this skill we require having a mob actively hitting us. This same group in most instances is pulling high red, low purple con mobs. These same mobs kill assassins in 2-3 hits.<br>
<br>
ii) Doing MORE damage to a mob that is aggroed onto us will not help to get the mob off of us, which is the ultimate goal in groups, to not get aggro at all if possible.<br>
<br>
iii) The 4th style in the chain is gained at level 50. Upon reaching level 50, RvR is the name of the game. Our main targets as assassins are archers and casters. Casters generally do not melee, therefore no evading for us. Archers may fight back, but the rate of evading in RvR is widely regarded as extremely low, compared to the chance to evade an equal level mob. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, we tend to have the upper hand in picking our fights, which we lead off with a perforate artery or backstab. The chain off of each is 2-3 (2 in the case of backstab II, 3 in the case of perf artery), so that's 3 rounds of combat before we will even think about using our 4-style chain. <br>
<br>
Now, after 3 rounds, if our target isn't dead or fleeing, we are fleeing or dead ourselves. In the rare case that 3 rounds of combat isn't enough, in order to pull off this chain we have to get lucky and evade an attacker (as said, 1/2 of our main targets don't melee us back, casters) just after our 3rd perf artery chain-style goes off, then successfully land the reactionary style (in the heat of combat, reactionary styles aren't used, you're generally mashing keys frantically) THEN land the next 3 rounds of combat. If your opponent turns to flee at a sprint, /stick keeps you just outside of melee range, therefore even if ALL of the above extreme luck situations happen, your opponent is dead or fleeing, so the remainder of the style chain is wasted/unused. <br>
<br>
Lastly, we cannot stand toe to toe with tanks for 4 rounds, so even if they get the jump on us and our BS/PA style combo isn't used to initiate combat, even if we evade their first attack (see above comment about rarity of evades in RvR), we would have to survive 3 more rounds of combat with them toe to toe to complete the chain. Which we cannot survive, as tanks (two hand users especially) are hitting us for over half of our hitpoints each round.<br>
<br>
Summary: This chain while it shows that we're being worked on, was not fully thought out as to just how useless it is in actual game use. Suggested change: Make the level 50 style the 3rd in a chain of 3 off of garrotte (garrotte, achilles heel, ripper) and leave the 44 style as is. Or make the 44 and 50 styles a 2-chain combo, used from the back or side and leave hamstring and leaper as-is.<br>
<br>
c) (this was addressed in the v1.45 patch by upping non-hidden CS style bonus damage) CS style damage is NOT scaling like it is supposed to as spec points are put into crit strike spec line. This is a large concern when level 40 rogues are doing the same style bonus damage to purples that they were doing at level 20. <br>
<br>
d) Endurance cost on Garrote style needs to be lowered somewhat, this is the main endurance sink causing us to run out of endurance 2/3 way through the fight.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> TOP TEN FIXES REQUESTED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (in order of importance to fix the class)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
1) Backstab/Perforate Artery hidden styles are not doing enough damage considering the multiple risks involved in setting one up and completing one successfully. One-shot kills when gaining exp solo or in a group is not what we're asking for. But right now we're assassins that take 8-10 rounds (or more) to finish our prey. Not what we signed up for.<br>
<br>
**2) Detect hidden minimum detection radius needs to be doubled for classes with detect hidden ability.<br>
<br>
3) Envenom poisons need to scale *more* than they do. Level 1 poisons are great on level 1 mobs. Level 25 poisons help on level 25 mobs, but they are not helping combat as much as the lower level poisons help on lower level mobs.<br>
<br>
**4) Endurance costs of the critical strike styles needs to be adjusted downwards. We are out of endurance 2/3 through the fight. Leaving us with no way to run or dish out additional (much needed) damage. Garrotte is the biggest culprit here.<br>
<br>
5) Poison/bleed damage prevents assassins from stealthing during RvR. This is THE #1 concern of assassin classes in RvR right now.<br>
<br>
6) Group friendly skills are severely lacking for our class. There is no situation outside of RvR where a group wishes they had a nightshade with them.  Something like a unique group buff (minor poison dmg add?), something similar to a protect skill for the weaker casters in case they get aggro, something, anything to make us group-friendly for PvE.<br>
<br>
7) The changes to leaper (spec level 29 in crit strike style) and it's new 4-style chain are useless to us in actual gameplay. Two options that would satisfy us and make these 4 styles useful again:<br>
i) Hamstring/leaper/rib seperation left as is. Ripper becomes the 3rd style in garrotte/achilles heel chain.<br>
ii) Hamstring/leaper left as is. Rib seperation/ripper becomes a use-anytime side or back positional (or both) style chain.<br>
<br>
8) More spells for Nightshades. See the Spells section for a list of ideas.<br>
<br>
9) Mobs and pets ignore stealth once they are aggroed on us. i.e. pet caster sic's a pet on us, we run away, get a good distance away and stealth. WHAM, pet is on us again because it's been chasing us the entire time and stealth did not affect it at all. Same with mobs.<br>
<br>
10) BAF adds are still going after stealthed assassins during pulls in a group.<br>

Worth pointing out that Nightshades hidden critical strike opening does less damage than a non-style regular hit from several other Hibernian classes (Hero, Champion, Ranger, more?), not to mention the other realms' classes?<br>

Making our hidden opening strikes ignore AF/Absorb (partial percentage, or completely) would keep us doing about the same damage versus the low-end (low level people, cloth casters) but incease our damage towards the high-end (tanks)... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A> at: 2/9/02 3:12:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ebullition>Ebullition</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 3:05:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2099.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshade class report draft 2/8/02 - request for feedb</span><hr size=1> Squink -<br>

This is a good report.<br>
<br>
I like the fact that you are still shooting to make the nightshade different than the infiltrator and shadowblade.  I get the feeling that Mythic intends to make us all pretty much identical, and I really hope you and the other rogue team leaders can fight to make us all different.<br>
<br>
The priority issues for me are:<br>
<br>
1)  Disguise<br>
<br>
2)  spells/skills that make all three rogue classes different<br>
<br>
3)  weak damage skills against yellow con players in RvR (this will get a lot worse if they start to make it so that the level differences play less of a role in damage scale.  Right now most yellow con players are pretty much completely immune from me, and I can only strike blue con players that aren't archers/rogues/casters or those that are already injured or fighting other people.)<br>
<br>
4)  bleed damage not stacking (why give us all these moves that cause bleed if they all cancel each other?  almost no point) and bleed damage preventing stealth<br>
<br>
5)  poisons are pretty much worthless in RvR and PvM.  They are okay at early levels, but at the high end they are just fluff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usquinkmcpoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squink McPoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 3:37:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2099.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshade class report draft 2/8/02 - request for feedb</span><hr size=1> Bleed damage -<br>
Good point, the 4-chain super combo that isn't all that super anyway, has 3 of the 4 styles causing bleed damage.  I'll make sure to add that in.  It would be pretty nifty if they stacked, but surely if they did, it would be an across the board change for all styles for all classes.  That's mythic's call though.<br>
<br>
poisons -<br>
I think they are fluff because they don't scale enough.  A good first step would be to increase their effects, test it, see how it affects things, etc.  The recent stat debuff changes also had a big impact on poisons.  However, one good thing is that a con debuff now has an effect on mobs, reports so far indicate that this was a very good change as far as PvE goes.  Unfortunately, I think RvR suffered a bit as a consequence.<br>
<br>
disguise -<br>
They're aware that this still needs to get implemented.  It's just a matter of priority.  All the game-wide balancing and bugs that have had to be fixed lately keep pushing it back, unfortunately for us.  But since I know that they know it's an issue, it's not in the top ten. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujablackhand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>J A  Blackhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.crewsman.homestead.com/files/Demon_Hunter.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 6:51:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2099.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE.</span><hr size=1> &quot;&quot; 1) Backstab/Perforate Artery hidden styles are not doing enough damage considering the multiple risks involved in setting one up and completing one successfully.

Is doing even less now...far less.<br>
<br>
And I would still like to see some form of a Re-specing done.  (IE) Making Stealth an innate skill = lvl based+items = total stealth skill or what have you but for now we are in a bit of a deficiancy for points.  Also, if they want to give us a super combo as it were and a reason to max CS which I feel we lack atm, why not make the last two CS moves chain off of our PA-CD-SS chain.  After all, atleast for me, I never go into a fight after spending 30-90 min stalking a prey hoping to get off a good Evade chain.  I go in hoping to get it overwith ASAP.  Plus, I realy don't think there are all that many of us who are depending as much on Evade=fickle in RvR as we are our opening dmg. PA-CD-SS-RS-Rip= Yum<br>

I would also like to know if Midgard weapons are at all dex based and if not, than what's up with that?<br>

Perforate Artery should not be a &quot;front based&quot; attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
- It's not in line with the thought of an assassin.<br>
- It causes us to get detected before we strike in PVE solo WAY too often.<br>
- It's setup makes things difficult in RVR as front facing is one of the toughest to get into.... lag/latency has given fail's to perforate more times then I can tell you.<br>

<br>
Squink, it seems to me that Mythic is trying to give the three Rogues some kind of identity through item bonuses. The highest stealth item I have seen in Hibernia is +2 (No reports from Epic zone yet). There are +3 and +4 stealth in Midguard and Albion. I also believe Hibernia has very few to zero +Crit Strike items, while Midgard has loads of them. What does that leave us? Envenom.<br>
<br>
To me it looks like Mythic is trying to make Hibernia the Envenom realm, and you just said you consider Envenom fluff. I completly agree with you. Envenom is a complete joke with the CS style upgrades. I'm not completly knowledgeable about items in the other realms but they are playing right into our "How should I spec" problem. I also think +2 to a spec is measly in the 45+ range considering you can get +2 steath gear our of Muire and Spraggon.<br>
<br>
I might also push for some kind of definet respec plans. Not just for Rogues but for everyone. The spec lines have been changed so much, especially Nurture, that people aren't playing the characters they started out as. <p><table width="600" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

Stacking bleed damage would mostly effect our evade chain though, since PA is the only other CS style with bleed damage.  (Well, unless you're still using Eviscerate...)  It would be nice in groups if everyone's bleed damage from moves stacked.<br>
<br>
Only problem I can see with that is some styles have access to use-anytime moves with bleed damage.  Tempest in the Celtic Dual line would be a good example, chains off of the side-positional Ice Storm.  Get four of those off and add them up, you've got some pretty serious bleed damage going on.

Passed that along to the appropriate people as a concern.

** Noted that the 4-style chain has 3 of the styles causing bleed effects, which do not stack.  Suggested again that this chain be revisited as it's just plain silly.<br>
<br>
** Top ten list shuffled slightly<br>
1) BS/PA not doing enough damage for difficulty/risk in setting up.<br>
2) Envenom not scaling enough<br>
3) Group friendly skills lacking.  Faerie Fire (make mob appear to be covered in blue flames, increase to-hit chance), some sort of protect skill involving evade for casters, minor poison-based damage add, something anything.<br>
4) detect hidden minimum detect radius still needs tweaking<br>
5) poison/bleed on our targets disallowing re-stealthing<br>
6) endurance costs (garotte especially) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthal0012.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thal0012</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/10/02 4:06:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2099.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshade class report draft 2/8/02 - request for feedb</span><hr size=1> I think assassin in pve need an auto evade skill similar to shields engage. Maybe a stamina or timer based skill that lets them evade all attacks for a few seconds. The biggest complaint about assassins in pve is they are mana sinks. Give them a skill that lets them avoid damage while NOT attacking for a few seconds. It would save healer power and give them a psuedo mez to keep a mob busy for 10-15 seconds if needed. I suppose limiting factor should be included, for example you can't move while using auto evade. In rvr this wouldn't be overpowering, best it could do is prolong an assassin life vs a superior melee class by a few seconds. At the very best it would make a really dumb attacking tank burn his endurance up on mostly evaded styles<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  In the end I think it would add to pve and RvR, and maybe even add some stategy other than use all stamina at once killing everything in sight in 2 hits<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usquinkmcpoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squink McPoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/10/02 4:41:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2099.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshade class report draft 2/8/02 - request for feedb</span><hr size=1> I'm not a tank expert .. but I think engage can only be used on mobs that haven't been hurt yet.

Time to realize what you got, is all you gonna get.<br>
<br>
I wish it weren't so, but they don't listen to me and they don't listen to rogue players, probably cuz our counterparts are hitting lvl 50's for 1200 damage at 200 yards.<br>
<br>
I know... a slight exaggeration.<br>
<br>
My friend has a mid-level SB (36), he was dragged around by his guild group, leaching exp.  He now says he loves pking, hes pretty powerful, taking down a blue in one-hit.  <br>
<br>
But he cries when he tries to level, he still dies to greens occassionally, and attacking blues or yellows is a total crap shoot.<br>
<br>
Just me and my nonsense.  Mythic you are godly, don't listen to us, we are just a bunch of crack whores. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udiirkshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diirk Shade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 6:23:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2099.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshade class report draft 2/8/02 - request for feedb</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Ground targetting. This system is very clunky in its current state, too many button presses required to acheive results.<br>
