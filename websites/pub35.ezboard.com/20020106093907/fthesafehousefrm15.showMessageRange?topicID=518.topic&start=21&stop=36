The bug as you call it is nothing more then lag..You want to fix it? then give everyone the same connection to Verants server and tada..fixed&quot;<br>
<br>
well lets see, Quake, Halflife/Counter strike, Tribes, and Unreal are all games older than eq and everyone of them can calculate locations with considerable acuraccy. the problem is that eq works like this,<br>
I swing: the info travels to the server<br>
the info arrives at the server who then sends a querry to my target<br>
my target gets the querry and responds with a loc<br>
the server checks the loc at the time it recieved my attack info and tells me I am to far away,<br>
its a really bad pvp engine. they should simply increase pvp melee range, its silly that I have to run in front of the guy I am trying to kill to get in my hits. Do you have any idea how hard it is to follow someone your in FRONT of?<br>

<br>
Ok, my opinion is the original poster is right on all the line. He was even not hard enough on how pvp sucks for pure mellees. I am a lvl 55 rogue, blackguard, with ragebringer playing the Vallon Zek server since it opened. I have a long experience and frankly, until lvl 55 and epic, rogues are dead 80 percent of time in pvp. Now i happen to be almost at 50 percent. I am talking SAME lvl here.<br>
<br>
     1- The mellee range bug when pursuing someone.  Whatever that guy said about connection is total crap. Got a modem cable and no lag with real good cpu and i have to be in front of thoses casters running in same direction to actually hit them for a round before they change their heading and lose me behind a hill or by turning in cirlce leaving that &quot;ghost&quot; behind them. It IS a bug. need be fixed.<br>
<br>
          Now for rogues out there, dump that stupid rbf and use your thrown weapon skill. I can do 40 dmg deadly strikes with the shurikens. That normally does the trick in killing thoses runners, if they stop to cast, press the mellee attack button. Also a good way to keep track of caster since you can &quot;follow&quot; your shuriken, it will make you face automatically toward the opponent. Shurikens are great cause of fast delay (ragebringer will haste your throwing rate) If you have time, make forged javelins, thoses are for people you really hate.<br>
<br>
    2- Damage shields. Can't beileive i readed people whining it is useless against 2handed weapon. Dunno what you doing but if you can't channel trough 2handers, you missed your vocation. Against a rogue now, the stats that have been given in previous post giving statistics are TRUE. If you are a caster, you can virtually stand up to a rogue and look at him die on your dmg shield. <br>
<br>
      You want more? It happen to me more than often that some casters, druid in particular, channel trough my ragebringer and burning rapier in off-hand. You CAN channel trough it, especially when you know all you got to do is place one lower level nuke or dot cause your dmg shield does all the job.  Dispelling his dmg shield, lemme laugh, it will be his last buff and by the time you did it, he casted 2 spells and you done for it.<br>
Golem wand, ya, if you can afford the 120pp for 5 charges to debuff him, he will prolly simply gate away and laugh at your money loss.<br>
<br>
     Solution. Well there is none. throwing weapons are still BUGGED so you will still take dmg from dmg shield.<br>
Your best bet as a rogue is to keep hitting anyways and circle him or walking trough him trying to get off that backstabb that will maybe get you victory. That will help you win more than trying debuff with normal pumice.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
Finally, it is from my view the major points that need be adressed in pvp. You will need to always drink sow potions too and have jboots rdy in case of dispel.  Pure Mellee will always be at disadvantage in pvp in most 1 vs 1 situations, casters got for most easy means of evading like shadow step and sow. If you get jumped in the open simply dont fight it, have a 120 mr to resist snares and head for zone. Zone and rezone if need be but don't bother. if he there waiting for you, hit a round while he start to cast and zone. <br>
<br>
     The trick for a rogue is not fight the battles you did not started, if he rdy your chances of winning are ridiculous and i killed more than my share of lighties. Don't forget its a bluebie world out there, lighties are for most xteamers and crap like that. You want even reconsider playing on pvp server at all unless it is a Daoc server. EQ is NOT a pvp game, as hard people will try convince you this can be done or that or bla bla, the engine is not made for that and Verant never ever did crap for what is a minority of the total eq population. The only sad thing is i made friends there and dont want to start all over.<br>

<br>
They *have* to stand still for 3-6 seconds to hurt the melee, the melees can do so much dmg it's not even funny in that amount of time. *If* the caster manages to channel through that duel wielding, double attacking, back stabbing, or bashing melee, their spell will hardly scratch.

<br>
Now back to rhainvs persistant complaints...<br>
<br>
&quot;Casters = not a threat to any melee unless exploiting los or in groups or something.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Oh bull If my main char was a caster I would be insulted by this load of @#%$.  You play a chanter on a server where everyone wears their resist gear all the time of course your going to have a lot of trouble. Mages, Wizards and Especially Necromancers are a lot more prepared to put up a fight vs melees.  Enc on the other hand is I believe a good anti caster class and an awesome group pvp class from what I've seen.<br>
<br>
I hear the same argument again and again about lifting the pvp dmg nerf and yet the only valid point I've seen is the fact that casters can run oom casting on some classes.  In what way does that mean you need to do dmg faster? Seems to me the only neccesary solution would be a larger manna pool which would adress the issue of dmg over a long period of time as well.<br>
<br>
Another thing you need to stand still for 3 to 6 seconds yes but you don't need to be hit for 3 to 6 seconds!  A caster needs to get a bit of space before trying to get that cast off if you do it right you can get your spells off without taking too much dmg per spell especially on those short casts.  Casters in my experience often suffer from one of two problems.<br>
<br>
A) A. S. S. Arnold Swartzenegger Syndrome (sp) otherwise known as BOSS (balls of steel syndrome) This is where the caster is under the delusion that they are a tank and they will just stand there while you beat their ass trying to cast.<br>
<br>
B) R. S. S. Richard Simmons Syndrome.  This is where the caster keeps interupting himself even in cases where he may well have channeled the spell with very little dmg taken. (this is sometimes acompanied by girlish shouts of suprise and alarm) In the end they take far more dmg from repeated failed attempts to cast than they would otherwise have taken and end up retreating.<br>
<br>
Finding the right balance between these two extremes is a big part of playing a pvp caster I think.   I know you have it rough as a chanter but maybe you aren't seeing the whole melee vs caster argument clearly and even more importantly perhaps your ignoring a set of strategies (or understating them) that could be a lot of help vs melees (pet dmg, dmg shield dmg, levitation, charming).  I do not think you are meant to take melees down with just casting and I think those other strategies exist because of this.<br>
<br>
I would suggest perhaps you speak with a good pvp chanter on RZ named Tsunammi(sp again).  I remember I was so confidant that I could take a chanter that I dueled her in probably one of the worst places to fight a caster lavastorm and lost due to a combination of leviation, pet dmg, and dmg shields even with quite high mr somewhere in my upper 40s(level NOT mr).  I may do more dmg now than I once did but I don't see those strategies mentioned above as much less effective if used right. <br>
<br>
In short from certain people here I have seen nadda but complaints and exaggeration as to the power of melees and gross understatement as to the usefulness of casters in pvp. If ANYONE has any doubts perhaps you need to speak with some RZ casters who do very well for themselves as it is.<br>
<br>
NO to nerfing melee dmg and NO to removing the pvp dmg nerf. I do NOT think a wizard needs to kill me in 3 rather than 4 lures nor do I believe that my dmg should be reduced to 2/3 making it take 1.5 x the current length of time to kill them and giving them THAT much longer to nuke me.  I love my rogue but it is a hard class to play in pvp I don't need more of a challenge thanks.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usweetdream.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sweetdream</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/01 4:28:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: given up the ghost</span><hr size=1> Haha i don't understand how you can complain about being a rogue in PvP.  If well play one of the best class in PvP wise.  Espically against caster, if you get a good jump on a caster most unbuffed caster are already in the 60%  hp range, that not factoring in a good backstab. Cause a good double backstab on a sitting caster is usually drops them to 20% health or so.  Golem wand and old style pumice are part of the game get used to it and if you really needed money to recharge it just go run through Sol A once and kill all the golbin you can easily pick up 200+pp from a clearing with FS and such.<br>
<br>
As a lvl 60 pally i absolutely think the Dmg nerf on pet should be remove as well as spell nerf.  Prior to Kunark and Velious i though that was need cause the gap between melee and caster are just way too much, in favor of the caster.  This is in the age where Yak and Mithril 2hs were @#%$ like weapon.  But as kunark came out melee became stronger and stronger although new lure spell and dot kept this balance.  Finally in velious melee totally blows caster out of the water it not funny.  With two charge of Golem Wand to strip caster buff i can take most caster down before they can get off a major dot or dmg spell.<br>

As a wiz I can kill any caster in 3 or 4 nukes, sometimes even 2 if they are low. With my chanter it only takes 3 or 4 nukes. Would only take one ice comet or 2 of my &quot;uber&quot; chanter nukes to kill a caster if they did full damage. Remove spell dmg nerf? hehe no thanks.<br>
<br>
Rogues are one of the best PK's in my opinion expecially with a caster partner. I've played one before and well, they own casters. Spine break is almost an instant death for any helpless caster ^_^ The thing is, you can't kill a running caster, and spine break keeps them from running hehe.<br>
<br>
In order to cast on someone, they have to be IN RANGE when you begin casting. Well unless they are snared or severely retared, or can't see you they WILL reach you before you get the spell off (even mez which is 2.5 seconds). I accept that fact that I can not touch a melee, but I'm just glad that they can't touch me either (due to &quot;melee range bug&quot;).<br>
<br>
75% of pvp servers do not have naked PK's. Everyone has the best resist gear they can. So that in itself unbalances pvp. Everyone has 100+ in all resists, some uber guilds have 150+. Not like we can get uber ac items for int caster to resist melee dmg.<br>

Melee range bug is what keeps casters from instantly dying every time they run into a melee with jboots or sow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utzara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/01 7:24:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: given up the ghost</span><hr size=1> Casters don't need to stand still while casting.<br>

They just need to be standing in the same place when they start casting the spell and when they finish casting the spell.<br>

<br>
About resists...personally I don't think we should have any resist stats at all.  I think spells should have a fixed sort of resistance.  I don't want nukes to be any weaker at all you understand just  would like them to work a certain amount.  Like a mage casting scars of sigil on a warrior of the same lvl should have the spell work as it does now as if the warrior had x lvl of fire resistance.  X being a number that would lead to balanced pvp play. There should be a fixed racial or class penalty or bonus for certain types of spells (for ice comet hits for 720 in pvp, say it hits for 400 on one particular occasion and 450 on another.  As a barb with a 10% bonus vs cold I might then take 360 and then 405) Maybe certain rare items would give a small bonus to the dmg taken.  Seems a lot easier to balance than dealing with a resist stat that changes a lot as more expansions and new gear comes out.  The resist debuff change seems a  poor solution to this problem.  This is not a suggestion for eq as it is certainly, just an idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uurshulgi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Urshulgi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/01 2:41:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Take me under</span><hr size=1> Take me!~<br>

Hi, that's a fuc en cry for help from the pure caster community who are sick of getting their asses beat by mediocre players who rely on badass connections to win in pvp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/8/01 4:54:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> connections...</span><hr size=1> Try a 56k connection that regularly connects at 40k and currently due to problems with my phone company 26k.

<br>
Although people with fast connections will call you a whiner, there is a MASSIVE difference between the effectiveness of a player on a dial-up and one on a dsl/cable.  Nothing can really be done to correct this, you're falling victim to the Quake ping syndrome in pvp.  It's not going to matter how good you are if you can't follow someone due to lag. Trust me,  a caster on a 28.8-32.1 connect like mine is just as screwed.  I try to kite someone and I still get backstabbed  when it appears that the person is in front of me.<br>
<br>
Anyways, just to toss the proverbial can of jet fuel on the flames, here's a statement that all you uber pkers will really love.  From my experience with 19 months of pvp, 14.5 months of that spent 50+, a lot of the uber pkers owe about 60% of their talent to connection speed and a top of the line system. Very few pvpers have truly distinguished themselves as being anything better than an average talent playing an unbalanced class with a good hardware/connect set up.  It takes way more  practice to melee pvp on a dial-up compared to broadband.  When you hear all about these rogues and shadowknights and monks and rangers, etc who are such great pvp talents there's a reason.  Shadowknights and rangers are two classes that really shine in pvp while being pretty useless in pve.  But why play one of those when you can be a rogue or monk and be highly desired for both pve and pvp?<br>

Oh, and btw a well played level 60 paladin is THE HARDEST person to defeat in one on one pvp.  Note that I said well played. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=518.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=518.topic&start=41&stop=45>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=557.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=559.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=518.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.threadControl?topicID=518.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=518.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=518.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
