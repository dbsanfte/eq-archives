<br>
We had 18 people, lvls 45-56, 3 clerics, and only 1 enchanter, and were able to push past the city and down to the Revenant Tower.  We had to stop there due to time constraints.  However, it IS doable to FD chain pull the Bank/Bar and get just 1-3 mobs per pull.  I was primary puller  (52nd monk), the 2nd part of the chain was a 45th SK, and we only had 1 bad pull where we both had to &quot;Take one for the team&quot; and die.<br>
<br>
Most important thing to remember - SNEAK is your friend.  Sneak around the corner, toss a shuriken at the mob, then start backing off.. by the time he wacks you and breaks your sneak your out of agro range and can usually peel of 1-3 mobs.<br>
<br>
Be ready to move quickly.  You have to pull constantly, keeping the main group in battle at all times. That's the only way to move thru without having to deal with respawns.<br>
<br>
Moving thru the city, from the Water by the pier, to the Middle Hole tunnel - the mobs in the buildings don't agro, so once you clear a path to the enterance to the tunnel leading to the middle hole, just move foward and fight as you go.  I'll try to remember to post a complete map of how to move through the city once I get it completed. <p>  Daimyo "Drunk Monk" Nightblind

Its pretty comprehensive now on how to get from the top all the way down to Master Yael. Once you get past the city its all really easy compared to the city. City and the Revenant tower are the two hardest parts of the whole zone to get a complete raid past and the revenant tower, well ... that's a pain in the ass to pull cause 90+% of the mobs cast, either they're shadowknights and HT you or are revenants and cast normal stuff. <p><center>---------------o0o---------------</center><center><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Ididar>Ididar Tzan - Level 51 Bard</a></center><center><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Fdor>Fdor - Level 51 Monk</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udaimyonightblind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daimyo Nightblind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/00 9:39:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~rwerning/eq/daimyo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Hole ...</span><hr size=1> Couple comments on your city map.<br>
<br>
Staging area 1 - there is a wandering Rev path that goes from the Rev tower, up to the city map (Hole Middle), past the bank &amp; 2J, past your markings of 4, then 3, then around past the outside of the pourch on the general store, past the enterance, and up the ramp to the castle.  You'll see other wanderers along portions of this wandering path, but the rev takes the whole route.<br>
<br>
Moving from 5-6:  Your method is different than mine.  Once everyone is medded up, back from AFK, then I make sure I do a fresh pull of the mobs between &quot;5&quot; and the pool beyond the archway to the west (near the office, you know the one - theres a Elemental that always spawns in it).  Once it's a fresh clear, we all move to the pool (wait for stragglers), then forward to the corner (wait for stragglers), then to the Middle Hole enterance.  If something jumps us, fight it there. As long as people stay away from the Library and big 'ol office building, you won't agro anything inside.  I find it easier to control the group if you move short distances, people tend to get lost or confused if you make a mad dash of it.<br>
<br>
Wandering mobs in the tunnel from the Hole up to City:  I'm not completely clear on how it works, but there seems to be 3+ wandering mob paths for the 7+ wandering mobs in this passageway.  They spawn back in the area of the Rev tower, most up on the ledge looking out towards the tower.   Some of these wanderers stop in the passaqeway, some stop at various points in the city, while others (like the Rev) go all the way up to the castle.  I've heard some people claim the respawn time is very short (6min) for these mobs, but I don't think so - I think what their seeing is another of the 7+ mobs spawning.  Once you start dropping them, the flow of wanderers slows to a trickle.    <br>
<br>
Another thing about the wanderers - I don't know this for sure,  but most of them don't seem to head back down the wander path. They go up to the end of their path and sit or despawn.  *I think* those that despawn then respawn right away back at the bottom. <br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, your guide looks very nice. Your tactics are very similar to mine (after several attempts at refining them with various levels of success).<br>
<br>
We're going to be taking a shot at Kirn in the Revenant Tower this week, I'll fill in what we learn during that adventure. <p>  Daimyo "Drunk Monk" Nightblind

We had four groups moving around and the space is a bit tight to be moving and fighting in that area. Plus, with casters sitting to med everytime a fight begins I didn't want to chance aggro from one of the buildings. I didn't find it THAT tough to clear it all and while there will still be a wanderer up (always seems to be one, at the least) it isn't a big deal to pull it with us down into the tunnel and fight it there. I don't like big runs but this one seems the safest, for our people, to manage. Last time nobody got lost except for two enchanters that were still back at 5, one of them afk. But those guys can just go elemental form and not get aggroed running over anyway, so no big deal.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem, like I said, with short steps in the city I find is just the deal with building aggro. Given how much time it sucks up to clear them along the way I prefer bigger jumps than I'm used to doing to avoid as much building aggro as possible.<br>
<br>
We only did one tower attempt with ITU up to Kindle's room and that failed miserably. An idea we had, that you might want to try, is sending people up with ITU a group at a time instead of all at once. Its a LONG run up those stairs and having 3-4 groups running up them leads to stuff aggroing one person and that person not realizing it and dragging the mob all the way with them to the room. Then you get a big train, mass confusion, and a total wipeout. We figure if you clear the revenant at the bottom of the valley in front of the rev tower, then ITU and send groups up one at a time you're bound to get them all in kindle's room. You might take a loss or two on a bad ITU or one dropping en route but nothing catostrophic. Do CR after you clear the two revenants in kindle's room and then pull to there once CR is done. <p><center>---------------o0o---------------</center><center><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Ididar>Ididar Tzan - Level 51 Bard</a></center><center><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Fdor>Fdor - Level 53 Monk</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udaimyonightblind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daimyo Nightblind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/27/00 8:41:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~rwerning/eq/daimyo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Hole ...</span><hr size=1> Well, we went in last night and gave it another shot - this time with 30 people instead of 18.  And exactly what you were talking about from 5-6 happened.  People got to close to the library and/or office building and agro'd them. When we evac'd we had around 10 mobs on us.. and we left 11 fallen comrades behind.   <br>
<br>
So, in retrospect I think yours is the safer plan, expecially if your bringing a large group.<br>
<br>
As for the Rev tower, we have yet to attempt it but the ITU plan is pretty much what I had in mind - send up one ITU group at a time, stop if you get agro'd on or loose your ITU.<br>

This usually really only comes up in this dungeon because its one of the only ones you'll come across where your raid will intentionally skip over huge amounts of mobs on purpose. Clearing from 5 to 6 really isn't all THAT difficult but all the same, due to wanderers, you might have to clear it 2-3 times to make it safe for the run. If you get lucky the first clearing might do it but if not it might take 2-3 clearings to stagger the wandering mobs far enough apart to allow you to run everyone across. <p><center>---------------o0o---------------</center><center><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Ididar>Ididar Tzan - Level 51 Bard</a></center><center><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Fdor>Fdor - Level 53 Monk</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udaimyonightblind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daimyo Nightblind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/6/00 10:39:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~rwerning/eq/daimyo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Hole ...</span><hr size=1> Did a recent Hole raid, made it through the city and to the Revenant tower in around 1.5 hrs.  We had 23 people, levels 45-56, average was around 51st-52nd.   I won't rehash what is known for running the city portion, following the advice laid out here will get you through just fine.   The key elements for a suceesfully run thru the city <br>
<br>
 - Communiate with everyone where your going, and what to expect, every step of the run.<br>
 - Patience<br>
<br>
Once you get to the Middle hole passage (#6 on the map), you begin your move down towards the Revenant tower.  There are a number of wandering mobs, 7-8 I think, that spawn near the rev tower and head up to the city.  Move as a group, stopping to fight and moving afterwards, until you get to the hill facing the Tower.<br>
<br>
Once on the hill, you can pull the Rev from the bottom of the hill.  Next take the west tunnel that leads to the bottom of the hole, and pull the Golems from there.  Once you've taken them out, you can move your group to the 2nd cavern in the tunnel - fighting in the first will attract the wandering mobs that spawn right outside.<br>
<br>
Once you've set up at this camp you have 2 options - into the tower or down to Master Yael.  We went into the tower.<br>
<br>
Head into the Revenant tower, if your looking to fight Kirn (Shaman epic quest), Kindle (Enchanter Epic quest), or Keeper of Tomes (Paladin Epic Quest).  Invis to undead worked great to get our people up to the top room where the Ghost of Kindle is.  First we ITU one group and myself, we choose to take the nuker group up first.  Ran them up to Kindles room and had them log out on the back wall.  Next I led the 2nd group up (all ITU also), and had them do the same.  Finally I led the last 2 groups up and we all camped.  Camped people went to a chat room, and we all logged in at the same time.<br>
<br>
Fighting in Kindles room is a snap.  Just don't cast any AoE spells and you'll be fine.  Only 1 revenant is KoS, the other 2 are indifferent.  After killing these 3 you can pull the ones in the hallway and kill them.  Next we ITU our shaman and she turned in the item to Kirn, I smacked him one and pulled him back to fight in Kindles room.  <br>
<br>
Kirn is a 2hr + spawn, Kindle is only 10-12 minutes.  So you can stick around and get the essence off of Kindle for all enchanters.  We'll be going back to do Kirn again, and Keeper of Tomes, one day soon.<br>

<br>
I mean, taking six hours for a cr, pulling 60 corpses from the Ghost of Glohnor area when you have only ONE rogue is not  fun !<br>
Anyway i managed to make a rogue and level it to 3 way before the cr was done : p<br>
<br>
Rogues are you time saver in this place ! <p><center>Iskys Syksiiksysiki  Monk of Thule<br>

When I tried to pull around area 6 I usually got 3-4 mobs.<br>
<br>
1) How do I reduce this number? i.e. the sneak and shuriken suggestion<br>
<br>
2) Chain pulling is mentioned please clarify howw this will work split mobs when they all return at same time in Hole. I assume tha tactic is pull to your FDed buddy, FD yourself, he gets up and pulls a few of the mobs the rest of the way...<br>
<br>
Please clarify. This guide is writtn from the point of view of a full raid. What if it was just a single group seeking to get to the Mimics for Sk epic stuff...<br>

If Master Yael is up, he drops a component for a very nice shoulder piece.  You'll also need a drop from Phinny, and somewhere else.  Imbued Granite Shoulderpads (?) drop in the Hole but they must have nerfed the drop rate.  It has been a long time since I've seen them drop.  The exp here is nice, and it's a very underused dungeon.<br>
<br>
If the undead tower is your raid destination, then there is a shortcut you can take through the city, that is if Yael isn't up.  There is a waterfall near the docks in the city.  Swim out to the ledge, and you can safely jump down to the pool below in Yael's room.  Just make sure he isn't up.  The Scalemaster pops down here too.  There are three mobs in Yael's room.  There are a few wanderers up to the undead tower, and three static rock golems right near the tower.  It's gotten SO much easier now that they are mezzable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=14.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=14.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2>Guides and Tactics</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
