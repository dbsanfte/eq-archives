<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I just wanted to chime in with my day 1 multiplayer experience. Mine was fantastic, and I didn't even mean to be online!<br>
<br>
I was just testing my module with the DM client, so I created a server that apparently got listed on the matching service, because suddenly here's all of these players dropping into my little three-room module!<br>
<br>
We chatted a bit, and I spawned in some creatures that they could handle...it was very low-key and lots of fun. I explained to everybody that I was just testing my module, and that there wasn't anything exciting to see or do, but no one seemed to mind...it was like a pick-up game of spontaneous D&amp;D, brought to you by Bioware and the miracle of the internet!<br>
<br>
So all of that was cool, but then I found out that one of the players who had dropped in was a Biowarian! Wooo! I tried not to be *too* fanboyish, but damn. Thanks for dropping in, Sophia!  <br>
<br>
Ok, so clearly my little pointless test module is not the pinnacle of exciting multiplayer gaming. But my point is: NWN multiplayer is going to work. Really, really well. Those few people who dropped by and I, we were given a glimpse of what NWN is going to become. It's going to be fantastic.<br>
<br>
After tonight, I *highly* recommend whipping up a quick module in the toolset and opening it up to the world. It doesn't have to be fancy; just chatting and spawning in some (appropriate!) creatures is half the fun.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my 2 coppers.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  -First I updated the new patch and went on to the multiplayer games where sadly not everyone had patched their games. Therefore I could only join about half the games on the list.<br>
-Everytime you attempt to join a new server and are unable to the whole list has to refresh which was annoying. <br>
-The games I got into were lagged to hell.<br>
-People killing players and not really doing anything else. No real roleplaying to be found.<br>
<br>
Overall the experience invoked mixed feelings. It was frustrating because it was like playing lame ass Diablo. However I got into one game where there was no lag and though the people were just running everywhere I realized that if I found a cool group of people to play with that really wanted to role play and we were in a module that wasnt &quot;Chapter one&quot; but something unique and unknown it will be a hell of alot of fun. <br>
Day one brought the realization that this game is going to take some work, work by players that love to role play and love the world of D&amp;D. The tools are there to make a rewarding experience. People say the games great or the game sucks but they are both right. Its what you make of it. The promise of what this game was supposed to be is real; its lived up to that. Sure there are some things missing but some great games can and will be played by people dedicated to making it work. Now all I need to do is find some people that are really into playing and not whining and complaining. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ufreonsmurf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FreonSmurf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 2:32:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A look at first day multiplayer.</span><hr size=1> I think alot of ppl have a misconception about the game, thinking it lies somewhere between a mmorpg and diablo, where its not even close to those in that sense.<br>
<br>
That said, the random player jumping from server to server will probaly find alot of the latter experince, until you figure out the server's,dm's that fit your playing style and etc.  <br>
<br>
To expect every joeblow server to be a d&d masterpiece isnt realistic, just not gonna happen. The 2nd player brought that point up, it takes alot of work.<br>
