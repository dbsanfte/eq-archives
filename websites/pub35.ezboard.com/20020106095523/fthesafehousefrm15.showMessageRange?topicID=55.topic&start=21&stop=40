Wizards/Mages are not the best gankers... Rogues do more damage than them both.  They do not even stand a chance in damage comparison.<br>
<br>
A_wizard00 begins to cast a 1000 dd.<br>
A_not_completely_hopeless_rogue gets hit for 230 damage.<br>
A_wizard00 gets backstabbed for 450..or doubled for 900, then gets poked for 70 70 40 40..<br>
A_wizard00 tries desparately to root the rogue...the rogue sits down and resist 16 consecutive root attempts before getting up to /end the wizard.<br>
<br>
Casters are easy (dunno aboot shamans, been awhile).<br>
<br>
Hehe I mean think about it.<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;ya ready for the big elbow?&quot;<br>
Wizard say's, &quot;haha, this is gonna be a joke&quot;<br>
You beging applying a poison.<br>
You have successfully applied (a stun or something)<br>
You say, &quot;are you ready?&quot;<br>
Wizard say's, &quot;haha yeah&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;say go&quot; (readies his finger over his dead eye disc and his backstab button)<br>
Wizard say's, &quot;go&quot;<br>
A wizard is stunned!<br>
Midgettos goes off on the wizard.<br>
less than a few seconds later the wizard will be dead<br>
<br>
They just dont have the HP needed to live through our wrathe.<br>

<br>
On the higher end of the level spectrum, a decently played melee can usually kill them right off if they have a lot of resist gear. In a recent tournament I went to, a level 42 warrior went to town during the royal rumble and netted half a dozen kills, which was more than anyone else.<br>
<br>
And I'd say that rogues are definitely the most fun to PvP with. The casters either sit still and cast, or run around and cast. Not a whole lot of fight options. <p><br>

-assuming: that every class is geared correctly, knows how to operate their class, and is prepared, it's undoubtably---<br>
<br>
Necros.  <br>
<br>
Unless the necro is lagging or dense, they can SS out of any rogues attack in a heartbeat, with the pet beating on the rogue all the way.  Splurt is nearly unresistable and does a good two-thirds of a 55 level rogues hp, and sure, you can dispel it...start up that FOUR SECOND CAST pumice, yea baby, and try and work a spell with the necro casting on you and the pet quadding you and backstabbing you...yea, right.  If anything, all that necro has to do is get a dot on you and the pet and keep you in spell range and there's not a damn thing the rogue can do.  The pet will go to work, and if the rogue tries to ID it (which is really a joke, for those of you who do it...) the necro will just blast the rogue with some nice lifetaps or some more super dots.  <br>
<br>
And if all else fails, I've stood Toe-to-toe with necros my level and they've flat killed me using straight life taps...EVERY necro who has more than tapioca for brains specializes in alteration (the lifetapping line of spells) and their mana far outdoes the amount of hp I have.  That was without a pet, me just standing circle straffing to backstab and him just reclicking his spell til I was dead =P<br>
<br>
I don't know of anybody else in the caster district that can just toe-to-toe it and come out in less than 8 or 9 pieces...<br>

<br>
Please refer to the emoted section in the very beginning.  It says &quot;is prepared&quot;.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I didn't clarify.  I meant &quot;prepared&quot; as in Dueling.  And you wont' find a necro dumb enough to let you apply a poison when you're dueling.  <br>
<br>
And if Athrex were prepared his rune would have made your backstab highly less potent.<br>
<br>
Midgetto...<br>
<br>
SS can take them out of your sight range with full clip on.  And generally a pvp event doesn't happen in an Arena...happens someplace with geographical features, unless you're in a flat desert.  <br>

The reason I chose necros is because I feel they're best overall...<br>

To close the fight tho, you need be able to KILL.<br>

And anytime I have to settle something with a duel it is always held in the arena...I like battles that show who knows how to control their class the best, not duels that show who is best at exploiting the terain to beat their opponent.

Duel like a man, not a lil sissy.

<br>
Mages suck post 30 or so, unless they have their epic... then theyre a pain especially outdoors when their pet has velocity.<br>
<br>
I dont see why people think necros are so tough... pets can be rooted/snared pretty easily, can dispell a lot of their dots... can cure the rest and they have very low hp. Unless they can get you in a place where they can abuse Z axis and kite you they arent really a problem for me.<br>
<br>
Rogues vary depending on gear and skills... if you play them right they can kill anybody at 59 i can kill anybody except maybe a shadowknight if i make the first move.<br>
<br>
I kinda agree with everybodys opinion on druids, at least from a rogues perspective. Good dots, good nukes, dmg shield, heals... in tight places theyve been easy for me (velks, seb etc)<br>
<br>
I agree with Tsunamii on enchanters to an extent...&quot;anybody they can land nukes on they own&quot;. Cant land nukes on many people at high levels =) Id think theyd kill most casters at high levels because of mana drains....I killed an enchanter before she had a chance to get tash off recently =P<br>
<br>
Anyway... i could go on forever.<br>

<br>
If it's in a dungeon, melees rule. <br>
If it's in an outdoor zone, casters got better chances.<br>
<br>
I play a 60 nec on VZ and trust me, there is no such thing as a given win against an equal lvl character..<br>
<br>
You have to take into account what the opponent got gearwize....and itemwize.<br>
Golemwands rule. Oldstyle pumice rule.<br>
If you go up against an opponent with these, you will find yourself buffless in 1 sec flat.<br>
<br>
Some of the statements here are pretty funny <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;I dont think any caster at 40+ can stand and take the blasts from a full bar of wizard mana no matter if they got 200MR 200FR and 200CR all at the same time.&quot;<br>
<br>
A cleric can out heal this.<br>
A necro can outdrain this.<br>
A good melee will interrupt this.<br>
A SK will HT and drain you to death before the mana is gone.<br>
etc..<br>
<br>
&quot;At 50+ a Paladin or SK with good resists (i.e. BD Bracers etc...) should be able to beat anyone. &quot;<br>
<br>
From a necs view:<br>
SKs are awsome with HT disc and drains. For these the spectre unfearable pet is nice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Stick with deflux, and never go below 1k hp if possible..cause then youre dead. HP gear is nice..*grin*. SKs are hard opponents.<br>
<br>
Pallys got LoH and heals (stunns will be resisted 95% of the time). Often they try to root the pet, just dispel it..If they go after you, you can just deflux until dead while running close to pet so it stays in meleerange of the pally. <br>
<br>
Mages with fearless epic pets are nasty..<br>
<br>
Rogues are evil when they get close..<br>
<br>
A well played enchanters are awsome, against casters they really shine..<br>
<br>
Warriors..lots of hp, stunkick..<br>
<br>
Bards..Almost unkillable outdoors unless they screw up.<br>
Dam you! You petpoofers! Dam you! (Sidenote: Thanks verrant for this awsome feature)<br>
<br>
Rangers..bows, melee..icky<br>
<br>
Druids..DoTs, DDs, DS...bearpet!!?! (JK)<br>
Needs to be dispelled golemwand style!<br>
<br>
Shamans..debuffs need to be dispelled asap! Nasty with SoWboots and DoTs. And that puppy pet can stun you unless it's taken care of. <br>
<br>
Anyway. A necro is neat..but the way verrant buffed melees after kunark is just sad. Tanks hitting for 300+ with tantors tusk..Rangers with UBR bows and trueshot hitting you while running and out of spell range..Rogues BSing for 1k..etc..<br>
<br>
Now they even upgraded melees more with the last patch.<br>
From a PvP standpoint this is crazy. Almost every high lvl caster on PvP servers makes melee twinks, mainly rogues, rangers and SKs.<br>
<br>
Against a necro resists don't really matter. All spells used are unresistable. (Try using EB and CoC against anyone with full BD, waste of mana)<br>
<br>
Drains, Vexing, Pyro, Anul, Jboots, Instacast items, Potions, Harmshield and SS are your friends...use them wisely!<br>
<br>
The comments about that PvP skills are best tested in the arena are at least in my oppinion false, cause using hills, trees and terrain should be a part of the fight. Hills and trees are very useful! Thats like the warrior saying to a wizzard: stand still f00! I can't hit you with my UBRweapon_03 if you run around and use spells!<br>
<br>
&quot;At lvl 60 I would have to say SK, using HT disc.&quot;<br>
Good call Secks, pretty much summs it up. <br>
<br>
Mkay..think im a bit off subject..it's late..I'm tired..Hope you can make something outta this post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Top 5 things you need to be a good PvPer is skills, skills, skills, gear, luck.<br>
Skills to get the hit/spell off. Gear and Luck to have it not miss/fizzle/be resisted.<br>

I have beaten a 60sk and a 60necro too, those were difficult fights, but if you have a see-invis item and lots of mana you can overcome the dots and lifetaps..the pet dies fast just kill it. The necro was harder, fortunately he ran out of mana before i did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
A paladin 59+ is quite difficult to kill, depending on the skill and equipment, I think a paladin could kill anyone. I think each class has weaknesses toward other classes, but the one that holds strong across the board is a paladin, it doesnt matter what your class is, your gonna have trouble taking a 59-60 pally down =P<br>

<br>
Sure I caster could shadow step and nuke and shadow step and nuke, and if you're stupid enough to keep running towards them then you'll die.<br>
<br>
In some instances you just can't win.<br>
<br>
However, if you want to single handedly take out anyone... smart or not.... it's an SK or a Rogue.  Sneak up on someone and HT or Duelist disc and it's over in about 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
MR based spells will never land on someone with halfway decent MR.  The only class that could be hard to get away from is a Bard, cause they're just fast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=55.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=55.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=514.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=525.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.threadControl?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=55.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=55.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
