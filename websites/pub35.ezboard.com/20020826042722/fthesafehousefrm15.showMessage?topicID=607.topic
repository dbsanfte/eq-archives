<br>
anyway..<br>
<br>
I'm a 50 rogue on Bristlebane (main character, not ebayed twinked (by others))  with about 90 days played.  Following is my gear with how and when i acquired it, to the best of my memory.<br>
<br>
Head : Circlet of Vallon, Bought for 10 kpp, recently<br>
Face : Sarnak Mask, Bought for 2 kpp, mid 40s<br>
Neck : Dragon Tooth Choker, Bought 4 kpp, mid 40s<br>
Chest : Iksar Ceremonial, Bought, 7 kpp, late 20s<br>
Back : Hooded Black Cloak, Bought 5 kpp, early 40s<br>
Shoulder : Seb Scale Mantle, Bought, 1 kpp, 30s<br>
Arm : Mrylokars, Bought, 4 kpp, early 40s<br>
Wrists : Seb Scale, found on vendors, 20s and 30s<br>
Hands : Silver Chitin Handwraps, Bought, 10 kpp, mid 40s<br>
Waist : TBB, Bought, 3 kpp, mid 40s<br>
Legs : Seb Scale, bought, 6 kpp, 30s<br>
Feet : Barbed Dragonscale, Bought, 10 kpp, mid 40s<br>
Fingers : Velium Fire (6 65) Bought, about 600 p ea, 40s<br>
Ears : Cougar Claw, bought, too much, early 40s<br>
Main : Small Dragonbone Shard, bought, 13 kpp, early 40s<br>
Secondary : Defiance, looted, late 40s<br>
Range : Idol of Thorned, bought, 5 kpp, recently<br>
<br>
All in all about 90 k worth of spending (or trade value) though most of the stuff isnt worth what i paid for it anymore.<br>
<br>
I made the money mostly by trade skills, keeping an eye on the vendors, buying and selling in EC and by selling things ive looted. In that order<br>
<br>
I havent played on a red server long enough to get into the economy there, having only played long enough to become frustrated with the continuous and repeated harassment in the newbie zone (me level 1 or 2, with newbie dagger, him level 6 with twinked weapon AND high level buffs) so I'm not sure how it works there.  i'd have a few theories though<br>
<br>
1) Blue servers have a more vigorous player economy because coin is safe, which facilitates trade.  A largely barter based economy (item for item trades only) will not be as vigorous. <br>
2) Blue servers have more gear in the economy because a stronger economy encourages farming.  If a farmer knows he can sell and sell safely, he is more likely to take up farming.<br>
3) Blue servers have a much larger market because they have more players, and in the case of SZ, more characters per player as well.  A larger market means more likelyhood of finding what you want in the marketplace, or of finding a buyer for what you have.<br>
4) Blue servers have one less worry when fighting mobs, specifically, they need not worry about other players (directly)attacking them.  Though i dont really know how much this happens in higher end red play either.  I was in Chardok the other day, and our raid got to the royals area only to be trained twice.  Supposedly unintentionally.  The first guy &quot;didnt realize until too late&quot; that he had a tail.  The second guy was &quot;coming to help&quot; the first guy because he saw his HP bar dropping.  even though he came long after the first guy was dead.  we had just barely defeated the first guy's train (10 or 12 sarnaks) and had about 20 seconds til the second guy showed..  Net result was that ourt raid got wiped, and most of the loot didnt get looted.  The trainers were from the other raid in the zone.  Anyway, on SZ thats a perfectly legal tactic and no prevarication wouldbe required after doing it.  So i suspect raiding is really different there.  On the other hand, If the rest of a red server is like the *pre-level 6 minimum for pvp* era, i dont see how you could level at all... unless you were on the top of the heap from the start.<br>
<br>
Anyway... thats one reason my days played are so high.  Its my first character, and i spend a lot of time making money other than by hunting.<br>

The 90 K figure is what i shelled out over tha last 30 levels, not what they would sell for now.<br>

Heck, FBSS used to be worth 10k, now theyre going for 2 or 3, at least on BB. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uartemuss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Artemuss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/12/02 5:15:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: swipey</span><hr size=1> Sorry probly wasnt clear but i do know on blue servers people have downed gods and other NPCs that we ahvent done on pvp servers so i just assumed that meant maybe people hadgear that i never heard of and stuff :P<br>

Thanks. (barb is from AOW?)<br>
<br>
i use saldrite dagger and dragonspine rapier mainly (swaping out with primal) I find evade suitable to avoid overagroing and both these procs affect MANY high end monsters including NTOV dragons, I do not die using them anymore then just using primal/rage. Shame that the dragonspine can't touch most shrooms in exp grinds in fungus<br>

thats crap<br>
<br>
Not to be an ass but, try joining a guild that has a chance pve? Macabre and Silent souls can accomplish about the same as 1 group of well geared level 60s. Don't join a guild of rejects just cause no one else will take you, raid with a decent guild and stick it out, show them you are worth their time. If you keep raiding with guilds that are kos to the server while you apply to good guilds, it reflects poorly. Just some friendly advice. <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28687"><b>Vixie</b></a>, 60th (Veteran??) Assassin of Bristlebane<br>
