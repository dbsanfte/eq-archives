I'm trying to taunt it off of him, I just get the aggro back and the cleric starts casting a spell. I figure, three of the tanks are low on health, he's gonna heal us up. WRONG. THE MORON GATES! He lost one bub of health max, and he f-ing gates! I couldn't believe it! He was bound in OT, so I figured he was near the ramp still. No, he's bound in the bank. almost full TPW, with only the cleric surviving. I mean, WTF!?

Back in the days when I hunted in Lguk, I often had to join makeshift groups at the times of day where either everything was camped or no one was around(usually the first). Anyhow, on one such occassion I was invited to lord. This makeshift group consisted of 1 warrior 1 rogue 1 cleric 2 druids 1 enchanter. Everything was going smoothly since the group before had spaced out the lord spawns nice and wide, then lord pops(with a yak too). So we go with the plan of cleric DA pulling to eat the HT and having one of the druids root it, fine. Well, the cleric pulls and runs back to our spot, lord follows, things went well up to here. The druid that had offered to root couldn't seem to land a spell, to which point the lord promptly ate our cleric alive. Our enchanter was next on the menu from trying to slow him, now through out this the warrior was ferverishly trying to taunt it off them which didn't really helped until they both of them died, well, he finally does get aggro and manage to dole out quite of bit of damage to lord with my aid and the healing/nuking of 2 druids. We got lord down to about 15% health I'd say before he turned to the druid that was healing and commenced to beat/yak him through the floor, while the warrior and I continued to wail away. At about the &quot;H&quot; of &quot;the&quot; in its name, the warrior dies as the last druid was medding. Last person standing, the rogue(me =/) hitting away with all I had, obviously not a match for lord but I held my own, it had almost no health visible and my health had dropped down to 2 bubs, &quot;heal please&quot; I said, no response, 1 bub and a half &quot;heal please&quot; I said, no response, 1 bub &quot; HEAL DAMN IT&quot; I said, druid starts nuking...... I die, druid gets solo exp, safe to say I was pissed. <br>

ANywayz... we are inside the fort pretty deep inside when we decide .. meh lets go to right plat to just heal up and get rdy to go back in. Well while we are running back the smart bards stops playing invis and we aggro 12 sarnarrks on our ass... we run to right plat..<br>
Druid dies.. 10 sarnarks left<br>
Then the ranger is at 2 red left and hes yelling and running around ahh ahh help me help me and he makes all the sarnarks aggro our pally but of course the ranger dies. by this time us 2 rogues have been killing 8 sarnarks left<br>
so me, rogue #2, pally and bard.. oh wait the bard ran away when the druid died... GRRR<br>
so me and the other rogue and pally battle it out against the sarnarks.. i ahve half a red when BOOM the pally uses LoH on me im like w0000t.. but then pally gets aggroed and he dies..<br>
Me and other rogue left 4 sarnarks... <br>
You have slain a sarnark recruit (3 times)<br>
THen last sarnark.. its at the end of the<br>
&quot;a&quot; sarnark recruit<br>
I trying to evadde.. anything! im telling the other rogue to backstab taunt it but of course my hp is really low so it aggro's me.. boom i fall down.. purple hp.. but i have regained consiousness.. then i triple it for 25.. it hits me for 10 and i die.. and right before it says returning to home point i see it turn around and walk away... rogue kills it.... i was so angry and the bard/ranger..  shudder.. the pain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=farvel>Farvel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 9:18:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23275.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well....</span><hr size=1> My worst group was in LOIO as well. I had gone through about 5 really bad groups in as many days,and I was getting sick of LOIO quickly. I decided to give it one more shot. So, I see a group leader announce that they need a level 20-24 rogue at the Sarnark Fort. I take them up on the offer, and head to the fort. Once I get there, there are 5 other people in the group, 3 lvl 20-21 warriors, a level 20 cleric, and a level 21 enchanter. I'm level 22 at the time,so it looks like a pretty good group. Well, the group spent 10 minutes trying to figure out who would pull. I offered to pull, but they told me that rogue's suck at pulling. Warning sign (#1).<br>
<br>
They finally decide to let the cleric pull(#2). While the cleric is pulling a sarnark, two of the warriors say that it's dinner time and they need to camp(#3). So, it's down to 1 warrior,1 cleric,1 enchanter, 1 rogue. No problem.<br>
<br>
The cleric pulls a Sarnark, and the warrior and I start beating on it. The enchanter doesn't help at all(#4). The cleric keeps the warrior's health up...until the warrior just disappears---no LD message or anything (#5) .So now,the sarnark is eating this cleric alive. I'm practially standing on top of this sarnark, backstabbing, pickpocketing, hitting beg, etc trying to get aggro...nothing works. So, the cleric dies, and this thing turns back around on me. It doesn't have much health left, and I manage to maul it before it kills me. I got away with half a bubble of life. All for some really crappy experience.<br>
<br>
So, I turn around to see what the enchanter was doing, and he's sitting there AFK. I sent a tell to the cleric and pulled her corpse back to the windmill. I split some cash with her, and decided that I would never go back to LOIO again. <p>Farvel MacDermott<br>

You tell &lt;name removed&gt;, &quot;Hey, you shouldn't practice instill doubt on mobs we are fighting since it might fear them when you don't want it.&quot;<br>
<br>
A black widow spider looks very afraid.<br>

You sigh, completely disappointed.<br>
<br>
Well, I suppose it wasn't really the group that was bad, just the one member.<br>
<br>
Generally, I only use the LFG tag when on raids while awaiting group assignment.  I tend to mostly just group with people I know while exp hunting. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156429>Sbik Swashbucklugget</a><br>

Okay!<br>
<br>
My new favorite hobby is standing at the zone in KC watching the trains roll by. It's great - I get to stand there in sneakhide, chat with my guild, and watch what amounts to a circus for free. The record so far is 22 minutes of continuous train, thanks to re-trains and people peeking in and reagroing everything. Occasionally a see-invis dog takes a shot at me, but it's a small price to pay. I've gotten more entertainment out of KC than the rest of EQ put together.<br>
<br>
edit: err, the first time I went to KC I had a group in LCY with an enchanter who insisted on charming everything. She didn't mez once. When things got nasty, she gated. To the KC zone. And promptly died to the train she helped create. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uargyll7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Argyll7th</A> at: 4/14/02 8:07:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugalivain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>galivain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 9:02:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23275.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Worst possible group you had.</span><hr size=1> Every group you get into as a twink that is filled with noobs.
