<br>
I know the way the DF nerf happenned sucks, but because it happenned that late they still kept DF as much better than any other anytime style afaik. And if you check the LA/CD/DW lines you'll kinda quickly figure out that LA effectiveness is superior to CS non hidden styles, while CS style are better than CD/DW styles afaik.<br>
<br>
That's just my opinion of course, but I don't think most people in Alb or Hib fears the 'other' assassin (Inf or NS) more than the shadowblades they're facing.<br>
Of course a bad shadowblade will still be crap compared to a skilled NS/Inf, but I honnestly don't think SBs are that bad off currently. For me they still stand out as the best assassins. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthormael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thormael</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/31/02 5:56:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 6:06:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /reply</span><hr size=1> actually woopya your incorrect,because you cant break down a skill into a style bonus. this is what got us here in the first place. if your going to look at a skill,look at the skill completely.<br>
<br>
are the styles better, not really, as a sb heres why.<br>
<br>
1. doublefrost damage was hit so hard,that it doesnt do much more then a garrote now. at 34+6 spec in both&lt;easy way for me to test them&gt; the bonus damage is within 8 points of each other on average. this was an average damage on yellow con mobs,based on 2 hours of killing.  furthermore,then endurence cost of DF is roughly equal to a garrote/ah combo.after a pa/cd you have on average 3 doublefrosts as a sb. thats usually not enough with current bonus damage,to kill any tank,or any cleric. a good shield spec scout,will also use that endurence up fast,thus making it essentially worthless to use in rvr. your then relying on the combat/frostygaze combo to win,which is unreliable as reactionary styles are tough to pull off.<br>
<br>
2. by far the best anytime styles for LA are now ravager-atrophy-scathing blade,which is also slightly more end then DF. scathing blade alone does more damage then the df bonus. problem is you will never get this off in rvr combat,due to lag etc.  the comback/frosty gaze combat is the best combo overall,but requires you to evade,another unlikely even in the lag that is rvr combat. that leaves you with snowsquall-icy brillance&lt;29 &amp;44&gt; which very few sb's will have,unless they are a true shadowzerker. the last style isa back positional+chain,which basically means it wont be used ,except on running targets,if you can stay close enough.<br>
<br>
anytime i dont use a style,with 2 weapons,my damage is almost always less then using the same primary weapon and shield. this basically means i blow endurence or not. ill get the polar rift style next level,so will test that out,with 34+6 sword to gain a comparision. <br>
<br>
while it looks good on paper,in reality it doesnt add up,because i have to dump at least 66% of my spec points into this line to make it viable. 66% means i dont have alot of points to raise other skills,stealth,envenom,cs etc etc etc. this means i need to be a specalist sb to be most effective. <br>
<br>
by comparison skill wise- a decent sb template using all 5 skills<br>
&lt;requires auto train to level 24&gt;<br>
35 stealth<br>
39 weapon<br>
34 cs<br>
31 envenom<br>
39 left axe<br>
<br>
vs slash spec infiltrator<br>
50 slash<br>
36 stealth<br>
36 envenom<br>
44 cs<br>
14 dw<br>
<br>
the infil is clearly better in almost every aspect of speccing there charecter. the infil template can be mixxed and modifed in any fashion,and numerous areas depending on what you wanted. you could easily have 4 more stealth then any sb,or have higher envenom,higher or lower cs,higher dw with ease.<br>
<br>
the sb has a limited range to work with. his left axe is basically related to his weapon skill,as weapon skill is to cs for infils. i have very little room to move with a 5 spec. my only advantage was doublefrost bonus damage,which is now gone.<br>
<br>
if i want higher left axe&lt;44&gt; or higher cs i have to completely eliminate a line of skill practically. so when you talk about styles,your really not telling the entire story,and the true story imo.<br>

I feel that the extra 453 spec points granted to Inf's open doors that we SB's and NS's could only hope to have.  Taking those extra points alone lets you spec a skill from 1 to 29 with change left over.  There a nice DW/Env spec for ya.<br>
<br>
As far as the free use of 2H for SBs goes I have mixed feelings.  When hunting even cons I rarely target anything not in leather/studded as I have a slash weapon and low HP/AF/Absorb.  The targets in my foodchain evade profusely and I cannot afford 10 seconds of 0 dmg output.  A single evade weilding a 2H does exactly that.  So I choose 1H weapons to offset the evades and misses.  The 2H died when they removed oneshotting and remaining stealthed.  Give me Vanish instead of Shadowrun and I'll dust it off and use one again.  While your at it give me a 9 sec Evade based stun.  And don't downplay the significance of Dragonfang.  Once respec hits I feel Dragonfang will be as prolific as doublefrost. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 6:21:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /reply</span><hr size=1> ela,the thing is that you cant really balance dw/cd or left axe based on the rogues,it has to be balanced amongst the dual wield charecters in the game.<br>
<br>
right now,everyone is applying these skills to rogues,what they should do is apply them to the classes who use them as there primary skills. <br>
<br>
as stated in my previous post,left axe is a skill that is dependant on your primary weapon,where as dual wield is not. a shadowblade has to sacrifice somewhere to make a viable template. the best balanced template still doesnt match up against the infiltrator in pure skill levels,and in any factor in finished skill levels. i will always be 5-10 skill levels lower then any infil in all areas that count. <br>
<br>
rogues have only one avenue to persue,thats damage. giving us 50 or even 100 more hp wont really do much,since we take higher damage on every hit then any other class in the game,with the exception of casters,and even that is debateable.the 50 hit points we got,quite frankly doesnt even equate a 5% bonus chance to survive  in reality. damage occurs to fast in this game for that to be the case.<br>
<br>
what they really need to do,is scrap the dw/cd build,or scrap the left axe build,and use identical skills for all 3 realms. make them viable based on the 3 primary classes that use them. that wont happen though.<br>
<br>
for me to equal the damage of a infiltrator,i would estimate that a 30% damage bonus to base hits,would probably do the trick. its tough to say as you trying to balance completly differnt skills,and how they operate against each other.<br>

The plan fact is DF WAS to powerful .  THere is not ifs ands or buts about it . Did the nerf go to far ?  IF what you all are saying is true  then i think it did . Should it be back to where it was before ?  Hell no not for SB, maybe for zerkers though . <br>
<br>
Elaa everytime i read one of your posts my head hurts . I understand them fairly easy ,but the fact is that some times you just make stuff way more complex then has to be . All the other styles in LA got a good boost in that patch . If DF got nerfed to much , Up the DF style damage that 15 % you seen to think SB needs, Lower the End cost on it alittle  and be done with the thing .Then Mythic can gets to the assassin class that really needs help and that is the nightshade . BTW Elaa i don't think NS are as far behide SB/Inifl as you do though. <br>

<br>
<br>
Now that Doublefrost the style is nerfed, the glaring inadequacies of leftaxe are shown.  In hard numbers.  Elaa shows them.<br>
<br>
.... and people STILL argue AGAINST enhancements.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leftaxe requires massive spec points to be effective.  There was a reward for that... doublefrost.  It made up for the glaring weaknesses in the spec line.<br>
<br>
- To get decent bonuses you MUST keep spec high<br>
--CD/DW you do not<br>
<br>
-Leftaxe damage is based on variance of leftaxe spec, not weapons spec<br>
--CD/DW is based on weapon skill<br>
<br>
-Base damage is halved, lowering style damage significantly.<br>
--CD/DW does not do this.<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree with giving a level based damage addition to leftaxe.  It's now VERY needed.  You can't just fix this with another increase to doublefrost.  It needs a total revamp, to bring damage to par and make it less dependent on heavy spec.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the 15% enhancement to match up with infiltrators....<br>
<br>
I'm not a big fan of +10% crit, I think something that has a chance to happen isn't a good fix.  A 10% to something that is always active is more effective, as the skill points of infiltrators are always active.<br>
<br>
15% more hitpoints, or a 10% CS style damage, or 10% added somewhere else would be better.    I just don't see 10% added to the critical chance making up for 7dps.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll still continue to think that sb's should...<br>
<br>
... have access to hammer spec line.<br>
... have access to viper and vanish<br>

rebuidl them from scratch for the 3 main classes that rely on them and then make them identical so that all rogues use the same set standard. <br>
<br>
you can then give every rogue the 2.5 spec line, or cut infil to 2.2 and make us all equal. <br>

after all this is what everyone is arguing for isnt  it? equality amongst rogues. then nightshades can get buffed up where needed,and the problems are all solved<br>

1)<br>
Good ideas in general.  However, as stated above, due to the way DW/CD dont' apply style damage, and LA doesn't apply style damage etc.  I Feel a more indepth analysis would be needed to equate the damage of the two lines. but this should be looked at.<br>
<br>
2)<br>
For LA SB's, you are correct, they will lag behind infiltrators.<br>
However 2H SB's are going to be roughly equal to infiltrators.<br>
<br>
Adding 10% crit to 2H's would over power SB's, but not giving it would underpower LA sb's.  I would then say to in conjunction with #1 above, increase LA average damage an additional 10% over DW/CD.<br>
<br>
This would leave 2H only SB's roughly equal, and make LA SB's roughly equal with Infiltrators.  An infiltrator using 2H for opening and switchting to LA for followups would get a substatnial bonus to PA as well as a 10% general melee bonus. This would again give a slight melee edge to SB's.<br>
To balance the edge.  2h's will of course suffer if they are evaded, but that's nothing new.  And of course infiltrators are <br>
more versatile and can choose thrust.  He who PA's first wins, otherwise it's a tough draw or even two dead assasins after poisons.<br>
<br>
In conclusion:<br>
<br>
Balance LA and DW damages giveing LA an average 10% lead over DW.  And give LA better scaling of damage with various spec levels. LA and DW both are wierd birds and need lotsa fixin to make things work right for all 3 realms. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usneekeerz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sneekeerz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 1:05:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /reply</span><hr size=1> I heard the base chance to get a crit is around 15%.

<br>
Aiden the point you make about LA are good ones and all true. But they dont adress anything I said. I never compared LA to anything other than CD or DW, which are suposed to be the hib/alb counterparts/equivalents. You counter me with:<br>
<br>
&quot;Doublefrost dmg was hit so hard, it doesnt do much more than garrout&quot;<br>
<br>
Garrout is part of the CS line which NS and INF are FORCED to take because of the extreme weakness of cd/dw. You are kind of proving my point with your statements. The line we are FORCED to take  does less than the line you have a choice in pursueing by your own admition. I never compared LA to CS. I only compared it to its counterparts DW and CD. It is the best of those 3 and this is proven by the fact that shadowzerkers(high LA spec SBs) exist. There are no high cd shade or  high dw infs, this alone proves that LA is more valuable. <br>
<br>
<br>
I also think you missed the point of my post which was to tell Elaa that her numbers do not reflect accurately the dmg dealt by cd or dw. In her post she equates 37.5% high offhand swing rate to 37.5% higher dmg. That is not anywhere near the truth. Because of this large miscalculation, the comparison between the +15% dmg infs get from more spec points and her value of LA/CD/DW is thrown off. It also does not include the value of styles. Again, not LA vs CS styles but rather LA vs CD/DW. <br>
<br>
I am not against LA fixes, as you all seem to think I am by my countering Elaa. Instead, I am just pointing out problems in her calculations. Those calculations are what she draws her conclusions from and should be accurate otherwise the solutions wont be balanced either. <br>

<br>
This is all a moot point.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leftaxe doublefrost was the style that made the skill.  It's it.  Everything else is not so shiney <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Now things are completely level.  The styles from DW/CD are as effective as leftaxe.  For the most part, the bulk of assassins, now including shadowblades will be using garrote.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now.  Compare damage from CD/DW and LA.<br>
<br>
CD/DW is a 37.5% chance to swing and is effective at any spec, as it's variance is weapon based and is just ADDING damage when you swing.<br>
<br>
LA is a 20% increase in damage.  But the second swing variance is based on leftaxe skill.  This only works at HIGH spec.<br>
<br>
<br>
CD/DW is more effective then leftaxe.<br>
<br>
I'm unsure where the errors in elaa's calculations are.  Please explain further.<br>

<br>
You say that with Infil getting a stun style we can kill anyone in the game . Well left axe gets a stun style at 39 spec to THrust's 50 in spec . Yes i know its a two part chain  but look at all the points you are saving over Infil.  <br>
<br>
You want all assassin's to get 2.5 or move Infil down 2.2 so it will all be balance ??  well if that happens you will have to give up your HP,two handed and use DW instend of LA . NS will have to give up shouts and spells . then we can be all cookie cutter . If NS/SB don't give up those skills then you would be putting Infil at the bottom of the assassin's like you claim SB are now . <br>
<br>
Look i understand SB are upset that they are no longer cream of the assassins. It sucks to but knocked down to our level . <br>

I agree SB need their combat boosted alittle now that DF is not god like anymore . But the old system was out of line .Come up with a different way to giving SB the combat edge then need .  <p>Moonglum DAoC

DW does more base damage. LA will swing both hands every time. Those swings though do 1/2 damage. So LA has 2 to hit checks in order to do the same damage as just your primary hand. Additionally the off hand weapon is ussually a faster weapon and less damaging. So LA base damage is lower even if you wear a shield and don't use DW at all.<br>
<br>
An Sb using the same weapon primary averaging 90 pnts a hit and a 2.4 delay weapon that hits for 60 pnts base secondary. Lets also say that 80% of all swings hit.<br>
<br>
The SB would hit for <br>
90/2 = 45 Primary<br>
60/2 = 30 Secondary<br>
<br>
80% to hit ratio = 36 average Primary<br>
80% to hit ratio = 24 average Secondary<br>
<br>
Total average = 60 damage<br>
<br>
Infiltrator<br>
80% to hit ratio = 72 average damage Primary<br>
<br>
Before DW is even factored in there is a 17% advantage.<br>
<br>
Now add in a 60 pnt off hand hit with a 37.5 % chance to swing connecting 80% of the time.<br>
<br>
60 - 37.5% = 22.5<br>
<br>
80% to hit ratio = 18 pnt average off hand damage<br>
<br>
90 pnt average base damage for inf<br>
60 pnt average base damage for SB<br>
<br>
SB does 66% the base damage of an Inf or an inf does 50% more base damage than an SB (symantics).<br>
<br>
This was the reason why LA styles added more than CD/DW styles. Doublefrost may have been doing more damage than was intended. The change though was not small it was a 50% reduction. My guess is the programmer did not understand that style damage was a function of 50% of base weapons damage. So when he saw the huge bonus that doublefrost had he did not know it was applied against a base of 50%. <br>
<br>
Additionally when the scaling was put in it messed things up even further. I have seen the bonus from doublefrost as low as +30 in pve while exping (with 44 trained LA). I am not sure that doublefrost for a high endurance cost should result in a hit that is lower than my dot. Or to put it in persective while using a high endurance style I was doing less damage, than an infiltrator not using styles. Thats the extreme case and the opening stlye to our 3 style chain does less than doublefrost.<br>
<br>
Thats why Old Mill is busy posting versus playing.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse Mythic is a company where the left hand never seems to know what the right hand is doing. My guess is CD/DW will get boosted to equal pre nerf style damage from LA. Resulting in SB's doing doing both 50% of style damage and based upon 50% of base damage. That would bring SB's vrs Inf/NS balance inline with the Armsman/Hero vrs Warrior balance. <br>

50 infil soloing prepared lvl48 warrior and lvl50 SB, where both (warrior and sb) have lotsa combat experience. No, he didnt do it once luckily but 3 times in a row:<br>
1) I nearly never hit him (see my template in my other thread)<br>
2) He evade really often and simply stunned the warrior all the time, until he had the time to hit me, stun me, switch weapons and finish me.<br>

<br>
But I can't support moving DF back to what it was before or give them more points to spend training . Do something with LA as a skill that ups the damage out put would work out perfectly . Hell using Elaa's numbers everyone seems to be fighting about SLASH infil are doing 17 % more damage then SB because of the way DW works . How about giving SB a damage bonus to all weapons they use (to cover the two handed crit blades too ) that starts at 5 % bonus and works it way up to 30% at 50 th level ?  that way at 50 th level for no points trained in any skill a SB does 13% more BASE damage then a NS/Infil that spends no points into DW?CD .  <br>
<br>
 Gerbrandt you talk about dragon fang like its a easy style to get . You have to train 495 more points over LA stun style . Yes its not a chain like LAs  But that is a lot of points to spend to get one style . <br>
<br>
Thrust stun style = 1274 training points <br>
LA stun style =779 training points . <br>
<br>
I think the cost differences is because its not a chain .Add to the fact that it is about the only thrust style that is worth a dam  unlike LA .  <br>
