When a Female cleric (highelf) came up to me and challenged me for a duel.<br>
She was my level (I was a level 5 Halfling rogue), but I asked her why she was so anxious to die.<br>
She said &quot;huh? you con white to me...&quot;<br>
I laughed at her and said &quot;so??&quot;<br>
I accepted the duel although everyone around us and even my guild didn't think I would have the smallest chance to win.<br>
<br>
The first spell she casted on me was flash (of light) that blinded me for a minute (nasty). But since I am not stupid I kept moving till I could see again. And as my sight returned she started dying <img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><br>
I kept circeling her, and stabbing her, thereby causing het blows to miss me and her spells to interrupt. The most fun part was the people watching us shout stuff like &quot;woohoo, look that little guy go&quot;.<br>
As she ran low on health she turned her back on me and ran (I had only lost one bulb of health). As she ran away from me I equiped my bow and finished her of with a shot in the back.<br>

He's lvl 23 and I'm 20, but I figured it'd be fun.  So we go over and he binds us up in the stands.  I jump in first and hide.  Then he comes in.  I open up w/ a backstab and it just went down hill from there.  (For him).  I hit him so quickly he couldn't cast.  Whatever he did cast, I resisted.  (Wish I had a runed bone fork, it would have been even better).  Every time he started to cast, I got behind him and bs'd him.  He went down like a CB cent.  I lost a bub to a bub and a half to him total.<br>
<br>
So he comes back, gets his body and we sit around a little longer.  We  decide to try it again, so we jump in and start going at it.  Exact same thing happens, he gets of maybe 3 or 4 casts the whole time.  I resist practically everything and interrupt the rest.  And ever time he casts, he gets knived in the back.  No contest, I only took a bub of dmg.<br>
<br>
For his part, he was a great sport and is a great guy.  We went over to HH and got a PGT later.  He got 185pp and a fire emerald golden bracer for it.  He let me have the bracer to sell so I'd have enough to buy a ravenscale chestguard.  (BTW, if you have a RS CG on Xegony for sale, tell me please!)<br>

I went up against a cleric at 30 each. My daggers sliced him up, proc knocked him down to a nice slow walk. Managed to root me once, I broke it half a second later, game up, and removed his spleen.<br>

Me and a friend of mine decided to dance, there was a considerable level gap but it was more a test session. So sad when he never once got a spell off, used my bow to track his yonders, once he got close enough for my bow to hit, I chased him down as he started lighting up a spell. Backstabbed through his skin, and proceded to blend him until he yondered again... end result?<br>

Clerics however should not be underestimated.  Versus a rogue, we are very prone to their stun line of spells which are very easily channeled through, very fast to cast, and gives them the ability to stick you with blind/root then nuke.<br>
<br>
I would have to say that the melee skill of a cleric are there to finish you off, as most the attacks are going to be offensive magic.  In the arena, a cleric can keep you blinded and feared while sitting and medding for the next nuke/stun.<br>
<br>
So, buff your MR as much as possible in exchange for ac, and use fast daggers to eat up that armour- They are a plate class and still take some time to kill.<br>
<br>
As a cleric, and a rogue, I would probably pick who ever is the highest lvl.  On even /con, I would go for a cleric.  But that is just me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uiildadar.showPublicProfile>Iildadar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/25/00 9:45:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Cliffs/6719/bluestar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics are easy kills</span><hr size=1> I think the Necro would win.<br>

For awhile he didn't respond, but finally we fought.  I was 13 and he was 16.  Perhaps it was dumb because I lost, but I learned a lot.  He wouldn't start until I unhid.  I became impatient and when I tried to rehide, I failed, he rooted me, and before I could move I was down to 50% health because of Smite.  Once I got moving though, I did fairly well.  Took him down 40% before I was rooted again.  These are some things I learned.<br>
-- Fast weapons; I interrupted him a lot, and turns him into a melee fighter.<br>
-- He's a caster who, if he doesn't have his spells on hot keys, that means he using a mouse.  If so, he can't move and cast at the same time.  I got a lot of backstabs in because I think he wasn't using hotkeys.<br>
-- I need more magic resistance<br>
-- I wasn't doing a lot of damage to him, he had bronze armor on, but your damage should come from backstab, while your primary and secondary weapons are used to whittle him down and interrupt.  <br>
-- SoW;  Get it before you fight.  Sneak/hide without it is very slow.<br>
-- Patience<br>
<br>
Question: Can damage from DOT interrupt a caster?<br>
