<br>
I know - it sounds overly simplistic, but think about it.  Instead of rescuing the princess, uncovering the plot, and preventing the war, you get to kidnap her, plant the misleading clues, assassinate her at the right time, and - if you're ambitious enough - take over what you please as the two nations are killing themselves off.  Alternately you can take a more subtle track and play out the good guys go bad sort of story line.  (Shoot me if you like, but I'm still fresh from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Episode II</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  I believe the First Edition Dungeon Master's Guide has more ideas for running evil campaigns.  Give me a day or so to check that...<br>
<br>
For races, it's probably easier to start out with humans, half-elves, half-orcs, and possibly gnomes or halflings.  A good player might be able to pull off an evil dwarf, but going with exotics like dark elves and deep gnomes might be a bit much unless you have ready access to existing source material. Quite a bit of information on the Underdark exists for the Second Edition Forgotten Realms setting if you don't mind looking around a bit.<br>
<br>
As Caowyth said, definitely stick with mostly lawful or neutral evil characters.  These alignments are used to working toward a common goal. One chaotic evil character will be difficult to deal with unless you have a strong leader.  Even then you can expect the chaotic evil character to attempt to assume control of the group at the first opportunity.  If you're comfortable with dealing more with group dynamics rather than focusing primarily on a storyline, you might want to try allowing more chaotic evil characters to the mix...<br>
<br>
Most classes listed in the Player's Handbook are fine.  Evil gods have their clerics, mages and sorcerers pursue their own ends to personal power, fighters take what they want by right of might, and may even be chosen by a dark god as  an anti-paladin (should the GM allow it).  Bards seek to attain a position of influence over a noble, becoming the power behind the throne.  Thieves... well, duh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Just something to keep in mind about evil characters: regardless of the end goal, they are always on the lookout for Number One.  When push comes to shove, they will leave the others to take the heat unless held together by a strong leader or an extensive common background.  I'd recommend the latter.  Loyalty is something lawful evil characters understand and appreciate, but only as long as it can be exploited. <p>Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br>

<br>
I guess the i'm not really sure what i'm looking for, I guess the biggest thing is an adventure or two to help get the dice rolling and to innitiate us all into the evil side of things.  That and I would prefer to have it start in the underdark, but surface would be fine.  And race wise i'd love to have trolls, drow, dark dwarves, illitiads, vampire/undead, hobgoblin, something really differant.  I guess the biggest thing i'm lookin for is a good campain setting (forgoten realms would work fine though) and a few adventures to help get it started, but you all have sparked a few ideas in my head already, thanks! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uswipey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 7:29:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: seeking help on evil parties</span><hr size=1> hmm.. is the party going to be heterogeneous, or homogeneous?  A heterogeneous party will have more trouble justifying and maintaining cohesion.  If theyre all dark elves, or vampires, or undead, thats good. But how will dark elves, ones immersed in their own culture of superiority, for example, treat others?  Not well. Which will cause in party dissention and possibly players killing eachother.  Unless thats what the killed player signed on for, he or she wont enjoy it.<br>
<br>
Traditionally thats why chaotics, and especially chaotic evils, tend to never be great powers.  They dont work and play well with others. They do OK if they have a strong leader, but players wont like having someone placed above them, especially another player.  A possibility would be to set up the party as a &quot;special ops&quot; team for some major (largely offscreen) badguy.  In party murder is kept to a minimum for fear of the consequences when the big bad boss calls the party in for a debriefing.  Raging_Warlord_01 : &quot;He wasn't YOURS to kill, maggot!  He was MINE to use!  And now I cant, because of YOU...&quot;<br>
<br>
Such a &quot;special ops team&quot; setup can be used to overcome a lot of the inherent friction that comes up in heterogeneous groups.  The dark elf may think the troll is little more than an animal, and the wight may look at the DE as a snack (mmm... levels!)  but all of them will restrain themselves far enough to work together, for fear of the boss.  It also allows you to avoid a lot of &quot;how they meet&quot; rigamorole.  Tell each player to make a character with a connection to the boss, and the boss can then connect them to eachother, no matter how disparate they are.<br>
<br>
Every adventure doesnt have to be a BossOp either.  The first, if it goes well, will act as enough to get the PCs together. If the Boss has no missions for them, they can easily get in trouble on their own, and now not just by themselves.<br>
<br>
Eventually, of course, the Bosses plans, for which the PCs are just catspaws and bagmen, will get the PCs in trouble with other bosses.  The Boss may even decide to send them into too much trouble (ie intentionally get them killed) if they seem to be growing in power enough to challenge his authority.  Just because you establish the &quot;Special Ops Team&quot; model to start with doenst, of course, mean you have to keep it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarafain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arafain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 10:49:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://wootage1.homestead.com/files/aoshi2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: seeking help on evil parties</span><hr size=1> A party of mostly Lawful Evils and Neutral Evils tends to make for some very interesting campaigning. <p><b> -- Veteran Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br> -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic<br> -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend<br> --  Formerly of Requiem of Souls<br> -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br></b><i>"Once, in the old west, a gentleman shot a professional gunfighter in the back.

<br>
This can be:<br>
<br>
1) Everyone is lawful evil and there is an accepted &quot;pecking order&quot; within the party<br>
2) Although they are evil in their methods, they are all friends and are the only people in the harsh world that they are sure they can count on<br>
3) They have a powerful patron they are all afraid of<br>
4) They have a strong motive (i.e. revenge on someone who has wronged them) that allows them to subsume any internal conflict until their goal is accomplished<br>
<br>
I used 3 &amp; 4 in my own evil PC campaign.  Notes on the first three sessions are here... the campaign is now on hiatus as the central character is moving away... a lesson not to base too much on one character.<br>

We have one Hobgoblin Ranger.<br>
<br>
One Half-Dragon/Hobgoblin Sorcerer.<br>
<br>
One Blue(thats a psionic goblin) Psionic Knight<br>
<br>
And one Elven Wizard(regular High Elf, but demented, and masqerading as a drow for campaign smoothness).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Right now, the group is trying to establish a hideout/outpost for their Hobgoblin tribe in a Commonlands type region.<br>
<br>
They have a few NPC goblins are &quot;hireling&quot; types, and are basically going about in &quot;marauder&quot; fashion.  i.e. they don't build a lair, they find something elses lair, kill it, and move in.<br>
<br>
When the last session ended, they were ass deep in a ruined tower that a necromancer was using for a hideout. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 2:24:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: seeking help on evil parties</span><hr size=1> I agree with Cordo about cohesion though.

The easiest way to make for an interesting encounter is to have the party brawl each other at the end of a module.  Usually this will happen on its own without DM interference provided the players are sort of greedy.  Just toss some kick arse magic item in at the end like &quot;The Helm of Flamefire&quot; (Player now has the breathweapon of a red dragon 1/day) or whatever suits your taste and campaign.  Watch as the players struggle to decide who gets it, usually there will be people willing to brawl over it.  After the fight to the death you now have something substantial to base your campaign on..inter-party rivalry!<br>

One thing to note about Evil, and I have played a few in otherwise good campaigns, is that subtlety is really where its at. Evil does not have to mean maniacal laughter. Friendly, helpful, trustable.... these are the qualities of the successful evildoer. Take a look at Darth Maul. Now take a look at Palpatine. Which one of these two is going to be Emperor of the Galaxy?<br>
<br>
Be insidious. Be persuasive. Appear to be Good. Do good things... where people can see. Become above reproach.

Players cannot get too greedy and work against each other, else no one has fun.  <br>
<br>
A key concept to help avoid this is making sure your evil players are part of an organized faction that has rules and deadly enforcement of the rules.  And, if they don't want to start out as part of a bad guy organization like the Zhentarim(sp) you should make it clear that they will either need to be very careful or join up. Its always good to have someone the party works for, a boss.  Should probly never be the big boss, if you know what i mean.  <br>
<br>
Also, when your players are climbing the ladder of evil, make sure they are well effected by the lesser evil beings beneath them (dog eat dog sorta thing).<br>
<br>
Have a good purpose to being evil.  Players can get a lot of kicks out of just doing things they can't do in real life (e.g. sick fantasy)  but i would curb this as much as possible.  One way is to make sure they are always busy and probably need to keep a low profile, unless the job calls for general mayhem.  The starting a war theme is a good idea.  <br>
<br>
Don't make the good guys too strong or too weak.  This may be the hardest part.  I've made both mistakes and they ruined the game if you ask me.  Too powerful good guys demoralize the players because they get the feeling you are unfairly making sure the 'good always wins' thing happens.  Too weak of good guys makes you players so bludthirsty they become hard to control.  <br>
<br>
Remember that the good guys never want to outright kill the bad guys unless its a pitched battle.  Good guys are all about taking prisoners and that silly thing called justice.  Justice systems are always fallable.<br>
<br>
Bad characters always want to go after the big names in the realm.  'hey! that elminster bloke aint so tough, a few bad asses like outselves can take em out!'  Try to avoid this at all costs, unless you yourself hates the character.  Then by all means off him.  And if characters do feel like offing big time npc's make sure they realize they are walking targets for people seeking revenge.<br>
