Thiryn runs out of the SK guild and goes along a ledge around the poor area. It's easy to pick him off there. Watch out for the blue guards(at 60), you will need invis to get past them.<br>

killed Thiryn yesterday and he wasnt up today about 15 - 20 hours later so I'm guessing either someone else killed him on T Marr or hes got a long spawn time. going to check on him again tonight.<br>

[Sat Dec 08 15:13:44 2001] You say, 'Hail, Captain L`Rei'<br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:13:44 2001] Captain L`Rei narrows his eyes sharply to the Gnome standing before him, his lip giving a gentle curl of his unveiled irritation. 'By your abrupt and careless approach, I see that you have yet to become acquainted with the ways of the [Primordial Malice]. Such an offense shall be disregarded by an outsider only once, and be grateful that it was I and not [his grace] to whom you presented such audacity.' <br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:13:59 2001] You say, 'who is his grace'<br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:13:59 2001] Captain L`Rei says ''The Archon, Mardeus N'Vidi, is our sovereign leader. He is the one who gathered us when Innoruuk condemned the Dark Lady. However, you are an outsider to us and it would not be wise to approach him. He is our loyalty, our faith, our distrust, and the voice of Malice.' <br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:07 2001] You say, 'what primordial malice'<br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:07 2001] Captain L`Rei releases the soft hint of irritation from his features and briefly waves an armored hand toward the camp. 'We are the Primordial Malice. A group of loyal servants dedicated to the [restoration of our Dark Lady], Lanys T'Vyl, and the preservation of her irreplaceable glory through the burning spite that binds our loyalty. Though we are few when compared to our enemy and this small temple is all we have retained after the Dark Lady's loss, our faith and the strength of our blades are not to be trifled with.' <br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:16 2001] You say, 'what restoration of our dark lady'<br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:16 2001] Captain L`Rei smirks darkly from the corner of his lips and shakes his head gently. 'Such information is not privileged to outsiders. However, you seem to retain some interest in us and given our numbers and the [Call of Malice] that guides us, we are always willing to extend our sermon to those who would heed the call. Perhaps you would be of a mind to attempt to [prove yourself to our ranks] and in turn for your success, devotion, and sacrifices. . . the call may seek you.' <br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:20 2001] You say, 'what call of malice'<br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:20 2001] Captain L`Rei closes his eyes and bows his head briefly as if in recognition of something sacred before quickly returning his eye to Booker. 'The Call is not for my voice to speak, nor is it for your ears to receive. When and if the Call beckons, you shall know it as no other.' <br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:32 2001] You say, 'i wish to prove myself to the ranks'<br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:14:33 2001] Captain L`Rei says ''We shall judge your actions as they come to us, Booker. Seek out Xjari V'Iyr within the camp and give her this letter. It is my recommendation for your trials.' <br>

You are most fortunate to be considered for these trials, outsider. However, do not think for a moment that your collective tasks will be of any ease. Take this message to Izera N'Kar. She can be found in the southern desert during the evening hours. She will provide further commands as to your duties. And mind her well, outsider, for she is equally as deadly with her poisoned dagger as she is knowledgeable in her art.' <br>

Though perhaps. . . just perhaps that deafness can be rendered though there is only one way to know for certain. Captain Lrei shall run you through the trials, should you wish to emerge from the bliss of blinding ignorance to a more invigorating truth.' <br>

[Sat Dec 08 15:16:12 2001] You say, 'Hail, Navariz Tas`Rel'<br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:16:13 2001] Navariz Tas`Rel nods their head deeply in a polite and well-mannered greeting, 'Greetings, Booker. Welcome to the temple of the Primordial Malice. I see that the call has yet to find you, but do not allow this to discourage you from seeking a greater understanding and acceptance into our most devout of ways. The call will come when you are prepared to listen for it. Until then, seek our Captain, for he shall guide you in our ways if you so choose to seek them.' <br>

[Sat Dec 08 15:16:32 2001] Archon Mardeus N`Vidi narrows his eyes in a very quick and brief study of Booker, his bitterly emotionless demeanor unchanged as he speaks in a calm, dark tone, 'We are not impressed by your presumptuous behavior, outsider. The arrogant and obtuse are blindly bold to approach the anointed Archon when the Malice that he governs has yet to find it suitable for a grant of trust. Both characteristics that you have exampled are unwelcome in our domain. Move along, Booker. Continue your search for the Call in modesty and obedience. Perhaps then you may find yourself at our service in due time.' <br>
[Sat Dec 08 15:16:34 2001] Acolyte Xjari V`Iyr begins to cast a spell.<br>

Go now, outsider, and continue your little existence. Only when the call has pierced the very essence of your being shall you be embraced to us.' <br>

<br>
I can confirm that both High Priest I'Xar and Vazern Ith'Salar or whatever his last name is both drop the imbued night ember sphere. I spent three hours trying to get one of them single. They are somehow linked to the other dragoons so when i thought i had a nice clean tag i would suddenly get a 941 point harm touch from the general and see 2-3 goons running after me at sow speed.<br>
<br>
The trick is to wait until they all start wandering around killing things. I was forced to zone the second time and when i came back i found Vazern wandering with a dragoon. I was surprised to find Vazern at only half life. I waited for them to walk in opposite directions and when Vazern was alone i quickly killed him.<br>
<br>
Tracker would be very very very very very useful or someone who can feign death for this part of the quest.<br>
<br>
I popped it in the solvent of preservation from Xjari and got the new thing. The solvent container was not consumed so im going to try a combine later on in it. <br>
<br>
Here is where i got lost.<br>
<br>
I turned in the sphere to Izera but i only got one powdered night ember back. Has this happened to everyone? I had plenty of slots she just only gave me one.<br>
<br>
I spent the last two hours killing in CC but i havent got the crystallized web silk yet which is required for the first combine.<br>
