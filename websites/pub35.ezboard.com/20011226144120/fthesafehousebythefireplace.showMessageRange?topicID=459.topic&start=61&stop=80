The soft rays of sunshine poured in through the octogonal window above his bed.<br>
He groaned and pulled the threadbare sheets over his head.<br>
Dacrin walked over and promptly poured a cup of hot water over his wound.<br>
Xvar barely managed to stifle a scream, his nails digging into the bedposts. <br>
&quot;Still hurts eh?&quot; Dacrin said with a laugh.<br>
Xvar's other, unwounded leg flew through the air stopping 1/2 an inch from Dacrin, who stood there stunned for a second.<br>
Xvar panted, wiping the sweat off his brow, then pushing his hair out of his eyes.<br>
Dacrin fell over, sitting on the wooden boards he stared at the dozing Xvar.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;How -- How did he do that? I didn't even see his leg until it stopped!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Dacrin scooted back a foot or two then slowly got up.<br>
Jerra burst through the door, grinning ear to ear, holding up a small boar.<br>
&quot;Nice catch!&quot; Dacrin said smiling.<br>
Jerra smiled then walked over to Xvar, patting his head and moving his hair out of his face.<br>
&quot;He's a strange kid...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, he's got uncanny abilities as well...&quot; Dacrin said, recalling Xvar's speed in kicks.<br>
Jerra happily prepared a fire for the boar carcas as Dacrin went over to his desk, beginning to sketch something out the window.<br>
Xvar was soon roused by a gentler sense, he smelt the boar cooking. The smell edged it's way into his dreams, then eventually pulled him out of them, beckoning him to awake.<br>
&quot;Hungry?&quot; Jerra said to Xvar, who now stood in his underwear yawning.<br>
Dacrin threw Xvar's cloak and pants at him and laughed.<br>
&quot;Not used to havin' a lady in the house eh?&quot;<br>
Xvar put his pants on and walked over to the table.<br>
&quot;I'd like to thank you for your hospitality and binding my wounds.&quot;<br>
&quot;Not a problem at all!&quot; Jerra said.<br>
Dacrin smiled, &quot;Hey, you're one of the saviors, it's the least we can do.&quot;<br>
Xvar didn't respond.<br>
Jerra sensed the tension in Xvar's body language and handed him a piece of fruit.<br>
&quot;The boar won't be done for awhile, but here, this is good too.&quot;<br>
Xvar thanked her and chewed on the tenuous dried fruit.<br>
&quot;Do either of you know who Yurd or Serhan are?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yurd Irwan and Serhan Salleigh?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, Yurd Irwan Sr. is the best blacksmith in Faydark, maybe in Norrath itself, but Yurd Irwan Jr. is a total obnoxious jerk. The Yurds have ties to many different nobles since they are so rich from their blacksmithing, or so I've heard... And I don't know much about Serhan, just that all of the Salleighs are very good archers...&quot;<br>
&quot;Why do you ask, Xvar?&quot;<br>
&quot;No reason.&quot;<br>
Dacrin raised an eyebrow and mouthed some words to Jerra, &quot;I bet he likes Serhan.&quot;<br>
&quot;Have you ever met them?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, both.&quot;<br>
&quot;Let me guess, Yurd made an ass of himself?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, I made an ass of him. He implied me and Serhan were flirting, threw a punch, so I threw him into a hay cart.&quot;<br>
Dacrin laughed out loudly, &quot;Haha!&quot;<br>
Jerra gigled and tended to the meat.<br>
&quot;So Xvar, why did you fight?&quot;<br>
Xvar wondered that himself sometimes, he knew Dacrin was refering to the war against the orcs...<br>
&quot;It's the only thing I know how to do.&quot;<br>
Dacrin was silenced by Xvar's unyielding expression of distance.<br>
The boar tasted wonderful.<br>

Well, I don't know... I do want to revision Scout Saga, close up some loop holes, add some more characther details, then probably combine it and this one into a single book. I expect Xvar's Saga to be longer then Sett's was, but we'll just have to see.<br>
If I was offered publishing, I'll tell you right now, I don't see how I could turn it down. But since no one has offered yet, still stuck in second gear.<br>

Xvar didn't hear them the first time, he was looking out the window to the market below.<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, all we know is you're a savior... Mind telling us a little about you?&quot;<br>
Xvar didn't see any need to withhold his past, so he sat down on the edge of the bed and recounted his life.<br>
&quot;My full name is Xvarian Dashard. I was born into a small colony. Since I was born, fighting has been the focus of my life. I came to Kelethin when I was 9 to continue training with the masters of this area. I've lived here since then.&quot;<br>
&quot;Didn't you miss your parents?&quot;<br>
&quot;I didn't have any. In the colony family was important, but we were all selected from birth by the Council to become fighters. If the parents refused, the child was killed. Mine were coerced into letting me go. I never met them. But I did have several friends before I left. Olar, Unic, Jaes...&quot;<br>
Dacrin was fascinated by Xvar's casual attitude about his unusual life. Jerra was equally intriuged and asked the next question, &quot;Why'd you leave?&quot;<br>
&quot;The best of every troop gets to leave and train here.&quot;<br>
&quot;How'd you train?&quot; Dacrin interupted.<br>
&quot;They sent us into Crushbone, and when I was 12 they sent us into Lesser Faydark.&quot;<br>
Dacrin and Jerra looked stunned and apauled.<br>
&quot;How could they make you do that!? Didn't some of you die?&quot;<br>
&quot;We had to be strong. For the colony.&quot;<br>
&quot;But why didn't you go back?&quot;<br>
&quot;After the war with the orcs I went to study under Coriard, I knew it would be allowed. But they haven't tried to make me come back yet.&quot;<br>
&quot;What colony are you talking about?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's a hidden city, far from here.&quot;<br>
&quot;But it must be horrible there! Why doesn't anyone try to escape!?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's not horrible for everyone. The soldiers are taken from the babies of the poor, and they are saved from a destitue life. The scribes and merchants are choosen from the middle class, keeping it strong. And the nobles are a wise dynasty. Soldiers can retire, but most don't. None can complain, the option is there.&quot;<br>
&quot;What is it a colony from?&quot;<br>
&quot;Long ago, before our lifetimes, a proud and noble kingdom stood with the strongest of Norrath. Our leaders were fair and just, and the land was ruled with peace. No utopia, but far greater then any kingdoms. But the king was tricked, and killed. The kingdom split, into the colony, the loyal who ran away and tried to start again, and the rebels, who wanted to stay, but not unite with the new ruler. The rebels are the true heros, they were all killed. We must live our lives as best we can, to make up for our folly. They were the truely loyal, and everyday we regret our choice to leave. So we must become strong again, and reclaim the land. And so I fight.&quot;<br>
Dacrin blinked, amazed that this had been hidden in the complicated folds of history.<br>
Xvar turned away and continued looking out the window, down at the market below....<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
&lt;AUTHOR BLIRB&gt;<br>
Well took me long enough to tell you his history I guess, but I felt it was better hidden up to this point.... Anyway... Hope you enjoyed it. <p><B>Koz.</B>

Xvar, or Xvarian has two seperate pronounciations.<br>

Or one where the X is pronouced like a Z, like in Xena, which would be Zvar, or Zvarian.<br>

&quot;Where are you going?&quot;<br>
&quot;To the market.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why? We have food he-&quot;<br>
Jerra elbowed him and widened her eyes, Dacrin promptly silenced himself.<br>
Xvar also secured his dagger, standing up and limping slightly.<br>
Dacrin opened his mouth, but Jerra elbowed him even harder.<br>
Dacrin cursed and rubbed his arm.<br>
Xvar bowed, &quot;I will return shortly. I thank you.&quot;<br>
Dacrin scratched his head, &quot;He really is a wierd kid.&quot;<br>
Jerra elbowed him so hard he fell off his chair.<br>
Xvar chuckled, bowed to Jerra, then left.<br>
<br>
As he reached the market he glanced around for Serhan, she was nowhere to be seen. He sat on the roof of an empty stand looking down at the forrest below.<br>
Another man sat down next to him.<br>
&quot;You've already figured out who Coriard really is, haven't you? Did you tell anyone who you are?&quot;<br>
&quot;I knew ever since I heard his name.&quot;<br>
&quot;Indeed, that 'ard' must've been a tip off.&quot;<br>
&quot;I was starting to get worried you had lost track of me since the war, I wasn't being informed on a normal basis.&quot;<br>
&quot;We've been very busy you know.&quot;<br>
&quot;I understand.&quot;<br>
&quot;Coriard was wrong about who was after you.&quot;<br>
Xvar looked over at him suprised, &quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;That crime band was long gone. You know who it is.&quot;<br>
&quot;How did you find out?&quot;<br>
&quot;We have our ways, you know that. They'll be after you again soon.&quot;<br>
&quot;I believed him too, I was going to go to the guild in Butcher Blok.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's good you were interupted.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, it would've been a great waste of time.&quot;<br>
&quot;The heat is starting to build Xvar, soon you may have to return.&quot;<br>
&quot;I thought you could handle it.&quot;<br>
The other man chuckled, stood up, bowed, then cloaked.<br>
&quot;I will report back as soon as I can.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
Xvar sighed again, thinking to himself, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;So, they've finally rebuilt. I had no idea. This is getting harder to handle... Bad timing...&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Xvar saw Serhan in his mind, thinking about who he was, and what would happen if he were to pursue her.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;What bitter conflict love and hate creates, just as harsh on the heart as war is on the body!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
He stood, his clothes waving in the wind, his hair brushed out of his face by wind's gentle hand.<br>
&quot;Like a blade upon my neck does draw time, slow and painful,and no time creeps by like that which is weighed with sorrow! How she humbles me!&quot;<br>

Tyu and Farren went from the barracks to the training hall often. It was a rectangular room, no windows to the ground far above and no kind of flooring to protect them from the rocky ground of the cave.<br>
On the far side to the enterance from the barracks were the climbing walls, which went close to the surface of the ground and must've been at least 40 feet high.<br>
All sorts of weapons were organized by difficulty on a table on the left from the doorway.<br>
On the far side of the hall targets for knive throwing and archey stood.<br>
There were various other training devices at different stations, which were carved further into the wall, some of them up to 20 feet from the main hall.<br>
On the cieling a long piece of wood, ropes, and cargo nets lined it, allowing students to try their hand at a more difficult and dangerous climb. <br>
Tyu picked up some weights and went into the water room, which was the third on the right from the main enterence.<br>
Farren immeadiately went to the caster room, meditating and scribing any new spells that had been found.<br>
At least another 300 students worked on their skills as well.<br>
A tall, stout barbarian entered the hall from the farside, through a door that was usually locked.<br>
As soon as he did, everyone stopped ran to the sides of a carpet that ran from one door to the other and bowed out of respect.<br>
The barbarian grinned and encouraged the younger students and bowed with respect to the elders.<br>
&quot;Tyu! Farren!&quot; He called.<br>
Tyu stood, soaking wet with wieghts tied around his ankles, he slowly walked in front of the barbarian and knelt. Farren walked over and knelt as well, raising their heads as he spoke, &quot;Congradulations on killing Coriard. Now we only have a few loose ends to tie, am I correct?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Farren said, looking down.<br>
Both lowered their heads as the barbarian's face tightened slightly, he looked skeptical, &quot;Now, what was the problem with Xvarian? Our estimated are seldom wrong, how could such great discrepencies appear?&quot;<br>
&quot;My lord, Xvarian trained under Ssssir Coriard, hissss training was excellent, far more then anything we could have anticipated...&quot;<br>
&quot;I understand, I will send a new scout to try and gauge his strength. Then we will see about a mission for you two. In the mean time, I want you to both train non-stop.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; Farren and Tyu said synonimously.<br>
&quot;Thank you. Alright everyone, back to your training, time waits for no man!&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; all the students shouted with a note of pride in their voices.<br>
The barbarian smiled then walked back to the door, shutting it gently.<br>
The students dispersed back into their activities.<br>

The house had been completely dashed, everything either destroyed or out of place. Even some of the furniture was broken...<br>
Xvar walked by them imperviously and picked up his armor, strapping it on and putting on his backpack. He strolled to the corpse, kicked it over, then leaned down, pulling the table cloth over the man's face.<br>
&quot;A robber?&quot;<br>
Dacrin nodded. Xvar ripped a strip of the table cloth off and went over to Dacrin, tying it around his arm tightly.<br>
He walked to Jerra, pulling her up and looking her in the eyes, &quot;Tunare forgives you, worry not, she does not cry over a robber's death -- you shouldn't either. I must leave, if you wish, you may accompany me, I'm not even going to feign wanting to do this alone. At this point, I don't need to. But I warn you, if you leave that doorway after me, you may never enter it again. By my hand, or their's, or Tunare's herself -- matters not.&quot;<br>
Dacrin stood up, his face became firm.<br>
&quot;I will go with you.&quot;<br>
Jerra walked forward, looking just as intense, &quot;I will too.&quot;<br>
Xvar didn't doubt her abilities, or that of Dacrin, but knew he had to tell and warn them, &quot;I travel fast, if you can't keep up you'll die. I fight without mercy, if you fight with me you'll die. I die without hesitation, if you try and stop me you'll die. Understood?&quot;<br>
Dacrin and Jerra nodded, they gave one last look back at their mangled home, pulled thier backpacks to their shoulders and followed Xvar out the doorway...<br>

The barbarian put down the tome he was reading and stood from his chair, &quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
&quot;You know the scout we had stationed in Kelethin?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, did he gauge Xvar's strength?&quot;<br>
&quot;He didn't arrive at the rondeview point...&quot; the messanger trailed off and his gaze reached the floor.<br>
Aftar scratched his chin, &quot;I'm sure Xvar must realize who we are by now...&quot;<br>
&quot;But who is he?&quot;<br>
&quot;Summon Farren and Tyu, Karok too... I don't quite trust those two to get the job done.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes milord.&quot;<br>
When Tyu and Farren entered the room, Aftar and Karok were already talking. As soon as the door opened, both silenced and looked to Tyu and Farren.<br>
&quot;I have found out who he is milord Aftar.&quot; Karok said.<br>
Aftar sat in his chair, folding his hands he looked at Karok expectantly, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br>
&quot;He's one of the Dashard.&quot;<br>
Aftar didn't look surprised, &quot;Makes sense... You've all been breifed on the Coriard and Dashard families?&quot;<br>
Tyu and Farren shook their heads, Farren spoke, &quot;No milord, who are they?&quot;<br>
Aftar leaned back in his chair, as if looking through the solid rock to the moon far above, &quot;The Coriard family was originally the royal family of Dakanolard, but they were murdered and a new ruler took over. This was several hundreds of years ago, so most of it was lost, even among the Dakans. However, it is rumored that one of the sons of Coriard left Dakanolard before the new rule took over, he had several sons, the lineage can be traced down to the last survivers, Quetra, Sett, and Darcy. Quetra's son, Sett was killed. As was Quetra... Dacry never had a son, or at least none we know of. Xvar didn't know of the Coriard lineage at all I expect, after the Dakans exodus to the colony, I doubt it would've been remembered. But often, the 'ard' on the end of a name points to Dakan lineage. Xvar must've known Dacry was Dakan, but probably had no idea that he's a royal desendent. But, he might have figured it out -- who knows, the kid has brains.&quot;<br>
&quot;So what was Xvar even doing in Faydark?&quot;<br>
&quot;The Dashard family are the decendents of the imperial guard, all sons of this family are sent out to become masters of the fighting arts. If they don't return they are considered unworthy and their memory defiled. If they do, they are great heros.&quot;<br>
Karok nodded, Tyu and Farren looked a bit lost.<br>
&quot;Now listen closely:<br>
Dacry might have had the medallion, Quetra didn't. Now if he died it's logical to assume Xvar might have it. Therefore I won't waste time persuading him -- do it with your blades, understood?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why do we want this medallion so badly milord?&quot;<br>
&quot;It holds the key to our cause, now go.&quot;<br>
Karok bowed and cloaked.<br>
Farren and Tyu looked at Aftar who spoke slowly, &quot;I want you two to go after Xvar. If you fail Karok will finish it.&quot;<br>
Farren and Tyu bowed and cloaked, then left the room as well.<br>
Aftar flipped through the pages of his book, thinking to himself, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;One last obstacle prevents my well planned checkmate, that damn knight. Ahh well, we shall soon rid him.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><B>Koz.</B>

You may have along way to go with your story, but your skills as a writer are as great or greater than many published and highly praised authors. If you were to compile all of these posts into a book I would DEFINETLY buy it.<br>

He followed close behind Tyu and Farren, he could see them both, cloaked or not.<br>
He made no sound, not even his breath, heartbeat, or step could be detected. Tyu and Farren had no idea he was there.<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
They walked through Kelethin's surrounding forests, it was late morning, or early afternoon. The sun barely reached through the tall conifers, making the woods chill.<br>
&quot;Where do we go Xvar?&quot;<br>
&quot;To the outpost, a place for the Dashard to assemble outside the colony. They'll be able to give us better equipment, a place to rest, rations, and some information on who we're facing...&quot;<br>
Jerra couldn't help but to interupt, &quot;Who are we fighting?&quot;<br>
&quot;Right now it's best if you don't know. Much safer for you both, just trust me, when we reach the outpost they'll tell us all the details.&quot;<br>
Xvar was walking at a steady pace, both Jerra and Dacrin managed to keep up easily.<br>
&quot;I expect that the robber was no robber, but in fact a scout looking for me. I also expect by now it's realized we have fleed and they'll soon be on pursuit.&quot;<br>
Jerra nodded, she knew how to track, and how to walk so she couldn't be tracked. Dacrin had always been more of a warrior then a ranger or rogue, but he managed to keep his tracks covered as well.<br>
Xvar walked normally, nothing unusual or noticable about his gait. But when his feet left the ground, you could see not even a blade of grass had been displaced.<br>
Jerra had been watching Xvar's feet for an hour, totally entranced with them and his technique.<br>
&quot;Xvar?&quot; she inquired.<br>
&quot;Hmmm? Yes? What is it?&quot; Xvar said impatiently.<br>
&quot;Where'd you learn to walk like that?&quot;<br>
Xvar chuckled, &quot;The walk of a cat is hard to learn, but very useful. They taught us the technique then during the fall they'd make us walk through piles of leaves without making the slightest noise. Very few pass that test... But I managed to make it...&quot;<br>
Jerra's eyes widened, &quot;Think you could teach me?&quot;<br>
Xvar nodded, &quot;Yes, but let's keep going for now, I don't have time to explain it.&quot;<br>
&quot;You're right, let's go.&quot;<br>
&quot;Xvar?&quot;<br>
Xvar sighed but answered, &quot;Yes?!&quot;<br>
&quot;Why do you wear that lock of hair? Who is it from?&quot;<br>
Xvar stopped as if yanked backward suddenly.<br>
He stuttered, &quot;No -- no reason, now let's go...&quot;<br>
Dacrin shrugged at Jerra and they continued....<br>

Killing a daemon single handedly isn't something that's looked over so fast. It was on Kelethin's news message board. Tacked up with a rusty nail:<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Xvar defeated daemon alone!<br>
Saved half the forest! Xvar suffered only a small daemon mark, and is being taken care of by Jerra Caetyr and Dacrin Caetyr.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
They found the scout at Dacrin and Jerra's home.<br>
&quot;No wonder he never reported in.&quot; Farren said coldly.<br>
Tyu looked around, seeing if Xvar had left behind anything.<br>
The picture that Xvar had taken from Coriard's chest had fallen out of the backpack, and sat near the bed.<br>
Tyu leaned over and picked it up. It was a rough charcoal sketch of a man's face.<br>
&quot;Issss thisss one of the Coriardssss or Dassshardssss?&quot;<br>
Farren looked it over, &quot;Not sure, let's keep it and bring it back to Aftar. Hmmm... They must've already left, trying to evade us.&quot;<br>
Farren picked up one of Xvar's blood and sweat soaked bandages and threw it at Tyu.<br>
Tyu grabbed it in mid air, and carefully sniffed it.<br>
&quot;Think you can track him?&quot;<br>
&quot;They can hide footprintssss, but not their sssssmellssss.&quot;<br>
Farren smirked, pulling the sheet off the dead scout.<br>
&quot;Hmm... he was killed by an axe, see that triangular gash?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yessss, without a doubt. You ssssupossse those two caretakerssss have joined up with him?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes. Xvar uses a dagger, never an axe. He must be getting help.&quot;<br>
Tyu nodded and continued sniffing.<br>
Farren yawned, he put his hand up above his head and blew a small hole in the roof, levitating through it.<br>
&quot;Sssshow off.&quot;<br>
Tyu jumped through it and stood, his back arced and his nose high in the air.<br>
Farren tapped his foot impatiently.<br>
&quot;Ssssshhhhh.&quot;<br>
Farren rolled his eyes, &quot;Can you smell him or not?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yessss... Get out the map, I want to check ssssomething...&quot;<br>
Farren pulled the small leather map out of his belt pouch.<br>
Tyu glanced it over, his finger skirting a trail on the map.<br>
&quot;I know where they're going....&quot;<br>

&quot;It's not far, see those cliffs?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah....&quot;<br>
&quot;We simply have to climb them, at the top is a cave enterance, then we go down those stairs into the door chamber, then to the main chamber...&quot;<br>
&quot;Wait a second... How are we going to climb those cliffs?&quot;<br>
Xvar smirked, &quot;You'll see...&quot;<br>
Jerra looked over at Dacrin, who's eyes were about as wide, and mouth gaping just the same.<br>
Dacrin put his hand up to his forehead and shook his head, sighing.<br>
&quot;Remind me why I decided to follow some invincible rogue with a death wish to go fight some other seeming invincible force to the death?&quot;<br>
Xvar smiled, &quot;I'm flattered.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Sssshould we go to the outpossst or give Aftar the picture?&quot;<br>
&quot;I have a better idea. KAROK!&quot;<br>
Karok uncloaked, he had been standing only 3 ft away.<br>
&quot;Well, my estimates of your distance were off, but no matter. Go give this to Aftar, it was in Xvar's possesion.&quot;<br>
Karok took the picture then jumped off the platform, cloaking half way down.<br>
&quot;Good, that will rid us of him for awhile at least.&quot;<br>
&quot;Killing two birdsss with one sssstone eh?&quot;<br>
Farren chuckled, &quot;Let's get moving, they're probably already there.&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Jerra looked up at the cliff, her head tilted back so far she nearly fell over. The cliffs were at least 200 feet, a dark gray color, maybe granite. They had walked so far from Kelethin she couldn't see the familiar smoke coming from Kelethin's warm fires. She shivered a little pulling her collar up. The cliffs were devoid of any trees or plants and were straight up.<br>
Xvar walked to a specific section of rock, pulled a peg out of his backpack and thrust it into a small hole in the rock.<br>
&quot;We have to climb it like that?!&quot; Jerra yelled.<br>
Suddenly the rock began to lower, then it suddenly plumeted.<br>
Xvar stepped on the flat section now on the ground and waved them on too.<br>
&quot;Dakans always find a creative solution.&quot; Xvar said.<br>
He reached down and pulled out the peg.<br>
&quot;If I were you, I wouldn't look down.&quot;<br>
Jerra and Dacrin exchanged looks of pure terror, Xvar's face was blank, but a smirk soon crept onto it.<br>
The rock began to rise, slowly returning to it's original position when about 30 feet from the top it jumped. Shooting them all up the last 20 feet or so at a high speed.<br>
When they reached the top Xvar yawned and walked off the rock toward a cave.<br>
Jerra and Dacrin stood like statues. Xvar turned around, sighed, and walked over.<br>
He yanked them both by the collar and dragged them to the cave.<br>
Both were still completely statue like, but slowly Jerra's eyes moved to Dacrin, and Dacrin's to Jerra.<br>
Xvar grinned cheerfully, &quot;If you thought that was fun wait until you see the stairs to the door chamber...&quot;<br>
They promptly fainted, falling to the ground and kicking up a little dust.<br>
 Xvar shrugged, &quot;I was only kidding you guys...&quot;<br>

---------------------------------------------------------<br>
Dacrin and Jerra managed to regain their senses and stumble down the stairs with the help of a small guard rail and Xvar.<br>
The door chamber was a circular room carved out of solid rock, it's formation was obviously unnatural. A large wooden door was directly in front of them. A small slot about eye level flew open as soon ans Xvar knocked.<br>
&quot;Password.&quot;<br>
Xvar spoke in a tongue they had never heard, &quot;Yliac dashard nonrantaska.&quot;<br>
The slot closed and they heard the sound of a man quickly fumbling to unlock and open the door.<br>
&quot;Xvar!&quot; The man shouted and embraced Xvar.<br>
Xvar smiled and gripped his shoulder.<br>
He spoke in the dakan tongue telling the man who Jerra and Dacrin were.<br>
The man ran up to them and bowed, thanking them in dakan.<br>
Jerra looked to Dacrin who looked just as confused.<br>
Xvar smiled, &quot;If you're hungry the doorkeeper tells me the lunch will be ready soon.&quot;<br>
Jerra smiled and said, &quot;That sounds lovely, C'mon Dacrin.&quot;<br>
Dacrin had been leaning on the wall, he stood up and came through the door.<br>
Xvar noticed the blood from Dacrin's gash was starting to soak through his shirt.<br>
He spoke to the doorkeeper in dakan, pointing to Dacrin's arm.<br>
The doorkeeper nodded and pulled Dacrin left to the bandaging room.<br>
Xvar showed Jerra to the right, they walked through a long rectangular corridor. At the end they entered a room with eight other doors, each with a carved wooden sign above it in dakan.<br>
Xvar pointed to the one second on the left and read the sign, &quot;Ration Hall.&quot;<br>
Jerra ran her hands along the rock corridor, it was smooth and grey.<br>
They entered a lightened large chamber. It was immense, at least 20 tables lined the chamber in rows. Each could seat 10 Jerra estimated.<br>
On the far side from the doorway a long table stood, behind it was the door to another room where she could hear people cooking.<br>
Some soldiers filed in from the door behind them. Xvar lead Jerra to a table and asked her if she wanted anything to eat.<br>
She nodded and he went to the long table where another man took his order, ran back into the kitchen, grabbed two plates of food and handed them to Xvar.<br>
Xvar sat down opposite to Jerra and she watched him as he ate.<br>
It tasted like boar and roots and maybe some kind of vegetable. The vegetable was something she had never tasted and she asked about it.<br>
&quot;It is grow on the surface near the outpost. It's called iko. Very good for you.&quot;<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Milord Aftar, this was found at where Xvar had been staying. We think he might have been carrying it.&quot;<br>
Aftar examined the picture closely holding it near a candle.<br>
His eyes slowly widened as he realized who it was.<br>
Karok looked impatient.<br>
&quot;This is worse then I thought.&quot; Aftar scribbled something on a piece of paper then handed it to Karok.<br>
&quot;Give this to Tyu and Farren.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes milord!&quot;<br>
&quot;Go! NOW!&quot;<br>
Karok pulled his cloak over him and ran back to Tyu and Farren.<br>
Before he left the room Aftar shouted to him, &quot;Get another teleport, it's fast.&quot;<br>
&quot;I shall sir!&quot;<br>

If he dropped the picture at the caretaker's house he couldn't have shown it to anyone at the outpost... But still... What if he recognized it, he knew Coriard well, and Sett as well... I'm sure the picture must've looked at least familiar. But what if he didn't recognize it... I will hope for the latter, but I must take the appropriate precautions. He must not tell the colony who we are... Not yet...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
Aftar leaned back in his chair, consumed with his thoughts, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> For now we'll just have to dispense of him as soon as we possibly can... There may be no threat, but I can't afford to take such a gamble. Karok will be able to handle it if Farren and Tyu falter. If all else fails I'm sure we can work something out... I know this is the true path for the world. I know Tunare will understand the sacrifice we all must make to help the world become as it should be... I only hope I have the strength to carry out this plan....</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
Aftar sighed and stood, &quot;I should go check on the soldiers...&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Jerra watched Xvar as he ate, looking him over with curiousity.<br>
Xvar noticed and looked up, expecting a question. Jerra commented on the food instead, &quot;This is really good!&quot; <br>
Xvar chuckled, &quot;It's alright.&quot;<br>
Jerra kept looking over at Xvar, who was getting self consious. He finally looked her straight in the eyes and asked her what she was so interested in.<br>
She apoligised, &quot;I'm sorry, you've just got an interesting face...&quot;<br>
Xvar's eyebrow rose but he looked away at some rucuss of a couple soldiers.<br>
The lock of hair came out of his tunic as he turned his head.<br>
&quot;Xvar, please tell me, where's that lock of hair from.&quot;<br>
Xvar's face became cold and stern. He crammed it back in his tunic and continued eating.<br>
Jerra was a little surprised but went back to eating as well.<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Boy, what's his problem? He never talks about that lock of hair. Maybe he lost someone, hard to see him falling in love with anyone but I guess it's possible.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
Jerra played with her food a little but was to lost in thought to be hungry.<br>
----------------------------------------------<br>
Serhan walked to the edge of the platform, looking to the east, wondering what Xvar was doing.<br>
She whispered, &quot;Xvar...&quot; then walked back into the market crowd.<br>
---------<br>
Xvar leaned back in his chair, looking up at the cave roof,<br>
&quot;Serhan...&quot;<br>
Jerra saw him mouth the word and her eyes widened, realizing who's lock of hair it was... <p><B>Koz.</B>

They ran panting through the malevolent storm, Farren wiped sweat and rain off his brow then drew his hood tighter closed. <br>
&quot;We can't travel through this, it's foolish. Even if we get there we will be unfit to battle.&quot;<br>
Tyu stopped and nodded. The rain didn't bother him, but he shivered at the cold.<br>
&quot;I can not go long without ssssome ssssort of sssunlight or warmth. Much longer and my abilities will be greatly affected...&quot;<br>
Farren nodded, rain dripping off his hood to his nose. They looked around seeing nothing but trees, no foreseeable clearing or village within at least 10 miles.<br>
&quot;I can't ssssmell over the damp mosssss, it'ssss to ssstrong for me.&quot;<br>
Farren shook his hood a little.<br>
A small winding smoke plume floated just over the trees to the east. It looked to be fairly close.<br>
Farren pointed to it, Tyu looked and nodded as they both ran toward it.<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
Xvar took Jerra to visit Dacrin.<br>
Several medics bustled around the various beds in the bandaging room.<br>
Xvar looked on curiously at several badly wounded soldiers. He remarked in dakan to the head medic.<br>
The medic barked several loud orders at others then looked to Xvar, solemnly explaining what happened.<br>
Jerra tugged on Xvar's sleeve, &quot;What happened to those guys? And where is Dacrin?&quot;<br>
&quot;Dacrin is on that stretcher, see?&quot;<br>
Jerra looked past the medics and saw Dacrin sitting comfortably on the edge of a cot.<br>
Jerra inquired about his treatment.<br>
He showed her the well bandaged wound and said, &quot;It's wonderful, they use some vegetable called iko to heal me. See that medic over there? He speaks some elvish.&quot;<br>
Jerra looked over her shoulder, since Dacrin had been facing the wall. She spied a wood elf looking medic leaning over a wounded trainee.<br>
Xvar walked up and commented on the soldiers, &quot;They just had a training exercise. Someone made a miscalculation and many suffered as a result.&quot;<br>
Jerra frowned, &quot;That's terrible, why send them out on such a mission if the risk is that great?&quot;<br>
Xvar sat on the cot, away from Jerra and Dacrin looking at the soldiers, he opened his mouth as if to speak, but instead sighed. He stood up and looked away, &quot;Stay as long as you need Jerra, but let Dacrin rest, the medic told me the blood loss was bad enough that he should get some extra time to recuperate.&quot;<br>
Xvar then walked out of the bandaging hall.<br>
Jerra looked to Dacrin, &quot;He's so completely shut away.&quot;<br>
Dacrin nodded, &quot;Sometimes a man must be far gone from his sorrows to be strong in a time of turmoil. But no man is so far gone from his sorrows that he is gone from the world that causes them. And I believe it's starting to catch up with Xvar...&quot;<br>
