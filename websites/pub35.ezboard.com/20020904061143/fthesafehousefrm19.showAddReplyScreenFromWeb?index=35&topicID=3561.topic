I attempted to use a simple example so you would get it.  The analogy is perfectly valid and I find it hilarious that you attempt to deflect the obvious issue of your complete lack of ethical compass by throwing in useless trivia about the Germans losing WWII and spouting about communism.<br>
<br>
As I said before, if I have to explain it you won't understand it anyway, and you've proven me right.<br>
<br>
Let me explain it another way.  This is a game.  The challenge is in playing on an even playing field with other people with your skill (not your wallet) as the deciding factor.  There is no challenge in bending the rules so that you have an unfair advantage over those people.  Just because the designers of the game didn't think of every possible way someone could exploit design issues to their advantage doesn't make using those design issues to gain advantage right.  Your attempt to defend what is clearly ethically undefendable is absurd.<br>
<br>
<br>
To answer your question directly, here's what you violated.<br>
<br>
Prohibited Conduct<br>
12. Abuse or exploit bugs, undocumented features, design errors or problems in the game collectively referred to as Problems...<br>
16. Engage in any behavior that is contrary to the 'spirit of the game' as defined by Mythic in its sole discretion.<br>
<br>
<br>
You're clearly exploiting a bug and/or design error so you violated the first one.  You're clearly violating the &quot;spirit of the game&quot;.  If you don't believe Mythic thinks this is a violation of the spirit of the game, ask them and let them answer for themselves.<br>
<br>
If you truly believe that the &quot;spirit of the game&quot; includes the contest being decided by how many PCs you can afford or how many characters you can control simultaneously for maximum advantage then you're completely confused and further explanation on this topic isn't going to get through.<br>
<br>
I'm done.  Flame away. <p>Sanlail Swiftpaw

<br>
Buff bots make infiltrators much more powerful then a SB + buff bot can be, they have extra buffs midgard doesnt.<br>
<br>
Dont try to blame SB's on getting people nerfed because of buff bots, more infil's use them by far that I know at least on ym server. Dunno how this got turned on SB somehow. If this is the case why havent infiltrators been nerfed then? They are way more badass buffed then any SB ever was or will be.<br>

The post isnt about shadowblades buff botting - you need to take a break from the anti infiltrator crusade for a few minutes.  Its about EVERYBODY buff botting, and infiltrators who do it are bound to get the class smacked down eventually.  Its also not an issue of what realm has better buffs.<br>
<br>
You posted a log of a 330ish doublefrost vs an orange con.  We know you are botted so we can discount it, but what about the zillions of other shadowblades who bot that we dont know about?  If you get a big enough percentage of botters, the class is going to look overpowered to everybody else(look at your own skewed view of infiltrators, almost as bad as mine was with shadowblades) - and a buff botted SB was the in thing to be for a good while there.  Wouldnt be at all stunned it that's indirectly part of the reason why Doublefrost type styles, and one shotting get nerfed.  Infiltrators will likely get hit some time too now that they are the flavor of the month assassin and everybody rolls up one.<br>
<br>
Last night i was running around groupless, with no buffs.  I landed 3 less than 300 damage perfs to neutral targets in 50 epic armor(i am 63 thrust 54 CS).  My evade chain on a 50 nightshade was hitting for 100ish per style (for crying out loud leaper caps 314 for me, and hamstring at like 306).  Was hitting 50 blademasters for 90's on some garrots, which caps at 269ish for me.  Tried to kill a 50 warrior a few nights ago unbuffed also - perfed for 400, then dragonfang stunned and did the chain (except rib sep got parried), and still lost with the warrior at 15%.  Really, im not overpowered as a class here.  Lets insert a buff bot though:<br>
<br>
Now those less than 300 perfs become 400-600 perfs cause my weapskill went from 1010 to 1350<br>
<br>
My evade chain vs the nightshade does a good 200 per style<br>
<br>
My garrots do close to 200 vs that blademaster<br>
<br>
That 50 warrior takes a 650 damage perf, and 250's on the evade style, not to mention i have 400 extra hp to just tank him with.  My evade rate goes up too with the added dex and quick, so I could just forget having to perf.<br>
<br>
Now im overpowered.  If enough people do this, my class will look overpowered, and that isnt a good thing cause you get nerf bandwagons.  Imo infs are just harder to nerf than SB's, without hitting the other classess, so mythic just hasnt come up with a creative scheme to do it yet.  <br>

<br>
I re-read your post, I was on auto SB defense, you didn't blame SB's per say, I was wrong. Sorry.<br>
<br>
<br>
Few SB's on pellinor are quitting because of the unbelievable power of the two resident slash infiltrators there(me included). It literally is a waste of time to even try to fight when they are around, no matter our buffs, we are going down hard, with no chance of winning. they simply hit way harder and have much heavier envenom.<br>
<br>
Ill be gone from the boards soon anyway, silly to stick with boards when you not playing the game. DAOC was fun, they could have made RvR a magnificant thing, but their biased idiotic, one dimensional thinking screws it up for most people.<br>
<br>
takes me 4 to 6 rounds to kill a caster when I am unbuffed, including perf/cd using left axe, think about that.(twice, kobenator, lurikeen eldritch). that just isnt right.<br>

It sucks just as bad going against a 90% buff botted asssasssin population.<br>
<br>
Hell, i chased a level 46 buff botted SB down once, had 30 % endurance left, with him starting at 60% health and no end, and STILL lost even though i started with 100% health.<br>
<br>
Its sick, and a poor representation of the class.  Normal shadowblades dont mainhand / offhand for 100+ unbuffed.  Normal SB's dont have 1700+ hp.  Normal SB's dont cap on 2h perfs every time.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately normal assassins have had to step aside to l33t d00Ds and thier bots so they can pwn stuff with a flavor of the month class.<br>

I am not a l33t dude either, and I use a buff bot, I work hard, and I just dont want to play a game at a huge disadvantage, my bot was a character my guild developed, because we were so small. Since now no mater what I do, I am at a huge disadvantage, it is pointless to play.<br>

Hello!<br>
 <br>
 I don't know if this is the right place to send this, but I hope you can get this message to the people who can do something about it.<br>
 <br>
 Many players in DAoC now use a secondary account for the purpose of creating a character to enhance their primary account. This would be fine if both accounts are played but many are just using the second account to &quot;buff&quot; their first character then sit in a portal keep safely away from harm.<br>
 <br>
 Impact on the game is three fold..<br>
  <br>
  First the players that do not &quot;buff bot&quot; meet a super human character on the battlefield and are promptly killed. They then complain about how powerful xxx class is to customer support and on boards around the Internet. <br>
 <br>
 Second impact is some players who worked hard on their characters that are killed by &quot;buff botted&quot; supermen loose interest in the game since they can see no way to compete with this. They blame mythic for it, and move on to other games mainly because they could not compete with all the &quot;buff botted&quot; supermen showing up in rvr. <br>
 <br>
 Third impact is that more and more people that create the support classes that are used for buff bots, find that they are not needed in rvr as much as they should be because they did not spec high enough in buffing to do a better job than the bott. most of the support classes don't have a lot of offense ability so they go into healing as their only true choice to be of value in rvr and feel trapped into doing so.<br>
 <br>
 Solutions..<br>
 <br>
 I have thought on this for over 2 weeks. I cant see any reason why people should not be able to do buff bots. It's their money and they are paying to play the game. I also don't think reducing the effect of buffs will help.. since no mater how much they are reduced, the ones with buff bots will still hold that edge over the rest, no matter how small. Where the issue is really hurting the game is in rvr, so that is the main focus for this fix.<br>
 <br>
 *** In the portal keeps place an NPC &quot;Sister Julie&quot; that is available to cast buffs on anyone who is willing to &quot;donate&quot; a small tithe of 5gp or so, for 30 min of buffs. (Not concentration based but timer based so she don't have to worry about a concentration pool) <br>
Buffs cast for the donation should be ..baseline AF ..baseline Dex ..baseline Con ..baseline Str ..specline Str/Con ..specline Dex/Qui ..specline AF ***<br>
 <br>
 The impact this will have is that of leveling the playing field for all players who wish to RvR. It does not nerf the buff bot players since their buffs are longer concentration based and free.<br>
 <br>
 As for the three problems.. the first one where you meet a superman that kills you will not be so common, if you get your buffs before going out. And rvr combat will last longer which is what many people were looking for.<br>
<br>
  The second one where people who worked hard on their character are leaving.. they may leave but it will not be because some buffed superman was bullying them around on their server. They will have the same ability to buff up for rvr and go out with their classes strengths and see what they can do.<br>
 <br>
 The third problem of support classes being trapped into healing roles in rvr.. don't really change. Sad but for support classes this solution will not make specializing in &quot;part buffs and part something else&quot; any more useful than before. It will allow them more time to heal their group though, since the members will have more hit points and be tougher to take down.<br>
 <br>
 Sorry about any spelling errors, I hope this made sense?<br>
 <br>
 Thanks for reading!<br>

Lots of people quit, ebayed, taking a break, started Bolds, or went to the PVP test server. At this point I consider myself lucky if I am in a full group with 1 class that can heal. Even luckier if it's a healer and we actually have aoe mez. This means in full groups I will have between 0-2 buffs. When I am scouting and meet anouther groups scout I bet they are fully buffed up. They ussually drop 4-5 buffs if I win. The objection to buff-bots is they give an unfair advantage, and I understand that concern. We have healers and Shamans showing up in the top 25 for rps earned in the last 7days from BG's. This means we really don't have alot of healers and shamans on the battle field. So generally we are unbuffed. So if we find the rare chance where we meet even numbers, we would need a bot to even have simular buffs.<br>

<br>
Whats the point, you know if you kill someone it was your buffs and not you that really earnt the kill, unless your an uber rp whore i don't see how anyone can get any fun or satisfaction out of using a buffbot. DAOC is unchallenging enough as it is without further reducing the &quot;skill&quot; factor.<br>
<br>
A simple solution to the quasi cheats would be to make buffs dependent on being grouped with the buffer, leave the group, you lose your buffs. Buffbotters who are clearly motivated by gettin phat rps will then have to group with their bot and find their rps cut in half to reflect the fact that their buffs are doing most of the work. <br>

  <br>
 Ok I can understand this solution, yet I passed it up because many of the buff bot crowd will do exactly what you said. They will group with their Bot. <br>
 <br>
 You are thinking that cutting their RP in 1/2 will stop them from using a bot. But I feel that winning every fight easily is more important to them than 1/2 the RPs. <br>
 <br>
 The only solution I can see right now is to level the playing field, so that players buffed by bots get &quot;little to no advantage&quot; over players buffed by the clergy at the portal keep for 5 gold.<br>
 <br>
 I hope you understand what I am trying to say?<br>

How is running a second account cheating or exploiting a bug? Makes no sense.<br>

If mythic thought that it was violating the spirit of the game, then why haven't they done anything about it?<br>
<br>
I am not flaming you, I am just trying to make you understand that your perception or interpretation of something isn't necessarily the way it is. I run 2 accounts, just started my second as a matter of fact. No way is that cheating. I like having 8 characters now on the same server because I would hate to start over on another and be broke again. I like playing several dif character classes. About buffbots, I don't have one yet, but I do plan to run a druid with my hero or warden so that I can XP without the headache of pickup groups when noone from my Guild is on.  <br>
<br>
If you are so ethical, then you better not accept another buff from anyone, because you might run into someone that does not have any buffs on so that would be unfair or &quot;cheating&quot; as you say. While we are at it, you better only stick to killing people of even con as you, because if you kill someone lower than you, that is ruining the &quot;spirit of the game.&quot; If you do any of the above, you Mr. Ethical are a hypocrit.<br>

<br>
For the following reasons:<br>
Enhance charachters cater for the playstyle where you buff others and play little direct role.  This is a legitimate (though uncomon) playstyle and is evinced by thoes who have partners who buff them then craft (to say its cheating to accept buffs from your wife is a failure to understand the  social nature of the game).  As such it is not a design flaw but a deliberate way of playing the charachter.  So the way in which buffs work is deliberate.<br>
<br>
There is a long standing tradition in MMORPGs of 2 boxing, many of the most skilled and sucessfull players 2 box if not buff bots then runspeed bots, if not runspeed then heal bots (this is a slightly diferent issue).  This is because to put the Massive into MMORPG you need to design the game to be fun for people who are not much good at computer games (and thank Mythic it remains fun or assassins would have precious few targets).  So the chalenge for the more skilled / more driven is to play 2 toons (again buff bots are not realy played but its part of the argument that 2 boxing is an anticipated feature of the design).<br>
<br>
Buff bots are a common way for a guild to aleviate the lack of a dedicated buffer, there is a tradition of guild resources by which organization a guild can achieve dominance.  This is not about a guild of 'wealthy' people but of dedicated and organized people.  Split the cost of an extra account 8 ways and its pennys per week on what is already an extreemly cheap hobby.  Obtaining (or giving) assistance from your guild or alliance is part of the 'spirit of the game'.<br>
<br>
The extensive use of buff bots has caused it to become a *part of the game* especialy for soloists.  It is Mythic's game and they will set the rules.  If they choose to criple buff bots then so be it but until then I'll play by the community's rules and the 'spirit of the game' as defined by the players in general.<br>
<br>
All that said I respect your decision to play the game the way you want to play and wish you the best of luck.  It is partly for similar sentiments that I choose not to continue to level my buffbot, L23 gives me the oportunity to have a fight where I would normaly stay hidden and a fighting chance against buffed oponants.<br>

That is the problem.. those spec lines are useless right now against a fully buff bot player.<br>

 The idea I have put through was to try and level the playing field a bit so that buff bots would not be so attractive as to give such a big advantage. If not.. more people will start buff bots and you will have the same thing where the non-full enhance spec types are useless. Anyone not willing to buff bot will quit the game and move on since they cant fairly compete.<br>

What I meant was that although the buffs currently available from the real players, aren't so great now, they aren't COMPLETELY useless.  Which is what they would be if we had a universal use buff bot in the PK.<br>
<br>
&quot;No thanks, don't buff me.  I'll just go get some uber buffs from the lil' cutie in the corner there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the idea.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ushennelofeverquest.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shennel of Everquest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/24/02 9:31:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3561.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's a Buff Bot worth?</span><hr size=1> Brandyn,<br>
Those buffs are indeed useless if you meet a fully buff bot player. And that is what is happening more and more. A lot of people are turning to buff bots. And more will follow, those that do not will leave.<br>
 <br>
 If nothing is done soon, that is how it will be.<br>
 <br>
 My idea will level the playing field a bit so that buff bots are not so attractive and also give option to those that will leave due to not being able to keep up with &quot;Mr.bots&quot;.<br>
 <br>
