an L50 SB Perfed me for 1071dmg standing [AF98 armor 20% Bonus, 100% Qua].<br>
<br>
The same SB Perfed me for 996dmg standing when I was 48 and he was 49.<br>
<br>
Where Perf is concerned, SBs ownz. <br>
<br>
But if the SB misses the Perf, then gud luck SB.<br>
<br>
But yeah, trying to land the Creeping using a 2H is absurd/near impossible.<br>
<br>
To the poster who said to switch to dual weapons after 2H Perf, sorry, it won't work.<br>
<br>
Perforate [2H timer starts]<br>
Switch Weapons [hotkey]<br>
2H timer continues to tick down<br>
2H timer continues to tick down<br>
Creeping Death [1H timer starts]<br>
1H timer continues to tick down<br>
Stunning Stab.<br>
<br>
Switching weapons does not change the previous weapon-timer. That's why using Staves to Perf is not my cup'o'tea. The Timer for the Staff is still active after I switch weapons [same for 2H weapons].<br>
<br>
CD will always be a b!tch to land for 2H Critblades, but kudos to those who can. It's not easy.<br>
<br>
BTW, I'm a NS, and no, I don't b!tch about the SB who perfed me. He's good. I got more to learn. that's all. <p><fontcolor="cornflowerblue"><i>Tiejinnie<br>

I never have had a problem landing creeping death since the /stick fixes.<br>

Before that I used to have to use a snare on my 2 hander to get it off, but now I just hit /stick and hit sprint and No Problem.<br>
I can Creeping death targets running right at me and through me.<br>

Of course, I think they lowered the to hit bonus on creeping death in another stealth nerf.<br>
It gets Evaded or blocked alot lately.<br>

OK, here I go again. reading thru all the posts on sb nerfs again. and they are claiming how being able to use 2hs free of training is not an advantage due to the fact that one shotting is gone. omg. (still wishing to use a 2hthruster).<br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<br>
Hey bro stop arguing that way. In fact its not arguing. First to yourself:<br>
1. make lvl 50<br>
2. fight as lvl50 sb<br>
3. do some serious RvR as 50 sb<br>
4. then show me, what a 2h is worth today together with crit skill.<br>
---<br>
Ok now back:<br>
1. Talking about assassin vs assassin is pointless, as our targets are not assassins, but all others (Still Sbs are in the melee realm and should own all other assassins but dont).<br>
2. Ignore pain negates PAs.<br>
3. 2h perfs against chain is a joke (with 39+11 crit skill, I perf chain wearers for app. 197-320 hp)<br>
4. Using 2h against other melee classes, even after successfull pa is a joke too (all other melees i met had ignore pain at least - 18 realm points nearly negate 594+ skill points for perf+CD)<br>
5. The points you used to raise crit skill are lost for overall damage output after your opening (even as it should be different in theory, I simply outdamage myself over time when doing la styles with 24 la, 39 sword than i do to 39 crit, 39 sword). Not to mention I apply more poisons in my la battles. Ohh did i say, that I proc more often, when using two 1h weapons?<br>
6. When using 2h I cant kill a caster, when he survived my pa combo. When not speccing la I lack the skill to melee a caster fast enough to stop him from casting. So, when using two hander, I have to go the 5-skill way. Now start counting, how much skill points i can put in my other skills. 5 sec delay against casters kills me (they simply cast in between). 5sec delay slash weapon against another melee fighter (always talking bout even conn) with Ignore pain kills me everytime,... So it all comes down to play russian roulette, when using two hander as a sb (successfull perf or not). Winning this way is no option (at least for me), cuz when i choose a target, I want to win and go ahead. I dont want to rely on my luck.<br>
<br>
And to all the Critblades who do use 2h and do GREAT. Cudos and please tell me how you do against each other class.<br>

<br>
I dislike seeing this sort of stuff (no offence to the poster ).  one shot are still alive and well, you just can't stay stealthed.  I am still getting one shotted and I am still one shotting, you just need to pick your targets better.  <br>
<br>
What does this mean?  If you can do more damage in that one shot than another in a keep raid or some other insatnce you are at a great advantage because you can leave the scene of the crime faster and increase your chance of survival.<br>
<br>
It is great to jump on a keep wall and perf someone and jump of whilst your victim dies without anyone getting a target on you.  One shot is often all you get in these circumstances so doing it better is a great bonus.  This should not be overlooked.<br>

In keep attacks and/or defense a 2h still rules to kill the pesky archers or casters, while his mates dont watch him closely. But the effect is reduced by the optional resser close by or behind =/<br>

I really think that the Left Axe nerf really sucks and I feel for you SB's that created your template around LA, but I was wondering if it's viable to spec less in LA and more in poisons.  I read a lot on these boards that there is not enough points for poisons because you have to spec LA, but since LA has been reduced to CD/DW, would it be better to spec more in poisons than LA?<br>
For Example:<br>
<br>
Stealth: 37<br>
Sword/Axe: 39<br>
Left Axe: 15<br>
Crit Strike:  44<br>
Envenom:  37<br>
<br>
Is this type of template possible for an SB?  Would it be viable?  Has anybody tried it? <p>Bloodreign<br>

It's those keep rangers I hate who keep hitting me when I'm about a mile away from the keep <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

Is this type of template possible for an SB? Would it be viable? Has anybody tried it? <br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
I consider your template viable, in fact it is close to mine. Still i would drop crit, to get 21+ la for scathing blade, to complete la chain (i get the full chain off quite often with 24 base la).<br>
<br>
That template has a great advantage: You are versatile and you have alot of options to play with. But be aware: most tanks kill you, even most blue tanks. But you will do very good overall and your on the safe side, upon any additional mythic change to the game. <br>
<br>
I myself will risk going for la completly, as la was nerfed (true), but I know form several tests with friends, that la chains were in fact upped in dmg. <p>--- <BR>

<br>
I noticed alot of posts where sb`s were hitting pa cd and a garrot or more befor thinking of switching. my way doesn`t give a faster time on cd for sure and if I typed it wrong forgive me, what it does is let you get moving faster after cd.<br>
and this is all under the asumption you can sneak ur ass up to em for the pa so the 1st weapon delay is negated then 5 sec for cd then to your faster weapon delay after cd <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A> at: 6/3/02 9:31:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gerbrandt>Gerbrandt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/3/02 10:11:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3434.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: . my 2h strategies ....</span><hr size=1> Heya Mithar,<br>
<br>
am just telling what I do, even though i do not know, if you can do better....<br>
<br>
First to my equipment:<br>
- I have 2 prepoisened 2h swords on me (disease and snare)<br>
- I have my main set of 1h sword and left axe prepoisoned with DoT and debuff<br>
- I have a backup set of 1h sword and 1h left axe prepoisoned with DoT and debuff<br>
- i have df bought helmet instead of epic helm on, I use df bought sleeves (crit mod) on first hit.<br>
--<br>
<br>
When i pick a victim in a group of enemies (like one standing on top of mg, the others standing at bottom), I use my 2h sword, with disease on it. I line up normally in front and use my hotkeys 2 (perf), 3 switch to 1h sword, 4 stick, 5 switch to left axe, 6 Creeping death<br>
I wait if CD is successfull. If it was successfull I hit 7 for SS and switch to my melee-la hotkey bar. The key here is disease to stop heals. If it doesnt go too well, i jump to other side of mg and stealth asap to the woods to hide from anyone with TS, in any other case I try to get some more hits off, till it is time to jump to safety. In case you did well and luck was with you, you get your rps upon restealth, when poison DoT finished your victim =P. The key here is some luck on perf (drives enemies mad, when you pick em one by one =P )<br>
<br>
When I pick archers or exspect a 1vs1 or 1vs2, I use my snare prepoisoned 2h sword. Either do the combo mentioned, or do your perf, sprint anead of your enemy and restealth. I seldomly use the last option, as it gives your victim time to think, to prepare and yell for mates. Whereas, when you hit him and stay on him, he messes around with his keyboard, trying to enter combat mode asap, leaving no time to call for help. By the time he fights back, he already has: snare, DoT and debuff on him. I switch to my epic sleeves (its like a heal by its const bonus and I do not need the crit mod from df sleeves any more) and to timourous drakulv gloves (for la bonus. yeah, only 3 pts more la and 7 str more, but imho worth it). By the time I have the armour switched, I already switch weapons to my 2nd set of sword/la, to reapply that nifty DoT/debuff combo.<br>
<br>
If my enemy looks too strong, I open battle from stealth with my necklace (2 charges of DoT) and do perf asap thereafter.<br>
<br>
Should i fight a moving cloth caster, I no longer perf: I simply switch to my two 1h weapons, sprint to him and start with la styles, pressing sprint if he moves too fast.<br>
<br>
If the caster is standing, I of course perf him as needed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . <p>--- <BR>

   I had originally decided to make my sb a critblade. Then I learned more about L-A. And, had decided to make a 5-spec soulblade.<br>
   Now, post-1.50, etc...I just got so tired of trying to keep up with Mythic's changes that I went back to my original plan; a hi-enven critblade. My spec thoughts were:<br>
Stl 35<br>
Sw 44<br>
Env 33<br>
Crit 45<br>
L-A 8<br>
   I know there's spec #'s I could shuffle here and there. And, I may. But, I will still finish it as a hi-env critblade. I will continue to use the 'hit &amp; run' snare method I've been using unless a better attack pattern presents itself. I just wasn't too sure how it'll work in the real RvR. SB is currently 30th. <br>
   I hope I find some success. If it doesn't work, and, I don't like it; I will simply cancel or sell the account.<br>

  I switch from 2h to 1h as I run through people. I don't auto-stick my target as I approach for the PA. Or, If I do, I run forward changing wpns after the strike. Even when the PA fails, I have already achieved seperation and I make a very quick decision on whether or not I want to turn around and re-engage with my 1h.

<br>
two hand, one hand, no hands, if you perf first, you win.<br>
<br>
regular melee, 2 hand SB will lose, every single time, to a competant slash assasin.<br>
<br>
<br>
using a two hander, a caster has enough time to quickcast a stun on you because of the delay as well, if they survive, other classes have time to do a  whole lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 handers are good for one thing, one shotting, thats it.<br>
<br>
Most SB's would gladly lose 2 handed weapons, it is mostly used as an excuse by the man to keep us down.<br>
<br>
as far as perfs, NS/infiltrators can have huge perfs too if they crit, fact of life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 9:31:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3434.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 hand weapons and SB`s</span><hr size=1> thanks for the ideas guys was helpful. my infil just hit his mini ay lvl 42 last night. I have an odd work schedule that seems to make me play when no one else is on so i tend to solo a ton, as such I am currently going with dodger and master of pain for ra`s with see hid then later was thinking going master of stealth last but now looking at ignore pain.<br>
 I mini`d and decided to hit df to grab a grave since it just opened, some kind soul was asking me about my guild so( stealthed) I stop to type a reply when Ghastly a 48+ sb pops into view, send half a message turn to attack( big mistake) ghastly hits me with a pa with the biggest dam meat cleaver i have ever seen ploop down i go lol I was pissed. at lvl 42 i have 107 con and 904ish hp`s this guy hit me like a ton of bricks. my dam fault for turning to engage but i hadn`t caught the name due to typing or i hope i would have turned and ran like hell lol!!!<br>
 definently going to switch to more of a kite type poisoning, being lvl 42 all i ever fight is red to me it seems so I ned to find a way to knock em down( so time to switch back to the old shadow knight tactics of yor)<br>
<br>
 last a question--- this is a sb point of view as going for high envenom, if i trained LA to 2 for the 1st style and used it just as a way to (hopefully) lay 2 poisons in the 2nd round of combat, would it work alot or miss a ton due to it being a low style, I was thinking going high ax/poison 35ish stealth for this set up and la at 2ish<br>
