I was shunned by a couple of parties who were more worried about their loot, than their kills, so I decided to venture out on my own.   <BR>    <BR> As you well know, running around by myself, a little Dark Elf Rogue, is not the best of ideas.  I ran from West Commons towards the town called Freeport.  I am not very welcome there, but I had a friend on an island in the Ocean of Tears whom I was hoping to accompany, so I attempted the trip.   <BR>    <BR> The boat trip was tedious, but short, as I hopped off early, deciding to refresh myself with a swim in the cool waters.  Luckily, there was no rain, as is the usual around here, and I ended up on an island abound with nasty green little monsters that I hear called Isle Goblins.  I size up a few, and although small, they seem seasoned enough to hurt this little rogue.  I decided to play it safe, and I hid behind sand dunes during my trip around this island.   <BR>    <BR> I finally caught a glimpse of my destination, Stone Isle.  It is a dreary and forbidding island, if ever I saw one.  Chills course up and down my spine as I thoughtfully consider the inhabitants of this dreadful place.  I catch a glimpse of moving bone on the horizon.  I quickly realize that this is a dreaded Greater Skeleton.  The skeleton reels in pain, and turns around, ready to fight.  I decide to wander closer to see what had happened to this skeleton.   <BR>    <BR> As I near the fighting skeleton, the sound of heavy beating of wings shakes the ground.  Unearthly grunts and growls reach my ear as I realize that this skeleton is being crushed by an unnatural creature called a Gargoyle.  I had only heard of such creatures, and I paused to ponder the magnificience of such a magical beast.   <BR>    <BR> Watching the efficiency of this gargoyle made me think that I shouldn't be too close when this skeleton was dispatched, so I quietly made my way to the last location that my friend had been.   <BR>    <BR> I took a few steps, and I was passed by a blur of fur.  No longer had I realized that a floating wolf had just overtaken, and passed, me, when my skin grew clammy, and fear wracked my soul.  A huge ghost wielding a scythe passed right through me, in pursuit of this strange wolf.   <BR>    <BR> My heart told me to run.  My curiosity said follow.  I followed.  I climbed over the crest of a steep hill, and I was enthralled.  There before me were several of these floating wolves, and they were dispatching the island of the huge Specter that had just passed me.  Magic and steel plunged into the specter as he tore the wolves asunder with his great scythe, and tossed magic of his own at the intruding wolf pack.   <BR>    <BR> The efficiency of the pack of animals was too much for the Specter as he writhed in pain, and fell to the ground.  He had been put out of his half-dead existence, and I felt relieved that these majestic wolves had triumphed.   <BR>    <BR> I ran over to congratulate them.  They laughed at my naivete, and I could tell that they were only tolerating my presence.  I bowed out with a flourish, and wandered over to, what appeared to be, a safe area to rest and relax while I waited for my friend.   <BR>    <BR> Suddenly, I hear a laugh nearby that sent a chill through my being.  Hopping up, I see another Great Skeleton not 50 yards away from me.  I nock an arrow and let fly.  It was a true hit as a rib of the skeleton went flying.  We bear down upon each other, and a fierce battle ensues.  &quot;Dodge, parry, thrust.&quot;  The words of my old fencing instructor run through my head as I comply with his direction.  There were times when I could almost hear his voice, and this was one of them.  The skeleton had the advantage of height, and a heavier blade, and I was battered very quickly.  I fell to the ground, unconsious, when a warm glow passed though my whole body.  A stranger had completely healed me, and I was ready to fight some more.   <BR>    <BR> With a new fierceness, I proceded to stab the skeleton as best as I could.  My muscles swelled with a strength they had never before possessed.  I was shocked as thorns grew out of my skin.  I felt wonderful!  With the magical aid, I dispatched the skeleton with great ease.   <BR>    <BR> I turned around to thank my benefactor.  It came as a great surprise when I find that I had been aided by the same floating wolf that had been chased by the specter.   <BR>    <BR> &quot;Good job, little one.  I apologize for scaring you like I did.  Please, hunt next my party, and we shall offer you our aid, and protection.&quot;   <BR>    <BR> Several more spells were cast upon me, and I felt more powerful than I ever had in my existance, and I felt my injuries mending themselves at a much faster rate.   <BR>    <BR> Immediately, I started clearing the island of every skeleton that I could find.  I was battered, and bruised, but my wounds healed faster than the skeletons could injure me.  I fought for long periods of time, never getting winded, and tired.  I felt like a heroine in the tales that my grandmother used to tell me.   <BR>    <BR> After a short time, there were no more skeletons to dispatch.  It seemed as though I had extinguished the island of the foul beasts.  Unfortunately, it also seemed as though the gargoyles had greatly increased their numbers, as though they had heard about the little rogue who was clearing out their island of the undead intruders.   <BR>    <BR> Seeing as how I had been destroying what was clearly an enemy to the gargoyles, they still gave me threatening glances, as if daring me to come closer.  Unfortunately, I didn't know the area very well, and as I crested a hill top, I ran face to face with one of these giant animated chunks of stone.   <BR>    <BR> He let out a cry that sent me running.  I could feel the wind off his wings as he took swing after swing at me.  Summoning all of my strength, I ran as fast as I could to my benefactors.  Turning to my chaser, I steeled myself for combat.  All of the air in my little frame was expelled as the gargoyle slammed his stone fist into my gut.  Unable to breath, the gargoyle continued to pound my little frame.   <BR>    <BR> As yet, the wolf pack had done nothing to save me, as they had a specter on its way to their position.  I took it upon myself, and my enchanted prowess, to destroy this magical being.   <BR>    <BR> The blows of my spear bounced harmlessly off the gargoyle, so I changed my weapons.  I tossed my spear, and drew my only two magical weapons: A Dragoon's Dirk, and a Chrysknife.  My daggers flew with a magical speed as I drove them into anything that they could hit.  I impaled the gargoyle's hand as he took a swing at my head.  I stabbed him in the chest as he attempted to knock me off my feet.  He hit me harder than I had ever been hit before in my life, but my magical regeneration kept me alive, albeit barely.   <BR>    <BR> Both the gargoyle and I were on our last breath when I noticed that he was missing me with his every shot.  I was recovering my health quickly, and he was losing his just as quick.  In a last ditch attempt at victory, he struck me with a backhand, and almost knocked me unconsious.  My vision was blurred, and I was greatly stunned.  The gargoyle, sensing my weakness, continued to pound my battered frame with everything he had.  We were both terribly hurt.  He was missing large chunks of rock, as a reminder of where my daggers had found their marks.  My right eye was destroyed, and I could barely stand up, from the beating that I had taken.  My life was almost over.  I pulled together my last bit of energy, and with a weak yell, I dove at the gargoyle, daggers pointed at the foul beast.   <BR>    <BR> The next thing I remember, the pack of wolves were moving all around me.  My body was terribly battered, and I couldn't move my left arm.     <BR>    <BR> I hear a voice, &quot;I'm sorry, little one.  I couldn't help you, as I was indesposed.  I am impressed with your achievement.  One of your age would do much better to avoid these beasts, much less attempt to battle them.&quot;     <BR>    <BR> I tried to get up to thank him, and found that the gargoyle had fallen on my arm, pinning me to the ground.  It took three of the wolves to push the gargoyle off of me, so I could stand.   <BR>    <BR> As soon as I stood, I grew faint, and sat down to rest, all the while being magically healed.  My crushed arm mended.  My broken leg straightened.  A dent in my forehead disappeared, and my nose stopped bleeding.   <BR>    <BR> Within moments, I was completely healed, and I was ready to start battling again, but as the sun crested the horizon, I realized that today was my birthday.  Today, I turned 16.   <BR>    <BR> Nflyte - 16 DE Backscratcher   <BR> &quot;My, my...  That leather armor has to be itchy.  Turn around, and I'll give you a good backscratch.&quot; <BR>  <BR> ** Thanks, Ralluwen.  I fixed the scimitar inconsistency. ** <BR>  <BR> More to come as I wander around Norrath. :cD <p></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/unflyteribsplitter.showPublicProfile>NFlyte Ribsplitter</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 1/21/00 10:54:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uralluwen.showPublicProfile>Ralluwen</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/20/00 1:56:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The day I turned 16.</span><hr size=1> Good story, don't mean to rain on your parade but the spectres wield scythes, not scimitars, but nonetheless an entertaining story, keep up the good work! <p><B>Ralluwen Shadowstar</B><BR>
