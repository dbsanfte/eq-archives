The new price for a 3-month subscription will be $35.85 and a 6-month subscription will now be $65.70. <br><br>You don't have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires. <br><br><br>HOWEVER, for a limited time only (through April 24, 2002), you may extend your current subscription for an additional 12 or 24 months by signing up for the new EQ 12 or 24 month plan - and reap great savings off of the new rates: <br><br>* Extend for 12 months for $109 US - and get a 30% discount off of the new monthly rates! <br><br>* Extend for 24 months for $190 US - and get a 39% discount off of the new monthly rates! <br><br>Now is the time to lock in these rates, so don't miss out. <br><br>For more information visit www.everquest.com/rates <br><br><br><br>April 23rd, 3:00am <br>------------------------------ <br><br>NOTE: We are unable to patch &quot;code&quot; right now because we are in the middle of making some changes to the basic structure of the game.
