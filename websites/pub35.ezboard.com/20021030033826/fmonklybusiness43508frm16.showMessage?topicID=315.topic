<br>
Maybe 10 procs in 3 minutes, this if you are really lucky, can swing for 1 minute without procs at all.<br>
Also I sensed little to no difference with 180 dex and 255 dex with boon.<br>
<br>
Fully buffed I'm at 3300 hp and 1204 ac (no haste item), and can barely solo a blue con with risks involved in doing that (thanks Divine Aura for saving my butt twice yesterday).<br>
If I'm not fully buffed a light blue is something to be scared of.<br>
Things went better when a shaman joined me with haste and slow, but kills were kinda slow.<br>
<br>
I can just say that if VI should really TEST spells before letting them go live, we wouldn't feel screwed another time.<br>
Thanks VI for giving me 3 hours of fun and then screwing me another time... now logging twink_01.<br>
<br>
P.S.: to all those who was whining about clerics DPS:<br>
Thanks and props! Instead of being happy to for us poor CH bitches, everyone started flaming: druids because they can't 75% CH and also shamans (that made me laugh, since they can solo DRAGONS!)<br>
I couldn't outtaunt a melee in NO situation, especially a epic monk, no matter what you heard.<br>
I feel sorry for those classes who really need a boost (Paladins for example), but I was actually having fun and doing something different from casting CH every xx minutes while spamming my right click legs.<br>
<br>
I have no logs or calculated DPS (I'm too lazy to do it), but check eqclerics to read about this nice nerf, it's a fact.<br>

I guess you are a monk and imho a monk should be able to solo effectively (I just have a 43 monk, so can't say how the situation is at 60, but I hear many like soloing with a monk even at highest levels). <p>Miele Boccadoro ~  Girlfriend of Innoruuk</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upeacedog67.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peacedog67</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/6/02 1:47:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=315.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cleric hammer nerfed</span><hr size=1> So sad and yet so stupid.

I think so many people believe any lvl 59-60 monk is just solo riping his way through blue cons for awesome XP.  This is just not true.  Here is my example:<br>
<br>
Lvl 59 - self buffed just under 1100 AC and ATK, 2300HPs, RBB, IFS (or SoM/Zekhas Katar), fungi, non epic.<br>
<br>
I tried going down into KC Basement and solo pulled a couple Soldiers and had to feign them both off and was not very close to soloing either one of them.<br>
<br>
Then I see a well equipped cleric with new hammer (1st day of patch), with 41% haste and no new pet working his way through dogs.  He was killing nearly as fast as I could.  I get a tell from him later telling me he is just riping through KC basement for good solo with his new hammer.<br>
<br>
Does this sound like what should have been happening?  I read alot of clerics saying they do much less damage than an EPIC monk but is this a fair comparison?  Should clerics get even remotely near as good melee as less than epic monks because they dropped into the magic shop and spent a few plat on a new spell?  Couple decent melee with thier plate AC, massive buffs and best heals in the game to keep them on thier feet.  <br>
<br>
That was the hopefullly objective part of my post.  As a side note I feel little for clerics as they have always been one of the most desired group and especially raid classes in the game and IMO the most coddled class in the game.  I've never seen any class get thier butts kissed by guilds just to keep them happy and logging in so a raid can happen.<br>

<br>
but does being the most desired usually mean the most fun?<br>
<br>
games are suppose to be fun. right?<br>
<br>
as monks we get to do our damage, click out flying kick button, click our epic hot key button, move around, split mobs,etc.. where as a cleric will /cast aego and /cast cheal.<br>
<br>
personally, even if a cleric is the *most* desired class for exp groups and/or raids.. to me, they arent the most fun to play.<br>
<br>
if they can some how work out a nice balance (which will be impossible) it would be a damn cool thing.. but since they cant, i see them just giving up on it like they have other things before. <p><table width="100" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

Personally I didn't like my cleric a lot in the "fun" department and this hammer gave us a chance to do something different.<br>
It's not bad now, still useful, even if I'd prefer to raise a bit the proc rate (the original one was exagerated I agree, I had 11 procs in 7 seconds as best performance).<br>

Hehe this cracks me up.  I won't get into how a monk not getting a group may have something to do with it being the &quot;twink flavor of the last year&quot; and there's literally thousands of them.  <br>
<br>
No, I'm gonna use a little logic, maybe clerics can get in so many groups because theres not so many of em because of exactly what your first sentence says.  I've created and played around with every class in Norrath except cleric simply because sitting on my ass non-stop does not appeal to me.  I find it so so humorous that monks, being a class that even the great Furor has deemed the most uber, still can sit here and bitch.  I'm not suprised though, our twink status has now invited so many that have no clue what honor and love of a class is that was so prevalent on this board a year and a half ago.  Whining is the norm so I guess I'll get used to it or move on.<br>
<br>
Everyone needs a garbageman to dump their trash because they don't want to live knee-deep in filth, but no one wants to be a garbageman.  Raise the trash fee so the garbageman can get a raise and people will rise up in revolt knowing full well that someone will still get rid of their shit for em.  Sounds honorable and brave, eh?<br>

maybe there wanted in every zone, on every raid e.t.c... because of 1 spell?<br>

Which one spell? CH? Rez? Aego? Hmmm.<br>
<br>
Even a Cleric's second best healing, rez, or buff spell is better than any other classes best.  <p><br>--

It's not like our group was a damage slouch either...had a 60th 2H primaled paladin, and 55 and 5x (was anon, blue to 55, didn't ask) epic monks, we're talking 30-45 second fights.  <br>

I've never had a weapon that procced anywhere near that much, even when it was going streaky in my favor... <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=249499">Slithers Sa`angreal</A>, 55 Iksar Monk of Prexus<br>Proud Member of Azure Sky<br><br>

<br>
The lvl 60 spell drops off of various 'raid' mobs in ssra.  I know it has dropped off of Rhag 1 and Emporer now.<br>
<br>
<br>
The 58 spell was proccing around 12 times per fight with fights lasting around a minute.<br>
<br>
The 60 spell procs as much as the pre-nerf hammer or a bit more.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was a very very very good change, now a lvl 56 cleric isn't out meleeing a lvl 56 paladin.  By the time the cleric can earn the lvl 60 spell the paladin can earn a raid level weapon and will still out dps the cleric.<br>
<br>
The 'proper' way to play a cleric now is to melee and yaulp V healing when needed.  Our cleric was lvl 58 with FT-1 and 0 AA with PoTG for mana regen spell and almost never medded the entire night in ssra.  He even hit FM a few times so he used the hammer pet to help kill stuff faster. <p><a href =http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569>Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a>

<br>
out of those spells.. Cheal is the only one where you need more then 1 person.<br>
<br>
you can use 1 person to rez the dead. you can use 1 person to aego the entire raid.. faster if you have MGB.<br>
<br>
so ok, we need 1 cleric to do those tasks.<br>
<br>
but with *so* many fights counting on a Cheal rotation.. of course there gonna be the most wanted. you cant get things done with out them. <br>
<br>
if you took that away and the encounters didnt need a cheal rotation..you could get by with 1 or 2 and fill the rest with druids/shamans.<br>
<br>
and now that shamans/druids might be getting new heals.. why go with a cheal/aego/rez cleric when you can get a shaman who slows/buffs/pet/dot/nuke/etc or a druid who buffs/ds/ports/nukes/dots/etc?<br>
<br>
giving them atleast the ability to do something other then sitting on there ass is good and from the posts ive seen it sounds like it made the game alot more fun for clerics to play.<br>
<br>
which is a good thing for everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umonax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Monax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/11/02 11:36:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=315.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cleric hammer nerfed</span><hr size=1> -Quote-<br>
Ok it might not be so fun to sit on your ass and heal all day...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But it must be really fun being wanted in every zone, on every raid e.t.c......<br>
-Quote-<br>
<br>
No, it isn't fun. It nice to be wanted but still not fun. I love my new cleric but I still love my monk. A monk has roughly a 50-75% chance of getting into a group because most groups allocate at least 3 of their slots (usually) to melee positions. Prior to the patch a cleric had a 1 in 6 chance of getting a group. If there was already a cleric there (unless leaving), end of story and I go log my monk.<br>
<br>
Raids of course are a different story and yes, I love that I'm needed so badly for raids. What I hate is the guilt when I have to leave and the boredom of the CH-sitmed-CH rotation.<br>
<br>
But then, that's why I have both classes. I do love playing with that hammer. And no, I don't solo with it. I hate soloing. <p>
