Have to say I hate this, mainly on a few points.<br>
<br>
*I raid with one of the uber guilds of Everquest, and one of the main reasons I enjoy it so much is because we explore the new zones before some punk does a walkthrough and every one knows how to farm something. One of the first to wack big mobs like Tunare and AoW and the rush when you see there drops for the first time. Now, with this Legends server, you can say good bye to being the first at anything, cause new zones/loot/mobs are added to the Legends server weeks or months before other servers. People will post info on items, mobs, zones, with walkthroughs long before we even have access to them. And for a game I pay for, thats plain wrong. This type of thing will kill Everquest for me, I know most people arent in the situation I am, maybe 2% of the game population are able to explore and do things on there servers before some spoiler comes out, but those 2% will be effected by this. <br>
*I understand how verant can't afford to make personal webpages for all players on a 10 dollar a month subscription, and personally this is something Id never want to be included in anyway. Seems like this is more aimed at the elitest players who want to brag to the world about there phat lewts!. But then, thats the type who will pay the 40 dollars for this service and Im sure Verant knows that.<br>
*I personally don't see the need for maps, but this is maybe the one option I would consider paying to move to Legends server for, Ive played on some text based games like muds that incorporate ascii mapping, and its a nice little feature, but again, 30 dollars for this... to much.<br>
*Price.. 40 a month US.. lets consider other countries here for instance, 10 dollars a month US for say someone from China is alot, now 40 dollars?, far to much for them to pay. Im an Australian, and the 40 dollars a month basically equates into 80 dollars for me. Am I willing to pay 80 dollars a month, 960 annually for a game? I think not. Of course, might be a good way for some chick from a third world country to find herself a rich husband online, cause ya gotta know if there on Legends server they gots da monez!. Whats the bet one of the new additions for the Legends server is a dating service!.<br>
<br>
So in ending, to each there own. I hope people who are willing to pay more for extra services enjoy the new server when it goes live, with the little bonus's Im sure they will. Myself, well, I'll play for a little longer, but as soon as the spoilers etc come out and spoil the game for me, I'll move on to some other online game and delete Everquest from my Hard drive, Im sure I won't be the only one.<br>

Better and better loot is the bane of this game. Eq worked better when the loot was at the initial pre planes level. It wasent broken till rok then devistated from tov.<br>
<br>
This is more of the must camp for 100000 hours to get loot. The older this game becomes the less it fufills its initial brilliance or leveling with a small group of friends in a cool place.<br>
<br>
Now for only 30 bucks a month they are making the loot even more uber. I like the idea of new content and more service, but thay lost me when they escilated the loot treadmill and want you to PAY for it.<br>

<br>
Lots of people play EQ for different reasons than you do, and their style of play is just as valid as yours.  For instance, I may not particulary like PvP in EQ, but a lot of folks do.  I don't complain about there being PvP servers for that reason.  Similarly, I don't mind if folks want to play on the Legends server.  You seem to be attacking anyone who is not jumping for joy over this.<br>
<br>
Again, I only care about this as it relates to service and upkeep of the Live servers and as it pertains to games yet to be released. <p><SELECT NAME="D1">

<br>
Just like PvP, I don't play it, but to those who want to, let em play PvP...doesn't affect me.<br>
<br>
I'm not interested in the Legends server, but others are, so let em pay for the premium service...doesn't affect you.<br>
<br>
In general, I cannot stand the "someone else is gonna have something better than me, I should get everything under the sun that I desire for $10 a month" cry babies.  EQ as it is, is quite a bargain for only $10 a month.  People claiming we should get all this premium service for that price is absurd.<br>
<br>
We pay $10 a month now for a bare minimum of Customer Service...mostly we just pay for the right to be connected to the game with CS largely missing.  Do you *really* think the level of CS we receive now can be affected negatively by this new server/area?  Of course it won't.<br>
<br>
Future games?  Be serious.  This is a service about 2 to 3% of the EQ population wants and is willing to pay for.  You seriously think that is going to encourage companies to only make future MMORPG's that cost $40 a month?  If they did, they would be shutting out 97 to 98 percent of their potential customer base.<br>
<br>
I suppose when airlines introduced first class service, you would have been concerned that in the future no airlines would offer coach service anymore and now you would have to pay 10 times your airfares to get anywhere, right?  Of course not.  In every business, there will always be people willing to pay a premium for a little more service - let em.  It doesn't affect the core business and normal standards of service everyone else receives.  Seriously, Chicken Little crying about the sky falling had a more credible concern than you do. <br>
<br>
For the last time, *I* am not interested in the service...it's not worth it to me.  But for those it is worth it to, I think it's great...have fun if they're willing to pay it.  If you're not one of those people, stop whining.  You have no point and you have absolutely nothing to complain about.  It doesn't affect you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukuurus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kuurus</A> at: 2/2/02 4:24:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucerios.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cerios</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/02 4:24:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant: Everquest Legends</span><hr size=1> Personally I could care less about this server, however 2 situations which I will not put up with are A) being charged more then about 15 bucks a month for what I currently recieve and B) I will quit the day that someone paying on my server gets an edge on me by paying more money.

<br>
No, no one is forced to read spoilers, it doesn't stop people.  What his point was is that the first to do anything now will be on the Legends server for the most part.<br>
<br>
There won't be anymore getting goods before everyone else knows about them.  Like the first guilds that were able to go to PoM and get a ton of stuff before everyone else figured out how to get there and then the place was nerfed to Hell.<br>
<br>
However, I think the thing that pisses me off the most about this is they used the money they use from us to implement content only 2-3% of players will ever use.  Don't get me wrong, I know Verant/Sony can use whatever they want for their profits, but I'm getting a little tired of hearing, &quot;Sorry, we can't fix Bug_01323 right now, we're working on getting the kinks out of Luclin.&quot; when they were able to hire an entire new team of people to make this server.<br>
<br>
My only hope is that the extra $240,000 (8000 subsribers x $30 dollars a month) will be used to hire more people to help the Live servers and not just to blow on the Legends server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufreonsmurf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FreonSmurf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/2/02 5:00:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant: Everquest Legends</span><hr size=1> ROFL, what a dumb idea.<br>

Any casual player who thinks they can get a better gaming experince by paying $40 dollars when you are still dealing with the same people needs a serious reality check.<br>
<br>
Props to any moron who pays $40 a month, might finally pay the salary for the new dev team and get some real fixes to everquest.<br>
<br>
lol, this is so funny<br>
Verant has so many broken promises, cant wait for the backlash then the $40 a month customers realize they are getting $9.99 + testserver+freewebspace(oh ahh) service. <p><P><center><font face ="Verdana,Arial" size="3" color="red">

I play EQ a lot (damn I'm so uncool, punch me!).  One of the things I would most like in EQ is dynamic content, new challenges instead of the same old thing.  Maybe some real storylines.  Do I think $10 a month is gonna pay for that in addition to the infrastructure and development of EQ? no.  Would I pay more to play a dynamic version of EQ?  Seriously considering it.<br>
<br>
You don't have to be rich to pay $40 a month, you just have to want to.  Some people have better cars, some people travel a lot, some people drink a lot, some buy clothes.  People spend their money however they choose and so they have different things from those who spent their money differently.<br>
