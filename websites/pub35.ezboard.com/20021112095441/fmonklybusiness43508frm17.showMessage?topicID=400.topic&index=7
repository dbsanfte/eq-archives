Its called retention, among other things, but what it boils down to is...it is not cost-effective to service everyone the same way, so you focus so your efforts on the clients who provide 75% of your business, and you /shrug at the rest.  Note that 75% of your business is not the same thing as 75% of your total userbase in this case either. <br>
<br>
How many ubers do you think own multiple accounts?  Even if they don't, won't it be the uber monks among us likely to provide the most income of the &quot;monk&quot; population?  Didn't they have to nerf the class so that the onslaught of uber monks into their new zones didn't totally unbalance their new high-end game before it really got off the ground?<br>
<br>
It really isn't that surprising...Verant is a one-trick pony.  When they timesink existing content/skills i.e. tailoring, or an almost-sorta-xp-nerf, or killing off the average monk and preserving the ubers, aren't these all ways of saying &quot;We serve the first 1000, and then we close the door on the rest?&quot;  Verant says through their actions that the ones who get there first get grandfathered in, and the rest are shut out in the cold.   Especially when those shut out in the cold are soloers, and all soloers do is throw off their mob/player ratio...they likely populate the majority of zones based on how many groups they think it can support, not to mention that I'm sure half of the &quot;ks&quot; petitions they get are because some soloer is infringing on someone's groupspace.<br>
<br>
I mean, just think about this:  How much use exactly will the casual gamer/soloer have for PoP?<br>

Thanks to those that have kept the discussion calm. We all understand that these changes are going to upset folks. It wasn't easy to decide to do this. So we accept the flames, and I'll read every email I get that isn't a copy of a post I've already read here  (extensive cursing excluded). <br>

Yeah I'm sure my dollar is going to put no where a scratch in their revenue.  That does not mean I am going to continue to patronize them.  They don't have to listen to us.  But its a service they are providing, and if we are not happy with it, we should not be paying for it.<br>
<br>
Oh btw, even if you cancel your account, you can still play until your billing cycle is up.  Just another way to speak with your dollar, even if you don't intend to really cancel. <p><table width="100%" border="0" height="90">

They wont get me trapped again in investing more than 3 years in my char to get nerfed at the end. <br>

<br>
I'm of the opinion that an small (proportional) increase in damage is vital to the monk class.<br>
<br>
They've altered the: <br>
warrior&gt;monk&gt;rogue (Defence)<br>
rogue&gt;monk&gt;warrior (Offence)<br>
<br>
<br>
and a small increase to monk damage would be vital to re-balance it.  (other wise it's just a pointless monk solo power nerf - and why would anyone take a monk over a warrior or a rogue in a group?)<br>

Sky thats so weird because I do the same thing also.  I went to Circuit City the other day to get another machine.  I skipped the entire Sony Vaio(sp?) aisle completely.  It just didn't matter whether or not they had the best deal or not there was no way I was gonna purchase that product.  Same thing with Cleo's(sp again?) when I was looking for a handheld.<br>
<br>
Whats funny about that is that I'm not saying the above to be mean or anything, but its weird how it feels like its &quot;ingrained&quot; in me to not buy Sony products anymore.  And I think it has everything to do with the way VI treats their customers.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this comes across as a whine, but it really is how I perceive the real world as far as Sony/VI goes.  Poor customer service from yet another faceless corporation. <p>Peacedog AoxomoxoA<BR>

There are four explanations:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) They listened to the wrong people..i.e. Absor told them stuff he thought was a genuine complaint and they acted on it. <br>
<br>
<br>
2) They cant handle the diversity of classes with PoP design so they are wedging all melee and hybrids into tank/da,age dealer lines so they can get the release out without it being sleighted. After that they can re-tweak monks.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) The vocal monk nerf and upgrades to the other classes are a precursor to a monk upgrade of some kind (I mean who the HELL believes we are overpowered compared to the stuff rangers can do (them being the most similar class to us - not saying they are overpowered, just that Ranger-Monk is no longer balanced)).<br>
<br>
<br>
4) They are a race of aliens that feed over the internet on the despair of human beings that they try to trap into their addictive yet massively frustrating virtual word. Realising that the classes were finely balanced and that the class envy they were feasting off from Furor tasted like BO and cold pizza.. they decided to nerf the entire monk class to open up a delicous supply of human suffering (some from RL martial artists who taste far nicer in terms of despair than stinking computer geeks with visions of grandeur). The only way to stop these evil alien invaders is to disconnect yourself from their mothership's computer by cancelling your account.. a bit like a seige where we have to starve them out. <br>
