<br>
Now during the a: event either the tanks were not taunting the mob or something was really weird with aggro.<br>
<br>
b: situation becomes an issue when the group sees you attack once or twice per mob, then never attack again-if im going to do that why have me eh?<br>
<br>
So anyway I know about aggro control.<br>
<br>
The main problem is that we bring NOTHING to a group that makes us wanted.<br>
If you want a damage dealer, get a tank or nuker<br>
you want meat shield? get a tank<br>
High damage/debuffs? Nukers<br>
Longrange? Heh...<br>
<br>
I dont know if im asking for new skills or what hehe I just want something that will actually make us wanted in exp groups, in RvR groups (battlegrounds only so far) I have plenty of invites to group, and have saved so many healers for my realm its not funny, id just like to see this translated somehow to the &quot;normal&quot; game.<br>

If you're still getting aggro, don't use styles except when you see a tank using a style.  The primary weaponskill detaunt very seldom works, maybe 10-20% of the time if that, so I can't suggest much there.  The left axe chain detaunt, on the other hand, works over half the time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A> at: 4/16/02 12:35:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umerry11.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merry11</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 12:43:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: detaunt</span><hr size=1> I find that you really need to make friends to get groups. A guild also helps, since most of my groups are started with a few guild mates. Other then that I try to hang around the same areas a lot talking to people etc. Eventually I get into groups but it takes a little more effort then when I play my skald.<br>
<br>
A funny story about groups.<br>
<br>
The other day I went to Darkness Falls, we did not have access and a group out front was talking about a raid to take a keep. They where asking for stealthers to help on the raid. I agreed to go help on the keep raid. The group was talking all through the keep raid how we would stay a group when we go back to DF. So we get other people together go on the keep raid, go back to DF, get inside DF. They then tell me, thanks for the help on the raid and booted me out of the group. <br>
<br>
Gee thanks! hehe.<br>

Time to train some mobs, I'd say. :P<br>
<br>
On the main topic, we have nobody to blame but ourselves.  All the bellyaching about how worthless our class is in PvE has raised a generation of DA players that believes it.<br>
<br>
I don't have that tough a time getting groups, but I do have to pester because I won't ever get invited unless I ask.  However, just about every time I group, there is at least one person who says, &quot;Gee, SB's actually do pretty well?&quot; when we break up.<br>
<br>
We contribute to the group damage just as well as anyone, and don't drain any additional resources if we're not being brash.  And heck, the other night our warrior and thane logged for the night, and I played main tank on reds in a group of 4.  We did just fine with only subtly altered tactics from the heavy tank scenario.<br>
<br>
If you're sure you know what you're doing - look for small groups in the areas you want to level - be a pest (although a friendly pest) and let them know you have something to offer.  Eventually you'll find people who will accept you in - and then do a hell of a good job, make some friends, and add them to your friends list to keep in touch with.  It doesn't take that long before you have a pretty good network you can hook up with for some serious levelling, if you've proven your worth. <p>Drolk - L43 Kobold Shadowblade (Tristan)<BR><i>In the shadow of the valley of death, I walk alone.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ularlanalavode.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Larlana Lavode</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 2:29:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: detaunt</span><hr size=1> Reputation will help quite a bit.  Sometimes it is a matter of us forming groups for whatever region/dungeon is desired.  Many times if I do not have family members who are awake, or they are way too high to join, or just too deep into a dungeon to join, I will send a message out to my alliance that I am forming up a group, be it Spindy, the werewolf dungeon, battlegrounds (frontiers), or what have you.  And while the responses do not flood in, I will get some responses.  From there, it is a matter of networking.<br>
<br>
As was stated earlier, knowing how to play your profession helps quite a bit.  And yes, we are probably the least desired class out there as far as PvE is concerned.  But if you can learn how to take the initiative, form good, desirable groups, and have some skill in giving instructions (that does not mean telling someone how to play their class), then your reputation alone will make it easier to find groups.  If that doesn't help, then a nice little guilt trip from time to time helps as your alliance mates realize on their RvR trip that they have no decent level rogues in their midst to be able to help protect against enemy assassins.<br>

The couple damage less damage you do per hit is made up for when you hit them every time, and have enough endurance for 2 fights.<br>

If you have a good tank at least your level then it is real easy to not get hit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeepoelfkiller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>meepo elfkiller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 8:25:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pincer vs Assault Ice Storm</span><hr size=1> My question is I see alot of people advocating the use of pimcer, which is cool. What I'm wondering is how does pincer stack against the Assault Ice Storm combo that you get from sword skill. I am a crit blade and thus at lvl 37 have a 34 crit 33 sword 28 stealth. The assault/ice storm is what I use since it can be used from any position (which helps when the mob changes targets frequently)Since I use a 2 hander and assault doesn't use much end. I usually can go 2 fights or so before needing to sit (I almost never get aggro with this combo btw, unless I taunt to pull aggro form the healer) Also if anyone with a 34 sword could tell me if the 34 use anytime sword style is worth it ? Just curious as to how the assault/ice storm and lvl 34 use anytime sword styles stack up against pincer in group PvE. Well anyone with any thoughts or opinions is encouraged to post, just tryin to play the most group friendly blade I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Then i started organizing my own groups. Instead of trying to join one i use /who like a madman and send the people i want to join the group msgs. This way i will also be able to handpick the classes i want in the group so i get a good group. And when you have a good group going people will come back. Add the ppl that you like to group with to your friends list so you can see if they're on.  I'm 40 now and i get tells all the time asking if i have a group going and if there are any slots in it. Now i even get invited into groups cause they will have ppl in them who has grouped with me before and done good.<br>
<br>
Sure we don't have it as easy as all the other classes to get groups, but it is doable if we put some work into it. Also sending out a msg saying something like 'Hi, i'm a 29Infiltrator want to group?' is probably not that smart. Start with something like 'Hey, we're pulling together a group to kill gobs (Or whatever you're hunting) and we got a spot open for a &lt;insert class&gt; if you're interested.'<br>
