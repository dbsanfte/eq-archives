Thus I started giving a lesson, as such I have decided to place those lessons in a this documentation so you may also learn of this technique.<br><br><B><U>Why you can't normally emote at a Mob:</U></B><br>There are three types of names in the game.<br>The first level is the most obvious, it is the name that appears above anythings head, it includes the names of mobs as well as those of players, on players this includes there first and last names, and any titles the have aquired as well as the guild the belong to if they belong to a guild.<br>The second type is the name that appears in the target box when said Mob is targeted.  In the case of a mob this is the same as there type 1 name.  In the case of a player this is simply there first name.<br>The third type is more elusive when it comes to mobs, this type is what the server actually uses as the name to differentiate one mob from another other one.  It is know as the handle.  A players handle is the same as his type 2 name.  As well some mobs without AI, such as boats, have the same handle as there type 2 name.  Monster type mobs (those you can attack and are not players) often have the same type 1 and type 2 names amoung many of them, i.e. there can be two mobs of this type with the same type 1 or type 2 name.  As such they need unique handles.  Figureing out what this handle is is discussed later.<br>Q. So what does all this mean, why can't I just target a mob and hit /wave? to wave at them?<br>A. The reason is that emotes like /wave with no target specified take the current target (type 2 name) and fill this in as the target of the emote, however, the emotes target must be a type 3 name.  This means that since it fills in the type 2 name, and players and non-AI NPC's have the same type 2 name and type 3 name, it will fill in the right type 3 name for them and the emote will work.  However, if the type 2 name is a AI-Mob then the type 2 name will be different then the type 3 name and the emote will try to find a type 3 name that is the same as a type 3 name, but will fail as no such type 3 name is around.<br><br><B><U>How to get a type 3 name:</U></B><br>Q. Ok, so the targeted name (type 2) is not the same as a handle (type 3) on a AI-Mob, how do I wave?<br>A. You need to supply the emote with the proper target, that is the correct type 3 name.<br>Q. Great, so how do I know what the type three name is?<br>A. The easiest way is to move back, and try to trade with the mob from a distance, the distance you want is one greater then what is allowed for a trade to suceed beginning.  Basically you want to get the message that will say, 'You are to far away to trade from Soandso.'  When you do this to a mob, say a wan ghoul knight in lower guk, you will get a message similar to this: 'You are to far away to trade from a_wan_ghoul_knight00.'  Now notice how the message relayed the name, that name with the numbers and underscores(_) is the mobs handle (type 3 name).  This is how the computer see it.  Now why does it have the underscores and numbers.  The underscores are there because of an old programming restraint in that variables(a area of memory that contains a changing value) can't contain spaces.  When variables (or area's of memory) began containing objects (a collection of data related to a similar item) they also could not contain spaces.  As each mob is stored as a object (a collection of data about that mob) it's handle cannot contain spaces, so these spaces are replaced with underscores to simulate spaces.  The number is so that if two mobs with the name 'a wan ghoul knight' exist then they can have seperate handles, i.e they would be named a_wan_ghoul_knight00 and a_wan_ghoul_knight01.<br><br><B><U>Using the type 3 name:</U></B><br>So now that you have the type 3 name you can do the emote, try inserting this type 3 name after the emote as the emotes target, for example, if we wanted to wave at that ghoul we would type this:<br>/wave a_wan_ghoul_knight00<br>and the server would do the wave animation and issue this statement:<br>You wave at a wan ghoul knight.<br>others would see:<br>Yourname waves at a wan ghoul knight.<br><br><B><U>I can wave at peoples corpse's, what about mobs?:</U></B><br>Corpse are a little different, first off a corpse doesn't use a double digit number, instead it uses a single one, so that a wan ghoul knight's corpse would be:<br>a_wan_ghoul_knight's_corpse0<br><br>But there is another point, some times the names on corpse are cut short, thus it might appear as:<br>a wan ghoul kn's corpse  (where the 'ight' from knight was cut off)<br>In this case the handle is:<br>a_wan_ghoul_kn's_corpse0<br><br>However, in either of the above cases, it might not have the number 0, it might be 2nd, or 4th corpse, but there is no way to get the handle, so you will have to play a guessing game, try going:<br>/wave a_wan_ghoul_kn's_corpse0<br>if that does not work hit enter and use Shift-Up to return to the last line and backspace out the 0 and replace it with a 1 so you get:<br>/wave a_wan_ghoul_kn's_corpse1<br>You will have to continue this way with 2,3,4,5,ect. until you suceed.  You can also use this technique if you don't want to try trading with a mob or know that is it the only one like it and thus it is at number 0 or that the only other one(s) like it have different number, then it must be the lowest missing number.<br><br><B><U>I still can't do it!:</U></B><br>Several things might be wrong:<br>1. You are using a mispelled, or non-existant emote, try checking the spelling.<br>2. You are mispelling the targets handle or the target no longer exists. Check the spelling and that the target is not dead/disappeared.<br>3. You are actually to far from the target, you have to be within about 50 feet.<br>4. Verant has made it so this ability is no longer available since this document was last updated. <p>Vaslin Slickfinger<BR>Scout of Tunare<BR>Tarew Marr</p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uvaslin.showPublicProfile>Vaslin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 5/31/00 8:57:39 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showPrevMessage?topicID=85.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showNextMessage?topicID=85.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.emailToFriend?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.threadControl?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly>Library (Read-Only)</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
