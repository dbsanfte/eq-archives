<br>
No one knows what happened to the swordsmith. I think it's more rumor that he went insane, because he stole the weapons back from people he had given them to. The nobles weren't very fond of him either because he made swords at his own pace, and on whims. He wouldn't just make them swords when they asked for it.<br>
<br>
He was apparently sane enough to hide his weapons up to thousands of miles away from each other, and keep them hidden for over 300 years. Not even the golem he left with the sword that the party found knows what happened to him.<br>
<br>
I should have answers to my preliminary investigation tonight.<br>
<br>
Koru-<br>
<br>
The goddesses level of involvement is an unknown. Gods aren't usually allowed to take a direct hand in the affairs of men, although I can recall one exception in a previous campaign where an actual avatar appeared at the end of a war to cleanse a city.<br>
<br>
Since Ishtar has a lot of temples (The game tends to think in a multi-planar sense) she probably doesn't know exactly what is inside this specific temple. If I can get it out without alerting her priests then I should be fine. If her priests realize somethings missing, she'll turn her eye this way, and possibly realize what she's lost. Then she might be mad. =)<br>
<br>
Or there's the possibility that she already knows what she has and that I might be in trouble regardless of how sneaky I am, but thats a risk I am willing to take.<br>
<br>
The weapons power is such that if I let them know what they had I would not be able to afford to buy it.<br>
<br>
I'll drop an update tomorrow morning when I get the results of my investigation.<br>

<br>
infiltrate their country and wayleigh some of each type grab tell tell pieces indicating the zealots involvement.  preferably find away to secretly wax copy an important seal or two.<br>
<br>
dress up as zealots and attack their neighbors as them =)  leave plenty of clues.  documents that the &quot;time had come to convert the heathen neighbors.&quot;   Then make some further strikes into your allys hearts leaving zealot clues behind.<br>
<br>
Preferably have a friend get close to those that would investigate these attacks so they can make the proper conclusions. <br>
<br>
EDIT: a good rogue never misses an opportunity to pilfer something that will lead back to one person and wont be missed by that person for a good long while.  such a thing is a nifty red herring to have on your for emergencies.<br>
<br>
when it gets messy. make your move leave clues pointing back to your allies in the descrated temple.  Let the two envoys from the nation make noise while you go hide in the mountains. <br>
<br>
also wealth buys influence with your &quot;front&quot; in your homeland use that to be in the right place at the right time.<br>
<br>
Also if your inherintly good... to good to be attacking innocents.  find corrupt targets in the neighboring states targets those states wont see as corrupt but they were corrupt nevertheless.  If you kill a corrupt magistrate in the form of zealots this should mitigate some of your evilness into something towards neutral/good.<br>
<br>
<br>
so campaign looks like this:<br>
1) find corrupt but reputable targets in the neighbors<br>
2) use your &quot;front&quot; and wealth to buy access in those neighbors. wine and dine. do favors. do some work on their behalf probono.  dont forget to find things to pinch for the end game in those neighbors while your doing this.<br>
3) identify targets in the zealot state.  wayleigh low levels get their stuff shouldnt show up on radar.  get impressions of seals<br>
4) forge documents. clues leading back to the zealots. dress up your party as zealots.<br>
5) attack and kill the corrupt but reputable targets in their neighbors dress as zealots.  leave plenty of clues behind pointing to the zealots. unfold a story for the npc's.  <br>
6) having bought access help the zealots neighbors come to the right conclusion. have them provoke some weakness in your target for some reasons that they think benefits them.<br>
7) when the time is right and the temple is weakened due to this external problems. make your move.  leave clues that your stole pointing back at your friends... mahahaha<br>
<br>
<br>
actually now that i read this.... i think this was a d&amp;D adventure i played once cept in that case you were the investigator that had to detangle this mess.  but hey learn from experience: now that player gets to leave the tangled mess behind =)<br>

We arrived in Thona and quickly got to work. Hamad and Aron used magical disguises to hide their appearances, while I made some minor changes to my own with my disguise skill.<br>
<br>
I had set up some forged papers for the trio (With an extra set of papers just in case) which we picked up in town. We then procured lodging and discussed the plan.<br>
<br>
Aron went out to set up contacts and to gather information on the building. He procured a map of the part of the building we were interested in, and some information on the guard patrols. We managed to locate several points on the map that could be the place housing the statue, but we weren't certain of it's exact location.<br>
<br>
We decided to infiltrate the building and check things for ourselves.<br>
<br>
The government palace was huge. We were interested in the East wing of the building, which luckily was away from the temple grounds. I climbed up the wall, waited out a guard patrol, and then unlocked a window and dropped a rope for Aron and Hammad.<br>
<br>
We explored the offices, and then moved to investigate the points of interest on our map. We found several statues, but it wasn't on the second floor so we headed down to the first floor. There, in a small atrium we found the statue.<br>
<br>
I cast True Sight and examined the statue. I didn't notice anything magical or otherwise. I began to wonder if the information I received was false when Hammad noticed a small hole in the back of the statues base. When I examined it with true sight I noticed magical writing above the hole which read &quot;The Red Lion see's what you seek&quot;.<br>
<br>
Remembering that there was a statue of a red lion back on the second floor, we jaunted back up there real quick to take a look. Aron noticed that the eyes of the lion were different, and proceeded to pry a gemstone out of one of them. Before we put the gemstone into the hole Aron put down a silence cube, just in case.<br>
<br>
It turns out his fears were warranted, as a stone slab in front of the statue slid open. Inside the slab was another message from the master smith Travanco. &quot;What you seek was hid within the locked.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now this could mean many things. With a lot of information to think about, we decided now might be a good time to slip out. Aron noticed that the gem we placed within the statue had dropped down where the new message had been revealed, and he picked it back up. As soon as he picked it up the stone slid closed once again.<br>
<br>
After a day of rest we decided to break into the buildings archives and see if we could find an architectural drawing of the building. I spent much of the night searching the archives to no avail (Aron and Hamad weren't much use, as I was the only one that could read Thonian). We were getting ready to leave when we heard the door start to open. We hid behind the shelves when a rather homely looking libararian type arrived to begin working early.<br>
<br>
I noticed a plaque by her desk with a name on it, and decided to gamble a bit. I pretended to have just entered the room, and used my charm, good looks, and acting ability to bluff her into getting the information we had been searching for. After promising to meet her for dinner later that evening, we snuck out and headed back to our rooms.<br>
<br>
We examined the map and noticed that there was a vault in the East Wing. Although it was down near the guards a bit. I headed off to dinner, while Aron went out to find information on the vault. It turns out that the vault is a clockwork creation, nearly impossible to pick. However there are three keys to it, and Aron plans to go out and steal one of the keys. The bad news is that the keys are on the Lion Lord, the Lady Lion, and (I honestly can't remember the third one). All of them are higher ups in the temple (High Priest, High Priestess, and Lord Templar).<br>
<br>
Hamad and I would only get in his way on this so we decide to meet him later. Aron manages to steal the key from the Lady Lion, and we sneak down to the vault. We &quot;subdue&quot; the guards without killing them, and open the vault. While Hamad and I start looking around for where the sword might be hidden, Aron pops open his bag of holding, and starts loading up loot (It's never good karma to rip off a church, but then hey who am I to talk.).<br>
<br>
Hamad finds a hollow section of tiles against one wall and proceeds to start removing them. He's not moving fast enough for Aron however, who comes over and starts smashing the tiles out. Inside a depression in the wall is an object wrapped in oilcloth. Hamad reaches in to pull it out and promptly slices one of his own fingers off (Mental note, do not pull on sharp objects). We finally manage to pull it out and unwrap the sword.<br>
<br>
A blade of hundred times folded alloy of earth, fire, water and air steels. The metal has a prismatic effect when reflecting light. A guard of shaped copper oak leaves and quilions with a pommel of gold.<br>
<br>
And this is where the questions began. We got out as quickly as possible, but did we get the right sword? Detect magic revealed nothing (As is sometimes the case with powerful items), but the other sword had a decoy, could this also be a decoy?<br>
<br>
After a fruitless attempt to Commune with my diety about it (Another mental note, don't bother Chaotic Neutral elemental entities unless its about the business of the church.) I decided that there had to be something more to it. Aron had left to return the key to the Lady Lion, so Hamad and I went to examine the statue again. At this point many questions were running through my head (Such as, who gave me the information for this in the first place?). It turns out that we couldn't do anything with the statue until Aron returned due to the fact that he had the gem.<br>
<br>
When Aron returned we put the gem into the statue again, and again the panel opened. This time we forgot to use the silence device, so the sound of stone grating on stone filled the area and alerted the guards. We hid while they tried to figure out what made the noise, eventually they left.<br>
<br>
I went over and examined the revealed area extremely carefully. I noticed that a comma in the message was actually a hole, about the size of the blade I carried. I inserted the blade into the stone. Immediately all of the plants nearby began to grow at an alarming rate. Roots cracked walls, trees broke through the ceiling and skylight, and eventually the guards came a running. Fortunately the area was so overgrown that they couldn't see much.<br>
<br>
I went back over and pulled the sword out. One of the trees that had grown so much turned towards me, and said &quot;Give me the sword&quot;. It held out a bark covered hand towards me. I did as it requested, and it asked &quot;Are you worthy of this sword?&quot;. <br>
<br>
I said &quot;I believe I am, yes&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then take the sword&quot;<br>
<br>
Which it dropped into a mass of vines. I quickly reached after it and had my arm entwined in the vines. I was unable to reach it, but then I remembered that I had another arm, and reached into it with the other arm and grasped the hilt. The vines didn't want to give up though, and I was pulling for all I was worth...<br>
<br>
In the meantime the guards were trying to hack through the bushes to get to us in the middle, while Aron threw stars at them covered with sleeping poison.<br>
<br>
After a few seconds of meaningless tugging I had an idea and asked the vines to let go of my arm. Which they did. Then I asked the plants in question to clear a path to the exit for us, which they did. Then we got the heck out of Thona as fast as we could. And I am now the proud owner of The Oaken Blade.<br>
<br>
I assume the Thonan's are going to be royally pissed about their vault being plundered, their building damaged, and having an artifact weapon removed from beneath their noses, but hey sometimes you gotta break a few eggs.<br>
