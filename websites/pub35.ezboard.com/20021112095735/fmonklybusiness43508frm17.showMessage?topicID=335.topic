Just got done fighting in Velks, spiders...compared to yesterday, was taking a LOT more damage, and seem to be getting hit a bit more often (less avoidance). <br>

No specific numbers tho, but yesterday hits were about 30-50, today they are 40-96.<br>

I didnt spend much time ingame today, mostly cause i decided to go solo some dark blue mobs i was having fun at pre patch. Well promptly after the Very First mob i fought killed me i got a lucky rez from a nearby guildie and decided to log. Even the green mobs on the way to my camp spot were hitting me for around 60 dmg. I'll wait a few days to see if anything gets fixed before i decide to cancel my account.<br>

Don't be confused... 986ac is quite good for a 46th Monk. The pattern seems to be that Monks with high ac relative to mob they're fighting are noticing little change. <p><hr />

Sorry for the lack of parsed data, this was done in a hurry before work.<br>
<br>
Our subject is a level 23 Iksar monk, maxed STA at start. 901 HP, 584 AC. Yes, I'm twinked. Live with it.<br>
<br>
Against Netherbian Drones in NL, medium to dark blue to me at 23, I was taking roughly 20-30% HP to finish a single solo fight before the patch, and could handle an add if I had to. Also pre-patch, the hits I took fell over a broad curve of damage. 5, 38, 11, 8, 20...a typical kind of damage scroll for any melee class.<br>
<br>
After the patch, those same Netherbian Drones were taking 40-50% HP off me per single solo fight. If I wasn't twinked, some of those fights would have been very close. And adds were out of the question. I didn't seem to be taking MORE hits, but I was getting hit in a &quot;mini-maxed&quot; kind of way. By that I mean, when I got hit, it would be either for like 2 points, or full/near-full damage, with few hits falling in between. 2, 40, 2, 38, 40...and those big hits added up quick.<br>
<br>
So just purely based on that observation, they've clearly put a big nerf on our damage mitigation. And life is gonna be a lot tougher for the lower-level monks, especially those who don't have a load of HP gear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eyez>Eyez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/16/02 7:31:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:Non-scientific results</span><hr size=1> Well I 2-box with a shaman. I had 2 vastly different experiences... (both chars level 51, sub-par gear except sham has JBB). Have been fighting Mature Rockhoppers and Stonegrabbers in Mons Letalis for some time now...<br>
<br>
First Experience<br>
************<br>
OMFG, mature rockhoppers completely OWN the monk... sham has to heal many times per fight and monk cannot maintain aggro due to extra heals... still win but zero downtime pre-nerf no longer exists...sham needs to med and monk bandage...Stonegrabbers not as bad but still much harder than pre-nerf.<br>
<br>
Second Experience<br>
**************<br>
Same mobs but this time sham remembers to SLOW the mobs first (smacks head against table several times)...<br>
<br>
Mature Rockhoppers still hit very hard and health ends up around 50% with no heals or mend (but mob slowed and monk fully buffed inc alacrity)...this equates to very little downtime with a couple of bandages and a superior heal.<br>
<br>
If anything stonegrabbers even easier than pre-nerf...monk gets maybe 5% damage after mob slowed...(stonegrabbers always did hit much softer than mature rockhoppers).<br>
<br>
Overall I would say the harder-hitting mobs hit slightly harder for more overall damage but not by much (maybe 10%). Easier mobs are much the same as pre-nerf. I am very thankful I have a pet shaman as it makes life much easier for me. I would guess the shaman would have to stay on his toes a bit more watching monk health to avoid death... However I sympathise with all the soloers as it will surely be harder post-nerf... I agree with Mobhunter when they say &quot;clerics might use their 100% rez a bit more now&quot; (they did not mention from MONK DEATHS). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukurrlee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurrlee</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1069<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/16/02 8:08:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Non-scientific results</span><hr size=1> 54, decent gear.<br>
<br>
Soloing in KK. The hits are very irratic. So is the damage from the MoBs. <br>
<br>
In general, the greens/lite blues/low dark blues could be considered the same. There was occassion that one of any group would hit much higher than they did in the past. Not sure why. In the same token, any one of those groups would hit much lower than in the past. Against one lite blue I think I took all of 20 damage.<br>
<br>
Higher level dark blues are a different matter. They are noticably tougher.<br>
<br>
One thing that I did notice for the little time I was playing was that I was getting stunned MUCH more than before. Could be just bad luck, but I am inclined not to believe that.<br>
<br>
This leads me to believe that again VI is using their motto of &quot;Your either Uber-geared or Uber-Screwed&quot; (mmmm might make that my sig).<br>

I'm using a velium brawl stick (the 32/40 one) as my weapon du jour.<br>
<br>
Last night I soloed about 10 dire wolves in Tenebrous Mountains, all of which I could kill on 50% or slightly over health (for pretty good exp might I add).  <br>
<br>
Tonight I tried about 5 of them, of which I killed 2 and had to feign the others off as it was definitely a losing battle.  <br>
<br>
My take was that I was getting hit less, but the hits I took surely hurt more.  I was taking a lot of 80pt hits.  I'll test it some more, but if that's the way it is going to be, I guess its back to quadding with the wizard for a while.  <br>
<br>
It does irritate a little, as I'm a casual player with limited and short play times.<br>
<br>
Parenthetically, the wolves that I beat down left me with about 10-20% health from a full bar of health (no mending).  It used to be that I could take two wolves on a single full bar of health.  Kinda sucks indeed.<br>

Oh, editing for other stats...HP's is about 1260 if that helps.  I don't have much HP gear, as my character has a lot of cheap range gear (300-500p cost) except for silver chitin handwraps, which I figured were worth the cost.  The biggest HP gear I have would be the 5/55 rings, of which I have two.<br>

dreadlands with my 46 monk, seemed exactly the same for the hour i played.../shrug Iksar monk 986ac 1724hps 1025atk<br>

Seemed exactly the same but then i attended a raid with my main and the monks reported in guild it was CRAPPY =/ so im confused hehe <br>

<br>
Don't be confused... 986ac is quite good for a 46th Monk. The pattern seems to be that Monks with high ac relative to mob they're fighting are noticing little change. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Yep if you have a very high AC (i.e AC to spare for your level) you won't notice too much of a difference.  So seriously twinked monks will be ok lower to mid levels (but true noobie monks will suffer) and Uber monks at high levels seems to be doing ok, yet the more average monks is suffering more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=conentenderheart>Conen Tenderheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://cgof.freeservers.com/images/trans-piccolo2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 4:30:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1>  I have noticed being stunned ALOT more now.<br>

 I went and did a solo run to the BK in Chardok and sat at ONE blue mob for over 30 mins cause every time I stood from FD he Stunned me. Also noticed this alot in Kael in the arena area when pulling the protectors. I went to KC and a Skeleton stunned me with a hit of 10 dmg on the way to the LCY. <br>

 I think I am not uber in the equipment area but I am pretty decent for my level. <br>

 My Level 56 Human Monk friend has been getting stunned alot since the patch also. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thrush123>Thrush123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 5:27:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> 54 Human monk about 980ac 1800hp -<br>
