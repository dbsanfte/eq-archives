Uhm....to say someone has never received ANY information from a knowledge pool such as this would be naive at best.  I think people are most upset that taking information and not returning the favor.  It just shows poor taste /shrug.<br>
<br>
Bakara has been posting similarly on eqtraders.com as well.  So he is either (a) witholding information he knows would benefit many, many other people; or (b) some troll who likes to fan the flames.  I lean towards (a)  If you know the recipe, share it.  Otherwise STFU and stop posting.<br>

<br>
To repeat:<br>
<br>
He was kind enough to confirm the suspicions that Yttrium Ore was used for the manufacture of Serubane weapons, which means that you know what that 'useless' ore is worthwhile towards if you want to bank it until you are ready to use it.<br>
<br>
He was kind enough to say that you really wanted to max your smithing skill as high as it could go before even attempting the combine. And even then it would have a 50% failure rate or so.<br>
<br>
He was also kind enough to state that final results were nodrop and only of real benefit vs. Seru(the last part being pretty freaking obvious), meaning that unless you are going to be part of a Seru attempt you have no real need to forge these weapons.<br>
<br>
He was also quite explicit that the non-Yttrium parts of the recipes were annoying as hell to get, and that the quest being public knowledge would bring the progress in equipping a guild from a 2-3 month proposal to over a YEAR(assuming four times the people trying to farm the same items - even one extra guild who wastes combines at low skill could slow the rate of finishing weapons by that degree). <br>
<br>
Maybe if you think your guild is capable of Seru(Ha!), your people do have appropriate trade skills, and you promise to keep it quiet Bakara would share it with you via email or some such. I'm not saying for sure he would, but if I was stumped and thought I honestly had a chance of putting them to good use(and not just bottlenecking the people that could) I would at least send him a polite email rather than expecting him to screw himself on a public messageboard.<br>
<br>
And if you check FoH's roster Bakara is on there, takes about 30 sec to check... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubakara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 1:17:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4648.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Niam is my sekret admirerer, how long before lvl 1 ogres start popping up on Veeshan?

<br>
I mean, those weapons MIGHT do someone good if they really want to wield a 12/20 with no stats that requires 250 skill to reliably make after 8 hours of component farming (with a full rounded group).. you never know.  But by the time you are high enough level to get that stuff you're pretty retarded for using such a pos weapon.<br>
<br>
I'm done trying to defend my reasoning to people, it is the WISH and WILL of my guild mates that the process isn't discussed, I've already said ALOT, and quite frankly I really wish I COULD post it so that it draws alot of attention and is re-tuned.  The fight is HARD enough to at least make the weapons 3x easier to get than they are now.  Maybe if enough tards are fighting over the parts VI will do some retuning of the whole thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uniamdsparil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Niam DSparil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 5:07:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4648.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> One, I have a hell of a lot better things to do than hassle someone in game, let alone on a different server.<br>

Two, the everyone that has raised up in opposition to you have been people who are upset at your elitist mentality that you continually feel you have to express.

Try combining them in a forge sometime with a flask of water and something (or without the flask) like the yttrium ore, maybe the meteor dust, dunno.  I'm assuming with the sheer bulk of keys and weapons required to hurt Emp. Ssra. it would be a reasonably common enough spawn with a rare drop, would probably have to be related to Ssra temple in some way (the grey or some such, perhaps even basement of ssra. There is a forge down there with the iksar slaves near the glyphed area)<br>
<br>
Dunno, just speculation, might be worth trying.  And on the Seru bane weapons, try getting the 4th earring, since it's likely the quest originates in katta (the anti-seru place) and is related to Lcea Katta or another high profile figure in there.  You'd think the guys who want to overthrow seru would have some idea how to hurt him, eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unajir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Najir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/10/02 7:28:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4648.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Seems to me (this is my opinion), that these weapons arent worth the time and frustration to get them...Although im glad someone was finally able to kill Seru, to me the time required to just get your guild outfitted with these weapons is absolutely ridiculous. IMHO, this game has become more of a time sink as far as high end quests go.<br>
<br>
Why spend 3 months (or longer) to get your entire guild outfitted with these weapons, for 2-3 loots ***IF*** your guild is even able to kill him, when you could be doing other encounters to get 10 times that amount of loot.<br>
<br>
Is all this RL time required to get 1 or 2 pieces of nice loot worth it? Is the prestige of killing an ubermob in game worth 2+ months of RL time? To me its not.. but i guess there are always people for whom the answer will be &quot;yes&quot;.<br>
<br>
Verant has made the game less fun, and more of a collasal time sink, than anything else.<br>

Original Norrath = perfect<br>
Kunark = excellent expansion<br>
Velious = excellent expansion<br>
Luclin = Utter and complete waste of time<br>

Trying to explain exactly why it is that those who know aren't exactly forthcoming with the information.<br>
If it really does take as long as he's saying it does, then any guild with half a shot at taking down Seru would want to start farming the supplies they need RIGHT NOW, since when they finally get their opening one year from now, they might actually have enough gear to equip the guild with the weapons they'll need.<br>
Consider this: if he DIDN'T post, even to say that the recipe has indeed been confirmed, then player A would come through saying, &quot;Does anyone know the recipe for Seru-bane weapons?&quot;  Player B would instantly pipe up, &quot;D3wd, you suxxor!  Seru-bane hasn't been implemented yet!&quot;  Then Player C would say, &quot;No, FoH killed Seru, so it must be in-game.&quot;  And then Player D would say, &quot;FoH didn't make Seru-bane because they're an uber guild, and the GMs decided to hand the weapons to everyone in the guild just so they could test everything out.&quot;  And then Player E would say, &quot;But my best friend's cousin's uncle's brother-in-law's roommate's guildmate said that FoH made it by themselves.&quot;  And then Player F would say, &quot;No, Seru-bane hasn't been implemented yet!  I can prove it!  The reason that VI made the revamped CT was so that they could sneak the ore they needed for it into the game, but its not dropping yet, which can be proved because the unrefined ore that drops there is the same stuff that is given as a reward for the newbie quest, and its OBVIOUSLY a placeholder for the real stuff that was coded in by mistake!&quot;<br>
And meanwhile, Player A has gotten disgusted by the fact that his thread has been hijacked into yet another whine-play thread, and wandered off somewhere else, and FoH is quietly sitting and rolling their eyes at all of the idiots who are wasting bandwidth on topics they know absolutely nothing about.<br>

<br>
If theres a forge in deep katta or use the one in Sssa temple to make the weapons.  I used to blacksmith, and its basically a mold, water and 2 other bits? ( i forget now )<br>
<br>
So maybe you need to make a mold first?  if not maybe put the yttrium ore, shissar weapons (off the elites in Sssa), water and one other thing into the forge  <br>
<br>
whats that ore off the burrower parasite btw?<br>
<br>
Of course im just guessing, bouncing some ideas around till someones lightbulb starts to go off P<br>
