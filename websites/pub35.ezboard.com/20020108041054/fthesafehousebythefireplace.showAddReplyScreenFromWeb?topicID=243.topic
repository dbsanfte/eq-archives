<br>
I had just entered Crushbone, on a quiet night.  I was walking my way over to the Castle area, to see if any soloing could be done.  I get to about halfway, at the corner by the Trainer's hill, when around the corner comes Ambassador Dvinn, running at full tilt.  He mumbles something about half-elves and that's all I remember.<br>
<br>
I woke up dazed and confused, not knowing what happened.  A cleric was nearby, helping me back to full strength.  The only thing I could think about was the HUGE headache I still had.  The cleric started to chuckle.  I asked what was so funny and he pointed to my forehead.  After getting the mud off my hands, I reached up.  The first thing I felt was blood and lots of it.  Continuing up the forehead, I stopped suddenly at the handle of a dagger.  As I'm trying to remember how a dagger came to be in my forehead, the cleric meanders my way, reaches down and yanks the dagger out.<br>
<br>
I wake up once again, with no less of a headache.  The cleric is nowhere to be found.  My dagger is also missing but in place of the dagger normally in my scabbard, a Dragoon Dirk!<br>
<br>
I found out later from a witness that Dvinn came running around the corner, pulled his arm back, and struck me in the head without slowing down, UNTIL he couldn't get the Dirk dislodge from my skull.  Dvinn, interested more in killing than keeping his weapon, continued on, leaving his Dirk in my forehead.  I thank the cleric that healed me and left the Dirk, and who was also kind enough to leave the scar from this oh-so strange transaction.<br>

He is weary but willing to tell his story now.  Nervous at his intent, surely teeth that sharp looking belong on an animal not a dwarf, you smile back.  Gruffly he says to you, "Heheh well me story ain't so dramatic like or nothing but sit close and share yer pint wid me."  Nodding slightly, you agree.  He gulps some ale to moisten his throat and starts*<br>
<br>
Me was a wanderin round da commons lookin fer a fight.  Course in me 17th ring dere ain't much fer me so I was debatin whether ta head ta dat oasis place or go on ta da pass of High Hold.  Den dis speedy little bard came a singin his gabbly-gook and tapped me on da shoulder.  Course, seeing me profession and all, me ain't likin when people come up 'hind me so me whirled round and stuck me daggr ta his throat.  Gapin in shock, at least it shut him up, he held his hands up like me was a robbin him, hehh crossed me mind course, and said he had a message fer me from a friend.  Seein as me friends were in short supply lately, dey not been journeying much, me was s'picious.  But when he pulled out da note and me recognized da seal, me let him go.  He quickly opened it and read to me dat me ranger friend (no names fer dere protection) was a gonna storm Dvinn's castle and wanted me ta campaign long wid him.  Knowin me ranger friend he'd be needin me help so me told dat bard ta tell him me would be goin.  Noticin he was a lingerin, lookin fer some money no doubt, me gave him a tip. Heheh he be a rememberin not ta mess wid da wee folk wearin stickers in da future evertim he look in da mirror and see dat scar cross his cheek.<br>
<br>
Course da journey home took many days.  Most of it me was passed out sick tops dat damn boat.  Me hate magik users, less dey wid me group, so me turned me nose up at a port.  Hehe 10pp ain't as much as ya think once yer watchin da waves a bobbin up and down fer days.  Finally we saw port, me thanked me god and even some odders me was so happy ta be on land, den me went past me old haunts.  Breathin in dat rocky wild scent of home made me happy but me didn't stop ta reminisce. Sides me family (dat be nother story all together) ain't dere anymore only some people me still owe money.  Hmn.  <br>
<br>
*Kriegar stops, takes a drink of ale.  Scratches an old scar that crosses his wrist.  He remembers the old days briefly.  Seeing his audience impatient, grins, swigs some more ale, then begins again*<br>
<br>
Me ran ta the Great Faydark and though me shouldn't admit it me was kinda glad ta run through dat old forest.  Me even kilt me a pixie and orc pawn fer old times sakes.  Den me shouted fer a magik ta bind me dere near Crushbone.  A kindly mage came ta me rescue den shouted out wid frustration when me simply vanished when he be a lookin fer his pay.  Stupid arrogant high elf.  <br>
<br>
Me finally made it ta da castle and crept up da stairs into Dvinn's tower.  Me was kinda nervous, no doubt, as dere be invisible see'ers up dat away.  But me ranger friend and his group had been busy and dey been clearin da trash away.  Clappin hands wid him was good.  Me ain't been so lucky ta see him in a year or so, so dis was a good moment.  Swappin lies and insults as was our wont, me den joined his group.  Sides him was a cleric, mage, warrior, and paladin.  Dey had all been journeyin longer den me own 17 years so me was glad as me knew me wouldn't die.<br>
<br>
Long into da night we fought.  The sun came up and disappeared. But dat sneaky (aye me have ta admit he be rogue like) inkie be smart and sent imposters instead ta talk ta Emp'or Crush so we nivver got ta stick it ta him.  Den da sun rose on dat third day and he appeared.  Prolly thought we'd be gone but no we stood dere covered in gore and blood.  We knew it ta be him as he be aholdin his dagger.  Since we didn't think he be a comin so fast , me wasn't prepared (ie hiding) and he stuck his dagger inta me back.<br>
<br>
*Kriegar stands and turns.  Lifting his dwarven tunic he shows you the ragged hole to the left of his spine.  You can tell  the scar has been there a while as there is a clump of scar tissue.  But you wince with sympathy as it obviously was very painful wound to receive. He sits down and resumes his tale*<br>
<br>
Stunned, me shouted ta me group and dey surrounded him.  Da healer type saw me problem but couldn't help me cause our mage had thrown fire bolts of immense power ta git him way from me.  *Kriegar looks sad for a moment* We nivver got a chance ta help her as dat bastid hit her so much dat she jumped ta her death in an attempt ta escape him.  *Kriegar silently thanks his god for safe fall*  Dat got me mad as she been a good sort, fer a human and all, so me gots behind him.  Motioning fer da warrior, he stood still and taunted Dvinn bout his ugly momma so me could bs da bastid.  It worked so well we continued. Da warrior and ranger yelled insults while dey bashed, pally smacking him wid his sword, da cleric tryin ta heal dem, and me bsing like mad.  Right fore we kilt him, blood rushin from his many wounds (and yes me did git da kidney cause he did pee blood) he whispered bout him bein avenged.  Den he died.  Me ranger friend had some bones in his pack so we took dem out and rolled ta loot dat damn inkie.  Fer once me luck was good and me got ta keep his dagger as a little souvenior, dat and da scar course which da cleric sowed up nicely once he was all full of mana. <br>
<br>
*Kriegar swigs the last of his ale.  Eyeing the coin in front of you he sees you have very little.  Motioning to the barkeep he asks for another pitcher of ale saying he would buy.  The bartender is not stupid and knows a rogue when he sees one.  Wondering  if he can trust such a  person but seeing that you are there, nods.  A buxom lass delivers the ale.  Kriegar pours a healthy amount into his tankard then swallows most of it in one gulp.  Wiping his mouth with a his sleeve and belching, he sits back. You sit and wonder if there is more to his tale.  Standing up, weaving a bit, Kriegar flings some money on the table and begins to walk away.  He stumbles once against you then straightens up.  Mumbling underneath his breath, Kriegar walks out the door of the tavern and vanishes into the night.*<br>
<br>
*Kriegar grins as he hears the shout of his companion.  Hefting the weighty sack of gold and jewels in one hand, Kriegar looks both ways then disappears.*<br>
