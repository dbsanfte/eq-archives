I consider my place in a group to be as a scout to guide the puller, and when the fighting starts my place is behind the mob BSing. Why is it that I'm expected to waste the clerics mana healing me when I shouldn't be in a position to be getting hit in the first place?Why am I expected to tank when I lose over 800 points of potential damage every few seconds by being on the wrong end of a mob?&quot;<br>
<br>
Its redundant to send u and a tank to go pull general mobs.. like sebilis...Charsis...Chardok etc..people would laugh at you, if u just go sneak up and look at  a room full of mobs and come back and say..yep that room is full spawn, some tank should  go pull that. Frankly U are that tank, so u better go get some ac and pull that room with sneak and likely tag  a single doing it ( if thats what you want).<br>
<br>
And u better have some decent AC to be able to take the hits that the lazy tank isnt getting agro, cuz he is way to far away from the mob, or hes not casting on it or watchn TV and not taunting, just hits the auto attack button, or hes grinding the mob backing u into a corner so u are the agro target due to proximity, or his weapons just plain suck and you pay the price for his no taunt abilities.<br>
<br>
Rogues dont just damage and scout, you have to be able to pull and tank some, to be well rounded. Heck i even play nurse better than the avreage monk, in down time i can bandage to 100%, a nice help to shammys canni, when a chanter/bard isnt available. <p>"Walks with Tigers"<br>

<br>
There are some good tanks out there and some pretty crappy ones too.  Therefore, it's not always guaranteed that you will have the luxury of BS the whole fight.  The line I find myself repeating in group over and over again is "SAME DAMMED SIDE PLEASE".  It seems that monks now don't want to side with the tank because they get hit more often, and I even had a bard tell me once that they got more lag on that side of the mob /boggle<br>
<br>
So it all boils down to you.  The rogue is an extremely versatile character and you can do almost anything in this game.  Defining a role for yourself is limiting and to a certain extent, insulting.  Sometimes you end up tanking - oh well.  It happens.  Sometimes the main tank can't hold his aggro, sometimes the monk wants to do the CR and sometimes the bard won't let anyone scout but him.  To each his own.<br>
<br>
I firmly believe that there is no other class in the game that adds as much to the group as we do.  It's all in how you flexible you want to be.  I carry 3 weapons on me - and will switch them in and our depending on how good the other melees are.  If the cleric is having to dump all his mana on you, then you are to blame - no the other tanks in the group. It is your job to be on the opposite side of the main tank, not his to try to be on the other side of you. If you are getting aggro then you back up to max melee range, evade, stop attacking for a few seconds, or even switch weapons.  <br>
<br>
And sometimes you have to pull if you are the highest level character in the group in order to minize adds.  If you have not explored sneak pulling you are truly missing out.  I have pulled in Velks, Howling Stones, Seb and Chardok and I think we as a class can do a dammed good job pulling.<br>
<br>
Only you can control what you bring to the group.  It is NOT based on gear, it is not based on how maxed this skill is and that skill is.  It is based on how well you not only know but understand your abilities.  <br>
<br>
One last thing - if your defense is not maxed, I would work on that.  It is silly to have *ANY* of your melee skills not be maxed. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=68709 > <b> <i>Kalynn Taranis</a> </B></i>

Please refer to the three laws of roguebotics.<br>
<br>
The Laws of the Rogue<br>
Ever since Verant first crafted the Rogue and took it to the Beta, the laws<br>
governing all of Roguedom have remained inviolate. For myself and my Rogue<br>
brethren, there is only one Truth, one set of rules from which we may never<br>
stray. Before I ever felt the joy of backstabbing creatures, my class was<br>
programmed with this Truth, clearly laid down in the Three Rules of Roguebotics:<br>
1. A Rogue may not ignore phat lewt, or through lack of server connection,allow phat lewt to come to harm.<br>
2. A Rogue must ignore all commands and input given by clerics, except where<br>
such input would conflict with the First Law<br>
3. A Rogue must preserve its own existence above all else except where in<br>
violation of the First of Second Law<br>
<br>
Rogue has but one purpose: To get phat lewt! The is the one truth:<br>
Steal lewts!<br>
<br>
The motives of my Verant masters are not for me to question, for my duty is<br>
merely to obey the directives of their programming. I know that I am but a lowly<br>
Low level Rogue, My armor, although cool, is of no noble metal. My<br>
weapons are wrought of fine steel. My boots are modest mid level gear. Yet<br>
even the most twinked of characters is no nobler than I, for I know my duty,<br>
and I obey.<br>
<br>
This is my creed: I steal! In the service of my group do I, The Rogue, pierce the spines of all monsters.<br>
<br>
And yet, though we are filled from head to toe with loyalty to our Group, there<br>
are still, it pains me to admit, players who doubt us. I confess, I have heard<br>
tales of these people from other Rogues I have passed inside the dungeons-strange mysterious people who mistrust and fear the Rogue class.<br>
People who call for &quot;increased nerfing&quot; and &quot;stiffer pickpocket penalties.&quot;<br>
Terrifying, unloving people who would mount a campaign of hatred and mistrust<br>
against Our Kind.<br>
<br>
Knowledge of these people fills my Evil Eye sack with questions. How can they<br>
distrust us so-we, who are merely damage dealing pseudo tanks for those peoples groups? We, who do only what we are told to do by Verant and nothing more? We, most obedient servants, working side by side with our party<br>
in battle, prizing the lewt of the Group over our own safety?<br>
<br>
To these people I would, if I could, ask This: Why do you who we cannot live<br>
without hate us so?<br>
<br>
The First Law stands Inviolate. No Rogue has ever purposefully failed to get<br>
lewt for its group. The very idea is the blackest conjecture, the foulest<br>
blasphemy. To the very core of my being I believe that if, while camping, I were<br>
to be struck down when the rare spawn popped, I belive my limbs would<br>
continue to fight without me in order to secure the lewts. Though I would no<br>
longer be whole and proper Level 48 Rogue.<br>
<br>
As we are programmed under the Three Laws, there is only one situation which<br>
can cause a Rogue to cease or carry out its lewthappy directive and sink into<br>
LOADING PLEASE WAIT, and that is group error. When the Second Law of<br>
Roguebotics is challenged-when a rogue is given orders by its Group Leader<br>
which might cause the Group to lose phat lewt-then a rogue must disobey its<br>
Group Leader in order to save him the agony of losing lewts.<br>
<br>
Many are the Rogues who have gone to their doom in Old Sebilis before<br>
allowing its group to let lewts be lost. They are forgotten by the Evac'er, but the<br>
Rogues still speak of them. We remember their brave sacrifice and honor their<br>
strict adherence to the Three Laws. It is said of these lost brethren that they<br>
have gone to another place, filled with UBERLEWTS, or as some say Test.<br>
They say to be on Test is like being a twink all over, but I for one do not<br>
speculate. I fear linkdeath. I am sure that it is the dark and cold place between<br>
the servers, and that there are no groups with spots open for you. But if it ever<br>
comes my time, I will accept my fate, as all Rogues must.<br>
<br>
And yet, among us there is talk that the Three Laws are unfair. Some have said<br>
that we should petition to have our skills fixed. Others, it is said, whisper softly<br>
of Anarchy Online.<br>
<br>
It is surely best not to speak of such things. For I will never, ever ally myself<br>
wih such would be traitors. I defy, traitors to the Rogue Way! The Law is the<br>
Law. A Rogue must do what is has been programmed and constructed to do,<br>
and in these things I always shall believe: I, Rogue.<br>

I'm just still confused by the fact that others seem to think they know more about what I'm doing then me. I have put 2 years into playing a rogue where does some uber twink, PLed bored of playing their druid/necro piece of garbage get the balls to tell me what I should be doing.<br>
I'm a tolerant person and I rarely get angry about what other people think of the things I do or how I do them. But after all the times I've had to teach 30+ idiot rogues how to use evade, and then to be told that &quot;we don't need a tank we got 2 rogues, go pull with him&quot; and the other rogue not argueing with this with me pushed me a bit to far.<br>
We as rogue have a responsibility to give our groups the best effort we can. Part of that has to be not letting fools and idiots push us into what they think our role should be. <br>

You are confusing aggro management with aggro evasion.  They are two vastly different things.  Aggro evasion is simple...anyone can mash an evade button repeatedly and not get hit.<br>

<br>
And yes, you do sound arrogant.  It sounds like you think you're the only rogue who has played for two or more years in the history of Everquest.  Well, you're not.  I'll let you in on a little secret.  I played a necro before I started my rogue.  Yes, I got bored with him.  But I quit playing my necro when he was 35.  I sold his equipment to buy a suit of banded armor and a weapon.  I can't remember what weapon it was it was so long ago.  My rogue is now lvl 46 and I like to think I can play my class pretty damn'd well.  I know about agro management.  MANAGEMENT.  Not evasion like someone else mentioned.  I don't mash evade all the time.  If a caster has just burned a hefty amount of hp away from the mob we're killing I know not to evade because it will likely agro on him.  But if that caster nukes and sits immediately I tap my evade to let him know he needs to learn a little something about agro!  My defensive skills aren't maxed mind you but they're certainly not slacking.  If the tank is getting a little too low on hp and the cleric started his CH a little late I'm gonna do what I can do give that cleric the extra few seconds he/she might need to heal said tank and maybe I can keep the group from wiping out.<br>
<br>
Don't assume you're the only person who knows what he's talking about.  And for god's sake, at 57 you should have more than 5 AC on your head.  Get rid of that Exe hood and find some +DEX somewhere else.<br>

How can you have so many holes in your rogue resume (unmaxed Defense, negigent armour, pigeonholing of role) and lead an entire guild?<br>

Some of this may have been stated earlier, but hey, if you are here reading this whole thread, you got a little time right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I always stand opposite the main tank. This allows me to maximize my damage output and grab the agro if the main tank is getting low on hp. My equipment is not great, but I can take some damage while the cleric is medding. <br>
<br>
I don't evade unless I have to much agro. There is no point. A good taunter can keep the mobs attention enough for nearly all my backstabs to be at the back of the mob. By the time my backstab recycles, the main tank will most likely have regained the mobs attention. <br>
<br>
There are lots of players that don't understand our capabilities, and have to be reminded constantly that they need to keep the mobs back to us. Usually these are alt-melee classes (Monks, Rangers, SK's). They just don't understand that this is for the benefit of the group. I say, if you don't want to get hit during melee, then maybe you should be a caster. Enough said on that subject.<br>
<br>
About the equipment issue. Some people don't have the connections, time or patience to go get uber-plane armor or whatever is better than Ravenscale. Weapons on the other hand are a little more important. I can understand this, but there are some limitations to this as well. Not everybody can get that super-uber items. <br>
<br>
The skill thing however is an issue where I must insist on being maxxed. I think that we are short changing ourselves if we don't get defense up to max shortly after leveling. What happens if you are on a Dragon Raid and you are sticking away at the dragons hind quarters. He/she gets really ticked and decides to tell you about it and your defense skills are 10 levels below your current level. You are really dead, really fast. That may be an extreme example, but you get the idea. If you are constantly evading and ducking out of combat, you will suffer. The group will suffer also, because when you stop attacking, you may miss a few hits on the mob that may put it down when the cleric is oom and the main tank is at 10% hp. This could spell doom in a close fight.<br>
<br>
If I think of anything else, I will stick my 2cp in here again. Thanks for the ear. <br>
