You have to give us a tidbit at least once a week.  I would say a better goal would be twice a week.  Really, you cannot create this much just to slowly fade away.  You have a good thing going here, NOW FINISH IT, AND GET IT PUBLISHED!!!  The way I see it, you have about ten more chapters to go.  It may seem like alot but you could crank it out if you wanted and then you would have something to shop to a publisher.<br>

Thanks for the encouragement everyone.  My intention is to start writing a bit every day, so there should be a lot more to read.  I have been editing the original as well (the only thing I was really able to do writing-wise while I was gone), and once everything is finished, the whole story, I will send it completed with the revisions to anyone who wants it.<br>

Now don't get lazy and cut it short.  There is still plenty of development to be had here not to mention building climax and all that. I'm thinking nothing less of ten more chapters, 15 pages each.  Sorry, to put this all on you but you really have a good thing going here and I want to see you get it published.<br>

Scuttle offered to take first watch, for which Talia was grateful.  She was exhausted from the brutal combat with the orc Shaman.  She was asleep within moments.<br>
<br>
Scuttle poked a small stick in the embers of the small campfire, the crossbow resting on his lap.  He lost himself in the thoughts and child-like fascination of a typical halfling.  Fireflies danced in the darkness beyond the firelight.  He listened to the sounds of the forest the insects chirping and creaking echoed in the night.  It seemed that the forest had forgotten the lumbering Orc army that marched through it only hours ago.<br>
<br>
Scuttle suddenly sat very still and cocked his head to one side, listening intently, trying to ignore the sounds of the forest.  Something was moving beyond the light.  It was moving slowly and steadily towards him.  He stood up and brought the crossbow to his shoulder, and stepped towards the sounds, positioning the fire behind him.  He decided it was definitely not a predator.  No predator made stalked prey with that much noise and commotion.  It was moving closer.  Scuttle lowered his head at an angle, and eyed the sight on the crossbow.  He could now see an occasional branch from a bush being pushed or moved by the approaching creature.  He followed the movement with the crossbow, keeping careful aim as the unidentified beast moved towards the light.<br>
<br>
Scuttle saw some sort of yellowish-red fur between the branches of one of the bushes.  He touched the trigger on the weapon, and the weapon charged, pulling the prod back, a glowing bolt appearing in the nock.  Scuttle steadied the weapon and prepared to fire.<br>
<br>
Into the firelight, from behind the last bush that blocked Scuttles vision, a large canine head poked its way into the clearing.  The dog hobbled its way towards the halfling, limping from a wound on its rear leg.  The dog whined softly, lay down on the ground, and painfully inched its way towards Scuttle.  Shaggy red fur painted with its own blood covered the dog.  Its tail swished back and forth slowly as it approached Scuttle.  It was obviously in a lot of pain from the wound, and thought that the halfling could help it.<br>
<br>
Scuttle looked back at the still sleeping Talia, who obliviously slept through the dogs approach.  He decided that Talia must be severely exhausted.  She would have immediately woken to the slightest sound.  That fight with the Shaman must have really taken a toll on her.  He shook his head sadly and turned back to the dog.  It sat at the edge of the firelight, whimpering quietly, its tail brushing back and forth across the forest floor.  Intelligent eyes watched the halfling closely, seeming to beg him to help.<br>
<br>
Scuttle placed the crossbow carefully on the ground next to him and pulled a piece of rabbit from the remainder of their unfinished meal.  He held the scrap of meat in front of him and sympathetically made his way towards the dog.<br>
<br>
Good puppy, he whispered quietly.  The dogs long, floppy ears perked up at the high pitched sound of the halflings voice.  It tilted its head to the side curiously.  Thats a good dog.  Come here.  He bent down and held the scrap out to the dog, gently tapping an open hand against his thigh.  The dog slowly scrambled its way to Scuttle, tail wagging in earnest.<br>
<br>
It came within reach of the food, and put its head down on the ground, whining and gazing longingly at the food, but too wary to take it from the halflings outstretched hand.  Scuttle placed the food on the ground in front of the dog, and gently rubbed the dogs head.  The canine still kept its head on the ground, but followed the halflings movements with the strangely intelligent eyes.  Scuttle cautiously ran his hands across the dogs flanks, unsure of what the dogs reaction would be to nearing the wounded leg.  He continued to pet the dogs flank and examined the wounded leg.  A jagged slash ran across the dogs right rear leg.  Scuttle could see torn muscle and exposed bone in the wound.  It looked bad, but not fatal.  He watched the dog expectantly and examined the wound closer.  The dog flinched slightly, but did not snap at the little rogue.  Scuttle decided that the dog trusted him enough for him to try to bandage up the wound.  He went to get his pack to retrieve some strips of cloth and some salve.<br>
<br>
He grabbed his supplies and returned to the injured dog.  Its head lying across its front paws, it watched the halfling draw near.  The dog still had not touched the scrap of rabbit sitting in front of his nose.<br>
<br>
Go on puppy.  Eat it.  Ill bet youre hungry.  The dog scooted forward, and delicately nipped at the food.  Scuttle stared at the dog.  A dog with manners?  What kind of dog nibbles food?  Most dogs just swallow food whole!  Ive never heard of such a thing!  Scuttle shrugged at the oddity, and began his version of bandaging wounds.  Fortunately, for the dog, Scuttle applied the salve, relieving the pain, and doing more to heal the wound than the halflings meager skill would possibly heal.<br>
<br>
Whats going on Scuttle?  Talias sleepy voice nearly scared the little rogue out of his skin.  <br>
<br>
Talia, Scuttle scolded, you really shouldnt sneak up on people like that!  This vicious creature could have taken my hands off!  The dog continued to rest its head on its front paws, watching Talia now, its tail sweeping leaves and pine needles back and forth while it slowly wagged its tail.<br>
<br>
Ahh, sorry about that Scuttle.  I can see you barely have control.  Keep up the good work, and be careful.  Talia smirked and shook her head, laughing to herself at her friend.  She went back to the fire, sat down facing the halfling, and watched him trying desperately to bind the wound of his patient.  She wondered at the dog.  The animal seemed so patient, more so than any normal dog.  She knew of no animal that would put up with the inept healing that Scuttle was trying to inflict upon the poor creature.  Despite the blundering healing, the dog only flinched occasionally, looking back not with annoyance at the halfling, but almost amusement.  Amusement?  What am I talking about?  Its a dog!  She laughed at herself, and turned back to the fire, placing in another small piece of wood.<br>
<br>
Scuttle finished with his healing, and came back to the fire.  The dog rose to its feet, standing nearly as tall as the halfling, and hobbled after him.  Talia watched the dog follow Scuttle to the fire.  Despite the injury, the dog moved with a fluid grace.  Even as the dog moved the few steps towards the fire, the bandages fell away from the wound.  Looks like you made a new friend, eh Scuttle?<br>
<br>
I guess so.  I wonder where he came from.  Scuttle sat next to Talia, the dog immediately lay next to him.  Scuttle absently scratched the dog behind the ears.<br>
<br>
Talia leaned back against a large rounded boulder, teasing the fire with a broken branch.  Scuttle desperately tried to stifle a yawn.  Scuttle, go ahead and sleep.  Ill take the next watch.<br>
<br>
Oh, Im okay Talia.  I will just kind of rest my head on my pack.  He shifted around, placing his pack as a pillow.  Ill just lay here and talk to you.  Just to keep you awake.<br>
<br>
Talia smiled at the little halfling, noting the small snoring sound and closed eyes that indicated he was already well on his way to sleeping through the night.<br>
