<br>
plz put out the flames before you leave<br>
<br>
to say it is a test server is a joke, and i dont even know why you call it that, maybe your jealous , /shrug i dunno.<br>
<br>
it hasnt been the greatest thing ever I have to admit, not having maps in game is annoying, maybe they can change that.<br>
<br>
having 5 gms on at a time is kinda cool.. and these are gm's not guides.<br>
<br>
ive had more events in the last few days then all my eq career, which is something different, not all of us want to raid.<br>
<br>
Im actually suprised that the number of &quot;uber people&quot; that are there.  THere is a guild called township rebellion who can do ANYTHING.. and i mean ANYTHING.. lvl 60, epic, all keys.. ALL KEYS ! seems to be the entry.. not that im saying they great im just giving you a scope of wot its like on the server atm.<br>
<br>
Going to zones that have 20 people in is nice.. not empty but not over-crowded and the player base is generally a whole lot &quot;mature&quot; to what i have experienced in the past.<br>
<br>
As for the other zones like cazic thule skyfire etc.. they kinda cool.. Cazik thule has turned into kael / tov inbetween.. mostly unmezzable and hit pretty hard.. well damn hard actually.. seen a mini cazic in their somewhere and there seems to be a RoF sorta quest deep down.<br>
<br>
As for the events ? atm they kinda suck but are great as well.. the gm's are still finding their feet and everyone seems to want to be at a gm event atm.. that will slow down im hoping.  Yesterday 200 people was in ak'arakon (sp).. we all got into two guilds,,.. one turned into giant gnomes and one into minotaurs and fought.. was kinda of a cool event.. <br>
<br>
Lag isnt much of a issue coz its stated clearly by any gm that all equipment used on this server is the latest etc.<br>
<br>
To all those people who are moaning about not getting new stuff at the same time, non-dynamic content, new equipment, the 24hr support etc.. You dont pay for a first class ticket to sit in the luggage hold.<br>
<br>
8000 people max on one server btw.. spread over a 24hr time period that isnt a massive amount of people.<br>

K.<br>
<br>
Why would that be?<br>
<br>
I'm just not stupid enough to join the server full of the<br>
problem children from lots of DIFFERENT servers looking<br>
for a new, fresh start.<br>
<br>
Not everyone on Stormhammer, of course, but I know a<br>
lot of them from several different servers who are doing<br>
it for this general purpose.<br>
<br>
And we already have enough 60s on Druzzil-Ro, thanks, don't<br>
need to get a server that has MORE.<br>
<br>
Or were you implying that somehow you were more UBER than<br>
I cause you could pay a WHOLE $40 DOLLAH! and I couldn't.<br>
<br>
Yeah, that's it.  $40 would just kill me.  Bwahahaha..<br>
<br>
Anyway.<br>
<br>
Have fun on Stormhammer, but please, I beg you, don't dredge<br>
up some delusion that you are somehow better.  Thanks for<br>
the Beta testing, take care.<br>

<br>
That doesnt make sense to me, explain to me please, why would you moan about this if it does not affect you in some way ?<br>
<br>
Havent had any problems with problem people as you call it<br>
<br>
Q : Why would a complete ass on one server move to another server which has 20x as many GM's ?<br>
<br>
Whats wrong with lots of lvl 60 ?<br>
<br>
having trouble &quot;communicating&quot; with your peers ?<br>
<br>
What is drizzle row ?<br>
<br>
Never did I say $40 dollarz would make me more uber than anyone, but it does get me away from lil stinky boy who cant stop complaining about how other people spend their money.<br>
<br>
You delussions of me thinking that I am &quot;better&quot; than you leave me boggled.. i mean can you even read ? go back up and re-read the parts I even talked about &quot;myself&quot;.<br>
<br>
0 ? zero ? zilch ?<br>
<br>
I give a perpective of what I see the new server as, and you gotta jump on my case like a housewife losing her prozac 'scription..<br>

I enjoyed reading your account of Stormhammer. It actually filled in some blanks that I had not heard of before. I did not see where you said you were better than  any of us.<br>
<br>
Your response to the miguided flame was strong, reasonable, and very entertaining. <br>
<br>
To those of you who think you are not getting enough for your $10, please just cancel your account. I don't know what is wrong with people that drives them to endless pathetic complaining. You spend all your energy just devising ways that Verant is, has, and will wrong you with every action they take. Give it a rest and just enjoy the damn game for once.<br>
