You have the distinct impression that she can see right into the darkest shadows of your soul.  She opens her mouth to speak but the sounds you hear come from inside your mind.  'Greetings mortal, thank you for releasing me from my [tormented prison]. <br>You say, 'what tormented prison'<br>The Spirit of Akelha`Ra appears to be fading in and out of existence as you speak to her.  The spirit's voice fills your mind. 'I am Akelha`Ra, once high priestess of Luclin and leader of the Akheva.  This form you see before you now is a fading remnant of my former existence.  The storm was the cause of my imprisonment in the world of undying [spirits]. <br><br>You say, 'what spirit'<br>The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'We Akheva are immortal entities placed in this plane by the mistrees of shadow.  We are her most perfect creation.  Death has no meaning to us, as even in death we find rebirth through the power of the mistress.  My imprisonment was caused by my seperation from the power of the mistress by [Atenha`Ra].  It was she who sent the storm to destroy me and all that followed me. '<br><br>You say, 'who is atenha ra'<br>The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'It is more then a little ironic that Atenha`Ra is a reflection of myself.  An entity created from my own consciousness, a reflection of a shadow.  She now holds the seat of grand power in [Vex Thal], and I have not the power to gain entry to the city, let alone face her. You must find my scepter that was lost in the storm to gain entry to Vex Thal.  The scepter has likely lost much of it's power from being shattered.  Once it is reassembled you will need to merge a Orb of Luclinite with a source of celestial power inside the scepter.  The spirits whisper that the emperor of the Shissar holds the power to manipulate such energy.  Be weary of him, he is heralded as the slayer of gods, the defiler of realities. '<br><br>You say, 'what vex thal'<br>The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'Vex Thal is the sacred home of the Akheva.  The place where Luclin's power directly touches this world...ungh...I can not summon the frame of my scepter in my current weakened state.  I need a soul to regain my pow...'  As she speaks you can see her slowly fade out of existence.  You wonder how long her spirit will stay with this world.  She seems entirely unable to speak to you now, and can only muster the strength to point at the ground at Dimi 's feet.  Dimi reaches down a picks up a small emerald off the ground, but it disappears silently into the shadows.  Akelha`ra looks as if she is trying to speak again. '<br><br>You say, 'what frame of your scepter'<br>The Spirit of Akelha`Ra opens her mouth to speak, but the voice in your head is no longer audible.  You reach forward to touch the fading shadow of a creature and draw back in horror as your hand disrupts the spirit before you.  She evaporates into the shadows once more. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usymitry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Symitry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 1:03:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4704.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Frame of scepter(VT key?)</span><hr size=1> give her an essence emerald? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=yayanono>Yayanono</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 1:44:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4704.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dont suppose</span><hr size=1> You would like to tell us how to spawn the Spirit before asking us how to continue? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unikedemus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nikedemus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 1:46:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4704.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Frame of scepter(VT key?)</span><hr size=1> Essence Emerald does sound like a good thing to try.<br><br>-Teebbasie <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unarith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Narith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 1:49:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4704.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dont suppose</span><hr size=1> Sounds like she needs an esscence emerald....
