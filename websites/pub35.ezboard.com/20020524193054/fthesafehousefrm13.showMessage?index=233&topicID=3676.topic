<br>
When you kill vampyres in TM, you get Nathyn up, Coterie/Valdanov down. However, when you turn in vampire items for faction quests in katta, you get Katta (Concillum, etc.) up, Coterie down, Nathyn -down-.  So, what faction do you get when you kill Katta guards? Nathyn up or down?<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm thinking this quest may be similar to the Earring of Veracity quest in SSeru -- you maybe end up having to eventually take down the city where the quest itself started, because of some corruption (i.e. vampire in the high ranks of Katta that Nathyn knows of for some reason).  Anyone here hunt in Katta much? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uisidien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isidien</A> at: 4/11/02 9:53:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upedriccuf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pedric Cuf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/11/02 9:59:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3676.topic&index=234>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Valdanov Zevfeer quest</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah, I'm there tons.

Sorry, just wanted to post this since about every 2 pages people start talking about items that have already been discussed. Only thing that terrifies me is doing this entire quest all over again if for some reason there is some spawned mob that we all missed on the turnin after killing the 4 spawned shades.<br>

I also didnt sleep well last night...err havent all week, so I am a bit foggy headed.  Please be patient if I somehow missed these:<br>
<br>
Found this in Allakhazams in some Quest list section (not the Quests by Zone, there is a separate listing)<br>
<br>
1) There is an &quot;Assassins in Katta quest that yields the following faction hits:&quot;<br>
Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better. <br>
                  Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better. <br>
                  Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better. <br>
                 ** Your faction standing with Nathyn Illuminious got worse. **<br>
                  Your faction standing with Coterie of the Eternal Night got worse. <br>
                  Your faction standing with Seru got worse. <br>
                  Your faction standing with Hand of seru got worse. <br>
                  Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse. <br>
                  Your faction standing with Hand of Legionnaries got worse. <br>
<br>
Plus the post above showing that Nathyn likes guardkillers. <br>
<br>
2) There is a &quot;grave robbers&quot; quest that appears to have two actions or quests from the starting npc:<br>
<br>
 Yurddle the Caretaker says 'Greetings stranger. It's nice to have visitors of the living sort. Seems like my work here is never done. When I'm not having  to dig fresh graves and keep the mausoleum clean I'm having to refill old graves that have been dug up by the [restless dead] or them disrespectful  [grave robbers]! <br>
<br>
The &quot;grave robbers&quot; trigger phrase leads into all those ethereal energy weapons.  But I dont see where the &quot;restless dead&quot; part has been followed up.  Brell is down, or I would check myself.<br>
<br>
3) Different bloods- I agree that the akheva blood seems likely.  However this quote from the book looted from the imprisoned shade... :<br>
<br>
&quot;Tegi: the bloods of the various sub-species are quite facinating. Although not nourishing enough to sustain a  vampyres physical needs the blood seems to increase the vampiric bodies to certain elemental forces while at the same time decreasing others. The effects of the blood are fully dependant on a presumed elemental affinity the  various clans of Tegi possess.&quot;<br>
<br>
..seems to provide a lead.  I know people have said they havent seen Tegi blood,  but I think I have.  Just dont recall where.  I have killed Tegi in Scarlet Desert, Umbral Plains and Maidens Eye, as well as Tenebrous Mountains.  At this point what I remember seems to point to the Tro Jeg on the mesa in SD.  For those who say they have never seen it- have you hunted the various clans in SD?  <br>
<br>
4) The dogs and the single- named vamps.  I wonder if you can give something to these fellows in their &quot;dog&quot; form that triggers the next step.  I believe their ability to cycle between the two is significant.  Maybe it is important to this quest?<br>
<br>
I think I am done with my musings.  Be gentle <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I no longer have my Katta Badge of service as i turned it in to someone with hopes of finding Val, in Katta as a spawned mob... no luck, they just ate my badge.<br>
After running around in Twilight Sea some, i noticed there's a Legonierre laying down just left of the katta/twilight zone, if you look out from Katta and follow the left wall... Legionierre Halle i belive her name is, is laying on the shore.<br>
When she's hailed she asks for help, and as i offer to help her she mentions she has information that can only be shared to a trusted member of Katta.<br>
I belive i'm amiably to most of Katta at this point, and i'm not sure if i "simply" have to kill lots and lots of vampires to gain high enough faction with her for her to speak to me... OR if handing in the Badge of service will get her to talk.<br>
<br>
When asking Phenic about Legonierre Halle he replies that he has not heard from her in a few days and wonder if i'm carrying words from her...<br>
<br>
Am i totally out or track here ? is Halle for a diffrent quest perhaps or does she indeed have valuble info about a certain Valdanov Zevfeer ?<br>

Hobolor Peltskinner says 'Allo there stranger! Taking up the fine trade of tailoring are ye? Well then you came to the right place! I got all kinds of supplies that you need to get started. '<br>
<br>
Pilop Stolarix says 'Allo there Rookwing. Take a look at these fantastic contraptions I have for sale! '<br>
<br>
None of them responded to questions about their missing relatives or Valdanov <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Perhaps though, we can infer that Valdanov may also be a shorty? Anyone ever question the crazy gnome in Umbral about Valdanov? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udarjeeling.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darjeeling</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 8:14:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3676.topic&index=241>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have read through this thread AT least once (yesterday</span><hr size=1> Interesting point, but probably unrelated to this: One of the mages in the tower in Katta has the same last name as one of the vampyres in the tower.

I tried a few lines: who is your brother, who are you, what about Sterbla, etc.. but no response. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utalrasprexus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talras Prexus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 9:18:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3676.topic&index=242>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have read through this thread AT least once (yesterday</span><hr size=1> I strongly don't believe Valdanov is in VT. Vex Thal is a very high-end game zone, and if you look at the quest itself, it is not very difficult. Why would it go from easy, to near impossible to complete? Maybe I am wrong though, you never know with Verant, but the reward better be damn good if it requires a VT key :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=3676.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=3676.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3676.topic&index=242><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3676.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=3676.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3676.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3676.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
