An Open Letter to SOE</span><hr size=1> Something I've been thinking about for a while.... something i wanted to get a public opinion on as well.<br>
<br>
There are two ways that an item can enter the game of 'everquest' at the high end.  <br>
<br>
The first of which is to create a difficult 'encounter' that is triggerable once a week.  Such encounters that come to mind are NTOV, Tormax, AoW, and the like.  Basically its one monster or one encounter that drops a set number of items (average of 3) per spawn.  That spawn is set to happen about once a week, so that each of these encounters provide 3 items on a weekly basis.<br>
<br>
The second type of encounter is the long camp type encounter.  This idea works off of the basis that the encounter in question may be triggered many many times during that same 7 day span, making that item drop very rarely from the encounter, so that if it is farmed 24 hours a day only 3 items from that encounter enter the game.  Examples of this can be seen in Plane of Mischeif, but also plane of sky, Temple of Ssra, etc.  These encounters require massive manhours to obtain the same 3 items average per week.<br>
<br>
Are you with me so far?  If not, cut and paste this line and reply to it.  If not, lets discuss what we agree on.<br>
<br>
The type 1 encounters are definately prefered by the majority of high end gamers.  The mob spawns, you kill it, you loot it.  One evening spent. 1-4 hours for the encounter, and everyone goes away happy.  If this is your only encounter you wish to 'farm' this week, you now have 6 days in which to eat, work, watch tv, sleep, or otherwise find something else to do with your life.<br>
<br>
The problem with type 1 encounters is that they are highly contested.  Once it spawns, it is literally mayhem on some servers trying to be the one to 'nab' that spawn.  Ragefire confrontations tear guilds apart, racing to NTOV can be downright dirty, and GM's can sometimes be involved in these confrontations.<br>
<br>
Type 2 encounters aren't very well liked by most players.  Most encounters that require this kind of time investment are mostly vacant across most servers (plane of mischeif and plane of sky especially), mostly because of the man hours required to complete these high end items.  While some of the items are well worth the time investment (lets face it, a full set of caster items from POM is practically priceless), most players choose to occupy themselves with type 1 encounters instead.<br>
<br>
Okay, now are you still with me?  If not, reply and speak your mind.  Otherwise, read this.<br>
<br>
We know now that type 2 encounters are probably considered a 'good thing' by the company who is currently designing PoP.  We've seen it in Luclin several times now... and the model isnt as HORRID as PoM and PoS, as they are 'farmable items' that once you posses, you do not have to farm again.  Once you are Seru enabled, you are seru enabled (except keys of course, but 1 key gets 51 people onto the raid).  Hopefully once you are SSRA enabled, you're done with it.  This isnt the worst business model.<br>
<br>
So using this model for designing content SPARINGLY is a good idea.  10% of PoP like this... fine.  Go for it.  But for the love of all that is holy, please do not make even a third of PoP this type of encounter.  Only the most obsessive guilds even consider going this route, and honestly, that content is something that 80% of the high end players will never see.  If you ship a product that is 1/3 unplayable by the general populace... AGAIN.... You're going to lose numbers. <br>
<br>
Yes, I know you are proud of the fact that you now have '430,000 subscribers' and yes I know that is more than you've ever had.  But we both know that most of that is new players, not older players who are still content to play.  Even the most obessive players have found luclin to be a breaking point.... and if PoP ships in this manner, its just not going to be pretty.<br>
<br>
Finally, let me say one more thing about these encounters.  Ring of Fire type content is great.  But when creating this type of content, like all good things, it needs to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  The cazic thule ring is a good example.  The ring of fire acrylia events... well, isnt exactly what players want.<br>
<br>
Remember, rings are great, but model them after type 1 encounters, not type 2.  I think most players will agree on that =p<br>
<br>
Anyways, this was long, and I hope people have a few things to say about it.  If not, tell me where to go stick it =p<br>

<br>
I'd also like to see a few more options for Coldain Ring/Shawl , Investigator Badge/monk shackle/iksar cudgel type quests. I doubt we'll see many of these as they haven't even finished the shawls and probably never will (heard the guy who made these just quit SOE, anyone confirm?), but they're a fun way for loot to enter the game. Lots of intermediate rewards, really nice items as you near the end even for mid-level/size guilds (ie 9th ring), and a badass reward for the high end guilds (ie 10th ring). At the same time you've got a nice storyline you're following with lots of scripted events and interaction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthorilan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thorilan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/15/02 4:33:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23310.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Time investment VS long spawn times.

An Open Letter to </span><hr size=1> Well...<br>
<br>
Actually I think they are both lousy models based upon the reasons you gave.  I wish I could suggest something better...<br>
<br>
The type #1 encounter doesn't scale as servers get more crowded.  The competition just increases.<br>
<br>
The type #2 encounter drives people to suffer endlessly from boredom and repetition with, potentially, nothing to show for many hours of frustration.<br>
<br>
The ring type of thing could potentially be a lot of fun, but there's a couple of issues with it too.  You've got to bring a force large enough to handle the big guy but they'll overwhelm the ring in the earlier stages.  It'll be boring, laggy, etc.<br>
<br>
What could be an improvement on the ring encounters is having it so groups can be working on various rings and come together for the final encounter.  Off in different parts of the dungeon.  Perhaps rather than &quot;surprise here's your boss mob!&quot; the penultimate spawn would be a mob that just stands around for a few minutes while you call the rest of the troops in.  Then you hand him something and spawn the big guy.<br>
<br>
I think some of the competition over spawns will ease if they add more content and more servers and thin the population a bit.  Or if another game comes out that siphons people off.  Or they could make the spawn rates dependent on server populations or something.   <p><a href="http://nmcs.com/kingscourt/images/toocool.jpg">The Blues Sisters</a><br><font size=1><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8428">Panamah,<em> Assassin elf</em></a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8188"><font size=1>Electrae, <em>Miracle Elf</em></a>

And this basic fact promotes ALL players to be able to gain loot depending on their social preferences.<br>
<br>
These type 2 encounters you speak of allow for similar quality loot from smaller groups.  Plane of Sky isnt as good an example, b/c it is an old zone that has been sparsely updated beyond quest endings, but it still fits the pattern.  Plane of Mischeif is the poster child for this type of encounter.  PoM can be cleared by 2 people if they're good enough, and by almost ANY full group.  Yes it takes more time for those ppl, but what you're missing is this.<br>
<br>
Type 1<br>
30ppl * 4hours = 120 man hours total.<br>
Type 2<br>
2ppl * 60 hours = 120 man hours total.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that in PoM you can have multiple chars played by a single person to, in effect, make it a MORE efficient encounter in the end.  To you, being in a Type 1 capable guild, may not appreciate the value of that.  Lately I've no need for that kind of activity, but at one point in time I was uncomfortable with all &quot;high-end&quot; guilds/sects on my server.  Instead, 5 friends and I all created our own little guild and spent a great deal of time looking for anything that one perfect group could accomplish.  At that time, post-K/pre-V, there wasnt much in the way of that type, but we found things to get into anyway.  Had there been a PoM at that point in time we'd have been in heaven.<br>
<br>
Tho I no longer look for single group raid encounter style play, I know there must still be people in those situations out there.  Whether they're just at odds with said uber-guild or whether they have odd, unreliable, play schedules or just wont join a larger guild for any reason, I feel that PoM style encounters are very valuable to the &quot;average&quot; high end player.  So its not FOR everyone, granted, but what you miss when you get entrenched in NTOV/AoW style events is that those arent for everyone either.  <br>
<br>
I think the best possible answer to this would be that type 2 encounters be refined to limit involvement to only one group.  Have a zone max or say make a zone only accessible to one group at a time.  Problematic for sure, but if we're speaking in the hypothetical here lets propose solutions other than, please dont do this again.  I say do it again, but do it right.<br>
If PoM were a zone, accessible other than NToV, and limited to no more than 6 ppl at a time, perhaps even with a single point of entry, so that only one group could, 'port' in at a time, similiar to the luclin ports, it would be far more effective.  Then the card drops could be set back a bit, to slightly more common than now and not have the capability of being a open floodgate.<br>

<br>
WHY do you all go to &quot;raids&quot;.... is it fun? Or is it loot at the end?<br>
<br>
I think all take the mindnumbingly boring encounters just to get loot. And this cannot be right.... I want fun dammit.<br>
<br>
Take the Rogue epic for example.... it is FUN, it is mostly doable by yourself..... the plane of hate trip is plain awesome if you do it yourself. <br>
<br>
Why must all quests be <br>
a) a super rare spawn with a super rare drop required, which adds up to a super super super rare item...<br>
<br>
or<br>
b) need at least 150 super equipped lvl 60 with at least 100 aaexp points <br>
<br>
????<br>
<br>
Why aren't there more quests than the rogue epic?<br>
<br>
I play a necro as a main.... where is the fun in doing fear 50 times and still see no slimeblood drop?<br>
<br>
A very good feature would be, that only one group is allowed to zone in at a time.... and if you have gone beyond a trigger door or something, you cannot go back and the next group is allowed to port in. So you have some other option than the 2 damn boring options above.<br>
<br>
And please... remove the no drop thingy... let the economy roll. So that casual players can get good loot. <br>
<br>
And please.... make the trade skills useful....  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
