<br>
Both of you argue that the main reason Mill does so little damage and gets hit so hard is due to the envervating poison the Inf hits him with..<br>
<br>
i.e. You're calling it a balanced fight because the poison lowered his melee output.<br>
<br>
However, neither of you respond when an SB points out that we don't have enough spec points to spec high in melee AND get the enervating poison (probably the 47 one) that the Inf in question is using.<br>
<br>
I don't deny that Penetration is likely a slash inf, but Mill also uses slash, both are L50, and both are in leather. So this shouldn't be an issue. A thrust Inf would likely do less damage, but the ability to spec to 50 Thrust/Slash AND use the 47 debuff and/or Lifebane is what makes the two classes unbalanced in my eyes.<br>
<br>
In effect, the spec points make all the difference. If Mill were able to use the 47+ poisons, the fight would have likely been much more even..<br>
<br>
I'm all for debate, but at least argue the points fairly. You both repeat the same thing without looking at it from both sides of the coin.. everyone is being very obstinate here and I doubt anyone is looking at this with an objective eye. If anything, Elaa's points were the most convincing, as NS's are generally considered sub-par and unable to hold their own in a fight with an Inf or SB .. I think she proves her point that SB melee power has been nerfed quite a bit recently, much more so than the needless rhetoric from everyone else..<br>
<br>
P.S.: Unbuffed logs are great, but the vast majority of fights have at least 1 party that is buffed quite a bit, if not both parties. So I don't see what an unbuffed fight would do to convince anyone, you're much more likely to be fighting buffed (or at least your opponent will be) than unbuffed. Either way, an unbuffed test would complement a buffed test case, not override it.<br>

 <br>
He is however hitting for much less than normal because of the STR debuff component of enervating poison.  Therefore comparing his debuffed hits against someone's (likely buffed) hits is completely dishonest.<br>
<br>
It was Mill's spec choice to not go with envenom.  An Infiltrator can make the same choice.  Here is a non-envenom Infiltrator template for slash.<br>
<br>
Stealth 37<br>
Slash 50<br>

SB's should have the choice to spec in thrust weapons.  Kinda unfair that they can only choose slash.  Especially since Dex is the primary stat for all assassins and Str is only tertiary.  SB's should have the option to choose a weapon type that will benefit from their primary stat just like Infs and NShades.  On the other hand, Norsemen have 10 more str and con then britons which somewhat balances this out.  <br>
<br>
But I still don't think that Infs are overpowered.   Yes, the .3 spec points Infs got is kinda nice.  But if you visit a character builder site, you'll see that it is only a small boost to an extra spec line.  It doesn't change your life.  <br>
<br>
I would trade those spec points and my x-bow for the the DD shout and spell that NightShades have.  Shout does pathetic damage, but is insta cast and really useful in RvR.  And in my opinion the NS DD spell is far, far better then the slow x-bow that Infs get.  I couldn't dream of revealing a stealther, stopping a run song or interrupting a caster or archer with my x-bow.  <br>
<br>
And despite being limited to slash, the unique abilities that SBs have are pretty good and no other assassins get them.  The 100% chance to hit w/ both weaps and apply 2 poisons in the first round is an incredible advantage.  <br>
<br>
Also, since each point in CS increases your damage cap by a measily 9pts an SB can easily afford to spec lower in CS then Infs because the super slow delay 2-H weapons they can open with will give a damage bonus equal to several levels of CS skill.  These extra points can be put into envenom to make up some of the difference between 2.2 pts and 2.5 pts.  <br>
<br>
The extra HPs SBs have is also nice.  <br>
<br>
Ultimately, when you take everything into account, there is no way that the .3 spec point advantage makes Infs vastly superior to any other assassins.  <br>

Raggok made some great points and I notice how you didn't think there was anything wrong with your damage pre 1.50 in fights with a lvl 43 against a lvl 50.

Mill argues his posts boldly and sometimes recklessly, but you are being intellectually dishonest if you are incapable of seeing the problem that he and others have pointed out. Not really shocking to me, since candidly many of the Infiltrators posting on these boards were the ones crying for the nerf in the first place. But I understand many of you feel that DF was overpowered, and it doesn't really matter what we all thought before because Mythic has made the change. Let's simply focus on the effect of Mythic's change.<br>
<br>
How about everyone take a moment and look at the real issue. Ignore Mills posts, go check out Elaa's posts about her combat with a Nightshade, who we all agree under-melee Infiltrators and then come back here and honestly tell me whether you see the problem or not. Be an assassin for once not an Infiltrator, Nightshade or Shadowblade.

<br>
&quot;Be an assassin for once not an Infiltrator, Nightshade or Shadowblade.&quot; <br>
<br>
This could have been and was said about the SB's prior to the nerf when every other assassin got whacked by them with ease and without requiring much 'skill'.<br>
<br>
The problem we are facing is that when SB's were on top they claimed all was well, yet when someone else is on top they expect everyone to jump to the cause.  I am happy to say that a lot of infils, myself included are trying to find a way to boost SB’s.  I’m not too sure but prior to this nerf did any SB’s try to help Infils? <br>
<br>

There were a few SBs who posted here often who said SBs were fine. You took their posts as some kind of statement that all SBs felt that way. I like to read Danlitus' comments and he repeatedly said nerfing SBs was not an answer, he never opposed giving Infiltrators additional damage, but the Infiltrators who posted only had 1 goal in mind, nerfing SBs. I don't support nerfs at all. Those infiltrators who posted nerf SBs should have chosen to prove through logs and research and time commitments the disparity instead of taking the easy way out and screaming NERF!<br>
<br>
I think SBs have handled themselves very well since this recent patch. I have not seen any post from a SB screaming that Infiltrators need to be nerfed. I am also thankful that many people are beginning to see how badly this patch has effected SBs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uoldmill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Old Mill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/4/02 10:16:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sover.net/~danmad/images/bigbeer.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Once again Mill you evaded my questions.</span><hr size=1> Sigh...<br>

 here we go again, I am doomed to repeat things a million times.<br>

I never said it was a good fight, I even said up front, I got jumped, screwed up, was not a good fight, but the damage is consistant, and I have posted other logs that show the same thing.<br>
<br>
Ludicrous? only thing silly here is your inability to make a point.<br>
<br>
Am I not outdamaghed, with styles and without?<br>
<br>
Oh, and you do NOT want to compare perfs. I hit him once with perf for like 500, he hits SB's for 700-900 from what I am told. My max on a  caster has been 635.<br>
<br>
Infiltrators have ALWAYS been fine, all the complaining before was totally baseless, as not one single person, ever, posted a log of a high level slash infil vs a LA Sb, never, never, never.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as me choosing to not spec envenom, you really need to do some math classes again. I HAVE to make a choice, CS, or envenom. If I lose CS, I give up a huge part of my offense vs casters, and against anything tough.<br>
<br>
453 spec points is a really big deal, period.<br>
<br>
I can not train weapons at all, choose 100% CS, stealth some envenom, and I woudl get my ass kicked all over the place, would I then be allowed to cry nerf because of that? No, btu that is exactly what many people did, when they didnt even understand that thrust/pierc vs slash is gonna lose. How can people be so dense?<br>

Assasins are not even close to balanced right now.<br>

 I seriously doubt any level 50 infiltrator in epic armor ever got killed by three DF's, even before patch. But once again, logs? I seriously have never seen a log from anyone regarding being out classed by SB's, in all my time reading this forum.<br>
<br>
My logs are not good, but they are all I have.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I got a response rom Sanya finally about the logs I sent her of pre 1.50 where I was 43, and post 1.50 when i was 50, she said<br>
<br>
oh, your damage seems similar, it must be the defensive skills of your opponents.<br>
<br>
She didnt even take in to account 7 levels difference, str relics, better weapons/buffs, nothing.<br>
<br>
she ended with this,<br>
<br>
&quot;Any idea what level those opponents were, what kind of armor they wore, etc?<br>
The damage range you're showing in Doublefrost is not very big (which was<br>
the goal, DF stayed pretty static while all the OTHER styles were improved),<br>
and can be explained entirely by the defensive capability of your enemies.<br>
<br>
I am serious about completely investigating your concerns, so I need as much<br>
detail as possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
so once again, she says they didnt change anythin, or it shoudl be less then 3% difference, well, it is an outright bold face lie, or mythic doesnt know who changed the code. Myself and especially the berserkers flood mythic with logs, they ignore them, and lie to us, it isnt right.<br>
<br>
People on the dev board still post everyday how overpowered SB's are, public perception, even if retarded, is what drives mythic, not truth.<br>

I personally cancled the account last week and I been posting/lurking hoping for some word.<br>
<br>
I had hopes with garrok and you sending and emailing folks that the 3-5%, thats really 30-50% would come to light. But I can see now that tweety is just another abashi and they are just going to ignore us, or tell us nothing is wrong till we go away.<br>
<br>
I cannot believe that the logs of you doing more damage vs level 50 folks at level 43 did not get through to her. Hello they stayed the same and your level is the main change. Yet they wrote it off as expected. Heck if thats the case then why bother to level?<br>
<br>
Anyway I have put my money where my mouth is and left the game. I may lurk a bit more here to see if they fix/rebalance anything over the next few months with spellcrafting etc. Personally with the number of anti inf posts I see now at the vault by the chain class characters from mid I expect to see them next on the chopping block. I hope not for their sake. Mythic needs to learn moderation when they fix classes. They need slight reductions with bigger additions to classes, not just blanket reductions.<br>
<br>
Anyway Mill I appriciate all your effort as a fellow shadowblade. But for me seeing that post by you just shows what I feared was right. They are not going to do anything about this. They will just wait and stall till it blows over. The classes affected are just to small a playerbase. So take some advice here....look to see if you are having fun. If so keep playing and read less message boards. If you are not having fun then do the best thing and get out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubaiultbh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baiul TBH</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.iomain.net/hounds.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 2:37:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wow mill</span><hr size=1> &quot;Infiltrators have ALWAYS been fine, all the complaining before was totally baseless, as not one single person, ever, posted a log of a high level slash infil vs a LA Sb, never, never, never.&quot;<br>

Mill, Once again you yourself have stated that your damage has been halfed.  If your damage was doubled in the fights that you yourself have provided us with you would be overpowered.  This is simple and I do not need logs to show it, plain and simple maths works fine.  You have shown us YOUR logs and they prove it. <br>
<br>
Also we need to ask the question of why Pene's damage is so different in both logs?  Any ideas?<br>

<br>
dont post trash that is never used by infils in this game,except as a lark.<br>
<br>
<br>
the template mill has is a common template,a soulblade.<br>
<br>
a compareable infil template would be <br>
<br>
50 thrust<br>
40 stealth<br>
39 cs<br>
39 envenom<br>
<br>
not <br>
50 thrust<br>
47 dw<br>
0 cs<br>
39 envenom<br>
40 stealth.<br>
<br>
lets use some reason and understanding here,not silly templates,silly statements,and flat out ignoring what people say,or butchering there posts so you can pick out part of a statement and make it misleading.<br>
<br>
the simple fact,is that people didnt spec slash as an infil,are the ones who are the most vocal about losing to slash spec s'bs &lt;our only choice&gt;.im not talking about the people who are discussing this,im talking about the people that make silly posts like the infil template above.<br>
<br>
or the same ones who make the silly statements,and refuse to listen to the overall point of what sb's are trying to communicate.<br>
<br>
look at elaa's log,look at the logs supplied by the berserker. look at the damage penetratin does to mill vs mills damage to him,and yes his sample is small and is biased by buffs, however most every infil he fights is always fully buffed.<br>
<br>
while the arguement could be made that df was overpowerd,the simple fact is,for the cost investment of dw&lt;basicaly none&gt; vs the cost investment of LA&lt;min 1/5 of skill points&gt; the rewards arent even close to even anymore,the are weighted in favor of infiltrators.<br>
