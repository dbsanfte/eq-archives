All you need is a rogue with a hide/sneak skill ( sometimes takes until level 4 for some races ).  Kill bears and get a HQ Bearskin, to sell for 30pp ( or more if you're lucky ).  Head down into lower guk and auction that you are buying FS Weapons for 2pp each.  They sell at a merchant for 4-6pp depending on weapon, faction and charisma.  Rinse and repeat, carrying as many weapons as you can and still be able to move.  Mostly though I wouldn't worry about money.  I've never had more that 10kpp at a time, and I can still contribute greatly to groups and raids.<br>

<br>
Just today I was told that I (as a Paladin) shouldn't try buying or getting a Centi Longsword... because classes that can Dual Wield will do more damage with them.<br>
<br>
So if my Paladin goes on a camp for a Lammy... or even worse, my Cleric gets invited to an area that has great drops for Melee weapons... I should just sit there and be quiet.  I don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> deserve</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to roll on items that I could sell to buy the items I need.<br>
<br>
Oh, and another thing...  When you pull the NBG card, do you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ever</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> offer to random off the item you're replacing?  (assuming it's not a No Drop item.)<br>
<br>
If you're after a specific item, then you should get your friends to help you.  If you're in a true pick-up group, then you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> expect that everyone will want to have the same chance to make a profit from the drops. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ualferogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alfe Rogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 3:58:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10167.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: erm...</span><hr size=1> wow Angelsyn I never even thought about rolling on the item they are replacing, that is a good point you make i will have to bring that up next time someone raises the NBG card thx =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 4:21:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10167.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> money</span><hr size=1> Best way to make money in the game is NOT from overpopulated dungeons like Seb/KC ect. <br>
<br>
To make a lot of money fast, first you need a group of players with actual skill. This allows you to accomplish things with less people than others, hence more loot for each person. Pickup groups simply don't work for this.<br>
<br>
Now, goto a dungeon or a zone that either is not overpopulated, OR go deep into that zone where no one but guilds go. For instance, a group of 6 of us would camp/farm the velks castle right after the zone was upgraded. Farming barbed ringmail / blood-runed armor when there were only a couple of pieces in existance gave us all a lot of cash. I scored the first pair of blood runed legs after the upgrade... after a bit of asking around, i got a total of 225k for them. The rest of the people in the group eventually got a few pieces each, and the total amount of plat made per person evened out.<br>
<br>
After that we moved on to HoT, still with the 6 man group. We all got full suits of armor, and stayed around to aqquire more which we sold off for yet more plat.<br>
<br>
Summary : the trick of making a lot of plat from non-trading is to go places normal pickup groups can't go. You'll get the items that are more rare, and hence sell for more plat.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uangelsyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Angelsyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/tdlutenatenjou/icon_keyne.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 6:43:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10167.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: erm...</span><hr size=1> Actually, I almost always do that.<br>

And if you are good enough to pick off a Kunark dragon solo, thats great money right there.  CoF are still dragon haste and still worth alot.  Also, if you can solo phin (I know shaman can do it.  I'd think necros or mages could, and I know a druid that almost did it until charm on the seahorse was dispelled.<br>
<br>
I think there are 3 standard ways of making money though:<br>
1)  Spend a lot of time as a merchant, (ie, buy and sell ALL day.)<br>

hunting rockhoppers in Dawnshroud peaks is good xp from high 40s to mid 50s but they *only* drop hides &amp; meat (ok those limbs and crap too which sell for 1-5g to vendors), and most people dont even bother looting the hides BUT with the luclin tailoring for acrylia armors , the flawless &amp; superb hides can easily sell for at least 100pp (and if you get to know some high end tailors who buy this stuff, probably 150pp+ per hide), and the HQ hides make 10slot packs, so you can sell those for 40-50pp, or take up tailoring and make the packs yourself, sell em cheaper than the competition ...<br>
<br>
once you establish relationships with a few different buyers, you wont need to hang out in ec and /auction your hides, just meet up with your buyers when you have a 1kpp++ worth of hides <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udaishinzo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dai Shinzo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/11/02 4:15:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10167.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Buying and selling in ec / gfay is how I make all my $$.

If it doesn't move, kill it. I had 7 Grachnists up at one time in the Gobbie fort. /ooc Free Iksar Scaled Gloves at *insert /loc here*<br>
<br>
EC/Gfay for beginners: The easiest way is start small. Bone chips, bat wings, hides...on Torv lately people have been paying 10pp or more for a stack of bone chips and bat wings(these depend on zone heavily), hides can get huge sums of pp, spider silks are the same way. Once you get around 1000pp(level 10-15 if you work hard at this after equipping yourself), start your bargain hunting on vendors. OT outpost has a treasure trove of goodies! While FV can be a big bust...I guess that depends on your server. I've bought spells that can be resold for thousands for as little as 50pp(I do detest selling spells, but lately it's been do unto others because of my clerics spell needs), weapons, armor, research words and runes. Another great spot is the vendors in Thurgadin. Velious Gems and hides are often discarded and purchasing them back is usually very cheap compared to their value.<br>
<br>
Camping for l3wt: Always go with the same people: guildmates, friends... Don't do pickup groups unless you are only going for experience. If you happen to get lucky in a pickup group and get loot, feel very lucky. 90% of the time you won't get so much as a gem for the simple fact that almost no pickup group lasts long enough for everyone to get an item or as soon as one person does get loot they leave. If you always go with the same people, you will become wealthy quickly because everyone gets a turn at the loot, you will probably be NBG on the first drop and some other obscure way to determine who gets next. Once your skills as a team are refined you can easily step up for the bigger mobs that drop awesome loot that sells for immense sums.<br>
<br>
Pharming: Find a nice quiet spot that you can solo for the rare mob's drop. Grachnist, Scarlet Desert, FM, TT...whatever you can do comfortably with low risk. The Luclin zones, though a bit tougher than the old world and Kunark, have tons of new items that are selling at higher than normal prices because of rarity. A lot of this is class dependent, but even a Rogue or Warrior of sufficient level and equipment can farm up Fighting Batons, Idols of the Thorned, SMR's... It can be tricky in dungeons with running mobs, you need Root and/or Snare clickables, but it's not that hard to find the right tools out there or even a single hunting partner like a Wiz, druid or Ranger that shares your same goal for wealth.<br>
<br>
Jewelcraft: Again, start small. Every pp can make more jewelry, your skills will steadily gain and you will steadily see more and more profit. You will easily make small amounts of money early on, but it can be tedious and expensive if you rush your training. The real money starts when you get enough to do plat and velium. Stay away from the big ticket items like BD jewelry until you have maxed your skill and turned a tidy sum, but do go for the most requested item you can make...Plat or Velium Fire wedding Rings. AC6 +65hp rings go on the fingers of almost every twink I have every made or encountered. Temple of Ro has a quest to get a Fire Opal for 50pp I believe, which is cheaper than a vendor sells them. Always buff up your charisma and faction when you buy the metals + gems and always enchant the metals before you combine. When you do these two critical steps, you might even see a profit while you are mastering your skills. Ak'anon has the best training area for jewelcraft, the jeweler is just across the hall from the bank $$<br>
<br>
Tinkering for profit: Ya, right...10K in the hole thus far and not even near mastered. Patience and wealth make a good tinker...Bell didn't just make a telephone, he had financial backing and time. Tinkering is a rich man's sport...stay away until you have the money to throw around.<br>
<br>
Bowcraft for profit: This isn't a fun skill or a high profit one...it is very nice to be able to make things for yourself, but it's rare to see anyone ask for anything. Still, the bows and arrows will sell if you are persistent and reliable.<br>
<br>
Tailoring for profit: Recently, the big money maker is in Rallic Packs...1000-2000pp for a giant capacity weight reduction backpack that takes less than 20 skill to make. /boggle Later after you master smithing and God knows what else, you can turn a profit making Velious and Luclin specialty armors. The best bet is just save the pelts and pass them on to someone else with a lot more patience.<br>
<br>
The rest of the trade skills are only so-so as far as I have seen...the armors suck for smithing and are usually worse than items a person could buy for your cost. Alcoholics might rejoice at your newest concoction, but drunks don't ever tip. Fish rolls are one of the best meals, but most people just buy iron rations.<br>
<br>
I hope this little guide helps some. If anyone knows the skills I didn't mention, please add a mini-guide...maybe Fish rolls really do make a lot of money ~<br>
