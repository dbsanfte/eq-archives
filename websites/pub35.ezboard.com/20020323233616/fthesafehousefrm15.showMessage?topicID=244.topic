To me it provides another form of role-playing.  It's like those players on Rallos who delight in being anti-PKs.  Rallos PKers are always bitter about &quot;antis&quot;, and Vallon &amp; Tallon PKers are always bitter about cross-teamers.  Why's it so hard to understand that some people enjoy being good guys and spreading the message of peace, love, and tolerance &amp; so on?  <br>
<br>
I think we cross-teamers are misunderstood.  We NEED jerk PKers to give our lives meaning.  It's no fun being a cop if there are no criminals.  <br>
<br>
I guess the &quot;cross-teaming is bad&quot; attitude reaches its extreme in Dark Age of Camelot, where different teams can't even talk to each other.  I think it makes the game poorer, because at one stroke you've disallowed the whole realm of politics and alliances.<br>

I couldn't care less if, you group for PvE or guild for communications.  You can even attack the same characters in PvP.<br>
<br>
However when you heal a character of a different team(race)while that character is in PvP combat with a character of your own team(race), you are betraying your team(race) and exploiting the server mechanics.  You are causing damage to a member of your own team while remaining immune from attack yourself.<br>
<br>
How hard is it to understand that this is behavior that will not be considered to be in the spirit of the server? <p><html>

Its not fun, anti-roleplay, and anti the spirit of the Team-PvP server.  The intent with the PvP server was to create a sense of homeland and a team to which you belong, people who fight at your back.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, the homeland is the most dangerous place to engage in PvP, due to the prevalence of immortal healers.  The most powerful tactic you can use to dislodge your foes, is to log in several clerics of the same race as your opponent and use them to fight free from recourse.<br>
<br>
So, when you exploit immortal healing in Team-PvP, the mechanics actually turn out to reward Xteaming over pureteaming, or pacifism over PvP.  There is a server that is intended for crossteaming and that is Rallos.  There are plenty of servers for pacifism.  We want to play Team-PvP.<br>
<br>
Here is <a href=http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=11481160&start=11504316>a link to a post I made recently on the subject.</a> <br>

You add a lot of character to Vallon.<br>
<br>
But why is it entirely up to you to determine what's &quot;in the spirit of the server&quot;?  It's great to blame someone for &quot;betraying their team&quot; *in-character*, but out-of-character there's no excuse.  Everyone has their own ideas about what team-spirit is and what constitutes patriotism.  On the team-servers this is determined by a kind of huge mass consensus.  When races disagree about who they're fighting and who they're allied with--that's cool, because that's a dimension that doesn't exist on any other kind of server.  If too many of your own race's healers disagree with what you're doing, then clearly you're the one who's not listing to what your team wants.  The ebb and flow of politics give Vallon and Tallon something no other servers have:  a history.  The ebb-and-flow of Elf-Gnome relations on Vallon alone would make a good-sized monograph.<br>
<br>
Rallos is NOT a cross-teaming server.  You can't cross-team when there are no teams.  I play on Rallos these days, and while it has it's advantages, the role-playing choices are much narrower than on Vallon.  Rallos is just missing an entire level of interaction--the teams.  There are no borders, consequently no smuggling.  No one hates you automatically on sight, consequently there's no thrill in over-coming prejudice.  Etc., etc.  <br>
<br>
I think the Shanks are a great PK guild, but I can't understand why you get so angry at people who want to   take advantage of the role-playing possibilities of a teams server in a way that's different from yours.  By mandating how people have to play, you're decreasing the role-playing opportunites on the server, because you're decreasing the number of roles there are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufricka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fricka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.thegamevine.com/~Elegant_Rogue/shanks/teenyknot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/9/01 7:17:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thegamevine.com/~Elegant_Rogue/Sigs/9frickaface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cross-teaming</span><hr size=1> ::raises an eyebrow at Frankly::<br>
<br>
Who's mandating what?  I believe both posts above say that four team play is fine and the emphasis is disagreement in play is in the abuse of game mechanics NOT roleplay options. We revel in roleplay options, in fact we helped create one. It has never been &quot;entirely up to&quot; us to say anything on the server. By your own reasoning the growing popularity of pure team play would mean &quot;then clearly you're the one who's not listing to what your team wants&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you wish to debate the Shanks views on this topic it might be better to take this to our own message boards:<br>

<br>
I actually agree quite strongly with you about the roleplay possibilities of cooperation with other races.  I see the original intent for the server as a mixture of alliance and conflict between the teams, not pure conflict.<br>
<br>
Let me first disabuse you of the notion that I am "angry" with people who want to roleplay differently.  Variety is what quality roleplay is about, and the Shanks would be my first example of that.  I have no resentment against those who choose to roleplay an alliance with even the evil races, and in fact enjoyed an encounter I had with one such player this weekend.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I want to note that we Shanks do not characterize ourselves as a "PK" guild, and in fact, applicants who cite a desire to join a PK guild as their motivation to join, generally do not find their way in.  <br>
<br>
But my primary point of contention with you Frankly, is to paint my position as somehow trying to limit the roleplay options of others.  The truth is much more the reverse.  I don't think that it is unreasonable to think that <b>some</b> sense of cohesive teams was intended for the PvP servers and as you have noted, it adds quite a bit of spice to the roleplay, that is missing on Rallos.  I also think it fairly obvious that the inability to strike members of your own team, was not intended to make attacking your own team, far easier and freer from recourse than fighting opposing teams.<br>
<br>
If you follow the hyperlink in my post above you will find, very clearly articulated, specifically what I object to.  In brief summary, it is those who misuse the mechanics of immortal healing to slay members of their own team.  This has become widely recognized as the most effective tactic for PvP and there are many of us strongly hoping that Verant will realize the necessity of a "fix" for this exploit.<br>

Imagine a world where three teams exist, the Blue Bombers, Green Hornets, and Red Racers.  One day Fred of the Hornets is patrolling his turf, and he spots a quite tough looking Racer.  He cons him and sees that he is yellow.  Fred decides to try and take him down anyway, does some Rping about the need for vile ruffians to flee ect.  Fred lucks out some, the Racer was slightly wounded, or low on mana, or caught by suprise ect and evens the score enough that it's a close fight.  Then from out of nowhere another Hornet comes up and starts healing the Racer.  Fred looks agast, his life is fading and he cant keep the damage greater than the healing.  He asks the Hornet why he has done this and recieves a rude tell (I won't go there-use your imagination).  Fred is then turned into messy noodles and recieve some more tells abouting being owned and how he is generally inferior to the ubermenschen that just cheated on him.  <br>
<br>
On the other side of the world, a red con Blue Bomber is in a Red Racer newbie zone nuking down the lvl 4s.  Hes been doing this since anyone can remember, and seems to delight in it.  The newbies band together, gather some lvl 7 or 8s and begin to win, when in comes his savior, a Red Racer druid who slaps some heals and a really nasty damage shield on him.  Eventually he gets killed by a lvl 16 Red Racer, but refuses to leave the zone and begins to bind rush, each time being damage shielded and healed by the druid, who sits down and meds during the fight, immune to attack from his own team.<br>
<br>
Now I ask you, how would you explain this in a roleplaying sense?  Even the most passive and restrained society would take action against the cretins named above, but because of the coding of the game, they can not.  And that my friend is a exploit.  It's like flying a WWII fighter game with unlimited ammo and damage turned off, you are in a cheating stance, and all victories are tainted.  I agree with Maj, if you wanna xteam, it's your call, but if you Xteam and heal against your own team, your cheating plain and simple.  <br>

*edit*<br>
<br>
Also, addressing your point on majority rule, many of the players on the team servers have been forced to accept the crossteam alliances.  Many of the players went to the team servers, expecting to play 4v4 team PvP, only to find themselves faced with cross team players, who would heal/buff their opponents while remaining immune from attack themselves.  They simply did not wish to put forth the effort it takes to resist the immortal crossteam beneficial spell casting exploit and capitulated to the crossteamers view of team play. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A> at: 5/10/01 10:20:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uceescritdabossalini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceescrit da Bossalini</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/10/01 10:11:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cross-teaming</span><hr size=1> Ha!

<br>
<br>
What if, when you did assist another team PC against a same team PC (Immortal healing/buffing) in PvP, that you WOULD be botted from your team as a race traitor.  This would actually create a 5th team, or the &quot;crossteamers&quot; as I like to call them, and put them on the Red team (discord).  This means that Team vs. Team would still work them same way, but the Red teamers become FFA targets (can be hit by anyone within the +/- 8 level range, even their own team, etc), and you would never get a faction hit for killing one.<br>

<br>
Answer:  nothing.<br>
<br>
The point is that certain aspects of team play frustrate all of us, cross-teamers and 4-teamers alike.  Unless you're a healing class, there's nothing at all you can do to fight any truly evil PKs you run across that are on your own team.<br>
<br>
Of course, now that Vallon is a no-item-loot server, it's a lot harder to BE a truly evil PK.  That's another topic.<br>
<br>
So okay, I can see how the immortal-healing thing could be frustrating.  But if you look at the replies to the thread you mention, Wotan, most people aren't saying &quot;Yes, we should be able to find a fix for immortal healing&quot;...they're saying &quot;Man, xteams SUCK.&quot;  <br>
<br>
On Vallon I was in an all-rogue, all-race guild.  It was a hoot!  Us against the world!  But I was often and bitterly accused of NOT role-playing, going against the &quot;spirit of the server&quot;, etc.  This is the kind of reaction I can't understand, and why I started the thread in the first place.<br>
<br>
I didn't start out trying to poke anything at the Shanks in particular.  You guys were always some of my favorite enemies.  One of the funnest days I had on Vallon was once when thirty Shanks came boiling into Misty and took over the zone.  As for the Shanks not being a PK guild...maybe things have changed LOL.  I haven't played on Vallon since the loot changes.  But I remember them as being right up there with Warriors of Hades or Tiny Thugs.  I suppose it's inevitable that guilds mellow as they advance and get more concerned with levelling.  The PK guilds that don't mellow as they age tend to just disappear.  But I take that back...Shanks were always different because they were always consistent.  When my warrior ran up to Permafrost to get her Icy Greaves even the greenie Shanks were attacking her.  That's practically the opposite of PK-guild behavior.  (Interesting end to that story:  in our chatter between fights &quot;Die mutant!&quot; &quot;I'll chop you off at the knees geek!&quot; she discovered I was a smith and commisioned me to make banded pants for her. =D)<br>
<br>
Bah!  I miss the old Vallon.  I have great hopes for DAoC.  Except for the no cross-teaming thing, they seem to have gotten team PvP right.  It DOES seem strange that they would try to build a whole new game by takeing EQ's LEAST popular servers as an example.  <br>

<br>
Praytell, what question am I dodging?<br>
<br>
In fact, I do play on Rallos these days exactly because Vallon became a no-loot server.  But Rallos is not as rich an experience as playing on old Vallon was.  It was fun to battle cross-team prejudice on a team server.  Didn't I say that already?  <br>
<br>
All I'm doing is asking WHY people get so upset other people who like role-playing cross-teamers, and your reaction is typical.  I'm told to shut my mouth and get off the server because I like role-playing in a different way than you do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/10/01 4:53:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cross-teaming</span><hr size=1> Please explain your roleplaying principles then.<br>
<br>
Good vs. evil.  Clearly roleplaying but in a way that's to the pure teamists dismay.  It does not disrupt pure teamist play to the extent if the pure teamist is on the evil team or fighting the evil team.<br>
<br>
Pure teamists.  Quite possibly roleplaying:  They hate all other races.  <br>
<br>
Pure cross teamers.  Anti-roleplaying.  Hated by both of the above because their practices, if used to the fullest potential, make both styles of play impossible.  <br>
<br>
Explain how you &quot;roleplay&quot; this.  If you imagine that all races should be getting along, and all dark elves and trolls and so on are just Drizzts, then you should be on a blue server.  This happens to be really tiring to me.<br>
<br>
If instead you want dark elves to group with wood elves and protect each other from dark elves who want to kill wood elves and the wood elves who want to kill dark elves, then play on Rallos, where your messed up teaming does not adversely affect the above two.  It has nothing to do with whether it's item or coin loot.  <br>

Its a bit of a novel, but Frankly, it answers your scenario question quite explicitly.<br>
<br>
As for the PK thing, I find the label to be rather meaningless on a server specifically earmarked for PvP.  In addition, it has negative connotations associated with griefplay (as evinced by the threads currently running in the Rant Hall).  The Shanks are a close-knit band of loyal, bloodthirsty, and xenocidal barbarians.  We seek to recruit those of like mind and bearing.  I did not mean to imply that we have mellowed, no quite the reverse.<br>
<br>
Order of the Black Rose is an excellent example of roleplay-based crossteaming that is quite inoffensive.  If you were to ask those who agreed with me on that thread, you would hear a fairly unanimous endorsement of OBR.  Thats because they are a well-run, quality guild with a solid premise.  <b>Its also because they do not exploit immortal healing to kill members of their own team.</b>  I guarantee you, that if you encountered such behaviour by an OBR and documented it with screenshots and logs, they would correct the problem.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line: If you read complaints about xteaming as trying to stifle roleplay, you are missing the point by about a mile.  The truth is that immortal healing is used as a tool to harass and gain an advantage over those who try in good faith to play the server as intended, whether pure-team or no.  <b> It is not necessary to engage in immortal teamkilling to roleplay an alliance with another team. </b> <p><font size=5 color="gray"><b>Wotan</b><font size=3> Shaman Elder of the <a href="http://www.talonguard.org/shanks"><font color="red">Shanks</font></a> <br>

It's one of the things that seems to define a PKer.<br>
<br>
Okay, a short anecdote supporting my role-playing principles.  My main on Vallon (a warrior) started an all-team anti-PK guild.  These used to be called &quot;police&quot; guilds.  One of our officers was an Ogre names Smallberries.  At level 8 he ran up to Misty Thicket and got bound there.  His schtick was:  &quot;Me not Ogre.  Me halfling with glandular problem!&quot;  You wouldn't believe the horror among the newbies!  Scattering everywhere shouting &quot;Ahhh!!! Ogre in the zone!&quot;  Imagine you're a halfling newbie and an Ogre 8 levels over you runs up and begins casting.  You're backing up wondering what to do...and voila!  You're SoWed, and the Ogre sits down next to you companionably and says &quot;You please got some for for mes?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Sure, Smallberries got PKed and ganked endlessly.  But in the end he won most of the halflings over and became something of a mascot to them.  It was an exhilarating experience, and it couldn't happen anywhere but a team server.<br>
<br>
My feelings about role-playing are complicated, because when I went to Rallos I really MISSED the bigots.  It was just plain WRONG to see High Elves levelling up in Misty Thicket or Dark Elves levelling up in Permafrost as if it were no big deal.  I mean, for one Dark Elf to run to Perma and make friends and gradually win the Barbs over...what a triumph!  But when it's taken for granted that anyone could do that...yech, how boring.<br>
<br>
After this thread I'm reaching this conclusion:  4-teamers get upset about cross-teamers because they have trouble separating their in-character and their out-of-character attitudes.  In-character they hate &quot;traitors to their race&quot;, and so out-of-character they have to hate the same people.  <br>
<br>
That's one thing I like about the PK servers.  Everyone role-plays whether they want to or not, because everyone has an attitude toward PK and how it should be handled.  Myself, I can't PK an innocent. I know.  I tried.  I ran my Dark Elf mage up to Perma at level 12 and bound myself and had an entire backpack full of azurite and I was ready to PK!  But there's an innocent Barbarian Shaman medding in the snow after a tough fight with a polar bear cub, and I just couldn't do it.  Then a Gnome gank came into the zone and I killed him (barbarians cheering a Dark Elf--how bizarre) and I realized what role I was meant to play.<br>

<br>
With a gaming system as it is, cross-teaming in many cases means immortal healing, which is a game engine flaw with the current rules.  It goes beyond RP to a simple matter of gameplay.  Some dwarf comes into Kelethin's bank and starts talking smack to an old elf enemy, the elf starts to kill him, and wham, every &quot;role playing Xteamer&quot; from here to Wakening Lands is dropping heals and buffs on the dorf and saying &quot;feel the love, man.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kind of takes the fun right out of having teams in the first place.<br>
<br>
If there was hard-coded teams, crossteamers could crossteam all they liked, albeit without the ability to help each other directly.<br>
<br>
IMO, anyone who is a big crossteaming advocate should spend a little time as a newb in the Gfay area, get a healthy distaste for the shorties <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think where you are going wrong is that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you are putting your own translation on others' motivations -- in short you are putting words into people's mouths</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, even to the point of saying you understand their out of game and out of message board motivations.

<br>
I attended the last Fan Faire and was quite happy to meet many folks who considered me their adversaries in game.  Some even complained jokingly, &quot;You're supposed to be mean so I can hate you&quot;.   Note they were not pure team players who held this attitude...<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> come to think of it this example shows exactly the opposite of your &quot;conclusion&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. It was the cross-teamers who desired to hate me out of character whereas I was just happy to meet folks who played on Vallon.<br>

It seems that twice now you have put words and motivations into other peoples mouths.  I have yet to see any pure team player post that they &quot;hate&quot; people out of game, the posts I see are all made out of character and address the game or game mechanics. Perhaps you are misconstruing the fact that people debate about immortal healing or cross teaming to mean that the posters who did so &quot;hate&quot; these people in real life?  ::shrugs:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=244.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=244.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=244.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.threadControl?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=244.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=244.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
