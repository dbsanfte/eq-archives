now I'll admit there's a lot of powerleveling and twink's in TMO(me not included, I avoid both with a passion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but then most of these people have been around EQ.. and fennin for a long time.. people get bored, so they twink.. they can't all be cool like us rogues nor is everyone an RPer ;p<br>
as for camp hogging, not often, hell TMO back's out of places quite often for other groups/guilds, now mind you not always.. we as a guild have just as much right to be in places as others.. most TMO aren't farmers(sadly we have some <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Take the planes for example.. since I joined TMO, not once have we farmed a plane... we go in we break it, we smash it and wipe everything else.. then move on to something else.. we don't sit in there and then farm the respawns with like one group after that(unlike some other guilds that I won't mention). nor do you see a small group of TMO people doing the planes.. hell think smallest I ever saw was like 20 people, if it's smaller it was to prove a point, thats about it. most times it's around 40 plus people, cause planes raids are fun and lots want to do em(like the old dragon raids, pre-limit)<br>
as for kill stealing, doesn't happen often.<br>
Why am I saying all this, and why would you care.. well because when people throw comments.. even if not totally serious like you did Teefr it really pisses me off, I've met many an ignorant ass on Fennin who hate's my guild and once I've talked to them, 9 times out of 10 it's for no reason other then, because of some BS they heard somewheres, most isn't from personal experience. <br>
Biggest complaint I have with all this kind of BS(which seems to spread around on Fennin a lot, not just about our guild) is if you have a problem, talk to an officer in the guild about it, try to be at least civil when talking to them though, or heck if it's a rogue talk to me if ya want and I'll talk to the officers. Most people that group with TMO people at all or much never have a problem, well not often.. can't please everyone.<br>
why you'd have a problem I don't know Teefr.. the hardcore, 90% of TMO that are on all the time are well above the level range you'd be around, most being 55+ so don't know why you'd have had many problems let alone encounters with them.. maybe it was a twink, in which case definatly tell an officer about the problem.. a problem I've encountered(in TMO and outside) is some people will say a character is they're twink just to get it into a guild real quick, no questions asked, when really it isn't a twink, but rather some RL friend or other such BS, from personal experience, what I've seen myself or from watching my roomate play is sometimes these people are the cause of a lot of the problems.. one, they don't do anything within the guild, most never even talk (probably have guildchat turned off) on guildchat and for the most part, most real guildies don't even know they exist unless on some chance they happen to see them in a zone(usually when I question who the heck they are). another reason I don't like &quot;Twink's&quot; a lot of times.. but I'll stop here, i'm not turning this into a twink bashing post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://members.home.net/eakins5/solsig4.jpg"><BR>

But now that its out I'll comment.<br>
<br>
First off, with a comment like that you're asking for it, plain and simple; whether or not you deserved it is another story.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Another Story:</b><br>
<br>
  I've had some very good experiences with TMO, I've also had some very bad ones.  Not second hand, not something I've heard, I've been stepped on by TMO in the past.  Now, I've got some good friends in TMO, some really solid people.  But I've also been privy to other members bickering like 3rd graders.<br>
<br>
As you said, its a large guild, its hard to keep tabs on everybody and everyone.  One rotten apple spoils the barrel, thats how guilds get bad reputations.  May not be entirely justified, but thats how it happens; many suffer for the actions and words of a few.  Indignation is totally understandable, but a phrase like "creme de la creme" very tempting flame bait, not to mention high handed, condescending, and insulting. <p><hr>

   I was gonna refrain, but have to throw my two cents in...Personally I really don't like people that &quot;toot their own horn&quot; like this..It's been quite some time since I've talked/grouped with Dalane, seeing as I'm on Druzzil now, but this comment doesn't sound like something that would come from the Dalane I remember. *shrug*.  All I can say is that nobody has the right to say something like this about themself/their guild.  You don't decide if you are the best, the rest of the server does...<br>

But I was surprised by that comment, too. When you say something like that you really are opening yourself up to take a shot. And like Hyarth, I thought that was an incredibly insulting statement. I know of many fine guilds on Fennin Ro that have excellent members that I would never hesitate to group with. I also know of other guilds with worse reps than TMO. I don't need to name names, because all the Fennin people know who they are.<br>
<br>
As for TMO itself, and like everyone else I wasn't gonna say it first, I've heard plenty of horror stories about them. But, I will say I've grouped and met with some TMO that were fine people and some that were jerks. One of the problems is that the stories that will go around will be the ones about how GuildMemberX trained a group out of a zone, not the stories that Solpel is a great guy to group with.<br>
<br>
The creme de la creme statement bothered me because I don't base the quality of a guild on how fast they can clear a plane or if they can slay both Vox and Nagafen in one night. That really doesn't concern me in the slightest. To me, the measure of a guild is how the general members behave. I'm in a smaller guild, about 30 people, but I know each of them and know they're good people that don't do dishonorable things. I know that from experience. To me, that makes a good guild, and in my opinion the creme de la creme of Fennin would be people like this, not people that can set a new speed record in Hate.<br>

Just so you all know, TMO doesn't like those bad apples, and we do try to get rid of them, especially those twink(not twink) varieties.<br>
As always if you ever have a problem, talk to the guild officers, even if the person is one of the officers<br>
if you want to know what officers are on, ask any member they can tell ya<br>
now this last statement should go for any guild, I just hate when people jump to conclusions and don't bother even talking to the people in charge of the guild<br>

I will always consider my friends.  Whether you take offense or are appauled by my &quot;creme de la creme&quot; comment it your choice as everyone will have a subjective opinion on things.  <br>
<br>
Was it condensending?  Perhaps.  Was it meant to be condensending?  No... it was meant to explain to the majority of rogues who would read the post that TMO is &quot;arguably&quot; (meaning open to interpretation) the elite of Fennin Ro.  Kinda like background information.  The power of TMO is well known, and respected server wide.  We usually have the leadership and the forces to be able to take down whatever gets in our path.<br>
<br>
You all know me... and you all know that I'm a good person.  Do I have guild pride?  Yes.  Is my guild powerful?  Yes.  Is TMO one of the most powerful on the server?  Yes.  Does that not make us &quot;Creme de la creme&quot;?  Again open to interpretation but I'd say most people would say that we are.<br>
<br>
Teefr, Solpel is correct... you can't have enough experience with TMO to judge or say anything about us as I'm one of the lowest level mains and I wouldn't be hunting in the same zone as you.  Most of our peeps are lvl 53+ so you can't have played with any large number of of player base.<br>
<br>
Basically the point of my post was to inform and celebrate our victory over Venril Sathir.  I wanted to spread the word, and rejoice with the rogue community.  I did not wish to offend anyone, especially my friends.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm just as appauled that not one of my &quot;friends&quot; congratulated my guild and I on a job well down and accomplishing such a feat... and instead focus on a comment which I still feel fits the post and provides useful background info to others reading this post <p>Ms Dalane Swiftblade<BR>

But congratulations.<br>
<br>
I don't want to argue the TMO's virtues or vices anymore, its simply not much fun.  (Arguing other things I consider fun.)  But also don't forget that different people have differen't goals.  I'm the officer of a role playing guild (Grudge Bearers), and while we can't put together a plane raid (yet, we're getting there) I (and other leaders and members) go through great pains keep our reputation pristine (I'm not saying we don't get complaints, we do on occasion.)  We have younger members who are occasionally suprised to see just what the tag over their head means when they get a ressurection or help from a stranger for no charge and sometimes unasked simply because they wear that tag.  And for anybody whos tried to manage a guild that hit a sudden burst of growth, they know keeping a clean name can be just as trying as leading a plane raid (yes, I've dont that too. =) ) <p><hr>

Regardless of how the comment was supposed to be taken and how it was actually taken, you pulled off an impressive feat, so congratulations. Like Hyarth said, by the time we were responding, we'd shoved the point of the post out of our mind. Sorry about that.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Hyarth, you've made quite the impression on my guildmates, it would seem. During my first trip to Hate a few weeks ago, Lotos (I think it was) told me that if I had any planar questions, to ask you because you were the best rogue he'd ever seen in Hate. Just thought I'd pass that on to you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/usolpel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solpel</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/28/00 1:31:47 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/eakins5/Solsig2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venril Sathir SLAIN on Fennin Ro</span><hr size=1> hehe, thats just cause Hyarth lives up there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/udarlantan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darlantan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/28/00 2:04:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venril Sathir SLAIN on Fennin Ro</span><hr size=1> No background is needed Dal. All you have to say is that you killed Venril. People will realize what an accomplishment that is, and applaud you for your accomplishments. By you telling everyone how you are arguably the best of the best, that sets things into a poor light, and as you saw, people lose sight of the object of the post, to come here and share your great accomplishments with your friends and colleagues. Edit:Wow, that's a long ass sentence hehe<br>

I think the reason your choice of words offended me for sure, others possibly, is that you somehow slighted any rogue not in TMO, in fact, any player not in TMO. <p>Darlantan Daggerstorm<br>Level 52 finally Rogue<br>Fennin Ro Valorous Union<br>How horrible is it to lose a Woven Shadow Breastplate to someone's secondary logged in Hate?

It was said earlier that Teefr couldn't have had any problems with members due to his level (or something to that effect if not exact words). That's not true at all. I'm not sure when he started playing, but I started Caliban on the first day of release and he's been basically my only character the whole time, yet I'm still "only" level 48. I just level slowly due to many reasons. I'm not saying that's the case with Teefr, but it is possible. So don't look at someone's level and assume that they've never had any interaction with people that are now higher level. Just because I'm not hunting in the same place as the level 58s doesn't mean I never did. Just needed to stick up for us slow levelers, which is a group that Teefr may or may not be a part of. ;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/usolpel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solpel</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/29/00 12:26:54 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/eakins5/Solsig2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venril Sathir SLAIN on Fennin Ro</span><hr size=1> if that's the case then you hold a grudge to long to be healthy, it's just a game afterall <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=1586.topic&start=21&stop=35>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2407.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=1595.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=1586.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=1586.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1586.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1586.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
