They thank me but they already have one. They've even highlighted parts of it. All the team lead feedback is read. But &quot;reading and implementing are two different things.&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Disguises:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>No disguises.<br><br>Scott: It came down to 2 alternatives. Make disguises purely cosmetic...or make everyone else unhappy...you could say [because we're faced with these alternative]...it's &quot;tabled indefinitely.&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What's the status with left axe? Is it a secret nerf?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>It's definitely not done on purpose. We'll [Sanya and Scott]look into it.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What races and classes are in the expansion?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: Details aren't being given out. Screenshots will be released in July. However some info: New city for each realm, new &quot;surroundings&quot; for the city (outdoor zones etc), 1 new race per realm, new classes for each realm.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Will the new engine be available to all or just the expansion?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: Just expansion. It's an entire new game...as big as the present game. They've hired the developer from Morrowind to do water effects etc. Players with the old version of the game will be able to see the new races etc but not be one.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Update on spellcrafting?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Spell crafting is our number one priority behind Mordred.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Tradeskill updates?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: New one are planned constantly. &quot;There is a big gaping whole in the economy where spell crafting will be.&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Update on Mordred?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Almost ready to go<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Will we get player owned horses?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: &quot;We want them eventually&quot;. They tried once so far but did not have a &quot;successful implementation&quot;.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Guilds</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Artwork for guild housing has all been finished. Housing will be worked on after spellcrafting. A guild vault was attempted but they had problems implementing it.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Arena, dueling</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>No ETA on arenas. &quot;It's a question of time and resources&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Will collision detection ever be implemented?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Scott: No, not in the existing game. It causes people to get stuck and to fall through the world. Maybe in an expansion.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Will RP servers ever have CSR run events?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: No events, no staff right now. We tried once with volunteers but it didn't work and its hard with volunteers and we prefer to pay our employees.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Will more emotes be added?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>On the &quot;to do list&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What happened to the story contest?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: &quot;Sanya is a loser&quot; -- Sanya said I could quote her on that. She needs to contact the people who won.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Will your rant page ever be updated?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: ::laughs:: the page &quot;keeps her honest&quot;. No update planned but maybe.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  And I asked this just for Elaa: Is Mythic hiring developers? Are you single?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Sanya: No. We literally don't have room. Scott is working in a closet. No ::laughs::<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What's the most played class in game?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Scott: Cleric followed by armsman. For Hibernia only it's druid, for Midgard, Thane.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What realms do you play?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>We can't really answer that but it's pretty even company wide. Scott: &quot;But I play a Nightshade so...&quot; Sanya: And I played in Midgard but my main is in Albion right now.<br><br>That's all I got to in the time allowed. If I didn't get to your question I'm sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I didn't have much time to prepare and to sort through the questions - I had to skim a lot of the longer worded ones.<br><br>Next year I'll be sure to be more prepared and open it up to questions earlier now that I know that I can get an interview set up.<br><br>For more E3 reports see the Logged Out forum for 2 picture posts from me and 3 from Wix. I'll also be writing up detailed info on Shadowbane, NeverWinter Nights and the Sims Online.<br><br>Most of this will also be up on my offlinetshirts.com site as well if you ever loose track of the threads.<br><br>-------------<br><br>PS<br><br>Additional info gleaned from talking to Mythic folks at their booth:<br><br>They will be expanding all dungeons.<br><br>There will be underwater zones in the expansion (Shrouded Isles).<br><br>There will be 5-10 new outdoor zones in the expansion.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <p><img src="http://www.thesafehouse.org/%7Efricka/sig/DAOCsig.jpg"><br><b>~Fricka</b><i>Fricka curtsies elegantly...while picking yer pocket.</i><a href="http://www.theshanks.org">Shanks</a>,<a href="http://www.offlinetshirts.com">Off-Line</a>,<a  href="http://www.geocities.com/fricka_on_vallon_zek">Sig Gallery</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufricka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fricka</A> at: 5/26/02 1:52:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaeleks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeleks</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.mipal.de/images/dwarfmale.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/26/02 1:41:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3365.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mipal.de/images/cube_sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Interview with Mythic at E3: Answers</span><hr size=1> glorious... :<br><br> What realms do you play?<br>We can't really answer that but it's pretty even company wide.

The official answer was &quot; We are working as fast as we can on new content, our first priority is to Mordred and than we are going to address new content&quot;. However, when I spoke with one of the artist who was talking with one of the engineers he stated that we will see a lot of new content shortly after mordred which ill entail some new  areas to explore.<br><br>Overall I was very happy with the mythic team.

The statement regarding disguise is no exception.  <br><br>What did they mean when they said, &quot;It came down to 2 alternatives. Make disguises purely cosmetic...or make everyone else unhappy...you could say [because we're faced with these alternative]...it's &quot;tabled indefinitely.&quot;<br><br>What does this mean?  We have to guess (as usual).  <br><br>So here goes!  <br><br>When I first heard of disguise I thought it was a great idea.  However, I immediately wondered how they would implement it.  If it was purely cosmetic (i.e. you only looked like a bad guy), anyone who was worried about a disguised enemy in their midst would simply select everyone around them and attack.  If they were really who they appeared to be, they couldn't attack them.  If they were the enemy, they could.  In this case, disguise would simply suck because you would rarely choose disguise over stealth.  <br><br>The only way to make disguise useful would be to make it so that you couldn't be attacked when disguised.  Unless of course you attacked and then your disguise would vanish.  Of course, this would be too uber of an ability.  You would be invincible until you attacked.  <br><br>I think that this is the dilemma they faced.  If so, I can understand why they can't implement it.  What I don't understand is how, if I figured out how impractical it might be in about 10 seconds, they didn't as well.   <br><br>But my guess is merely academic.  Whatever their reason for not doing it is really unimportant.  The fact is, you should never realize something can't be done after you spend months promising it.  First you decide if something is viable, then you tell the whole world your gonna do it.  <br><br>What I think is that disguise is just another vapor-ware promise of Mythic to string us all along.  They never really planned to do it.<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morinn>Morinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/26/02 11:30:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3365.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> well fact is some folks are gonna stop playing because of the recent nerfs. <br><br>Same fact is when Mythic releases an expansion they will draw in new blood.

Right now we have zones with dragons in them that are so damn hard the dragon never dies. Whats so epic about it anyway? You have mobs to farm for loot and is getting so common I am getting hand me downs from total strangers. Oh thats right it has the dragon that kills everyone that looks in its general direction.<br><br>If spellcrafting goes in like they say then every 50 in the game will have an epic suit of armor.

The impression I get is that they do not fully have a good grasp on what we should be able to do as assassins in RvE and RvR with the use of disguise.<br><br>I think decent use of disguise would just be the ability to not reveal your name to your opponent and hide the con of your class from other players.<br><br>The cosmetic chage of making a player loko like another humanoid native to that zone would be cool as well, similar to the Enchanter shapechange that lets you grab the closest object, but eliminates all non humanoid players when doign it oh well. . .
