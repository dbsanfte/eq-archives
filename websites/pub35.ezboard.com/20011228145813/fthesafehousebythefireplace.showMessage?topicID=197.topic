Dank air forced its way into his lungs.  Heaps of bones and decaying matter lay strewn about the expansive cavern.  Only two objects stood in sight, himself, and a granite portal.  Etched into one piece of stone, the portal was reminiscent of a mouth or face.  Orange energy flowed in the rectangular gap.  He shivered. <BR>    A latecommer, Grey stood alone while his companions lay with an uncertain fate on the other side of this ominous door.  Fear wracked him, as he felt the waves of pure terror eminating from the rippling energy in front of him.  His feet refused to move underneath him; that is, until he heard the sound of Cyndreela's pet laugh.  She had risen again to stand in the way of the travelers to Fear, and Grey knew his time was now short.  <BR> Willing his shaking legs to move, Grey approached the stairs up to the portal.  Sweat beaded on his blue skin, and he heard every sound.  The clank of his backpack, the rustle of his armor, all of it echoed in his ears.  The closer and closer he made it to the gate, the greater the waves of utter fright that rushed over him.  A sound stopped his feet.  Was that a scream he heard in the last pulsating flow of the gate, or was it his imagination? <BR> After an enternity and countless battles with his fear, Grey was before the orange wave of the gate to Fear.  He stood shaking, heart pounding in his ears.  Sheathing his daggers, and removing his dark gauntlets, he reached out to touch the gate.  His right hand edged toward the gate slowly, and his entire being rested in his fingers.  Fear enveloped him, and became his driving force.  Behind him, the laugh of Cyndreela's pet nearing him slowly pushed his hand toward the greatest fear of all. <BR> Slippery. Pliable. His hand bent the gate inward as he attempted to put his hand through.  Spurred by the thought of not making it through, he lurched forward, bringing his other hand up to the gate's face.  Nothing.  Brashly leaning his weight in behind his hands, he registered a high *pop!*, and felt himself falling inward.  His scream echoed through the cavern, and the older ogre inhabitants of the forest shook their heads. Another had been claimed by Fear. <BR> Blackness enveloped him as he passed through the portal.  He stood in clear site of the most horrific creation of imagination, the god Cazic Thule.  A thought attacked his mind and left just as swiftly.   <BR> &quot;Why am I alone here with him?&quot; <BR>  <BR> GREYMALKIN! Face Terror! I shall rend your mind with fear! <BR>  <BR> ----------------------------- <BR>  <BR> Grey lurched forward out of the portal.  A jungle spanned before him, and he was on a raised bluff of green.  Shouts of jungle-noise pervaded the air.  Monkeys calling, the rustling of trees, and the drums of natives.  His eyes were drawn to the hourglass rotating in the air off in the distance.  <BR> &quot;Right...&quot; he thought, &quot;this is Fear&quot; <BR> A shimmer in the distance caught his attention.  A wall of fire?  He thought he registered movement behind it, but was unsure. The thought came to him that he should probably not want to find out, either. <BR> &quot;GREY! HELP US!&quot; was almost drowned out by the hum of the jungle.  He whirled to face a battle on the bluff behind him.  Swords and magic created a cacophany intertwined with the unholy sounds of the denizens of Fear enjoying a slaughter.   <BR> &quot;NO!&quot; he shouted, whipping out his daggers. <BR> As Grey rushed to the aid of his friends, he felt the pang of grief for his dead comrades.  Crush, great leader of men, dead in a pool of rotting flesh and slime.  Ielyen, weaver of magic and arcane art, flayed of his skin in the jaws of an enormous primate.  Falein, most idealistic of monks, figthing for justice and seeking naught but his path to enlightenment, lay cleaved from stem to stern, one half of his strong body writhing still. <BR> &quot;DAMN YOU! DAMN YOU DENIZENS OF FEAR'S EVIL!!!&quot; <BR> Greymalkin Koshigai rushed the hill, daggers spinning.  A gleam in his eye told any onlooker that his friends would be avenged, though he would soon join them in their new astral abode... <BR>  <BR> ------------------------------ <BR>  <BR> Greymalkin Koshigai <BR> A dramatized sumbission of the events leading up to the longest Fear break-in ever recorded. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/umarinar.showPublicProfile>MarinaR</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlackfire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/00 1:05:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fear Incarnate.</span><hr size=1>  <BR> Excellent storytelling!!
