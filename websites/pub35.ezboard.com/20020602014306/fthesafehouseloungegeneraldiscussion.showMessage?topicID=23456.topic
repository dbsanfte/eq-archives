You can argue that people shouldn't feel that way, but telling people how they should feel is generally futile. Dreadlands is crowded, Droga is empty.<br><br>The other factor is that unless you play at exactly the same exp gain rate as someone else, you will soon be a liability or overpowering when you hunt with them. <br><br>EQ plays much better at or near the level cap. The majority of the people still playing EQ are the ones with characters at or near that cap. That suggest to me that the level cap is a good thing, and it should be lower, not higher, in EQ2. <br><br>Something like 40 would be good, 10 levels to learn to solo, 10 levels to learn to fight in a group, 10 level to learn how to fight in a dungeon, 10 levels to learn to raid.<br><br>Soru<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umelissacorleone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MelissaCorleone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/25/02 4:44:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23456.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The leveling trademill</span><hr size=1> MMoRPG'S are all about Level Treadmilling.

I do however believe this would lead to extreme twinking but to that extent one solution would be to make most magical (stat modifying) items no drop.<br><br>To this extent, if you wanna raid and you aren't level 60 (or the top level of EQ2) you still can and still be fairly powerful.<br><br>The way EQ is not stats can make about a 5%-10% difference in the power of your character but the different in a level 50 toon and a level 60 toon is astronomical (and probably should be because of the time requires to make that leap)<br><br>I dunno, seems kind of hard to me to find a good balance in the two and not have huge problems arrise....good luck Verant with getting the system in working order <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Mugn Mobs <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulordvirix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Virix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/25/02 3:53:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23456.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The leveling trademill</span><hr size=1> Leveling would be much more enjoyable if it didnt revolve around sitting in one spot and pulling mobs to the group for hours on end. The easiest (and possibly most enjoyable) way for this to be done is to make questing for exp worth it. When you do a quest, more exp should be given for turn ins, making it worth your time. Why spend the time questing for an item when you can buy it? This may not matter much at the release of the game, but exp given from quests will make all the difference in the long run. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20251"

it, but...<br><br>*Trivial Loot rules: green mobs dont drop anything.<br><br>*Level capped dungeons: places you cannot go unless you are a certain level range.<br><br>*Level caps on gear: you cannot use an item (at all? at full power?) until you have the right level (character level? skill level?)<br><br>*Random spawn timers: make the respawn vary a LOT more than it does now.<br><br>*make death less of a difficulty: no one takes risk because if you fail, you lose hours or days of effort. (perhaps make a spot in each zone that you apear at if you die in that zone instead of a single bind point for your character.)<br><br>Adding these kind of things to EQ would be bad.  Concepts like this must be part of a design from the beginning, or not at all.<br><br>These things would slow down the leveling process, and force players to go DO more things than sit in one spot and farm exp by killing the same mobs over and over ad nauseum.  You would have to go hunt up new gear as you level up, not simply use uber item Y from level 1 on.  If you wanted to hunt in a certain area, or kill a certain mob, or earn a certain drop, you would have to do it at the right level range.  Remember how little it mattered when you died in your first few levels?  Sometimes you would do it just for fun.
