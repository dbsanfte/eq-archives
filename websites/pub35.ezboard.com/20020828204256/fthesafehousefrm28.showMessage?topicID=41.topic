<br>
Withholding any comments that Wine is in fact not an emulator, the initial answer to your question is, Yes, it works quite well.<br>
<br>
I will tho take a random stab at another issue ... No, it does not play everquest. <p><center>

Redhat if you want the most main-stream distro, and Debian if your a real linux guru and want real power and quality at the sacrafice of user friendliness.<br>
<br>
Gnome or KDE?<br>
KDE all the way.  By far the most developed.  I've heard blackbox is good though.  Gnome has honestly fallen behind.  They just released 2.0 but I really don't think it holds that much.  I hear the graphics are good but past that it isn't really that nice.  KDE on the other hand is better than explorer for windows.  Really it's retail quality and I wish they'd write it for windows.  The worst problem with Linux on the desktop these days is X.  I don't understand X well, but from what I understand it is written to be network transparent and not for speed or ease of setup.  X needs to be replaced with something like they use in OSX (I think from FreeBSD) or whatever was used for BeOS which I hear was excellent.<br>
<br>
Wine does work well.  It does add a signifigant amount of overhead though.  (Tom's hardware compared the speed of running Quake 3 natively to running Quake 3 using wine and quake 3 natively was almost twice as fast, though it should be noted that the Quake 3 native to linux ran measurably faster than the Quake 3 native to Windows due to the linux OpenGL drivers being better than the Windows DirectX drivers.)<br>
<br>
That said, I refuse to use wine for games, (and shy away from it over all).  One of the reasons I run linux is to get away from crappy windows programs.  I've got a windows computer to run them on if I need.  I want linux native stuff on this computer.  Also, as hard as they are trying at transgaming, they don't have directX 8.1 emulated in wine yet, (which is the reason Everquest doesn't run on it.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugooda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gooda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 11:21:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Linux</span><hr size=1> Linux newbie question :<br>

I installed Gnome, just because that is what we use at work. I have never seen KDE at all. Somehow I managed to nuke my Gnome task bar. :P So I may be reinstalling soon, although I can gimp through running the programs I need. <p><br>

KDE on the otherhand comes with its own office software suit and browser, which are very nice for what they've done so far.  Not microsoft office quality yet but its all relatively new software.<br>
