<br>
<br>
The party was deep in a keep that was a pseudo dungeon.  They were pretty battered, and on their wits end after many encounters with wraithes, ghasts, etc...   So a new player is joining the group at the start of this session, and he's playing a psionisist.  He decides he wants to impress the group so for his &quot;grand entrance&quot; he makes himself glow, and floats down through the ceiling of the room the group is in.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, the party -- thinking he another wraith, make short work of him.<br>
<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Group had split up to explore an old estate house that had been overrun by baddies.  The fighter/mage was exploring upstairs when he came into a dark room.  He looked around and saw another door at the far end of it, so he creeps over and opens it up.  <br>
<br>
He see some movement in the room and decides that a pre-emptive strike is his best option.  So he blasts a fireball into what just a mirror at the back of a small closet.<br>
<br>
Always have a lightsource!<br>
<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Waaaay back when I was just starting Glip (who's now 14/15th level gnome illusionist/thief) my adventuring partner was my friend Jansan, a necromancer.   Neither of us had many hit points, so we had to be careful with fights.  We always tried to win without actually having to get out our weapons.<br>
<br>
We'd just hit second level, I believe when we came across an arqubus (which, as well as any form of primitive firearm, have since been banned from our games).<br>
<br>
When we came into possession of it, we were on our way to rid a small town of a kobold camp outside its boundries.   Using my only illusion spells plus my disguise skill I was able to make myself appear to be a kobold, and Jansan, my human friend was my &quot;prisoner&quot; who said he had a gift for the kobold chief.<br>
<br>
His &quot;gift&quot; was a magic viewing tube (the arqubus) which &quot;could predict the future to anyone who looked into it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with the rules for arqubuses, so I'll explain them real quick.  If you roll a critical fumble with them, you take the damage.  Damage is 1d10 and if you roll a 10, you can roll again and make it cumulative.<br>
<br>
So naturally, Jansan crit fumbles and blows himself up -- right infront of a bewildered kobold chief and me, who is now in a rather tough spot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujhanivandolay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jhani Vandolay</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.half-asleep.com/pooh/nav/bee02.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/29/02 7:14:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://spookachu.homestead.com/files/pumpkin1mini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Worst Death Ever.</span><hr size=1> I can't even justify writing about any of my deaths, because as stupid as they can be, every time I think of one I remember one of my friends who tends to get witch-hunted and slain through cheating (kinda frequently.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).

<br>
My Friend wrote his own adventure for us to go in. It was a Town he called Sanctuary which was out in the wilds (frontier style) and we were sent in by the governor of the region cos nothing had been heard from the town.<br>
<br>
The GM had a Mage that he would normaly play as an npc and go in with us (we took turns gming and the gms character would be played as an npc) but I should have known it was gonna be a bad time when he siad his mage was just teleporting us in and we we could take our followers and henchman.<br>
<br>
I was the lowest member of the party and I was a 17th Halfling Rogue( yeah I know Im predictable...he is my highest and longest played dnd character) their were 5 of us all with at least 3 henchman each of around 8th to 10th.<br>
<br>
I wont bore you with the whole story and all the details of WHY I WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR!<br>
<br>
But I got out alone and down to 3hps! and at 14th level!<br>
<br>
Man I never got over that! I havnt played him much since as whilst that group occasionally see other now we rarley play dnd together anymore (this was at 6th form ie 16-18 UK college and Im 33 now)<br>

The RPGA said it was for level 1-2, but the first thing we happen across is an Owlbear (wounded, but still, it HURTS at level 1), we lose 1 party member, as well as the farmer that the owlbear is harrassing.  <br>
<br>
We survive, bury the dead one, and carry another unconscious party member to the nearby farmhouse where we are then ambushed that night by orcs.  <br>
<br>
An orc shaman steps up in front of me, and without even breaking a sweat, slashes me so hard I (an elven rogue) pretty much come apart in the middle (was down to a -9), and spray blood across the entire room.<br>
<br>
The funniest thing about this module though, is that we needed someone with a 'talk with animals' type spell... which isn't available till something like level 3 for druid/ranger types...I forget, as I hardly ever play anything but some sort of rogue. ;)  <br>
<br>
Needless to say, we scrapped this module as unplayable after trying to get through it some 3 times.  We've also since decided not to update our RPGA memberships. :) <p><center>

<br>
Rogues death:<br>
<br>
My third level Rogue was on watch one night when I spot 2 bears coming into the camp ( We were after an evil bard that had pipes that charmed animals ). I call a warning to the group to wake up and go to climb the Tree next to me. The bears of course bore in on me now that I yelled out. Rolled my climb check for a 1. DM had me fall on my ass and looked up into jaws!! needless to say, I became fodder!!!<br>
<br>
This lead me to roll a Ranger...<br>
<br>
My Rangers death was more fun.. I was lvl 6 and had a wolf for a companion. Entire party moves into a room to attack an Evil mage. I Rolled the worst on Initative so I was not in the room yet, even tho my wolf was. THe Mage casts ICE STORM AE spell.. The mages Familiar Dies.. My wolf dies.. The mage goes unconscious ( we had been fighting Trolls before hand ). I am unaffected as I was not in the room.. The mage TEleports out and we fight some more trolls. We figure out that the Mage was escaping to a boat so me and the monk run off towards the exit, where we encounter more Trolls. Now my Ranger had Giants as his favored enemy, so I'm doing +2 damage to these guys. I had been kicking serious buttocks. I get 2 Trolls cornered and the Monk runs on after the mage so I go to kill some more Trolls. One lands 2 hits on me and I find out about their special ability. They bascially grab both your arms and tear you apart.. I had 30 someodd hp at the time and the GM starts to roll damage while I sat there waiting to hear if I was dead... He rolls his dice, looks up at me with a smirk and says this verbatim...<br>
<br>
&quot; err Zlater..You uh... &quot;<br>
He picks up the miniature I used for my wolf and puts it in the doorway of the room nearby.<br>
&quot; You see dead pet wolfy in an ethereal form enter the room and say.. Come into the light Zlater... &quot;<br>
<br>
If I wasnt laughing so hard, I might have been upset. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uannid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anni D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 2:42:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Worst Death Ever.</span><hr size=1> I was playing an evil mage/thief, and my friend was playing a neutral warrior.<br>

We had just finished our first adventure, and were talking to the mayor about our reward. I don't remember exactly what they mayor said, but I didnt like it and threw my dagger in his chest.<br>
<br>
That was a really great move, until he shouted for help. Apparently town mayors have a good amount of guards. Thinking quickly, I ran across the room and jumped out the window, dashing away. The warrior tried to follow me, but broke his leg on the fall, and was sumarilly dismissed by the guards.<br>

My group were all around lvl 15, and we had come to possess a fly castle.  And it flew fast.  I was a dwarf Mechanic(custom class my gm made, pretty much a tinkerer, but dwarf only)  so i'm the only one who new how to fly it.  <br>
<br>
So the whole groups goes off on an adventure, but I decide to stay back and fix the castle, been running a bit sluggishly.  I'm wondering around the castle basement looking for the problem when I come across the power crystal.  I roll an INT check to see if I know whats wrong.   <br>
<br>
My character is dumb so I think it's pressing against the frame too closely.  So I get up and jump on it to try to move it downwards.  It does move downwards....hitting the dragon, that none of us knew about.  The dragon was hidden in lower level as protection for the castle.  Angered by this the dragon attacks the crystal. Which explodes in a broken wand like effect.<br>
<br>
Party comes back later to find pieces of crystal everywhere, but that castle is no where to be found. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uronixpraetoriax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ronix Praetoriax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 2:24:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Worst Death Ever.</span><hr size=1> I had a warrior...

(and chronic gas due to intestinal injuries) I could list a dozen, he was the warrior that never died, and skill had NOTHING to do with it /grin<br>
<br>
Mardoc's story reminded me of his death though. We were big dragonlance readers at the time, and flying citadels were all the rage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Our campaign was nearing an end, and an epic battle was taking place.  (For those unaware of gibberlings they are basically  VERY low level critters that can be best described as a hairball with ALOT of teeth, and an attitude to match)<br>
<br>
Our party led a mission into the flying citadel, which floated above the ranks of evil who were busy cutting the army of good to ribbons.  We split up to find the control room.  My warrior came across a cavernous room with gibberlings scattering about...  looked like a good 10-20 of them.  I cackled with glee and charged, slaughtering for the sheer joy of it. 5 down, 10 down, 20 down... 30... hmm  still 30 to go... where are they all coming from...<br>
<br>
Ah, the sick GM... gibberlings that had been cross bred with trolls... Every kill compunded my troubles.  When I was found, only my armor, and a magical metallic arm remained, I had been eaten by gibberlings.  /grin<br>

It started off in a corridor we had to go down, which I, the wizard noticed glyphs on the wall, which had a riddle on it.<br>
<br>
I don't remember the riddle anymore, but I had correctly guessed the riddle, and was aware of the trap (or so I thought).  So I came to an area that looked like the right area for the trap, so I recited the passage for the riddle and continued.  <br>
<br>
At a second area just like it, I hesitated, and decided that I was safe, since I already said the passage for the riddle.  Too bad I said the whole answer, and not the three parts separately. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyways, I barely survive, and we continue with the same results at the third area.<br>
<br>
At the end(ish) of the third corridor, we come upon an efreet and a dozen salamanders.  We start fighting, and the rogue decides he is going to run, and crosses the last trap area without saying the riddle.  He fails his save, and is blasted to death with some magic I can't remember.<br>
<br>
We get half the salamanders killed, and we are starting to hurt a bit, and the fight looks like we might make it out if we are lucky.  One of the fighters (who wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer) got a ring that could open a portal to the elemental plane of fire that no one really wanted.  He took the ring and summoned a portal, which of course opened the portal.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the efreet laughed loudly and summoned a few elemental lords and the rest was history.  I think the cleric and I escaped by becoming ethreal.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, we asked him what in the world made him summon it, and he says &quot;What?!

   Close 2nd.<br>
<br>
   I had a character that was very rich and went into a small town and spent alot of money on carousing and gambling.  The constable came and arrested me.  I didn't resist since I'd done nothing wrong.  Once behind bars the constable informed me the town had gotten together and decided to let me starve to death in my new cell while they did some remodelling with my cash.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
   Yet another:<br>
<br>
   I had another character that was very poor but had managed to acquire a magic gem during character creation that was useless to anyone but a wizard (which I was not).  <br>
<br>
   So I went to the nearest town with a guild and found a wizard.  I asked him for some cash for the item.  He insisted that I simply give him the item.  I refused and he called the guards on me, so I swallowed the gem.  Apparently this wizard was pretty serious about getting the gem so his guards cut me open and extracted the gem.<br>
<br>
   I made a phenomenal health roll and survived the gutting.  The guards left me in an alleyway.  Unable to move I called for help several times.  Finally a priest that worshipped the most compassionate deity in the game system came by and looked over my wounds.  But he decided, much to my dismay that I was so likely to die that his time was better spent on someone that could be saved.<br>
<br>
   I tried to strangle the priest but he beat me to death with his bible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ulerkinbehinja.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lerkin Behinja</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/29/02 1:37:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://tunares.juju.org/media/screenshots/roster/lil_lerkin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Worst Death Ever.</span><hr size=1> Alright, we (about six of us, I was playing a Gnomish Rogue) come into this cavern with lava about 50 feet below us.

One of our players was something of a history buff, and convinced the GM to allow him to use a tactic against these fantasy war elephants that was used historically by the Romans against Carthaginian war elephants.  Specifically, his plan was to obtain a pig, slather it up in combustibles (pitch, naptha), point it at the elephants, and light it up.  The plan was for the pig to run at the elephants, flaming and making a most horrific screaming sound, such that it would spook the elephants and make them unmanageable/of little worth in the battle.<br>
<br>
When the time came to execute the plan, our warrior managed to fumble the pig attack so badly that he was trampled AND caught on fire by the pig.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25>Pen & Paper Rogues</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
