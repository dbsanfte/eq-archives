(math stuff)</span><hr size=1> Your assumption that random spawn times are fair overall as long as the range is a multiple of 24 hours is only valid if you also assume that there is a relatively equal distribution of players across all time zones. On most servers this is a false assumption, I'd be willing to bet.<br>
<br>
On my own server, Quellious, I would guess that probably 70 to 80 percent of the server population resides somewhere in one of the 4 major US time zones - Pacific, Mountain, Central or Eastern. The remaining population is concentrated in one of three major geographic areas: Europe, East Asia and Australia. With the opening of Antonius Bayle, the european contingent has fallen dramatically so they are even less of a factor now than they once were.<br>
<br>
What is my point, you may ask. It is simply this - unless a mob happens to spawn sometime during a narrow window that is favorable to players in the Mountain and Pacific time zones (say between 6 and 10 pm Pacific Time), then it might just as well have spawned during peak hours for Central and Eastern times because they'll always get first shot at the mob anyway.  Here's why.<br>
<br>
Let's say that on weekdays I typically log in around 6 pm Pacific time and log out around 10 or 11 pm. If a particular uber mob happens to spawn during that time, then my guild and I (who are mostly west coast players) will get a chance at the mob. It probably won't be uncontested (unless the mob spawns fairly late in my playing window) because my play time has some over-lap with the east coasters on my server. So, let's say between the hours of 6 pm and 8 pm Pacific, I'll have to contend with people from the east coast, but for the rest of my playtime (from 8 pm to 11 pm) I only have to contend with other west coasters. This leaves me with 2 hours of &quot;contested, but still possible to get&quot; time and 3 hours of &quot;relatively uncontested&quot; time.<br>
<br>
What happens during the other 19 hours of the day? I have very little chance at getting to any uber mobs that spawn during those times. The reason is because anything that spawns after I go to bed will normally be killed by the east coasters the next day after they get home from work/school - a time when I am still at work. Basically, any mobs that spawn from about 11 pm or so at night to 4 or 5 in the afternoon are free reign for people playing on east coast time since there aren't enough people playing from europe, asia, etc. to make much of a dent in the uber mob spawns that might pop when the east coasters are at work/school or what have you.<br>
<br>
If there was an even distribution of people playing from all time zones on the planet, then at least everyone would be in the same boat - you'd normally only get a shot at a particular uber mob if it happened to spawn during your window of play time. However, with so many people concentrated in the US, the people playing on east coast time get the lion's share of the spawns and the people playing from a western time zone get the dregs + whatever happens to spawn during a relatively narrow window when they're logged in.<br>
<br>
Not that I think Verant cares about this inequality between time zones, but if they did I have two suggestions for helping to even things out.<br>
<br>
First, they could create and enforce some type of reservation system. I don't really favor this option for a variety of reasons, but more importantly, I'm certain Verant doesn't want to go anywhere near a reservation system - it would be a hassle to set up and manage and it would cut into their bottom line.<br>
<br>
The second option, and the one that I favor, is to continue to have random spawn timers on these uber mobs, but to also implement some ways for people to trigger them at a time of their own choosing. Perhaps via a quest, or perhaps by creating &quot;spawn token&quot; loot that drops completely randomly off of just about any normal mobs in the game. This would have the advantage of taking the camping element out of the spawn tokens - uber guilds couldn't just simply sit at the known spawn points for token dropping mobs and farm the tokens.<br>
<br>
I realize that both of these suggestions are rough and probably have lots of problems associated with them that I haven't even considered, but I would certainly like to see Verant do *something* to address the issue of the imbalance between east and west coast players.<br>
<br>
Apologies for the length of my post and thanks for reading.<br>

(math stuff)</span><hr size=1> 2 guilds on day time, 1 guild on night time - 50% spawns during day, 50% during night. The nighttime guild gets a bigger share of the spawns. You're right - the population-weighting idea makes sense. <br>
<br>
Fixed: 66% spawn during day, 33% at night.<br>
<br>
The implementation might be pretty simple, depending on how fancy they got with the population forecasting. I doubt they'd put that much effort into it though.<br>

---------------What's he's quoting to------------------<br>
&gt; nope will be patchday + 6hrs so all mobs are in yank <br>
&gt; primetime its there most important player base, <br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
I promise you - It isn't.  <br>
<br>
Or rather, I promise you, that isn't the intent. (I can't really make promises about any changes the infernal game gnomes make to our code between the time it leaves Test and arrives on the live servers.) <br>
<br>
I wrote this one myself, and tested out granularity across the board. What I saw made it look like it was working exactly as we wanted: Totally random, across every time zone in the world. <br>
<br>
On the off chance that's not what happens on Live, you can bet we'll go back and make it so it is. <br>
