For reason much different then most on this section of the safehouse. <br>
I never left many posts but I read nearly everything in here. The safehouse was the first place to ever let anyone ever read any of my stories, and you all have helped me a ton, and I thank ye dearly for that. But I am a Christian, and though maybe roleplaying in itself isnt a bad thing, its what others see in my life. They may look and see me playing a game where there are fake gods, witchcraft, murder and other such things in which Jesus speaks out against. <br>
<br>
I will most likely be flamed for this post, but maybe some of you in here are christians as well, and will see the mistakes you are making in life, I am always open to talk to about anything you need.<br>
<br>
To those who knew me or read any of my posts, thank you for your support and time...<br>
If you have any questions about my reasons in leaving, or would like to know how to become a christian, I will more then willing explain it to you, my email is renwarb@angelfire.com<br>
<br>
Ciao and good luck to you all... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udranec.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dranec</A> at: 12/3/00 11:29:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uglipthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glip the Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/00 12:23:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=422.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ciao</span><hr size=1> Dranec, I'm not a Christian myself (raised as one, family are all Christians).  However, for as long as I can remember I've been hounded by them because I play RPGs, because my dad paints dragons, because I listen to metal, because I wasnt one of them.  I'm not going to question your faith or try to turn you away from Christianity, but I'll offer a piece of advice...  Dont quit EQ.  <br>
<br>
How many of those people who are judging you because you play EverQuest have actually played themselves?  How many of them have played D&amp;D? How many of them have taken the time to learn the OTHER side?  I can tell you the answer right now will be none.  They're ignorant, teach them, show them how it really is, otherwise this sort of thing will keep happening to people.  The only way to show them that RPGs are not evil is to teach them how to play.<br>
<br>
I'd recommend running a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure for them, only change the name to something different so they go in with an open mind.  Just use the same rules.  You'd be surprised at the results. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

You feel drawn to what Satan has to offer because of the spellcasting done within EQ?  You feel like murdering your neighbor because of the message &quot;You have slain a gnoll pup&quot;?<br>
<br>
Please, if this is true, yes, leave the game.  Don't waste your time with EQ, spend your time figuring out why you are like that and please, seek change.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying is a storytelling medium.  Stories are essentially the discovery of how a character reacts to a situation.  In roleplaying you take on a character and explore how your character (and you, since all characters have some aspect of you to them) react to those situations.  If you find your character enjoying murder, that should tell you something about yourself, that aspect of who you are that the character embodies, and you should use that knowledge.  Hopefully not to go out and kill your neighbors...<br>
<br>
The stories themselves though, I find it strange to believe that they by themselves could be harmful.  The Bible is filled with stories of incest, murder, genocide, adultery, idol worship, all manner of evil things, usually even done by the hero.  If stories of evil things are by association evil, the Bible, especially the old testament, is incredibly, horribly evil.  You know, it speaks of false gods, witchcraft, murder in the Bible, right?<br>
<br>
Those people watching you play, tell them about how you hope to conquer Hate, and slay the false god Innoruk, whom is worshipped by the horrible witches of the murdering Tier'dal.  See how they react to that. <p><strong><font size=4 color="#3366FF"><u>Ozaak Kaazo                                        </u></font><br>

I really dont think RPGs are against the bible, but the problem is the others see it, even if I could show a few of them that it isnt a sinful thing I could never show everyone, but then again maybe those few I show would show others as well. All in all I will wait a bit more to see if I can get anymore replies about this subj, whoever reads this I would like to know your advice and thoughts on the subj. Or if you dont want to post publically about this please Email me, I need help here, I am very confused on the subj of this.<br>
<br>
Any advice at all would be helpful atm. And if there are any Christians reading this post, please post what you feel, your advice would most likely be the best coming from another christian.<br>
 <br>
Until I get more replies, I am on hold in EQ, I wont play but I wont quit, thanks again glip and Ozaak.<br>
<br>
*******************************************<br>
<br>
Btw Glip, you should listen to your family on the subj of Christianity, you dont know what it will do for you to become a christian, besides the fact of going to heaven, it is the most important thing that ever happened to me, and I am a strong christian or try to be atleast, I am open for any questions if you would like to ask, either post in reply or email me =)<br>

From what you've said it seems that you enjoy EQ, roleplaying, and the like and see nothing wrong with it. However, it seems to be the views of your peers is that which is the affecting your decision. Perhaps I can speak in a more objective point of view here because I'm Jewish and looking at things from another angle than you may be.<br>
<br>
To me, it seems that the path to heaven would involve being a &quot;good person&quot;, performing charitable acts, and believing and following in the tenets of your religion. On the topic of charitable acts, I have never in any religion seen it mentioned that &quot;You must sacrifice your own well being for the good of the whole.&quot; Charity, tzedokah in my religion, is a noble and important system. There is an inherent difference, however, between philanthropism and cheap, meaningless charity. Philanthropism is the belief that helping others is important. When this goes too far, however, it becomes a meaningless shade of itself, one in which the person will sacrifice himself and his beliefs for the beliefs and wishes of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> any</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> other person. Qutting EverQuest on the word of these people, who have not experienced it and automatically and blindly assume that it possesses an &quot;evil nature&quot;, is not necessarily the right choice. This is the type of sacrifice I have just spoken of, the one in which you give up yourself and your own beliefs for those of someone else.<br>
<br>
Can you value these people's opinions? Yes, when you stop valuing them, you lose much of your humanity. However, there isn't any need to agree with people such as this. Don't give up something that you wish to do, especially because it doesn't harm anyone, on the whims of the ill-informed. The only thing that I could understand quitting the game for would be if you believe it violated the wishes of your god and theology. However, according to mine, I see nothing wrong with that. Humans are creatures of instinct, of passion. Perhaps a moral rationalization that you can make regarding the game would be this - by acting out your baser instincts inside of a game, it prevents them from leaking out in the real world. The human mind needs a pressure valve, and role playing is one way to let out the buildup.<br>
<br>
Think long and hard before you give up your freedoms and beliefs based on what others say. If anywhere leads to a heaven, I somehow doubt that doing so would. <p><p><center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/daklin_rogue/discodaklin.jpg"><br><i>You can tell from the way that I use my walk, I'm a woman's man...</i></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showPrevMessage?topicID=422.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showNextMessage?topicID=422.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=422.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.emailToFriend?topicID=422.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.threadControl?topicID=422.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=422.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=422.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing>Retirement Wing</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
