<br>
If garotte is taking down bladeturn, then there is a problem. When they gave us the ability, it was said that critical lines performed while hidden. meaning only our opening crits would break through the bladeturn and hit.<br>
<br>
Now, he is of the opinion that this is not the case. If he is right, then it is wrong and should be fixed. <br>
<br>
I don't care why he should not be worried about it because he is dead anyhow. If it isnt working as it was intended to work, we should want it fixed.<br>
<br>
Now, he hasnt done any official testing on it, it doesnt seem. If there is a caster on guin (non hib) that wants to do some testing on this, I will go and do it. Or our lead can run some tests. <br>
<br>
I will also do my best to watch while I am hunting tonight. Sure he has aoe nuke, that doesnt make him all powerful. He has a valid concern, maybe we should do something other than saying well, it wouldn't matter anyhow. You would just die anyhow so don't worry about it.<br>

I would first like to thank him, a non rogue class, for coming here to help solve a problem in a mature manner. Please treat him with the respect he deserves for this.<br>
<br>
His comment is valid, but complex, so please try to understand what he is saying. Here it is in SB speak:<br>
<br>
If I try to perf artery from behind, it is not a perf artery, <br>
it is a normal attack. If I use Garrote it is not a hidden style, it is a normal combat style.<br>
<br>
Ibioc is saying that he believes that only succesful &quot;hidden styles&quot; should take down blade turn (BT). I agree with this.<br>
<br>
What is needed is clarification of the &quot;Stealthed attack Vs Bladeturn&quot; rules.<br>
<br>
1. If any CS attack takes down BT, then that is not right. It should really only be our special &quot;Assassinate attacks&quot; - Backstab I &amp; II and Perf Artery.<br>
<br>
BUT,<br>
<br>
2. If it is only these attacks, but they also take down BT if they &quot;fail&quot;, then that too is a problem.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any testing results from this that we can give the TLs then that would be ueful.<br>

I guess that answers part of the problem, in that it is a &quot;hidden style&quot; flaw. Do BS I &amp; II also take down BT if they fail, ie attack carried out from wrong angle?<br>

The PA itself does not get through the bladeturn for damage. An unsuccessfully executed PA gets bladeturned, but if the assassin is dual wielding, he still has a chance to hit with the offhand weapon. I use a 2hander and I know for a certainty that if I screw up the PA, I will miss and then the fight gets interesting... The original poster's problem is with dual wielding, not assassin CS styles. <br>

Also, many Shadowblades are spec'ed with high Left Axe.  As Dither says, it sounds like you are getting hit with the off hand after the PA fails and still &quot;hits&quot; which causes no damage but removes your BT.<br>
<br>
You need to see if you ever get hit twice in the same round.  If you get hit for less than PA damge, say around 100 pts, twice in the first round, then there's a problem.  That would mean that the PA failed but still pierced your BT for damage.  If you only get hit once in the first round, then you were quite possibly hit by the offhand which would be perfectly valid.<br>
<br>
Your note about being poisoned concerns me a little.  If you have BT up and get hit with two poisons in the first round, there may be a problem there as well.  I haven't paid a ton of attention to it, but sometimes it seems like I apply a poison even though I missed on the swing.<br>
<br>
You attack the xxx with your sword!<br>
You miss!<br>
The xxx is poisoned!<br>
<br>
That shouldn't happen IMO, but it may be.  It's a seprarate issue, but may need some attention. <p><font size=1>

<br>
Okay, thanks for not just flaming me, I don't want to see assasins nerfed. Yes, the problem is in the first round that I'm getting hit by BOTH the offhand and the main hand. The main hand is hitting for the exact same damage that the offhander is (which means it's gotta be a failed style...no 50 infil's PA lands for just 110).  <br>
<br>
Here's an example of a fight that I'm concerned about. <br>
<br>
I'm standing near AMF, I see an infiltrator coming to get me. I begin dancing around to make it difficult for him to PA. <br>
<br>
First round. <br>
<br>
Assasin attacks you with his weapon.<br>
The blow has penetrated the magical barrier. <br>
You are hit for 110 damage. <br>
You feel weaker.<br>
Assasin attacks you with his weapon<br>
You are hit for 100 damage<br>
You are poisoned<br>
You are hit for 90 damage. <br>
<br>
You begin quickcasting mez. <br>
<br>
2nd round:<br>
Assasin attacks with weapon. <br>
You are hit for 170 damage<br>
You start moving slower<br>
You cast mesmerize (assasin now disabled)<br>
You are poisoned you are hit for 90 damage. <br>
<br>
At this point, I get hit by two more ticks of poison, and I drop dead. <br>
<br>
That's what I'm talking about. <br>
<br>
It's much easier to see this from the Caster's point of view.  It seems that when a PA isn't lined up correctly, you *DO* lose the massive to-hit bonus from the style.  I've had infils fail PAs and straight up miss me plenty (remember, if you're just in f6 melee &lt;no styles&gt; you're only going to hit an even con with good armor about 50% of the time&gt; but I've never seen it that their strike has hit my bladeturn. Furthermore, I don't think an armsman or any other tank has ever penetrated my bladeturn and straight up hit me since I've been level 50, so I would doubt that the infils just are getting lucky. <br>
<br>
My one test on the BG with my shade seemed to work, I went up to a sitting kobold caster from the front and did a backstab II, hit him on the first try.  Not positive he had his bladeturn up, but I would assume so. (I am never without it)<br>
 <br>

The difference is that the hidden styles are guaranteed to puncture it when they land successfully.<br>
<br>
You can see a normal attack go through a BT when you do PvE. Mobs are constantly puncturing my pulsed BT. Question is, is the PA puncturing BT every time on a failure, or is it only puncturing at the rate a regular hit would do so? (&lt;10% I'd guess, but I don't know the real value, and I doubt it's constant.)<br>
<br>
The only way we're going to know for sure is to do a controlled test. Intentionally fail several PAs against another tester, and examine their logs beside your own. Probably a good idea to try it with garrote too.<br>

Anyway...I had this happen again today..to a very low blue con assasin. I had a bladeturn up, and this is what the first round looked like. <br>

Anyway...I have 8 levels on the infil here...there is absolutely NO chance that he would ever be able to puncture my bladeturn without the benefit of the PA style. Furthermore, the PA style couldn't have been performed correctly..or it would have done more damage...<br>

To his credit...he wasn't exploiting a bug...I moved just before he struck...so i messed up his PA.  Just giving this as an example of the puncture thing. <br>

Not that anyone LISTENS to anything we report on pendragon, but it's worth a shot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Thanks for bringing this up, I don't think this is supposed to be happening.<br>

<br>
Please test thoroughly, there are some weird things going on with this.  Today, I had it where an assasin's strike seemingly *WAS* absorbed by bladeturn from stealth...I don't know if he may have just garrotted instead of using a failed PA or what exactly happened. <br>
<br>
I really don't have the resources to test this all that well on Guin...but I can very much vouch that something is weird here. (Assasins are the only ones that ever puncture my BT, and many times they obviously didn't perform their perf correctly). <br>
<br>
Thanks for giving it a look.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=2797.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=2797.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2797.topic&index=19><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=2797.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=2797.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2797.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2797.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
