HELOOOOOOOO Velks, AGAIN) and I believe I've finally figured this place out.<br><br>We'll start with the basics. You have three groups who want ownership of Hollowshade Moor. There are three special places that we'll call bases. The grimlings in the south have their base in one of their villages, the Owlbears in the north have their base in the north in the owlbear cave, and the Sonic Wolves in the east have their base in their cave. Once one of these races takes over all three bases, a named mob of the conquering race will spawn in the outpost where Vah Shir normally are right near Shar Vahl, surrounded by bodyguards.<br><br>I haven't done the owlbear and sonic wolf war yet, so I'll just detail for you the Grimlings.<br><br>The war happens all the time, so there is no need to trigger it, but should you want to start it on command, I've found that all you have to do is kill the Grimling Chieftain. This will continue the attacks and you can help the race of your choosing.<br><br>Now on to the step by step. First of all, the Grimlings already own 1/3rd of HM, so you only have two places to worry about, both being caves. You can kill the chieftain or wait till the grimlings attack, but when they do, you will get a zone wide message. The same goes for any race that attacks, you will be able to decipher who is going after who by the messages. If someone attacks the race of your choosing, there is very little worry, the defenders that spawn usually easily repell the invaders, but there is no harm in making sure that the invaders die. Now if your race is attacking, follow them, or wait for them to come to their destination. Whatever you do, DO NOT aggro the defenders before the invaders arrive, let the invaders come and aggro first, then attack defenders. Once some or all of the defenders are down, the victors will go into the base and they will populate it with their own kind. Now you're 2/3rds of the way there.<br><br>You can wait for them to attack their final enemy, or kill the chieftain and trigger it, but repeat what you did until they hold all three bases. Once this is accomplished, 8 bodyguards and Prince G something will spawn in the Vah Shir outpost. You will hear the shout across the zone proclaiming their victory. The bodyguards are highly social buff each other very well, but are easily dispatched by higher levels. The max hit was 64 or so and they normally hit in the 30s. Then you move onto the Prince. The Prince doesn't move, he just stands there. You can aggro him and run off, he'll just look at you. I'm betting he summons, but I am not sure of this, because out of the two times we took him out he didnt summon anyone.<br><br>Now for the important part. I'm betting you've heard all the above already and are wondering why the heck I'm posting common knowledge. The answer lies in the looting of the corpse. If you know the quest, no doubt you've heard of the 20 second rot time. We have found out (with the assistance of a GM) that the crucial factor is to leave at least ONE bodyguard standing. Once there are no more bodyguards, the corpse is &quot;dragged of to be ressurected at a later time...&quot; and it just vanishes. I'm not sure, but I think when you down the prince one bodyguard pops, probably the one that you should let live while you loot.<br><br>Side notes: When the Grimlings take over the owlbear caves, a named grimling spawns in there who dropped a 6/27 primary only spear. +3% to piercing, +3 wis/str/dex and procs engulfing darkness. Classes: BRD ROG Races: NONE <br><br>/eye<br><br>Also, one of the body guards dropped some no drop vah shir garrisoned armor or something like that, can't remember the name. 5/20 sword that looks excellent (gemmed scimitar, except much shorter and curved more abruptly) and a 20 AC shield that weighs 0.2 stones.<br><br>The loot that I saw on the Prince was all No Drop and what I inspected was Shield of the swamp or something like that and the stats I remember were 11 AC +3 wis, but usable as a back item as well as a shield. He dropped two of those. The only other drop I got to look at before he poofed was a 13/25 sword +4 bane damage against owlbears.<br><br><br><br>If anyone would like to post their experiences with this quest and results of supporting other races, I'd love to hear it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udokomo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dokomo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 12:22:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4692.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hollowshade Moor- Solved!</span><hr size=1> I let the grimlings take over, loaded up a 60 druid, got a target on the Prince, ran behind the wall of the outpost, had a ranger hold off his adds and nuked the guy to death. No summons, script ran perfectly, you have 20 seconds to loot the body. Leaving the bodyguards up wont help because they were still being tanked when I killed the Prince.

I was positive that we killed all the bodyguards, and then I summoned the GM to watch the fast rot time. When he went down, either a bodyguard spawned or it was one left, but whatever the case, the Prince's corpse disappeared moments after he went down. Could someone post the message you get when you down them all, about them ressurecting him. He told us to scroll up and read that, and when we said leave a bodyguard standing, he said we were correct. Something must have gone wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubunad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bunad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 1:34:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4692.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hollowshade Moor- Solved!</span><hr size=1> When you kill the prince it ends the war, not just the coprse decays, but every single mob despawns as well and the war is over until it is triggered again.  <br><br>And in my experience the only faction that can control the fort in front of shar vhal is the grimlings.  I've seen the sonic wolves and owlbears controlling the whole zone and the fort still had the cat vendors in there.  Also if you can get the owlbears or sonic wolves to win the war then it's much easier to get names because I haven't been able to find the one mob that despawns the whole zone like the grimling prince does from grimlings.<br><br>Then again I've only been playing around in the war off and on for 4 days or so, lots of fun though.

That's why it's such a @!_^*! pain to get the third part done.<br> <br>What's worse is,the war is VERY buggy. Since the last patch,even the grimlings have been screwed up-the Inny and FV server Moor has been wall-to-wall grimlings,and the outpost failed to respawn as bodyguards/prince.<br> <br>Once in a while,things will be a little screwy otherwise-for example,I've seen an owlbear labeled &quot;grimling herder&quot; (which is a grimling MOB). That's where the 5/20 scimitar and AC 20 shield are from,most likely-it's a bodyguard that ended up with a Vah Shir guard's loot table.<br> <br>Further,the &quot;X attacking Y&quot; zonewide messages where screwed up as of last patch...which means right now,the zone is messed up badly. Still,you can get nice stuff off the various named ones,but once a side is gone,it's gone till the next patch-the war is most of the time unfinishable as it stands. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <br>-Morgrist<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/udroledefiantdagger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drole Defiantdagger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 6:42:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4692.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hollowshade Moor-what's happening,and things are SNAFUed</span><hr size=1> Bah, it is odd on Prexus.

I guess they changed it in the last patch so it would happen like this in case the war script messed up . But the proublem is that there has been wolves in hollwshade since the day after the last patch , so he was either wrong or they messed it up even worse. Either way they will not repop the zone and are not able to anymore because of the bugs so i guess we wait for the server patch agian <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ulocostrangetf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LocostrangeTF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/02 3:04:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4692.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hollowshade Moor-what's happening,and things are SNAFUed</span><hr size=1> Thanks for that input.
