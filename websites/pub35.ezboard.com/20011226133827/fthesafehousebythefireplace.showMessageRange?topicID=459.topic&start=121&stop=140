This does mean some lapses in characther traits. Especially when Serhan is mentioned, since she is the base of these drastic changes any problems he feels associated to the new found feeling he will blame on her. Ergo him calling her his "weakness" which he will "destroy".<br>
I tried to explain in that last paragraph about how he's starting to think and wonder about life. He's never had to do this, so alot of philosophical questions are hitting him like a brick wall. Which are making him weak at what he's best at being, a soldier.<br>
He has to accept these feels before he'll become a true person. His inner demons still plague him. <p><B>Koz. Lean, Mean, Posting machine.</B>

All I said was he lost track of time. This doesn't mean he was socializing. He also thinks the most during the night. I have written many dialogues with him battling which way to live. But some of them I don't write out. And mostly because I want you(!) the reader to THINK about it. Think about why you do the things YOU do. Xvar is no more then a confused kid, that's the underlying reality. He's been taught one way to live, and that's by killing. The idea that he might care about something is difficult. Complicated people are used to making complicated decisions, but simple decisions are foreign to them because they've never had to deal with them.<br>
He will go back and forth as one side of his personality dominates according to what's appropriate to the situation. Xvar knows that that day is going to be a hard one and one of long traveling, possibily fighting. This makes him switch gears to what seems more logical, the fighting mindset.<br>
Try and think about it a little Vija, Xvar is dealing with normal emotions he's never had to deal with, this does sometimes negative things to a personality. And his own confusion is apparent in how he switches moods.  <p><B>Koz. Lean, Mean, Posting machine.</B>

I've parted from my path. How dare I betray myself." Xvar thought to himself.<br>
He stood pulling the lock of hair from out under his tunic he held it to his nose. "Serhan..."<br>
Jerra noticed his movements and watched in pure curiosity.<br>
His voice was low and in the single tone so over used.<br>
"I am going to go for a walk."<br>
Jerra watched his form descend from the rock, and still with bare feet he walked into the icy forest.<br>
Asunder had been at her side and she hadn't even noticed.<br>
"Charming, ain't he?"<br>
Jerra's thoughts broke and she turned to Asunder.<br>
"I used to train kids like him. I thought it was wrong to force good kids like that into a life like that."<br>
Jerra nodded solemnly.<br>
Asunder continued as if thinking aloud, "Xvar probably never worried about falling in love. When you don't have a heart it must seem paranoid to worry about something like that."<br>
Jerra looked at Asunder's face, his chuckle turned grim and he sighed.<br>
"These youth. What a horrible fate we've thrown you into. Disgraceful really."<br>
Jerra looked at him trying to show some condolence in her eyes. She reached up to his shoulder and smiled at him.<br>
"The turning of generations is so often marred by the wars of the past generation. This is a pattern. What is unsettling is that we as a people aren't learning from it. Not that it's anyone's fault. It's not going to be solved by blaming it on someone. We have to all accept as a people that this isn't the right way." She realized that she had never thought about it. The truth in her words was foreign. It had simply popped into her head and out her mouth. It was all so clear now.<br>
Asunder looked his age, not the genial man she had seen last night but an old man. An old man marked by experience, war, and the turmoil all life brings to life till death.<br>
Life's pattern had marked him with age, with sadness in his eyes, with wrinkles and scars. He lowered his head breathing out slowly.<br>
Jerra turned around and went into the tent.<br>
Asunder fell to his knees. His fingers kneaded in between the rough strands of dead icy cold grass. His head fell to his chest then to the ground. He pounded his head onto the ground. Crying silently he pushed his face into the ground.<br>
Jerra heard him from the tent, she sat on her cot. She looked just as full of apathy as Xvar was. She was silent, although tears of hopelessness streaked her face.<br>
She understood now. She saw why Xvar couldn’t cry. She saw why Asunder cried. She saw why the world wouldn’t let go. She knew they couldn’t defeat Aftar as things stood.<br>
“Hopeless.” She said with a light, gentle smile.<br>
Her gaze went to the floor of the door where Xvar appeared.<br>
He walked in, raised her chin looking at her sternly.<br>
He wiped her tears from her cheeks and said very simply, “Not yet.”<br>
His voice was completely gruff. The only trace of emotion was determination. <p><B>Koz. Lean, Mean, Posting machine.</B>

His wife collapsed into his arms as he opened the door, screaming about Serhan’s kidnap.<br>
She threw her head to his shoulder weeping and moaning. Salleigh had lost his daughter twice over. Holding his head in his hands he breathed heavily, but no tears came. His breaths shortened, breaking into a few sobs. His brow furrowed and he fell to the ground, his wife in his lap.<br>
A man behind them stood solidly. He spoke quietly, “We sent a messenger, but he did not arrive, his horse died from lack of rest.”<br>
“No matter how that horse could have arrived, he would have been black as death.” Salleigh said quietly.<br>
They were both startled by a sudden slam against the door. It knocked the door slightly ajar, and a small gust of wind blew it open. Pierced into the door was a dagger, which held up a small note.<br>
Salleigh rose and walked to the door reaching tentatively to the note.<br>
“Sir Salleigh-<br>
I must apologize that your daughter had to be used as a political tool in my favor, but the fates had it to be so. She will be returned once her purpose is realized. I promise she shall not be harmed.<br>
My deepest regrets,<br>
Sir Aftar Coriard.”<br>
“Magnatic wishes to make her the heir, I must go tell him of what has happened.”<br>
His wife sat shocked on the floor as he turned and walked out.<br>
“My daughter… a queen?”<br>
Magnatic sat his hands over his nose in a position you’d think he was praying.<br>
He breathed in slowly then exhaled at the same pace. He was completely calm.<br>
“This is perfect.” He said.<br>
“What do you mean! My daughter is kidnapped!”<br>
“We are kept in check by Lugiver. Lugiver’s army followed his father, who was so recently murdered. If I point the blame to Aftar, and tell them of Serhan’s kidnap the temptation to be heroes will make Lugiver have to rescue her. They will crush Aftar, but I do not have him underestimated. The army will be weakened, but not severely. We can call in the legions from our southern frontier to replace the dead. Lugiver’s army shall be heroes, but Lugiver is no general. I shall send someone else to lead them.”<br>
“Who?”<br>
“Myself. This shall restore the needed order. Lugiver can then be taken care of. His army will be brought here to become part of the royal army and take orders from me as their ‘reward’. In this way I can make sure their loyalty will not be to Lugiver. Freeing us from his political checkmate. At the same time, the Knights Justified will also be taken care of. Order can be fully repaired after that.”<br>
“But- who will lead in your absence?”<br>
“I will inform the other officials of the situation and they will not betray me. For when I return, with a massive army, they won’t dare try my patience or mercy.”<br>
Salleigh stared at Magnatic. “He’s brilliant,” Salleigh thought.<br>
Magnatic stood slowly. “I must go prepare for the upcoming battles.”<br>
“Is there anything I can do?”<br>
“You are a legendary archer, your fortune raised by winning tournaments, but do you think you could help me win a war?”<br>
“I can help you get my daughter back.”<br>
“Understood.”<br>
Xvar stood under a tall leafless tree on the hard cold stones of a small road. Looking above his shoulder he saw a single raven perching above him.<br>
“Yes, I know I can’t defeat him. But I don’t think it’s him I’m supposed to be fighting. There’s something else in this my brother, something of blackened evil. It is him I need to find and defeat, not Aftar. Where is my enemy?”<br>
The raven straightened up and cawed, flying closer to Xvar. His beak pointed back to Xvar’s ancestral home.<br>
“The cell. Is that my enemy?”<br>
The raven cawed and stamped its feet on the branch, hopping forward several times.<br>
“Thank you brother.” Xvar paused and looked to his elder land. “My brother tells me you are my enemy, what have your brothers told you?"<br>

She heard him speaking, despite their distance.<br>
Xvar raked his fingers through his hair, pushing his recalcitrant bangs from out of his way. Jerra saw his thoughts move to something else, somehow more troubling then his last thought. He looked exasperated.<br>
“A warrior’s greatest enemy is himself and all distraction. I find the more I consort with other people the harder this enemy is to combat. Useless, ugly distraction in the way of a meaningful battle. I was once free of distraction. I did not even consider myself, so my will was not my enemy, nor were ideals. Pure and simple battle was the way I lived. I know where I have to go now, and I know why I have to go alone. I only wish they could understand.”<br>
Jerra looked disappointed. She knew Xvar had to leave them, but she hadn’t thought he’d have to so soon.<br>
“But first I must take care of this painful distraction from my battle. So I will have to endure myself for a little longer. I don’t feel guilty for what I have to do, in fact I resent that they will make little effort to understand, not that they ever could.”<br>
Jerra did understand, the more she heard from him, the more she understood why he had to be the way he was, but she still didn’t understand the unspoken attraction to Serhan.<br>
The news of her adoption by Magnatic and her subsequent kidnap before she could even learn of this greeted them in the first town they traveled to.<br>
Asunder had parted with his band and followed Xvar and Jerra on their journey to Aftar. In the fairly large village they happened into the first thing their eyes met was an inviting looking inn. Deciding to rest for the night they walked into the lower floor, which seemed to be a tavern and office in the corner.<br>
Asunder walked over to get a room, Jerra a drink, and Xvar looked curiously at a small group of men by the wall. A poster on the message board stood out immediately. A printed sketch of Serhan adorned the poster with a small article underneath. Xvar pushed his way through, to the dislike of the other patrons for a better look.<br>
Underneath her face it read,<br>
“Magnatic was to claim an heir, and as he did so she was kidnapped before she could meet her new father. The somewhat famous Serhan Salleigh, daughter of the archery tournament champion, Sir Salleigh was abducted sometime in the last two days. Apparently a distant cousin of Magnatic, she was also an excellent student, debater and archer. Most notable for her debates in the city hall over recent laws, Lady Serhan is also an accomplished student of philosophy and apparently the perfect candidate for top official. Magnatic has issued a warning, if she is not returned within 10 days the suspect, Lord Aftar Coriard will be attacked by Lugiver’s forces under the guidance of Magnatic. It was also said that Lord Coriard may have been the assassin who killed the late Count Lugiver the first. The army is eager to avenge their loss, and willing to do so were tomorrow the day of the attack.<br>
For all those in the southern frontiers, you may be advised to move out of the area until a more secure force is stationed since it is expected the legions will be withdrawn from this area to reinforce the attack…”<br>
One of the patrons jested at the picture, “Awfully pretty, would make a good wife and mistress, I mean daughter.”<br>
All the other patrons burst out in laughter as he made his comment.<br>
Xvar threw his dagger forward, whizzing by their heads just under the single nail that held the parchment up. He reached forward, moving it back and forth making a small half circle under the nail until the paper was free and drifted into Xvar’s hand.<br>
He rolled it carefully then put it down the left side of his tunic.<br>
He walked up to the room Asunder had gotten and lay on the floor in the corner, free from conversation about his action.<br>
Jerra had been witness to it as well and looked at him in the corner, his arms folded behind his neck and his eyes closed.<br>
His expression was nearly unreadable, but the bulge in his tunic spoke more then anything he could of conveyed with his face. As he adjusted himself the bulge crinkled slightly and he stiffened, making certain not to crush the small piece of brittle paper.<br>
Asunder stayed in the tavern below, and who better to walk in this moment then Tyu and Farren, who promptly sat down next to him. Farren spoke.<br>
“We want to come.”<br>
Asunder nodded. “I know, I know.” He said sipping his tankard slowly with his eyes narrowed. He put up to fingers without putting up his head. He spoke to the bartender, “Two more of the same.” <p><B>Koz. Lean, Mean, Posting machine.</B>

“We can not return her, they will attack regardless of whether we do or not. They don’t understand our intentions at all; it’s all been misconstrued just so Magnatic can get the power back from Lugiver.”<br>
Aftar sighed, collapsing into a nearby chair he continued rubbing the bridge of his nose.<br>
“We can not win if we fight them. But we must fight. Can’t anyone see how ugly this battle will be?”<br>
Aftar stood and walked briskly to Serhan’s cell. He had provided her with unusual luxuries for a prison, trying to keep her comfortable.<br>
She stiffened as she heard the door unlatch.<br>
He sat down in a chair, looking defeated and somber. He looked up at her, “What would you do Lady Serhan? What would you do?”<br>
Her voice was perfectly calm, almost as if she was speaking to a wounded child, “I would not have gone down your path. I find it difficult to justify your motives, although they are understandable. However, I do not think rebellion is in the best interest in the people. Those that are dead need not be consecrated through more bloodshed. This only furthers the illusion violence can accomplish satisfaction and peace. No true peace can be reached if the underlying reality is the same. You made a large mistake trying to reach your goal through crime. Those you mean to justify are dead. They need no justification through your conquer. They died to protect their land, not to conquer others’. Your purpose is obsolete now. Please release me, I want no part in any mans motives for power. Neither yours or Magnatic’s despite how I agree with his more.”<br>
Aftar nodded his expression distant and unreadable.<br>
“I had a feeling you would say something to that affect. But Serhan, I do believe you misunderstand our intentions.”<br>
“If your intentions can be so easily misread, then you should learn to better express them. How you gained power will always taint your power, no matter what a good leader you become.”<br>
“But Lady Serhan, I don’t do this only for myself. I do this for all those under the tyranny of the king, or of Lugiver.”<br>
“The king is nothing but a poster face, the true power lies in Magnatic’s position, and he holds and wields it well. If Lugiver was without an army Magnatic could restore the proper order. And in a way, you’re defeat will only further that.”<br>
“Yes, I see that now. Kidnapping you was a mistake, but it is not the only factor. Lugiver’s assassination certainly stirred things up as well, but it had to be done. He was no longer cooperating with us. Lady Serhan, please understand, I don’t mean to simply conquer for the sake of power. I mean to conquer this land and restore the proper way of things. Those that died for this cause should be avenged. We will fight this last great battle until every one of us is dead. If we can not influence this world the way we meant to, we shall let them see how truly evil a battle can be.”<br>
Aftar stood up, looking down briefly at Serhan’s stunned face.<br>
“This isn’t the way to show them! Not all will understand! You have to teach them!”<br>
Serhan yelled as he shut the door behind him. She pounded her fists on the door for a few moments. Before slumping onto the door then down the door to the floor. She pulled her knees to her chest and leaned her chin on them, the putting her forehead to her knees she began to quietly cry.<br>
Aftar sighed as he left the proximity of the door, hearing Serhan’s sobs…<br>
His brow relaxed and his eyes shut, putting his hand on the railing down the stairs from her cell.<br>
Opening his eyes, he looked over his shoulder, “They will learn, Lady Serhan, they will learn – the hard way.” He turned back to the stairs and walked down them, his steps became nothing more then silence.<br>
---------------------------<br>
Xvar awoke with a slight crick in his neck, but nothing serious. He rose from the hard floor of the room and looked over to Asunder and Jerra. Jerra lay peacefully asleep in her bed. Asunder was sitting over the edge of his bed, looking deep in thought. Xvar ignored Asunder’s expression and walked out of the room. Pausing only once not bothering to look over his shoulder.<br>
“Wake her up and bring her down, we need to leave as early as we can.”<br>
Asunder nodded in silence as Xvar walked down the corridor to the stairs and tavern below. Navigating through the upturned barstools and passed out drunkards that seemed to frequent the bar he walked out to the horses below. Tyu and Farren stood arms folded and silent.<br>
Xvar’s expression seemed impervious, but he spoke. “I assume you want to tag along?”<br>
Farren didn’t adjust his posture to acknowledge Xvar but simply nodded. Tyu’s hood fell far over his face, his emotions shrouded from view, but he was the one to speak.<br>
“I know what Aftar will do, we musssst prevent it.”<br>

It would help if we knew what he meant to do when he kidnapped her.”<br>
“To get to you, of course.” Farren said, not moving his chin off his chest.<br>
Xvar’s eyes widened with a trace of fear, then he pulled his mask back over him and his face settled. He wanted to ask how they knew, but he could probably figure it out himself. Just as his thoughts were following a line of logic, trying to figure out how Aftar had known Farren spoke again.<br>
“She wished to postpone the wedding. The rest was putting 2 and 2 together.”<br>
Xvar let out a small breath turning away from them violently and jumping on his horse. He yelled up to the window of Asunder’s room.<br>
Asunder scurried down the stairs with a groggy, disoriented Jerra in toe.<br>
He put her on top of her horse and she wiped her eyes, give Xvar a small wave of approval.<br>
Tyu and Farren walked to the side of the inn, returning with two healthy horses, noone asked where they had gotten them. <br>
Asunder reared his horse and turned it around, speaking to Xvar as the restless horse kicked the ground with impatience. “I bet you 10 plat I can find where Magnatic would put his troops for the attack, maybe we can meet up with him there.”<br>
Seeing no other choice Xvar nodded and waved his hand, pointing in the direction Asunder galloped off into. <br>
The first leg of the trip led through a small forest. Luckily a trail big enough for horses wound through it, making for a faster ride. The five riders were completely silent except for when Asunder was barking out directions and where to turn.<br>
The forest seemed to be a large triangle like patch of land in which it’s center a large river furrowed through the landscape. Most of the trees were evergreen, with the occasional bare branched oak or elm. They rode until nightfall, stopping near the edge of the forest where it meets a large plateau of solid, granite rock. At the plateau’s base were the intermittent remains of dead dry plants and skeletons. The flat, dusty land stretched out for what seemed the infinity right past the horizon.  The once vigorous river was no more then a trickle of a creek at this point as it reached the barren, yellowish soil.<br>
“Qlirec Lands.” Asunder said his face looked grim.<br>
“Qlirec?” Jerra questioned.<br>
“It means, literally translated from Dakan, ‘Go in and die.’” Xvar said sternly.<br>
Jerra looked to Xvar who was steadily eyeing the horizon in front of them. The sun’s eerie glow made all the land tinted with a reddish orange.<br>
“What does Xvar mean in Dakan?”<br>
“Xvarian means ‘Sentinel’.” Asunder said, the slopes of his mouth tugged at by a smile.<br>
“Asunder means ‘Tides’.” Xvar said, countering Asunder.<br>
“Tides? Why would anyone name you that?”<br>
“I had a rather mercurial personality when I was young I’m afraid. It’s meant to represent my patience, or lack thereof.” Asunder said with a large smile.<br>
Jerra nodded, dismounting and tying her horse to a small dead tree.<br>
Tyu and Farren were already off their horses. Tyu sat up in a tree, looking out over the land. Farren spoke, “Tyu will keep the first watch.”<br>
“I’ll take the second.” Xvar said, nodding at Tyu.<br>
Asunder made a small circle of stones, then asked Jerra to gather some firewood. Once he had arranged the sticks into a small tee-pee like structure inside the stones he took out his tinderbox and struck a light.  He gently fanned the spark into a comfortable flame. Then holding his hands gratefully over the fire soaking in the heat he spoke. “Someone grab some water from the creek, I’ll get the bits of rabbit meat and vegetables I have and we’ll make a stew.” Everyone, except Tyu of course, sat around the now cozy fire basking in its glow. Asunder decided to tell a Dakan tale. Everyone sat attentively as he spoke.<br>
“There was once a great knight. He was admired by all his peers, and loved by all his ladies, and fighter for good.” Asunder paused to test the soup then continued. “He found a suit of armor, unlike anything he’d ever seen. It was beautiful and intricate and light. It felt as if he wore a suit of feathers with the strength of a hundred steel layers. Noone wanted to fight him for they thought this armor to be invincible. But another champion, from a not so distant kingdom came. He mocked the armor and said it to only be a fable. But when the knight fought in the armor for the first time, he almost went mad. The world shifted, and in this world he saw every world the armor had seen. He saw every battle, and although blinded by this illusion of past battles the armor led him to kill the other knight. When the illusion faded he saw his sword stained with blood. The last illusion he had seen was his death. He had in fact, in this illusion killed himself. And as the last words of the dying knight were heard the armor mangled those as well into this, ‘In yourself is your only enemy.’ And after that day he threw off the armor, locked it away and never let anyone use it again. This armor, it is fabled, shows you your true future and your true enemy.” Asunder sipped some stew from the wooden ladle and smiled in satisfaction. “Well, enough about mystical armors, how bout some stew?”  <br>
Xvar looked at Asunder and asked curtly. “What was the armor called.”<br>
“Hmm? Oh, it was called the Armor of Tru’Ferr, since it showed it’s wearer true fear. Clever eh? It’s rumored that the armor was that of a dakan knight and is somewhere locked up in dakan ruins.” Xvar nodded and continued on his soup.<br>
“And the moral of that story is that all invincibility comes with an equal price.” Asunder said with a slight smile.<br>
Jerra looked over at Xvar, who seemed to be deep in thought about something. “Probably the armor intrigued him,” She thought silently to herself.<br>

Xvar took the second watch as he said he would, but Tyu did not sleep. He walked into the desert, scaled a dead tree and looked over the parched land. Xvar knew parts of Kunark looked highly similar to these lands, and Tyu probably was struggling with memories.<br>
This thought brought back thoughts of his home to him. By the time he was born all was left of the once great empire was the colony, and now that he thought of, he had never been home. He sat back, his head leaning back on the course back of the tree. He spoke an ancient dakan poem about the original land and it’s fall from glory.<br>
Jerra listened in silence, not understand it of course since he spoke it in his native language:<br>
“Gold. All around us is this land of gold. Gold crops, gold roads, gold hearts of fortitude.<br>
Blue. All around us in this land of blue. Blue seas, blue streams, blue sky.<br>
Green. All around us in this land of green. Green grasses, green marble, green trees.<br>
Red. All around us in this land of red. Red blood, red scars, red anger.<br>
Black. All around us in this land of black. Black night, black death, black forests.”<br>
Asunder roused, he knew those words. Every single dakan ever born after the exodus knew those words. They were the words taught to everyone and memorized by the age of 5. So noone ever forgot the pain, or the homeland. But it wasn’t a simple poem of despair. It also showed the great strength in the times of the exodus. The Dakans had overcome all in their path. The struggle of over a thousand miles and 50 years had led them to settle in the colonies. The Qlirec lands used to belong to the Dakan. There were probably some cut off forts still operating in those lands. Some were still maintained by the colonies, and some were no more then deserted piles of rubble.<br>
The Dakans had once a marvelous culture and civilization. Their beliefs based on the ideals of realistic organization and peace within. Rebellions were rare and easily undone. The dynastic cycle left small patches of history tainted by indolent or foolish rulers, but this wasn’t as serious a malady as it was for other places. The pride of the Dakans was a lingering force for motivation.<br>
Asunder rose. He and Xvar exchanged glances, brushing past eachother as Asunder took the next watch. Jerra watched as Xvar walked off to sleep away from everyone else. With a sigh she rested her head back on her makeshift pillow, a saddlebag. <br>
“I know it’s not the right time yet Xvar, but aren’t you strong enough to win with a heart?” Jerra said to herself and she drifted off.<br>
Xvar looked up to the stars, over the desert no clouds dared cross. It seemed even the moon and the clouds feared these lands. These lands were pure death. There was no native life, just those old forts and a few dead remnants of a dried lakebed. A thin layer of dust rested on top of the cracked dried mud that stretched out in front of him. He was lying facing the desert. It was his way of facing the future. He wondered what the armor would have shown him. What would his future be? Would it be as desolate as the lands in front of him, or as beautiful as the sky above him? He had to admit the cloudless view of the stars was stunning. He knew who his enemy was. He knew what his only distraction was. “Serhan…” He silently mouthed to the sky. He spoke, “I don’t like that you already know where I’m going.” His anger seemed to be directed to the sky. “I wish you’d just tell me. Just tell me so I don’t have to ask… I know you won’t tell me, but I know who will.”<br>
He said, his gaze was stern. He pulled the small parchment from his tunic, tracing the features in the picture.<br>
“Maybe you can tell me who I am.”<br>

Serhan was taken to the library. Aftar sat, his face looking contemplative positioned on one of his fists. His elbow was on the arm of a large chair in the middle of the room. Several desks, book shelves and various tomes were the only decorations besides the intricately carved chair and beautiful rug. He was faced towards the hearth and when the guards pushed her in he seemed oblivious.<br>
“Why are you doing this? Your motives are nothing more then revenge and ambition masked thinly with a false story of glory and justification.  You claim to seek justice, but how can you when all you do is create more unrest and bloodshed? Are you so blinded by your hazy ideals that you don’t see the recourse of your actions?”<br>
“Lady Serhan, my intentions are inversely masked. The soldiers who seek bloodshed will fight for me. The soldiers who seek justice will fight for me. I take no more advantage of this then does Magnatic. A soldier’s intentions are his own, and no reasonable amount of training can change those. I prefer they join with similar intentions. But their true motives, revenge, greed, need, or duty are their own and I can never see them all. Those that I keep close to me I keep in check from being misguided. I believe that is why Tyu and Farren left me. They knew they could no longer follow my ideals. This is the greatest respect they could have shown me, and I understand that now. The underlying reality of what I’m doing will not change with change of intent. I was going to show this world what the Dakan life was like. How the Dakans’ emphasis on realistic ideals could help this world reach closer to a peaceful, good place.  Unfortunately, this idea got lost in the diffusion of ideas among the soldiers. When the soldiers forget what they’re fighting for the battle is useless and ugly. Even if they fight with bad intentions these intentions are their own and they will fight with justification no matter how evil the discourse. This makes a battle worthwhile. Can’t you see that Lady Serhan? This battle will make every single man, woman, and child think about why they fight. If we can all get to the root of why we fight then maybe we can use it like a snake’s poison is used to cure a bitten man. I did not have this in mind in quite the same way. I meant to take over as peacefully as possible and then show the way. The orcs would have been involved. They are a stupid race that fights because it’s all they know how to do. Those that have emotions are scorned and killed. They are a perfect and necessary evil. When this battle passes we will be destroyed, but you will live on and you can show everyone just how disgusting this battle truly was. I have to say my ideals evolve as I see more of this world. I find it discouraging that I could get so much power so easily. A mere criminal with a force could take over this world at any moment…”<br>
Serhan stood there, taking in his speech.<br>
“This is not the way to show them. People, normal people, poor people want peace. They want a good, normal life. When we try to organize people, try to categorize people is where the battles start. People should be equal, people should be taught, people should be led by a good, virtuous leader. But even I know that this is unrealistic. Not in these times, in the times of deep-seated hates that rips us apart, not in the time of such foolish decisions. You can’t be serious. You can’t mean it this way! You don’t see what you’ll be doing. All this to prove a point? No. This is not the truth.”<br>
Aftar stood up and put his large hands on Serhan’s shoulders. He looked into her eyes, his expression sincere:<br>
“You were right about one thing though, the way you get power always taints your power. I see that now Serhan. The people will learn the hard way. They will feel the need for hope. And you must help that blossom. I know my intentions are masked by your prejudices of me. And they are rightfully so. I have killed 3,467 people in the last 26 years. That’s more then you’ve probably ever met in your entire life Serhan. But the common people don’t kill anyone. The Dakans understood this Serhan. They wanted to show everyone this but were cut short. Now I will show them, and you will tell them why I did. The strongest soldiers will not follow a man who preaches peace, a man who preaches the things I believe. I needed to change, I needed to be the way I am so this can happen. I didn’t want things to be like this, but now that they are I think it’s better.”<br>
“I think you drastically underestimate soldiers.”<br>
“And I think you have just the hope in soldiers, and all of people to make things right again.”<br>
Serhan’s breath caught as he said that. The sudden realization of the truth in his words made her freeze. <br>
His face became cold, he put his hands back to his sides and turned back to the hearth. With a sudden boom he yelled to the guards to put her back in her cell.<br>
“Magnatic was right about her. If he understands that, maybe he’ll understand me. I hope I won’t have to kill him.”<br>

I am a gundam wing fan, but non of the characthers are quite the same.<br>
I'll try and explain myself here:<br>
<br>
the armor that is exactly like the wing zero and the epyon. <br>
-Eypon tells futures, zero shows a hiegthened sense of battle, I guess, in some ways, this is true. But then again, I have read a series with a sword that shows everyone the truth about themselves was the main feature. I thought this would be interesting, so I tweeked the idea from that. I needed some concrete reason for Xvar to have motivation to protect Serhan. His reason is almost completely selfish. He just wants her to help him figure out who he is. He believes this way he can withstand whatever the armor shows him about himself. In reality Xvar is plagued with caprisious depression. Thinking that he can never love anything long enough to really settle down and live a good life. <br>
<br>
the fact that heero yuy and xvar are the same<br>
-They are close in personality, but not the same. Both cold yeah. But Xvar is much more in touch with his humanity and yearns for it much, much more. Xvar is incredibly complex. The only constant thing in his world is his duty. And this was inspired by THIS quote, not Heero Yuy:<br>
"A samurai's spirit cracks and decays when besides his duty- he finds a reason to live."<br>
That is Xvar's ENTIRE basis for characther. Xvar looks NOTHING like Heero.<br>
<br>
<br>
or serhan and relena peacecraft,<br>
-Yeah, they are close. Jesus, the more I think about this the more I agree, these stories are really close. Serhan wants peace, Relena wants peace. Wow, exact replicas. Serhan was NOT sheltered, Relena was. Serhan is already realistic about her ideals. She believes what Aftar is doing is right. How is this similiar to gundam? Isn't it exactly the opposite?<br>
<br>
or aftar and zechs/milardo and sometimes treize kushrenada.<br>
-Aftar has evolved during the story. He hides his motives saying he's a barbarian and a conquerer. I've never heard either Zeches or Treize say this. If they have, please, tell me where and I'll simply cut out the lines. Aftar looks nothing like either characthers and his methods are pretty different. Aftar wants to show the world how they were wrong about the Dakans. He wanted to do this by reestablishing the Dakan empire. But now that he sees he can't do that he's trying to help Serhan figure out how she can show them.<br>
<br>
 i was only suspecting such a blatant ripe off until i headed over to your site and saw the first line: "I'm a Gundam Wing addict. . ." then in this last episode, aftar told serhan this: "I have killed 3,467 people in the last 26 years." Strange, when wufei chang battled treize for the second and last time, treize happened to mention that he knows how many and the names of all the people who have ever died for him. seems quite odd to me."<br>
-Yeah, he did. I don't want Aftar to be a bad guy. That's why I wrote that.  There are many, many stories where the enemy incites how many people he's killed. Aftar would have to know it because it's a trophy. But it's PART of his explanation that the common man doesn't know the guilt of death until they're FORCED into war and then find out the hard way. This was never mentioned in gundam.<br>
<br>
I wanted a dynamic moral dilemma. Here's how I thought I'd go about doing that:<br>
Xvar - Shows you eventually that people can overcome lack of emotion and gain back humanity. While still trying to figure out who you are, where you should be and whether destiny exists or not. Xvar shows the hopeless people who want to be heroes because they want to use their own worthlessness in a good way. Heero Yuy never does this, he lives for the mission. Xvar does not.<br>
Jerra - The main reliable narrator of Xvar's emotions since Xvar won't talk much. Also shows the confused population which is being kept out of touch.<br>
Aftar - Shows a crushed people who think their ideas were best and should be how the world is ruled. A man who is born a barbarian but ideals are so strong can overcome this original emotion and find a way to take over the world and show them the right way. Shows the idea of force of undeniable fate.<br>
Magnatic - Shows a good man who is plagued with a lack of humanity and knows it, looking for a better heir. Represents the confused, unhappy generation which are trying to help the new generation from destruction but plagued by helplessness and guilt. Noone in gundam, that I ever saw, showed this. <br>
Serhan - Represents what's still good about ideals. I had to have her become more powerful in some way because I needed her to become worth fighting a war for. I considered making her the daughter of Lugiver, but I decided this was even more of a stretch. And then I couldn't have Magnatic kill off both Lugiver and Aftar in one stroke, returning some peace. But I complicated this further.  I made a completely evil charachter, Daro, to show the exact opposite of what a bad guy can be. I did this to make you question what makes a good and a bad characther good and bad. I also let Lugiver run off so he could find an army and cause later trouble. <br>
Lugiver - Represents the basic human instincts of greed and survival, I needed people to find someone they could hate because in reality they knew a part of them was just like him. And no matter what, he will always survive in some way.<br>
Asunder - Represents the elder generation marred with a feeling of guilt for the new generation. Similar to Magnatic's feelings. Also saw the exodus of the Dakans first hand.<br>
Overall theme: To show that bad and good, war and peace, and human and animal are balanced and subjective. That is my theme.<br>
<br>
 Tell me McKerrn, compare all this to Gundam. I admit, some of the characthers have the same mannerisms. They have to if I can show them correctly and get the point across.<br>
 If you can find EVERY charachter's match I'll delete the whole post. But until you do all you have is that some talk and walk the same. Big deal. The entire plot is different, the characthers motivations are different. The setting is different. What else do you want me to do? Make them all just drop everything and go fight a dragon? Noway. I wanted the reader to really think about why the hell they are doing what they're doing. That's what Xvar's line is about:<br>
"Have someone write it down. Have someone draw it. So everyone will remember even when the original memory is nothing but a bad dream."<br>
<br>
Still not convinced? Just ask. I will defend the originality of my story to whatever lengths I have to.<br>

It gave me a chance to explain everything and clarify everything.<br>
Now that I am rather more calmed down I'd like to apoligise if I was to forceful. But I did feel you were jumping the gun, since the story isn't over and that you would have best just e-mailed me and if you didn't get a satisfactory reply post the whole thing so I don't have to humiliate either of us.<br>
This story is my story, and to be most honest about it, Xvar is my characther. Xvar, in many, many ways represents the depressed, unhappy, and confused person I am alot. Your calling him fake, or a copycat hurt me in a personal way. Because in all truth, writing is my only way of expressing whatever I feel, which is why I wrote this story. In Scout I used large events to exagerate unhappy times in my own life. In this story I articulated my loss of hope in parts of humanity and my own struggle to figure out who I am and what I mean.<br>
<br>
I apoligise if I am not an original person, but I'm me, and that's something I can't change, not yet at least.<br>
<br>
I'd appreciate you returning the consideration of replying. It took a great deal of effort for me not to explode considering how hard I've worked on this and how it feels sometimes it's all I've really got that's part of me. I hate getting in to that cliche "poor, starving misunderstood artist" thing, but it partially applies.<br>
<br>
