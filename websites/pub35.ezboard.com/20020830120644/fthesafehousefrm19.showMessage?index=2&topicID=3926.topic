How you can manage to extrapolate what he WOULD have done on a hit that is capped is beyond me. I have hit people sitting or standing for my cap of 750 on my perf. Until I swing and hit them, though, I don't know how much I am going to hit them for. I would like your crystal ball that can predict how much I would really hit for though.<br>
<br>
Secondly, you don't know the second SBs weapons, how fast, or what quality. You don't know if they had res sickness (possible) or was debuffed, or anything else. In addition, I personally have perfed casters for 250 points, so I think most of us are aware that epic armor really hurts all perfs.<br>
<br>
Third, we have shadowblades on our server that do a damn fine job of kicking ass, without buffs or bots. LA is a better tool than DW/CD, so while their damage 'type' is limited, their overall damage is greater. <br>
<br>
Shadowblades, nightshades and infiltrators need like ZERO attention for a while. Let things shake out with spell crafting and alchemy. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, there are real classes and real spec lines that actually NEED attention. Classes like Paladins, thanes, warriors. Spec lines like sorcerer mind, therugist earth line, spirit master's spirit line, and mentalist lines.<br>
<br>
Assassins don't need anything right now. They do just dandy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujablackhand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>J A  Blackhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.crewsman.homestead.com/files/Demon_Hunter.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 11:18:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3926.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;AND:<br>
you said qou were siting by the first attack = double dmg &quot;<br>
<br>
 Well, that was part of his point friend.  His estimates though other than the actual hit dmg are pretty much on the nose even though they are just estimates.<br>
<br>
 As for Assassins not needing any attention, I play on three severs atm and would have to disagree atleast where Shadows and Shades come into play.  They do not need alot that's for sure but I do think the two class types need a rework.<br>
<br>
 I do agree though that classes like (espescially) Warriors need a massive overhaul, after all they are supposed to be Midgards heavy hitters and main tanks yet they have become all but Midgards least played class which in it's own right should say something.<br>
<br>
 I've tried making a few proposeals for Warriors yet sadly most of my opposition on that subject comes from Hunters, who also are the ones in Midgard who oppose m,ost things about Assassin classes yet use Shadowblades as their example.  Hell it's no surprise at all that Shadows are being nerfed to death with players from all three realms going against them.<br>
<br>
 Then again, it's always the sucky Hunters who are whining and doing the &quot;nerf so and so`s&quot;, the good ones just keep racking up the RP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarxantael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arxantael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 12:19:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3926.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I'm hitting for pretty crappy PA's lately<br>
Usually I perf with an arcanium Bastard Sword 4.1, 16.2<br>
I've perfed for 260 on a Scout.<br>

I used an Arcanium Great Dwarven 2Hander (16.5, 5.0?) and hit for 368.<br>

LA 43 +6<br>

On the other hand, I perfed (Same 2hander as above) a yellow Alb not in epic armor for 811- I was amazed. (but then yellow alb could be down to level 46?)<br>

I like playing my assasin, but when our PA's are dwarfed by spearo's, polearmsman styles...I have to wonder.<br>

<br>
However, most of your NS or INF brethren are not going to support you on this. These boards have proven over and over to be used as a means for one assassin class to influence changes to the game that handicap one of the other classes. There are a few outspoken NS and INF (Ubergnome comes to mind) who agree the SB has been nerfed too far. But the rest of the lot are content with the nerfage.<br>
<br>
SBs have and will survive, most of us thrive when the odds are stacked against us. Mythic has done about as much as they can do to make SBs weaker than NS and INF without flat out taking away our weapons. NS and INF have absolutely nothing more to cry about. If they cannot win now, well you can figure out the rest. The shadowblade has become the &quot;kick me&quot; dog of the assassin world. I supported NS getting adjustments, and I still do even though their boost came directly at my expense. What goes around comes around. Mythic has proven that.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I do agree that other classes need help. Better to spend your time and Mythic's time fixing them. Population disparities are becoming a much larger issue on many servers and 2 realm wars are developing. Mythic needs to fix those issues before countless people leave the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3926.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3926.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3926.topic&index=4><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3926.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3926.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3926.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3926.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
