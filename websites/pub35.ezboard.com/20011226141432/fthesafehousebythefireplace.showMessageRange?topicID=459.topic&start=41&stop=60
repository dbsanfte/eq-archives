&quot;Tyu! Do you smell him?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hisssss.... Yessss! A little, very faint, to the west!&quot;<br>
&quot;You had better be right Tyu!&quot;<br>
&quot;I know I am... C'mon, let'ssss find him.&quot;<br>
Farren nodded, drew his cloak and jump from the roof to a lower platform.<br>
Tyu walked into the shadows, dissapearing.<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
Xvar sprinted to the falconer.<br>
&quot;Have you news?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, this came.&quot;<br>
He handed Xvar a small piece of paper, it was only about 3 by 3 inches with 1 letter on it.<br>
&quot;B&quot;<br>
Xvar's eyes lit up and he thanked the falconer, throwing him a gold piece.<br>
The falconer waved him off as he ran out the door.<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
As he ran down the somewhat overgrown trail he batted plants and branches out of his way. Running right into a clearing, he then stopped, skulking forward cautiously.<br>
He heard a very low whistle.<br>
He relaxed and stood up straight.<br>
&quot;Lead me to Coriard!&quot;<br>
A small whisper came forth, &quot;Who are youuuu?&quot;<br>
&quot;I am his apprentice, that's all you need to know.&quot;<br>
&quot;I seeeee... I shall fetch himmmm....&quot;<br>
Coriard walked out from the other side of the forrest around the clearing.<br>
&quot;You remembered?&quot;<br>
Xvar laughed, &quot;How could I forget?&quot;<br>
&quot;Come, the other bandits wish to meet you.&quot;<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
Yurd waltzed into Serhan's home.<br>
&quot;Heellllllloooo?&quot;<br>
&quot;Just a minute....&quot;<br>
Yurd yawned impatiently and slumped against the wall.<br>
&quot;Ready.&quot;<br>
&quot;Alright, come on.&quot;<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
&quot;They'll find us soon, but it won't matter, me, you and the bandits will be enough to make them reconsider and back off for a better time.&quot;<br>
&quot;I understand. They won't leave until they kill one of us at least.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I know. And one of them isn't actually a rogue...&quot;<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;I know who they are, and you're right.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who are they?&quot;<br>
&quot;This isn't a good time to tell you.&quot;<br>
&quot;I understand.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm going to die in this battle Xvar. I'm old now, and weary. I need to rest, I don't fear it.&quot;<br>
Xvar's expression didn't change.<br>
&quot;When I die, take the letter out of my pocket and leave me. Don't linger.&quot;<br>
Xvar nodded emotionlessly.<br>
&quot;It will explain the situation. When you've read it, burn it.&quot;<br>
&quot;I will.&quot;<br>
&quot;Also, take the medallion, the note will explain it to. At all costs take the note, even if you have to kill me for it.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
Coriard turned away, &quot;Get some armor from the bandits, they have some high quality gear. It won't be long until they sniff us out.&quot;<br>

Come now, quick around!&quot;<br>
&quot;Yessss... Clossser!&quot;<br>
Tyu drew his blades so quickly that the moon, now growing higher in the sky reflected off them as if they were lightning.<br>
Farren stayed cloaked, running and jumping at full speed. Both were masters of the dark artifices, and Farren was quite respectable in several other fields of study....<br>
------------------------------------<br>
Not far off, in a well managed clearing a small get together was being held.<br>
12 or 13 visitors of varing ages swung merrily around a may poll garnishing ribbons in the hair and hand, winding the long colorful strings around the poll while singing.<br>
Yurd stood like a stately bird, chest puffed out, shoulders broad and strong and one arm close to Serhan's unwilling hand.<br>
She looked distant, yet polite to every remark made.<br>
&quot;Ahh Serhan, you look gorgeous m'dear, and when's the wedding?&quot;<br>
&quot;3 months.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ahh Yurd! Ya lucky dog! Hahahah!&quot;<br>
Yurd smirked and tried to put his arm around Serhan, she turned away, saying she wanted a bit of the food that lay on a well built, sturdy bench covered with a fine white clothe.<br>
On it lay foods of varing sorts, she picked up something once resembaling a rat and ate it gingerly.<br>
She looked to the ever darkening sky, &quot;Xvar...&quot;<br>
------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Serhan....&quot;<br>
------------------------------------<br>
Tyu caught the scent in several directions since the wind was playing tricks on his senses, Farren was getting frusterated.<br>
&quot;They must be close! Hurry Tyu!&quot;<br>
Farren eagerly put his hands to his sides, still running just behind Tyu, whose blades were drawn and steadied at his sides.<br>
------------------------<br>
Although Coriard had always been a bit of a marinet, Xvar had never considered this to be a fault of his.<br>
Coriard now sat, contimplating his desicive moment soon to come.<br>
Xvar didn't quite know what that felt like, and was curious.<br>
Coriard stood up, looking to the sky, breathing deeply.<br>
His somber, yet thoughtful expression intrigued Xvar.<br>
Yet despite his usual apathy, Xvar did feel something, Coriard was far from decrepit, far from ugly or old looking, yet he wanted and was ready to die.<br>
In Xvar's mind Coriard's death would not be lamentable, he would die much as Sett did, ready and willing to do so.<br>
The retribution for their crimes, or well deserved rest for their good deeds...?<br>
Xvar wondered which his death would be considered...<br>
&quot;In the eyes of the beholder Xvar, death can be anything.&quot; Coriard said. His gaze still fixed on the moon, slowly moving to the bottom of the sky and tree line.<br>
Coriard let out a long, deep, sigh.<br>
&quot;Tomorrow Xvar, the sun will rise, whether I live or die. But I want you to be there to see it, and make sure it rises without me. For of course, I will have no way of knowing. And I wanted to apoligise, noone your age should have to live this life.&quot;<br>
&quot;I live as I choose, that much is up to me, let fate decide the rest.&quot;<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
Not far off from where Yurd and Serhan were standing a giant explosion rumbled the ground, throwing Serhan to the ground. <p><B>Koz.</B>

Raging he flung it out of his hair, shaking violently.<br>
&quot;What the hell was th-&quot;<br>
Another sudden quake seemed to push up the ground in waves.<br>
Throwing Yurd right back into the wooden bowl full of goat cheese.<br>
Serhan struggled to get up.<br>
She could see bright flashes of light coming from another part of the forrest, not to far off.<br>
The other party goers were running around screaming and tripping over fallen trees and branches.<br>
Two children stumbled over to Serhan, crying and shivering in fear, absolutely terrified.<br>
&quot;Shhh! Calm down, you'll be fine, quiet, it's ok, everything will be alright.&quot;<br>
Their mother lay under a fallen tree, her head cracked open, with a small pool of blood gradually making zig-zagging capilaries in the grass.<br>
The father stood over her scream and crying as well, he then saw beyond her corpse to his children, ran over and took them from Serhan.<br>
Serhan was nearly knocked over again as a great shockwave hit the area making the first seem obsolete.<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
Farren cackled maniacly as his feet rose two feet or so over the ground before the ball of reddish orange mana in his hands raised above his head then drilled into the ground and exploded.<br>
Xvar jumped from tree to tree as the ground shook, avoiding some of the shock waves.<br>
Coriard fought Tyu fervently, both were talented in mid air combat. Running toward eachother then jumping in the air, avoiding the shock waves and striking at eachother.<br>
Everytime Tyu's blade drew closer and closer to Coriard's chest.<br>
Coriard hit the ground panting, partially knelt over. Tyu didn't even turn around, his eyes narrowed as his nostrils opened wider, smelling the blood in the air.<br>
Coriard turned around, sprinted towards Tyu, Tyu made no move. Coriard jumped high in the air, twisting midway and doing a flip. Right as he landed in front of Tyu, a shockwave hit, Tyu jumped right as it hit and Coriard was knocked off balance. Tyu jumped right on him hearing several of Coriard's ribs break. Coriard grabbed each one of Tyu's feet and threw him off. Tyu fell to the ground on his side, completely suprised. He was not easily detured however as he jumped right back up. Coriard pushed himself back up, panting and holding his stomach.<br>
A smirk crept onto Tyu's face.<br>
Tyu charged forward, Coriard stood ready to defend. Their blades hit high, then low, Coriard twisted his arm around throwing Tyu slightly off balance. He thrusted leaving his stomach open, Tyu thrust his blade in so hard that as soon as the hilt hit Coriard's skin he threw up blood.<br>
The blood was dark brown, almost black -- Tyu had hit the liver.<br>
Coriard's dark black pupils narrowed, as his expression seemed to melt off his face leaving only a pale blank expression of death.<br>
Tyu's blade protruded out Coriard's back. Tyu slid the blade out, Coriard stood as if he had become a statue.<br>
Tyu jumped as a shockwave hit the ground. Coriard fell over, he held his stomach, slowly his hand loosened then fell to the grass. A leaf hopper jumped onto his fingernail, then jumped off, avoiding the drops of blood trickling off.<br>
---------------------------------<br>
Xvar didn't stop when Coriard fell, he continued evading Farren's attacks until he got a chance to jump over, grab the note and medallion and then paused. He hesitated leaving, staring at Coriard's empty expression.<br>
Tyu's blade came whizzing by the side of his head as Xvar turned around thrusting his blade forward, it missed Tyu's heart by half an inch.<br>
Xvar ducked and then bashed him in the chest, knocking his air out.<br>
Tyu lay on the ground recovering his breath as Xvar positioned a blade right by his throat, calling to Farren, &quot;Stop now or he dies.&quot;<br>
&quot;Fine, kill him, he knew the risk of his duty.&quot;<br>
Farren walked in the air calmly over to them, Xvar looked up at Farren, half smiling.<br>
&quot;Fine then.&quot;<br>
Xvar made a fient, looking as if he was about to kill Tyu, Farren tried to block. Xvar grabbed him by the hood, pulled it over his head and then threw a bottle of fog to the ground. Leaping away and making his escape.<br>
-------------------------<br>
Serhan ran into the clearing, coughing at the fog, catching Xvar in the corner of her eye, she shouted to him, &quot;No! Wait!&quot;<br>
Xvar didn't stop, although he did look over at her quickly.<br>
Farren and Tyu jumped up coughing and groping through the fog.<br>
Serhan hid behind a bush as they ran after Xvar.<br>

Xvar pored over all the techniques in his head, trying to figure out the best strategy.<br>
He was trying to concentrate hard enough to be able to sense the two behind him, but he was to busy paying attention to jumping from tree to tree.<br>
He felt the fatigue creaping up on him faster then the attackers, his lungs burned and his hands bled from small cuts and abrasions from the tree bark and branches.<br>
His vision was blurring slightly, and he squinted to see in the dark. It was getting late, but not close to dawn.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Tomorrow Xvar, the sun will rise, whether I live or die. But I want you to be there to see it, and make sure it rises without me.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&quot;The sun will rise, without you, I shall see to it.&quot;<br>
Farren was drained of most of his mana, Tyu's ribs still ached from Xvar's attack, but they both continued to pursue.<br>
Tyu half clutched his left side, but with every step his rage grew and the pain shrank. His breath was slightly heavier, and manifested itself as short, angery breaths and hiss like muttering.<br>
&quot;Tyu,&quot; Farren called, not taking his eyes off his direction.<br>
&quot;Yesssss WHAT!?&quot;<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Stay calm, don't get angry!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
Tyu shook with boiling rage, even his scaley hands trembled and his steps were more like stomps.<br>
&quot;You heard me! Now calm down, we need to stay focused!&quot;<br>
Tyu tried to put reign on his emotions, but his rage continued to flare up.<br>
&quot;I will get that, that, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> boy!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't you get it? It's not a loss, Coriard's dead, and eventually we'll catch up.&quot;<br>
&quot;When we do, he'sssss <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> mine</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I will never be sssshamed by sssssome, ssssome, kid!&quot;<br>
Tyu's fury interupted his thoughts and concentration, he tripped over a plainly visible root, flying through the air he recovered and landed on his feet. But all it did was redouble his angry and efforts to catch up....<br>
--------------------------<br>
&quot;Serhan, you ok?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yurd...&quot;<br>
&quot;I was so worried I might loose you.&quot;<br>
Serhan turned away towards Xvar's path.<br>
&quot;What's wrong? Woah! What happened here?&quot;<br>
&quot;A battle.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well obviously, but who? What over?&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't know...&quot;<br>
&quot;It was that Xvar punk wasn't it! He killed that guy over there, didn't he?!&quot;<br>
&quot;No... someone was trying to kill them both...&quot;<br>
Bandits also lay stroon about the ground as well, the grass was stained almost completely red.<br>
&quot;Tunare.... Wait.. How do you know?&quot;<br>
&quot;I saw them fighting...&quot;<br>
&quot;You haven't been hanging around with that guy have you?&quot;<br>
Serhan turned back to him.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
Yurd sighed, frusterated, &quot;I know you like him, but you're mine -- understand?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yurd, leave it be.&quot;<br>
Yurd's expression tightened as his anger pitted in his stomach.<br>
&quot;Stay away from him.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh yes, of course, I'm really going to be spending time with a rogue who just ran away from two assassins... Honestly Yurd...&quot;<br>
Yurd's eyebrows furrowed but he simply walked away grumbling to himself.<br>
----------------------------------<br>
Xvar ran into Kelethin, panting and sweating he jumped on the lift, sitting right next to a guard.<br>
Tyu barely had run a step through the brush when the guards noticed him and yelled a battle call.<br>
&quot;@#%$, he's led us to guards!&quot;<br>
&quot;Cloak and desert! We can get him later!&quot;<br>
Tyu threw himself upwards and cloaked. Farren simply stepped backwards dissolving into thin air.<br>
The guards were not at all suprised, &quot;Cravens!&quot;<br>
&quot;Smart cravens.&quot; Xver said between breaths.<br>
&quot;Who were they?&quot;<br>
&quot;Assassins, they killed at least 1 person, probably more with those earthquakes.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, we felt them all the way over here, we had report a small party was interupted and several died. Malady Serhan and Milord Yurd were unhurt though.&quot;<br>
Xvar looked up at the guard, &quot;Are they to be wed?&quot;<br>
The guard stood up smiling, &quot;Yes indeed, quite the lucky two kids!&quot;<br>
&quot;Kids shouldn't be wed.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ahhh jealous of Milord Yurd eh?&quot;<br>
Xvar scowled, &quot;Jealous of a fool like that? Never.&quot;<br>
&quot;Haha! Well, he happens to be the son of a rather rich fool, and a somewhat influential family ya know!&quot;<br>
Xvar changed subjects, &quot;Where can I get a drink?&quot; <p><B>Koz.</B>

His breath was settling, and need to vomit had left him.<br>
He closed his eyes and gazed into the dark pit of his mind, a small, affectionate smile came into focus. The sound of a voice, warm and cheerful yet wise and well tempered.<br>
His back muscles relaxed and he opened his eyes, looking up he saw the sky was turning purplish hues dissolving into gray then black across the sky.<br>
The sun illuminated the edges of the mountainous horizon and reflected off a small puddle of water on the ground.<br>
He soon realized he was soaked and had been sleeping.<br>
The guards stood solid and proud on each side of the lift, once eyed him and spoke with a stifled chuckle, &quot;You were asleep all night, you ok?&quot;<br>
Xvar flexed his hands, looking at the brown scabs and green bruises that fleckled them.<br>
Groaning, he held the lift button post and pulled himself up. He rubbed the back of his neck and yawned.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;The note!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> his brain suddenly screamed at him.<br>
He felt his pockets, his chest, his boots, then found it, neatly tucked under the second layer of armor he was wearing.<br>
It had faded and partially washed away at the bottom he clenched his hand, crumpling it a little.<br>
He had learned how to read when he was young, but only in elvish -- luckily this was written in bold elvish text.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Xvar,<br>
If you've recieved this then you managed to get away, good job. I hope you're somewhere safe, it not, get somewhere safe.<br>
You know I was from a small poor family, but that's only partially true. As I grew I was adopted by a slightly richer family, then I joined the guard.<br>
This family was the family of Conrad, my original name might have been simply Darcy Coriard, but it's never been clear.<br>
The Conrad family was a family of influential power and political scandal. They soon grew enemies all over the land, including a then small group of rogues, warriors, necromancers, everything, who smuggled and did venial damage to the land.<br>
The Conrad family's father was named Asyrta, he was a greedy fool. When he met me, he had pity and adopted me. It never made sense until I found out his true motives. I was a decoy for his son. Well, by that time I was old enough to leave, and I joined the guard, when I lost the king to an assassin I ran away for good.<br>
The smuggling ring killed Asyrta's son, Lert. Asyrta saw it as my fault and for years tried to track me down, never sucessful.<br>
Eventually Asyrta died, and his nephew took the seat as head of the house, but his nephew was more guile and insidious the Asyrta. He allied with the smuggling ring and gave them real training. They became masters and assassins of a much more signifigent brand then originally.<br>
He also supplied them with superior weapons.<br>
I don't know what most of those weapons are, but I'm sure you'll find out soon. I don't know where there main hide out is, your best bet it to try and evade them then follow them back.<br>
The medallion was given to me by ...... it........ keep...&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Xvar cursed himself for falling asleep.<br>
He threw the note in a burning pot, straighten his dagger, swept back his hair and took a swig of the water before throwing the bottle into the fire as well.<br>
Xvar walked up to the old house, when he opened the door he saw it had been searched, everything thrown the the floor and someone had tried to break open the chest.<br>
Xvar picked up a roll off the table, it was moldy, but Xvar bit off a huge chunk anyway. He walked over to the chest, stomped on the board in front of it, which teetered up revealing a secret cubby.<br>
He took the key from the cubby, pushed the board back into place and opened the chest.<br>
Inside he smiled at the small heap of high quality armor and box of potions on the other side.<br>
He pulled off the wet, rusting armor and put on something dry and clean. He felt exhilerated by the warmth, although his bones still ached slightly.<br>
He secured his dirk in it's scabbard and rubbed his neck once again, rumaging through the remains of the once tidy house. He uncovered a small sketched picture of someone he'd never seen.<br>
He scratched his chin then put the picture in his backpack.<br>
He also put in a small blanket, 3 days rations, water, the potions, a change of clothes and a robe.<br>
He walked down the platforms back to the market, to pick up a few more things before he needed, including some mead.<br>
He saw Serhan, she was glancing around as if looking for someone, looking for... him?<br>
She saw him, their eyes met but were quickly cut off by the passing people.<br>
Somehow it felt they were the only two people there however, as if the existance of the rest of the world was unnecessary.<br>
She hopped looking over the heads of the crowd, Xvar pushed through a couple, then realized what he was feeling.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Wait a second.... What... What... What the hell am I doing!?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He simply stopped, frozen in his own confusion. Serhan stood before him, his gaze slowly rose to her face.<br>
&quot;Xvar, wait, just wait, don't run from me.. please!&quot;<br>
Xvar turned away from her, speaking over his shoulder, &quot;I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> go.&quot;<br>
&quot;I know, those men, they were after you, but please, stay, my family can protect you -&quot;<br>
Xvar swung around with great speed, his dagger flew through the air, cutting the air and making a sharp sound.<br>
Serhan froze as it came straight at her, he cut two inches of her hair off, grabbed it mid air then jumped off the platform.<br>
The crowd stood stunned for a second, Yurd ran over and shouted at them and tried to comfort Serhan, &quot;It's ok, if he ever comes back I'll cut his head off!&quot;<br>
Serhan held her hair in disbelief, feeling the perfectly cut ends, even and perfect.<br>
&quot;Thank god you dodged in time, he would've cut your throat! Bastard!&quot;<br>
Serhan walked over to the platform, watching him draw his cloak and jump into the shady forrest floor.<br>

He put the lock of hair to his nose as he ran, breathing in deeply and letting the smell rest peacefully in his nose, slowly working it's way into his lungs and heart. He could feel the warmth of the smell reach all of his body, gradually relaxing him.<br>
His apathy partially broken, emotions of all kinds begining to sharpen, the smell made them more keen then ever as his mind stuggled to keep up with justifying his feelings.<br>
He knew where to go, close by, in Butcher Blok somewhere was an abandoned mine shaft, well not as abandoned as rumored. For hidden deep within it's innards and dark chambers lay a guild shrouded by time.<br>
He hoped it would still be there, and that he would be able to find it, to get to them, so they could tell him what to do.<br>
He slowed down, feeling his stomach yearning for food he sat down and opened his pack. First he drew a small string and tied the lock of hair up so it would not fray. He then tied the makeshift necklace around his neck and smelled the hair again. <br>
With that the other world, where he was mortal dissolved around him as he sat in his own world, him and Serhan sitting in the smell.<br>
His feelings felt natural, he was amazed but did not try to over question them.<br>
&quot;Forsake my destiny, my fate, forsake my memory and trust, and all intense feeling had I felt before -- all of this just for one lock of your hair...&quot;<br>
His emotional recess was soon interupted by a passing hawk, which pierced the air with it's cry.<br>
The sky, although light blue, with horse tail like clouds seemed just the same as the dirty mud trial beneath his feet.<br>
But the seeming infinity of his new emotions still caused him grief. As on every day in which you can see the sun, even on the days of which it is most bright -- the slightest shadow, cloud, fog upon the land greatly detracts from it. With all his hope, he still could not see beyond the errors in his way, he could not see the good he'd done.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    &quot;I am not a hero for what I did. I never have been. It was Sett, he was the hero, and yet I, the living get his reward, do not they see the sapling above his grave?! Do the not understand the sacrifices he made!?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Before he knew what he was doing his voice became real, furiously real, he screamed at the unyielding trees, the hawk, the ground and sky, &quot;I am not Sett!! I am no hero!!&quot;<br>
As he screamed the lock of hair bounced off his chest, seeming to kiss him, and make him sneeze.<br>
He stuffed it back down his shirt and armor, panting, his fists white from being clentched so long. Several of the scabs came off and his hands bled slightly, he spat in them and rubbed the blood off. Looking back at the sky, in the far distance, darkening the edge of the sky, a large black thunder cloud bled on the ground beneath it.<br>
It looked unnatural, darker then the usual thunder cloud, the rain was not right either, was it dark blue? Or was it dark red? From this distance all colors converged to a single blackness, and yet even from where he sat he knew it was not usual. It moved quickly, and behind it the trees seemed to sag as if a great weight had been pressed upon them, like putting tar on them. The leaves seemed to be falling off, like an acid, or disease had descended upon them. The leaves turned bright white, then darkened and fell off. It was striking because they did so in patches, as if the rain was not constant, it seemed more controled, as if trying to follow something.<br>
He threw his rucksack on his back and began to jog, then run to the rain cloud, trying to get a better look at it. The gravel of the trail crumpled under his feat, from his pace it almost equaled the small cracks of thunder in the distance.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;What is that?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
All around the borders of the cloud a pale red light, as if shining through mist or fog showed the outline of the cloud perfectly on the snowy white treetops.<br>
The smell hit him like a brick wall, it was horrible, and as he ran into it further it only got harsher and more acute. The abrasive smell of the dead, the rotting flesh and plants, all around him. It blinded him, drunkening all his senses, bewildering him, asfixiating him, he stood, like a statue as the pale red light drew closer and closer, like the reflection of a blade...<br>

He pulled his collar up to his mouth, attempting to block the smell out.<br>
He awkwardly pulled the lock of hair up to his nose and held it there, it protected him from the smell as he trudged forward against it.<br>
The light got brighter as he approached it, and he heard something running through the forrest in front of him.<br>
The sound was growing louder, despite his senses getting dimmed as he continued walking into it.<br>
As it neared it became 3 sounds, 2 of them the same, yet different in distance, and one was dramatically different.<br>
The first 2 sounded like footsteps, running at high pace, not just on the trail.<br>
They must've been running together, because they were close, and zig zagging back and forth off and on the trail, as if avoiding something.<br>
The one behind them sounded like a daemon, it was a low rumbling growl and a moving at a sloth like pace. <br>
They were growing so close he could hear the panting of the people running, one tripped, the other stopped, ran back and helped them to their feet.<br>
They must of seen him, because they yelled to him, &quot;Turn back, run! Run! It's a daemon of great power! Lead him away from the forrest! Run!&quot;<br>
Xvar squinted to see them, they were stumbling, as if blind, but continued running.<br>
Xvar quickly grabbed a bottle from his belt pouch, it was a small oblong greenish blue piece of glass. He pulled the cork from it, grabbed another bottle, combining the contense of the two and recorking it. Then he threw it forward as far as he could.<br>
It hit the ground and exploded with such force that both Xvar and the two that were running all fell to the ground, as the daemon screamed in agony.<br>
Xvar heard a great chunk of the daemon's body fall to the ground, as a cloud of maggots flew out of the wound, falling to the ground in a great heap.<br>
The daemon limped for a moment, then pulled itself up, continuing to scream in fury.<br>
The daemon charged toward him, both the two that had been running ran straight past him -- not looking back at all.<br>
Xvar stood secure, he did not move at all, his left hand resting on another large bottle on his belt, and the his right on his dagger handle....<br>

The daemon was about 8 feet tall, maybe a bit more.<br>
He had no horns, showing he was a young daemon, and his wings were still small sprouts, he was weak.<br>
Xvar's pupils widened, taking in all of the scene, despite the thick fog of acid like smoke.<br>
The daemon dragged itself, then managed to get a 1 legged charging pace going. With every step his fury swelled inside of him and replaced the limb he'd lost.<br>
As he ran maggots fell out of the open would in his side, his entire left leg had been blown off and atleast up to his 3rd rib from the bottom. The wound was jagged and burnt, the dead skin blistering and falling off, while more and more maggots and rotting inner organs fell out.<br>
From all this Xvar knew the daemon was very young, and probably very weak. The older a daemon gets, the less maggots because they are completely decomposed inside and the more horns they grow.<br>
Eventually as daemons grow older, the decomposed flesh from the inside hardens into a dagger like stone and pushes through the skin, creating a rock hard horn.<br>
When a daemon eats a man, he takes their flesh and creates a horn, the more horns, the older, stronger, and more it's killed.<br>
Xvar drew his blade, readided himself and pushed a leg back, to keep balanced and solid.<br>
As his eyes narrowed, his pupils continued to grow, the daemon drew closer and closer.<br>
It's face was half ripped off by shrapnal from the blast and several death beetles fell out of it's eye socket.<br>
The daemon pulled back one of it's arms, this arm seemed undamaged by the explosion, Xvar saw the viens in the arm grow and his claws extend.<br>
With great agility, Xvar drew the bottle, shook it up, and threw it with all his might at the daemon, it lodged right in the daemon's eyesocket.<br>
Xvar jumped backward through the air to a treetop.<br>
The daemon wailed and hit it's head against the ground, trying to free the bottle from it's eyesocket.<br>
As soon as his head hit the rocks of the trail the bottle exploded, dispersing the daemon's remains all around in a 20 feet radius of maggots, flesh, and acid.<br>
A small piece flew over to Xvar, the acid burned right through into his leg, he fell off the tree, screaming in intense pain. He quickly opened a small flask of water and poured it over the wound.<br>
The acid had burned off a small layer of skin, a patch about 3 inches by 2 inches.<br>
Xvar panted as he felt the wound spread deep into his flesh, penetrating even the marrow of his leg bone.<br>
The two that had been running had abrutly stopped and run over to Xvar, one was a female wood elf, and the other looked to be a male high elf, but Xvar couldn't exactly tell because he went unconsious.<br>
--------------------<br>
When Xvar awoke the wood elf was patting his head with a wet prayer shawl.<br>
He looked down to his wound, it had been well bandaged, and treated with aloe to sooth the pain.<br>
He tried to move, but felt the searing pain shoot right up into his knee then thigh.<br>
The woodelf pushed him back onto the bed.<br>
&quot;That was a stupid thing you did back there, but very brave at the same time.&quot;<br>
The woodelf had chesnut brown hair, green eyes, and long fingers, she looked delicate, but several scars on her hands and forearms told Xvar she was some sort of active hunter.<br>
His vision blurred as he tried to sit up, she pushed him back down and comforted him.<br>
&quot;My name is Jerra, and this is my brother Dacrin, you saved half the forrest from that daemon. But I'm afriad you'll need to recuperate for awhile, that daemon mark won't leave easy -- we'll have to take you to a shaman...&quot;<br>
&quot;Where, where am I?&quot;<br>
&quot;Kelethin of course, it's our home.&quot;<br>
Xvar lept up from bed, the room swirled around him, &quot;I -- it's not safe... I have to leave...&quot;<br>
He fainted after about two paces from the pain and disorientation.<br>
Dacrin rolled his eyes, &quot;He's persistant, I'll give him that.&quot;<br>
Jerra nodded, &quot;We'll bring him to the shaman tomorrow when he's a bit more stable...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, wise thinking, but what was that he said about not being safe? Suppose he's a criminal?&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't know, hope not, he's kinda cute.&quot;<br>
Dacrin sighed heavily, &quot;I'll go to market and fetch us some rabbit for tonight, sound good?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, sounds fine...&quot;<br>

&quot;You're awake! Great! Well, it's to late to take you to a shaman... But we can at least feed you.&quot; she said with a grin.<br>
Xvar looked around then over to Jerra, &quot;Jerra, how is it that I saw the veins of the daemon grow? Is he not dead?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, many daemons are only half or partially dead. Evil majik keeps at least several body parts completely alive. Where did you see the veins? His arm? I noticed them too.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br>
&quot;He also had a great plague cloud above him, someone must've cast a powerful spell on him, since he was such a young one.&quot;<br>
Xvar nodded sleepily.<br>
&quot;If you're still tired then sleep, when Dacrin gets back I'll serve up the charred rat, it's very good...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, that sounds great.. thanks...&quot;<br>
Jerra smiled, &quot;So how old are you? I'm 17, Dacrin's 19.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm 16, a bit more now...&quot;<br>
&quot;Only 16?! Wow, I knew you looked young, but you've got the equipment of a senior rogue, who did you study under?&quot;<br>
&quot;Darcy Coriard...&quot;<br>
&quot;I've heard he was the best ever. I know who you are by th way..&quot;<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;The tattoo, me and Dacrin thought you might be a criminal, but when we saw the tattoo...&quot;<br>
Xvar turned away, &quot;I am a criminal, just because I killed people who I was supposed to doesn't make me any less then a murdered...&quot;<br>
&quot;But I heard you fought valiantly... You fought along side Sett and Beim and Sandrock, didn't you?&quot;<br>
&quot;No war is glorious, Sett and Sandrock and Beim were all good men, but caught up in what they couldn't control. I felt no remourse for those I killed, that makes me a criminal, Sett felt regret for all but D'vinn -- I know he did.&quot;<br>
Jerra's gaze lowered and her voice become quieter, &quot;I understand...&quot;<br>
&quot;I have to leave tomorrow, I must get to Butcher Blok...&quot;<br>
&quot;You're not going anywhere tomorrow! We need to get that daemon mark off your leg!&quot;<br>
Xvar grimaced and turned onto his side, &quot;It'll be fine.&quot;<br>
Xvar tried to lean his legs over the side of the bed and stand up, but Jerra blocked his way.<br>
&quot;Sit!&quot;<br>
Dacrin pushed the door open with his back, carrying several large packages.<br>
&quot;I got the bandages we needed, the shaman also gave me several potions to put on the wound.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ooh, what's the big package?&quot;<br>
Dacrin smiled, &quot;A gift for you!&quot;<br>
Dacrin put down the other packages and handed Jerra the well wrapped box.<br>
She opened it eagerly to see a fine piece of armor, light green in tint, and chain in material.<br>
&quot;You, you, you got it!!!&quot;<br>
Dacrin smiled, &quot;Now you're a real ranger.&quot;<br>
Jerra ran up to Dacrin and hugged him, then ran back to the package and put the armor on.<br>
The green armor seemed to gleem even in the low light of dusk, beautifully etched carvings of ivy shapes dotted the armor.<br>
&quot;How do they etch the chain?&quot; Xvar inquired.<br>
Jerra laughed, &quot;I'm sorry, I got so excited I totally forgot you're here! I'm not sure how they do.. majik I suppose?&quot;<br>
Dacrin nodded, silently contently watching Jerra stroke her armor with pride.<br>
---------------------------<br>
Tyu and Farren walked down the long stair ways to the central oral report chamber.<br>
Both were completely silent and had a somber look on their faces.<br>
As they reached the oral report chamber a loud, deep voice beckoned them to the center of the room.<br>
&quot;Please report on assignment #459, the assassination of Darcy Coriard Conrad and Xvar Unknown Unknown, codenamed &quot;dikill&quot;.<br>
Please report in this order, sucess on first target, Conrad, sucess on second target, Xvar, any known witness, any problems, and possiple solutions.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sucess on first target. Failure on second target. One witness, unknown wood elf female, approximately 16 years old. Xvar was much stronger then Coriard or any of our estimates. I suggest sending us both on another mission just to kill him.&quot;<br>
&quot;Understood, Aftar will be informed of your progress. Take 3 days rest then report back for mission assignment. Your mission suggestion will be put up for review.&quot;<br>
Another man waved them out of the chamber, down another hall to the barracks.<br>
&quot;Next!&quot;<br>
