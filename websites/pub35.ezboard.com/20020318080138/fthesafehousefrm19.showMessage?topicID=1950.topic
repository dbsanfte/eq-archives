Day before the patch, I was rarely missing and hitting in the upper 40's.  So Im thinking it has something to do with the buffs.  I drop haste and quickness.  I start hitting a little better, slower obviously, but still not as good as I was.  I then drop the dex buff and what do we have here?  Im back to hitting for what I was prepatch.  A tad slower, but I'll take slower upper 40's over faster misses any day of the week.  Im going to mess around with it some more tonight and see if dropping quick/dex even more will up my damage.  <br><br>I talked to a Nightshade friend about it last night and he was missing a lot more too.  He does the same thing I do, pairs up with a druid and goes out to kill reds and low purples.  Told him to try the same thing, drop some buffs, but I had to log before he got a chance to test it out.<br><br>Anyone else notice this yesterday?<br>[EDIT]<br>Just thought about this.  I leveled the night before the patch.  Went, trained CS up to 29, got Leaper, but didnt train anything else.  My weapon skill dropped off to around 77% of my level whereas it was 81% before I leveled.  Im going to go throw a point on it and see if my damage output ups any.  I'll try hunting without training first, log it all, see what buffs I have on, do all the tests I can, to figure out what could have possibly dropped my damage like that.<br>Phaelon Ocius<br>32nd Season Nightshade<br>Divine Wind - Percival <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uphaelondaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phaelon DAoC</A> at: 1/30/02 7:20:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=daak>Daak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/30/02 6:41:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1950.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stat meanings</span><hr size=1> Dex doesn't help, me as an Inflitrator cast faster :P <br><br>While it makes me sad, if its true that more quickness, and maybe even more dex makes you hit for less, but faster, it makes sense Mythic would overlook this.

Good and Bad</span><hr size=1> As far as the missing goes, the rumblings are that red con weapons pretty much suck to use now. Not only do you ruin them faster, now people are starting to think that after this last patch you have less of a chance to hit. I haven't tested this myself so I can't verify it's true. However, if that is a red weapon you are using and seeing large miss rates, pull out an orange or yellow con and see if it gets better.<br><br>Oh, and the theory that quickness reduces damage is only partly correct. You <b>do</b> see a small decrease, but your damage over time is still improved. As far as to what exactly causes this I can't say, but that 'DPS is a constant' rumor is just that, a rumor. <p><img=http://www.twitchmonkey.com/~damnskippy/DAoC/kerysmall2.jpg></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukeryath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keryath</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.twitchmonkey.com/~damnskippy/DAoC/kerface.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/30/02 11:05:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 2:03:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1950.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why is primary stat Dex for Rogue types?

We had 2 druids in the group, so I was pestering them to help me test what buffs did what.  <br><br>At first I told them to just give me Str, dex and con buffs.  I was attacking at my usual rate and hitting on high reds for 35+ with very few misses.  So I ask for haste.  We go through about 20 or so mobs and Im doing between 30-35 damage a lot faster.  So then I ask for the quickness buff.  Bufss my quick up to about 160 or something from 123.  Miss, Miss, Miss, you hit for 29, Miss....you get the idea.  I tried it on 3-4 mobs and had to get rid of it.  The damage output for the group was killing our healers.  I wont be asking for quick buffs from anyone anymore.  Might even stay away from haste because all that did was draw agro on me.  Dex, Str, and a con buff please.  Keeps my damage up and agro off me.  <br><br>Also, with 210 dex or somewhere around there, I was evading high reds low purples like it was going out of style.  I think I got hit a total of 3 times out of maybe 20 swings in the hour and a half we were in there.<br><br>Going to go off and do some solo testing with druid buffs tonight.
