We don't have a SZ thread like this, but it really doesn't matter as my original home is Rallos. I'm proud to have played a rogue on there since the summer of '99 until the summer of '01. A tough road I know, but it was fun. All fun things eventually become boring though I suppose, and EQ is no exception. The bugs, incomplete quests, imbalances, etc. start becoming bigger pieces to the overall puzzle, and can't be ignored forever. I have logged in less then a dozen times in the last month, and I have no desire to log in anymore period. I'd wish my friends on RZ goodbye, but 95% of them retired before me. I'd wish my friends on SZ goodbye, but same story there though I didn't really meet all that many new people, most were coming with me from RZ or the Safehouse in general. I've lead two guilds, and been an officer in another before I lead it. Got Canbik to level 40, only in two guilds ever, and the 2nd one I only entered after I retired. Great feeling, hunted on every continent, even Odus I think; from swamps to castles to deserts to ice caves to sewers to crypts to birdhouses (heh), I guess I've done everything to be done though level 40. Mastered two trade skills, and tampered with some others. Played to 20 before ever getting any decent equipment (that's right, DING 20 in banded and a bloodclaw). I dabbled with poison but found it much too costly for my taste. Was Warden of RZ for a year or so I guess. Always enjoyed those groups with me and two other rogues :) Even got married, was fun Goardo, get on AIM more often. As I lost the urge to play, they brought up SZ and I thought I'd have some fun there, but alas, RZ EQ and SZ EQ have something in common - EQ and that was the main reason for growing boredom. It was the same game no matter how you cut it. I say that overall the main reason I got bored was the time sinks. On my wizard on SZ, who I only got to level 17, I managed to read half of a Wheel of Time novel almost exclusively during med time. As far as Canbik went, I was always dissapointed that for many classes, solo'ing (in a multiplayer game) was more profitable then grouping =/ I toyed with DXW (let you play EQ in a window), and that kept me going a little longer, being able to talk to friends on AIM while medding up. I suppose the world is too static, and the GM's are too afraid to do anything to influence the world. I personally don't understand why a GM can't randomly rez people - who is to say their diety didn't feel pity or something on them? A rant for another day though. Logging in for an hour or two, and accomplishing nothing - or worse, coming out behind - was always discouraging. I don't know about you, but an hour is a decent amount of time... I could have mowed the yard or cleaned my room or something, but no, I felt the need to sit around for 15 minutes in an empty room in guk, so that I could mash keys for about 30 seconds in between waits. I guess you can only dangle the carrot in front until your donkey dies of hunger eh? Also I always hated all those NPC's in Rivervale who don't say anything when you hailed them grr I told myself I'd kill them one day, I guess I won't get to =( Proud to have worn two masks total, though I never got redeemed. Got bored with the quest onces I figured out I couldn't redeem myself on my own. Maybe the fact that I didn't feel I needed redemption factored in. Or heck, the fact that there were much easier to obtain weapons out there ?? Anyway. My favorite memory of EQ was when my friend bought the game (that I had been talking up for months /repent [he just retired too heh]), and I had him create a newbie. I told him to go click on "that rat over there" and hit "A" to attack it. So he does so, and starts humming that "A" key over and over. I honestly did fall out of my chair laughing and had to explain to him how autoattack worked ;p He got level 42 that loser. But he was blue mwuaha ;) I had to reformat in december. I lost all my screenshots =( Whenever I get to deleting the game, I'm gonna have to burn my screenshots though. Kodak moments, to be sure. Well finally I am going to try to list as many people as I can who influenced me from Rallos. By no means a complete list, but heck.<br>
<br>
Aerimus, Cylant (was a long journey), Takarae (you never beat me after Misty hehe), Veishkav, Timbuktu, Goardo (husband of mine), Inke, Xezzt, Elsbethe (long time friend, I wish we could talk as much as we once did, you were always an encouragment), Algaron (though I resent what you did to the guild, I'd have never gotten as far as I did without you), Megal (good luck reviving KoBB!), Sabutai, Ashmedai, Arkkain, Gogma and Harki (what to say? always great friends and the few KoBB I got to hunt with), Werty (thanks for always being there), Tryggvi, Slinar, Cattiebrie (my oldest friend on RZ), Bitterdreams, Eaglewing (how I miss you), Talliesyn (thanks for the trak), Cideral, Coyoteblack (always ahead of me somehow), Tytan, Yoeta... well I'll add more if I think of them :)<br>
<br>
I realize I didn't use paragraph breaks. That was intentional, as I was just rambling anything on my mind. Hope it wasn't too hard to read.<br>
