Mill you can email me at vehemence_86@yahoo.com. If you would like to set up some kind of session to have both of us get logs and than we can parse the data and find out exactly what is going on. I can also get Pene to give up his logs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I want this to be clear to the several people who keep thinking that I am happy with the nerf or whatever you want to call it. I will tell you this from experience what is going to happen here is they are going to nerf infils now and than the fighting will swing the other way.<br>
<br>
The rogue community in general needs to be watching each others back. This board was not meant to divide, this forum is a support structure and too often I do not see it used this way. As soon as you get the time and place set up I will meet you Mills and Surly and V can get it on over and over and over until you feel you are done wanting to fight. We can try it heads-up over and over or we can try it with stealth, with pa, without pa, and so forth you let me know what you want done and we can make it happen.<br>

WTG vehemence.  <br>
<br>
<br>
As for nerfs.  F Nerfs.  I will fight my balls off to stop any nerf on any rogue, period.  End of story.<br>
<br>
Compared to casters EVERY rogue class is less damaging.  A theurgist nuked me 3 times today for 502 each cast faster then my pitififul doublefrosts could dish out the 170 per swing back at him.<br>
<br>
To nerf rogues is about the dumbest thing that could happen and I won't have any of it.  I hope mill, syco, the rest of the SB battalion would do the same.<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought rogues were pretty balanced pre df nerf.  With nightshades needing some love.   <br>
<br>
I think rogues are still pretty balanced with nightshades needing a bit of love and shadowblades needing some good love.<br>
<br>
<br>
I DO NOT THINK, nor will i ever, that our class is overpowered.  Infs, SB's or NS's.  I remember how gimped we were a few months ago.  It's not like we are THAT much better off since then.  We're just the only real stealth class now, so public opinion says we're uber.  Stupid, but that's the way of DAOC.<br>

<br>
There's not even a hint on the delays of weapons used there (everyone knows that faster weapons mean lower dmg per hit, even though they'll have the same DPS), and the LA and DW skills work differently.<br>
<br>
LA will score a lot more hits with the off-hand than DW, which in itself will lower the average dmg per hit, and LA will lower the dmg per hit too to account for the extra number of hits.<br>
<br>
What I mean is that it makes sense that LA average dmg per hit is lower, that's just how skills work. On the other hand LA lands more hits and swing both weapons all the time.<br>
<br>
If you use a SB wielding a 2h and compare average dmg / hit with those of an Inf or a NS, there's no doubt the SB will have a higher dmg / hit. Different skills, different weap delays. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ukedilash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kedilash</A> at: 6/13/02 7:55:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 8:18:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3506.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> See, <br>
<br>
This is the reason why mill is so frustrated, me as well.<br>
Your post is... well... wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, leftaxe will swing everytime, but to balance that, the swings are as significantly reduced damage.  So much so that DW/CD will outdamage it, pretty significantly.<br>
<br>
The newest change MAY bring max spec or very close to max spec leftaxe into balance with DW/CD, but to break even, an SB must invest massive spec points to bring it to even with dual wield.  Consider that Dual Wield is effective at 1, 20, 40, 50 spec... that is, it is very level based and is effective even when you don't spec in it very much, that tends to have nightshades and infiltrators very high spec'd in weapon, envenom, CS.... WITHOUT losing effectiveness.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, your last point.<br>
<br>
2handed weapons will NOT outdamage Dual Wield/Celtic Dual.<br>
<br>
You'll notice in the patch notes from the latest leftaxe enhancement, leftaxe was enhanced so that it does more damage then 2handers at high spec.<br>
<br>
This is the nature of dual wielding classes vs 2handed classes.  Classes that wield 2 weapons are designed to do more damage... and they do, over time.  Frontloading damage helps for 2hander classes, but, for the most part, the duel wielding classes are going to do MORE damage then 2handed classes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, speed of weapon must be looked at.... but... take the EXACT same weapon for a LEFTAXER and a DW/CD'er and the dw/cd'er will do, on average, a good bit more.<br>
<br>
The equations for Leftaxe and DW/CD are published.  Try using them in calculations and you will see the disparity.<br>
<br>
*** NOTE that the leftaxe equation has changed some in the latest leftaxe enhancement, but only for higher spec (greater then 35, i believe)<br>
<br>
Either way, <br>
<br>
This is the point of everything!<br>
<br>
<br>
DW/CD IS better then Leftaxe in damage.  Period.<br>
<br>
2.5 spec IS better then 50 hitpoints.  Period.  (nightshade spell is better as well)<br>
<br>
Vanish IS better then Shadowrun. (nightshade venom is better as well)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The point of all this..........<br>
<br>
<br>
Balance is out of whack.  Add variance fix for nightshades and we are getting to the point of.... INFILTRATOR &gt; NIGHTSHADE &gt; SHADOWBLADE.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hopefully mill and vehemence can do some testing to prove it.... and mythic will take action to re-balance rogues.<br>

<br>
even if LA hits as much as people think, it takes 3 to 4 LA hits to equal one off hand hit of another assasin.(30 to 50 damage LA)<br>
<br>
and remember too, I had two 500 + perfs figured in to my average damage, none from infil.<br>
<br>
Remember, I must spec much higher in LA to be effective as well, and have less points to do it with.<br>
<br>
Arguing is pointless when the topic is stupid, or it is one sided. I have yet to see a valid argument against my ideas though. It is the way it is. Numbers really do not lie.<br>
<br>
I hit for over 60 points less average per hit. that alone is more then my off hand hits for max.<br>

Spec is the same, 2.2.<br>
Strength/con/hitpoints are the only real difference and I think that is more then made up for by the shout damage.<br>

A slash nightshade SHOULD defeat a shadowblade ESPECIALLY when using venom, but I won't be testing it WITH venom.  I'm working on finding slash inf and slash ns to test it, I'll be gone a few days, but I'll be back next week to make it happen.  I'm hoping I can get help from Elvoril and Zedie to test.<br>
<br>
<br>
The difference between YOUR disinformation campaign, and my arguments is that I want to TEST the information, while you want to sit behind false words.  So, if you want to be an ass mr. brisbanoch, back up YOUR words with testing, I doubt you have the balls to know the TRUTH.<br>

Because it certainly isnt close when it comes to taking on tanks/hybrids/healers, thrust just rules.<br>

Personally, I want real combat logs, tests are fine, but dont water them down, just meet up, stealth, fight the way you normally would. Fight to win, thats how it is in the real game.<br>

Anyone be interested in comparing logs of assasin vs chain classes? I kind of think it would be neat, I know I suck at fighting them, but dont know how hard other assasins actually hit chain/plate.<br>

<br>
The &quot;moron&quot; implication was submitted before I was even aware of your response.  So no, it was not directed specifically toward you.  As Mill said, you seem like a nice enough guy and I hope there is no resentment between us.<br>
<br>
It's just really easy to get carried away and tear into someone when despite your agonizing efforts, they go right ahead and believe whatever the hell they want to believe, contrary to reason though it may be.  And no, I do have the market cornered on truth, or hold a monopoly over reason.  Just ask Suppreme Allah, who took me to the bank and back, about that.  It's just that when you've been doing this sort of thing as long as I have, you discover that reality for most people, myself included, is governed largely by misconception and that truth is often best administered by brute force.  It's a fact of life that I accept and feel neither compunction in the performance of this duty, nor indignation when the roles are reversed.<br>
<br>
So I have to ask, what makes you think that infiltrators will be nerfed?  It's almost as if you are encouraging the collective Shadowblade defense to pipe down and take one for the team?  Personally I feel that Infils do not need a nerf nor are they in any danger of being nerfed.  Your precious 2.5 spec/lvl points are safe, of that I am certain.<br>
<br>
What disturbs me, however, is the recent anti-nerf trend.  I'm sure every one of us has experienced a debilitating class nerf in some game or another.  It sucks.  You sacrifice not only money, but more importantly time, toward the development of a character only to be kicked in the teeth by the company with nothing more than an impersonal patch note for consolation.  It tends to leave you rather jaded and cynical about the company's concern for the player base, and for the most part, I'd say the cynicism is justified.  MMORPG's are just another Skinner's Box bundled with a glorified chat engine.  But to universally denounce &quot;nerfing&quot; is just naive, especially in games with pvp-centric designs.  Fault the designers and programmers all you want, it's just damn difficult to balance the multifaceted pvp experience which characterizes the games we all know and love, without endless fine tuning.  Scaling all classes upwards just doesn't work.  For one thing, that imbalances the PvE element.  For another, PvP is as dynamic as the people behind the avatars.  There will always be new and changing ways to exploit the intricacies of the endless class resources.  Scaling upwards would result in a ceiling-less growth as each class approached uniformity.  It's one of those idealistic concepts that is just not practical.<br>
<br>
So ya, F nerfs...that are injurious to overall balance.  But nerfs that improve the welfare of the game as a whole should not only be welcomed, but actively pursued (in the case that an upgrade is not judicious.)  And no, I'm not campaigning to nerf the infiltrator class, although I'm sure I'll be quoted in that context. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/usunraven01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SunRaven01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 12:06:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3506.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> &quot;If a thrust NS/infil can be even with a SB, then there is a balance problem.

<br>
I notice you ignored comments in the template thread, where I mentioned that doing 200 actual damage a round isn't the gimp you think it is.<br>
<br>
Regardless, there is no reason why a thrust NS/Infil should be automatically pwned by a SB.  Nor any reason why a slash NS/Infil should own you either.  So much will depend on who evades first:  If the thrust user evades before you do, that skews the damage in their favor because of the stun from Diamondback/Dragonfang, especially if no one opened with PA/CD.  Moreover, most NS are able to chain Diamondback/Hamstring/Diamondback/Hamstring/Leaper, with the defensive bonus from Hamstring/Leaper giving us the edge to evade again.<br>

I get owned routinely by equal level infiltrators all the time. Here is the reason why IMO.<br>
<br>
Infiltrators will simply dish out more damage over the same period of time as a SB. I cannot dish out the same amount of damage considering (as it has been proven) that DW/CD melee damage is equal (if not more than) LA damage and infiltrators will out poison me every time. So unless I have some style that is going to make up for that difference, I am doing less melee damage over any time interval. Doublefrost was that style, it isn't any more. Unless my hit points are significantly higher, I will end more fights dead than alive. <br>
<br>
Yes, I agree that other factors will influence the outcome. But since we each have the same level of evade, unless I evade more I am going to lose. True stuns off evade do play a part, but it takes a SB longer to get that stun (a 2 style chain) then it takes an infiltrator (1 style).<br>
<br>
As I have stated numerous times and repeat it again, SBs are doing far less melee damage than infiltrators and as a result we are inferior and need an improvement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/usunraven01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SunRaven01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 1:53:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3506.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> And NS have less points to spend than Infils as well, but at 46 I can kill -- and have killed -- level 50 infils.

<br>
But they don't.<br>
<br>
Not *all* the time.  Which is why I said that the results *should be* fairly even.  You get a bonus to leather.  They get an easy stun style.  It should even out.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to the variables, which is where Mill has a point about setting up the tests as if they are &quot;real&quot; RVR.  If you stand there and just whack, whack, whack, you deserve to die.  Battles between assassins should be about finesse and grace, and in this case, some skill.<br>
<br>
And if it *doesn't* even out, well ... that is the point of the tests, right?  To get the evidence to present to the devs that SBs are now underpowered?

<br>
I have to raise objection regarding both your and Mill's approach to testing.  What we are after is balance.  Throwing finess, grace, and skill into the equation is a just an excellent way to @#%$ things up.  An individual's level of skill should not be a determining factor on the issue of class balance!  That is just plain silly.  The classes should be balanced according to the sum of their maximum potentials.  If you know anything about statistic you understand that throwing all possible variables into the class soup, so to speak, and calling the result an accurate examination of all constituent factors, such as occurs in a everyday RvR, shows nothing, as you yourself has proved.<br>
<br>
If we really want to address the issue, the *only* reliable testing environment is one where each variable is examined independently and free from influence.  This really is common sense.  Such logs will show us the way things are, but will say nothing towards the way things should be...the old ought vs. is fallacy once again has revealed its ugly head and clouded the issue.<br>
<br>
Until there is consensus on what Shadowblades *ought* to be able to do, revealing what it *is* that they actually do accomplishes nothing other than forcing public awareness to reflect reality, a commendable pursuit, but doesn't do a god dman thing for me.  Encouraging people to log realistic fights is just encouraging them to waste their time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/utiwgy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tiwgy </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 3:17:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3506.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> my CS thrust poisoning Infil is copied over to test server now . i will gladly help in putting this stuff to rest once and for all.

I think setting up the testing between the TLs is good.  They can do controlled tests.  But I don't think having the NS TL stand in front of the SB TL and have them stand there and swing at each other is the way to fight DURING the test.<br>
<br>
If you do not fight that way in RVR, why would you expect test results done that way to be accurate?  That's like asking a champ to duel a paladin but not use his debuffs, or asking a caster to duel a merc and not use his staff.<br>

You don't see how a test where they are dancing around could be accurate; I don't see how a test where they AREN'T dancing around could be accurate.<br>
