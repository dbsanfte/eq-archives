<br>
You prepare to perform a Perforate Artery.<br>
You perform the Perforate Artery perfectly! (+177) <br>
You hit XXX for 639 damage! (-7)<br>
<br>
That's when your PA goes off well.<br>
<br>
The problem arises when:<br>
<br>
<b>You prepare to perform a Perforate Artery.<br>
XXX evades your attack!</b><br>
<br>
<i>The server is NOT even processing the Perforate at all. It is NOT recognising the fact that an attempt to Perforate is being sent. THAT is the bug.</i><br>
<br>
I was just at the amg-alb side in Emain. I was standing at the door waiting for stealthers to get thru. A Brit Infiltrator looms up [FILLING MY SCREEN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM - it's THAT close]. I immediately /face - Perforate. And this happened:<br>
<br>
<b>You prepare to perform a Perforate Artery.<br>
XXX evades your attack!</b><br>
<br>
He proceeded to PA me and gank me up. Ridiculous I say.<br>
<br>
If you did not line it up properly, yes, you WILL get a failed message. But in this bug, the failed msg didn't even appear.<br>
<br>
So just bcos u got 1-mil RP doesn't mean diddly squat if you can't see the trees in the forest, but can only see the forest. <p><fontcolor="cornflowerblue"><i>Tiejinnie<br>

So, everyone who sees this problem is trying to target moving targets?<br>
<br>
- people at duels that expect a perf<br>
- people walking thru a milefort<br>
- people moving so fast you get target not in view messages<br>
<br>
In that last example, bot your target was moving (coming thru the milegate) and you were moving (turning around via /face).<br>
<br>
I agree that there should have been a &quot;you fail to perform&quot; message.<br>
I don't agree that perf is bugged. I'd blame this on a sloppy setup.<br>
<br>
<br>
What you should do is:<br>
<br>
- Find a player from another realm (preferably another assassin with high evade, or a high shield/parry specced fighter.)<br>
- Grab a 1.0 dps newbie weapon<br>
- Perforate artery 100 times (or whatever..) on a __&gt;&gt;non-moving&lt;&lt;__ player.<br>
I seriously doubt that any of them will miss.<br>
<br>

I'm standing right at the door. <br>
<br>
He stopped at the door to open it. That's when I did the PA.<br>
<br>
He wasn't moving. He was right in front of me filling up my fricking screen. Right after he evaded, he back-peddled a bit and then PA'ed me.<br>
<br>
Unless u have found a way to constantly move forward while opening MG doors, don't even try to suggest such a thing [no, auto-run and bonking the door while it opens doesn't count].<br>

Usually when I go thru mileforts, I come in from the side, walk once along the doors then turn around and open them using the space bar.. inside i walk into the left corner, along the doors, into the right corner (I'm used to checking for archers/assassins hiding in there), then again oopen the other side doors using the space bar (while walking.) I try to avoid walking straight thru a milefort because of stealthers hiding inside or on the other side. But that's just me ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying you are lying, or that there can't be a bug. All i'm saying is that this never happend to me, and there there may be other causes for this. But of course, blaming mythic is always fun, and certainly the easiest way to deal with this =D <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gerbrandt>Gerbrandt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 7:46:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3573.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gul.50g.com/images/Horusthumb.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ppl blocking/evading/parrying/me missing my PA?</span><hr size=1> Heya Nandurius,<br>
<br>
real fun to see you more active on this board <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Browsing through this thread, some observations from my side first:<br>
<br>
1. the failed perf artery happens to me too (in fact quite often)<br>
2. the failed perf happnes in RvR and RvE for me. At least in RvE I am in some encounters quite sure that the targets were not moving (neither on server nor on client side). In my experience you notice a desync by a weird fast switch of your targets position or facing.<br>
3. My conn is not the worst either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  512KBit/s, 112ms ping on average and packet loss 1%&lt;. For a conn from Europe to the States - quite ok.<br>
4. What I noticed is (in some cases of this fail): Sometimes when I moved to my target and hit perf, the system doesnt perf immediatly, but holds a second or two until perf lands. In case i was still hidden, perf goes off successfully; in case I was uncovered, while waiting for perf the same thing happens. This is reproducable by using &quot;distract&quot; ability and immediatly perfing the target (distract has an action timer).<br>
<br>
As I am quite interested, I suggest we meet and test it (maybe with clickster and MJ to reduce downtime).<br>
<br>
- at least 25 perfs on each with low level bronze weapon, unbuffed, but in epic armour<br>
- at least 25 perfs with our best weapon, but fully buffed<br>
IMHO we should test on live. Should we reproduce it, we should test on Pendragon also.<br>
<br>
Deal? <p>But as always: only my five cents ;-)<BR>

<br>
It's not a positional issue, from my experience.  I have gotten this bug, casually walking up to someone who is afk (i.e. hasn't moved for a few minutes), standing still in front of them for a little while, then hitting perf.  And no, they were not ld.<br>
<br>
My theory on this is that it is a simple packet loss issue.  When you press the PA button several things happen.  First it sends a message to the server that you performed a PA.  The server takes that request, processes it, determines position, damage, etc. and sends you back a message.<br>
<br>
What also happens, is that *client side* when you press the PA button (or any style button), it automatically puts you into attack mode, regardless of what is happening server or link side.<br>
<br>
So what I see happening is that the request to PA is getting dropped or lost somehow, but the client (since there is no lag of course) still goes into attack mode.  So your client starts sending the fact you are in attack mode to the server, and you hit with a regular non styled hit.<br>
<br>
The big question is why this is happening so much more often now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/unandurius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nandurius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 3:00:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3573.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/phaas/phazer-avatar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ppl blocking/evading/parrying/me missing my PA?</span><hr size=1> <br>

there were a couple of straigh misses in that test (didn't count but about 5-6 I think). I didn't evade any of them even though I evaded most of the normal hits.<br>
<br>
I don't think there was any chance for a failure here, I wasn't moving the whole time (except for 2 hits which were succesful) so I'm assuming this is the bug most people here are seeing.<br>
<br>
<br>
One possible cause for this could be the 0% bonus on the weapon vs. the 35% of the epic armor. I belive armor/weapon bonus affects the chance to hit. Can any of you who regularly miss perfs post what kind of weapons they are using? If there are still misses with arcanium (35% bonus) weapons, this theory is wrong.<br>
<br>
However if weapon bonus hit/misses are checked before the perf to-hit bonus is applied, then that's something that  should be looked at. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ushennelofeverquest.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shennel of Everquest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 11:16:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3573.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Results of testing</span><hr size=1>  Well about epic armor.. none of the normal mobs in PvE wear epic armor, and I have had my PA &quot;miss&quot; on them too!<br>
  <br>
 Something that was not tested was if the target is in combat or attack mode. None of the PAs we did were with Lihp in combat mode. It is possible that the answer to the &quot;blocked, parry, evaded PA situation has to do with attacking targets that are already in combat or combat mode.<br>
<br>
 Just food for thought.<br>
 <br>
