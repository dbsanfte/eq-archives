The mines of Crushbone were soon behind me, along with the fellow slave whose lifeblood still coated my hands and rough tunic, and the man who killed her, the man I had known only as Master. It was Misa who had told me of the docks beyond the Butcherblock Mountains, and a place called Freeport across the Ocean. It was there I was heading, to the human city far from the forests of Faydwer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A  dubious glare from a Dwarven guard reminded me that I was covered in blood, and I slipped into the underbrush out of his sight. The rain was welcome at first, I washed up in a puddle and scrubbed at my tunic with wet leaves, cleaning the worst of the stains and covering the others with mud. Thus tidied, I pressed on through the daylight hours, following the rough outline of a trail. The rain persisted, and despite my exhaustion I was too wet and cold and afraid to sleep. I finally made it to the docks in the morning, with a runny nose and a small cough as reward for creeping through the underbrush all night.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Dwarf on the docks seemed less hostile than her well-armored counterparts, for which I was grateful - it’s hard to be ‘dim’ when you can’t stop sneezing. With my back pressed firmly up against one of the dock posts for support, I basked gratefully in the warm sun as I wondered what lay ahead for me. Here in the sunlight, with the water<br>
lapping at the thick wooden posts and the birds calling softly as they circled above the water, it was easier to remember the dark fear, the circumstances that brought me here, and the man I both hated and adored.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was eight years old when the slavers took me, screaming, from the home of my father. My mother was away, visiting her parents in the High Elven city of Felwithe, and my lean ranger father was slaughtered where he stood as he tried to protect me. I remember fighting like a wildcat as the orcs bound my hands and feet, but it was no use, I was just a child. I remember the deep fear that struck me when they stood me in front of a man the likes of which I had never seen. Cold blue skin, shockingly white hair, icy violet eyes - he looked at me and smiled as he threw the torch into the only home I had ever known, showing the tips of his sharp white fangs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I smiled a little, remembering how I had pounced forward then, my bound hands clenched on his tunic for balance and my little teeth biting into the slick blue skin of his hand. I can still almost taste his blood. After the beating I took immediately from the orcs, the dark elf himself carried me, smiling down at me with those bright<br>
white fangs. I heard him whispering to me, but I was dizzy and bruised and lost consciousness in his arms without ever understanding the words. I woke on a soft rug beside a huge stone desk, still bound. And it was then my lessons began.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I learned that the dark elf was the only source of warmth and comfort in the place I found myself in. He reminded me daily that my life was his, I was allowed to eat only if it was from his hand, permitted to sleep only on the rug at the foot of his bed. I was forbidden all speech, and wore a gem around my neck that somehow<br>
allowed the dark elf to hear if I spoke. Transgressions were punished immediately and without compromise - failure to obey or breaking any of the rules meant I was banished to the mines like any other slave, subject to the beatings of the ever-angry orcs. Over time it was more the withdrawal of the dark elf’s favor that was the worse punishment, rather than the time in the mines.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was in the mines that I met Misa. Though I only spoke to her once - the beating from the orcs after my simple “hello” left me dizzy for days - she became the closest thing to a friend I had ever had. She understood that I could not safely speak, and over the years we<br>
developed a sort of sign language. It was she who told me tales of Tunare as we dug, she who dared contradict the dark elf’s insistence that hate was the only true force in the world. Misa, though she was just as much captive as I, seemed free - and she taught me to dream, to imagine the world outside the mines, to picture oceans and boats<br>
and lands where we could be free.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was Misa who taught me that slavery was in the mind, Misa who kept me from succumbing entirely to the insiduous ‘teachings’ of the dark elf, and Misa the dark elf insisted I kill. I couldn’t do it, though I had been trained to obey him immediately and soundlessly. My life was his, I knew. I had killed orcs at a word from him, I had<br>
slashed my own cheek when he required proof of loyalty, I would sooner die than raise a hand against him - but I could not kill my friend. His eyes were unreadable as I made no move to obey his command, his hand twisted in Misa’s dark hair, and he instructed me again to take<br>
her life. I had never heard him give me a second chance to follow an order, and my hand actually twitched as if to take the proffered dagger - but in the end I remained still.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Misa smiled as the dark elf slit her throat and shoved her to me, bright blood flowing freely and soaking us both. He could have easily killed me as I uttered my first sound in nearly eight years, whispering her name and sinking to my knees under the weight of her. I was small for my age, and weak, but I pulled her into my lap and<br>
couldn’t care less if I was slaughtered there as I watched the light in her eyes flicker and finally disappear. I held no faith of my own, but I bid Tunare take her spirit as my tears dropped into the blood between us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only then did I look up at him, and for the briefest instant there was something in his eyes, something I had never seen, something somehow soft ... Then his face was cool blue stone again, and he dropped the dagger at my side. “Your life is yours,” he hissed almost inaudibly, touching my flame-red hair briefly before he whirled and<br>
strode from the room. I knew I only had a few moments before he called the orcs, I couldn’t let my shock at his words delay me. I wormed out from under Misa’s body, snatched up the dagger, and was out the window before the alarm sounded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I miss him, I realized as I boarded the boat that would take me across the Ocean to the human city of Freeport. Whatever evil he was, whatever hatreds he tried to instill in me, he had still been my protector and father figure for the past eight years. And in the end, he had given me my life when it was his to take.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m sorry,” I whispered, knowing he would hear the hesitant words through the gem still buckled around my neck. I unbuckled it and dropped it over the edge of the boat before I could change my mind, then turned my face to the wind and the future.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Night had fallen again by the time the boat sailed into the bustling city of Freeport, and with it, a chill. I could feel the heat in my forehead, and knew I was bordering on truly sick, but with no money and nowhere to go, it couldn’t be helped. I had been awake and running for nearly two days now, eating only what I could forage from<br>
the woods, and my energy was at it’s end. I slipped under the docks to look around for somewhere to sleep - however strange it would feel to not be curled at the feet of the dark elf.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There, in the shadows, behind a barrel - a door. I crept in, trying hard to be ‘dim’, and found a row of bunks - maybe for the dock guards I had seen on patrol. Poking around behind more barrels, I found a hidden panel in the wall, and slipped through it. Now I was underground, under the city itself, heading down a ramp. Who knew of<br>
this place, and what was important enough to keep so well hidden? Investigation revealed several small rooms, and as I watched from a safe distance, people. A human and a halfling, from the looks of it - I had seen halfling adventurers in the mines sometimes - all kinds of<br>
travellers came to try to free us, but most were slaughtered.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You are safe here, sister,” called the human softly. “There’s no need to hide from us.” Paralyzed, I realized he had seen through my best attempts at stealth, and there was nowhere to hide. “Come out,” he beckoned. “No one will hurt you.” I moved forward slowly, scanning<br>
the room for any danger, and was promptly stricken with a fit of sneezing. The halfling laughed, a merry sound, and produced a handkerchief.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Here, sister. You’d best sit down and rest some, you sound a bit under the weather.” I was uncertain of these two, but their tones were friendly and I was so tired ... I accepted the handkerchief and the box to sit on gratefully. For the first time since I had watched my<br>
home burn, I started to cry. It was all flooding in, Misa’s death, my escape, the fear, the sickness ... I couldn’t help it, the tears began and just wouldn’t stop.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hey now ...” The man patted my shoulder awkwardly, but the halfling ducked into the next room, returning with a human female. She shooed them both away, wrapping me in her arms unquestioningly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s all right, little one. No one here will hurt you. Come, let’s find you a place to rest.” She ushered me into another room, and led me to a pallet on the hard dirt floor. “It’s not much, but it’s safe. Sleep, sister. We will speak more when you wake.” She had barely pulled the rough blanket up over my shoulders before I was lost in a<br>
deep, fevered sleep.<br>

_________________________________________<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I woke confused, expecting to see the stone footboard of the dark elf’s bed and instead finding the smiling face of a human female. It took me a few moments to remember her, and where I was, and why. She helped me sit up, and I realized my fever and sneeze were gone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “There you are - thought you’d sleep forever. How do you feel?” Without thinking, I sign my answer in the language Misa and I invented, only realizing my mistake when I see her puzzled expression. “Can you speak, sister?” I nod, and lick my lips.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I - I’m fine, thank you.” My voice is soft, and unfamiliar to my own ears.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My name is Elisi. You look as though you’ve been through a lot, but we don’t ask questions here. Come and go as you please, you are always welcome.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How long ...?” Elisi flashed a quick smile. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You’ve slept three full days away, sister. Up with you now, there is a whole world to explore. Just remember to have one of those spellcasting types work their magic on you to make Freeport your hometown in case you lose your way.” With a stretch and a yawn, I check the dagger at my belt and stand, getting my bearings.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you again,” I manage to say, curtseying to the pretty human.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s no trouble, sister. We’ve all been there. Stay safe.” With that she turned her back and took up conversation with a dwarf, and I was on my own. I found my way back up to the stairs, and then through the false wall out onto the docks. The air was clean and crisp, the<br>
sun was shining, and anything seemed possible. Remembering Elisi’s admonition to seek out a spellcaster, I worked my way through the crowds, and managed to find the west gate, where a tall, regal high elf was performing some kind of magic. Perhaps she could help. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ma’am?” It was getting easier to speak, but I still kept expecting orcs to come out of nowhere and start hitting me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m new in town, ma’am, and I was wondering if you could bind me to this place? I have no money, but I can pay you back someday, I swear...” She smiled, and nodded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No need, little one. Come, stand here, and be  still.” I did as she asked, and soon my skin started tingling. “There you are, now. Be safe.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you again, m’lady. You are most kind.” I curtsied and made my way just outside the gate, where I was struck by a wave of homesickness. That high elf had reminded me of my mother, I realized, but I hadn’t seen or thought about her in the years I had been gone. Was she still alive? Did she know I was? Would I ever find her again? Mother had always seemed a little distant, concerned with her research and her spells, but she had loved me, and my father, that I had known. I vowed one day when I was stronger, I would return to the forests of Faydwer and seek her out, no matter the danger from the orcs that shared the great forest.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Right then I was distracted by a rat bumping into my leg, but this was a bigger rat than I had ever seen in my life. Jumping back, I poked at it with my dagger, and it snapped at me angrily. When it lay dead at my feet, I realized the rats were probably excellent combat practice, which I could use.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had not often been called on for my fighting skill when I was with the dark elf, mainly because I didn’t have any. He preferred my ability to remain unseen, usually in a visiting guest’s quarter’s when all were sleeping, getting those papers or items he felt were better off in his posession. I spent that whole day testing my skill against the rats, of which there seemed an endless supply, and by the time I returned within the gates I felt far more confident with my weapon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s good to see a familiar face,” said an elf as I walked by. I hadn’t been paying attention, but when I turned, my heart nearly stopped.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Misa?” The friendly elf shook her head, and in the light of the lamp post I could see she didn’t look as much like my friend as I had thought.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No, my name is Linadian, I’m a merchant here. Have you anything to buy or sell, or are you simply looking for a place to sleep?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I was looking for a place to sleep, but I haven’t any money. Just these things...” Linadian looked through my day’s scavenging, and to my surprise, bought it all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You’d be amazed what people buy in this town,” she smiled at me. “Here, sit under my tent and rest. If you decide to stay in town awhile, I could use some bat wings as well as more of these rat ears.” We dined on fruit and water, and she said her tent was big enough for two and cheaper than the Inns, and I was welcome there. I hunted more that night, liking the exercise and the feel of the blade in my hand, and shared Lin’s tent as she invited. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my hunting the next day I came across an old dwarf who needed the ear of a rat, and since I had no use for it myself, I was happy to hand it over to him. Imagine my surprise when he paid me with not silver, or gold, but five whole platinum pieces! I was still staring at the coins in disbelief when he began casting some sort of spell,<br>
and before I knew it, I was rich and practically indestructible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest of that week was a blur of hunting and selling, but I did use the money the dwarf had given me to buy some new pants, and a tunic - crafted of leather, and well fitted. They were expensive, but at least they weren’t covered with Misa’s blood. And the more I practiced outside the gates of town, the less I was challenged by the<br>
creatures there. Not knowing who else to ask, I returned to the secret rooms under the docks.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Welcome, sister - I see you’ve grown.” Elisi was friendly, never asking any questions or expecting any information. As we spoke I learned that she knew more than I could dream of, she had been so long as a “rogue” - I had no idea there was a name for people with my talents, let alone that there were many in the world! She taught me<br>
some things, those that she could, and suggested I talk to her halfling friend about where I could practice further, since I seemed a quick study.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Practice? Challenge?” Gren Frikniller was a middle aged halfling, who chewed his lip when he thought. “Well for that you’ll be wanting Misty Thicket, lass, but it’s not an easy journey. Are you up for it?” I nod.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I think so.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You must know so, sister, or you will never make it alive. Go west, then, but be on your guard. Close to the city things aren’t so bad, as long as you don’t take a wrong turn into Nektulos Forest. More dark elves there than anywhere, and all of them wanting to kill every pale creature they see.” My heart lurched at the mention of dark<br>
elves, but I knew that nearly all of them would kill me at a glance no matter who had raised me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Farther west, now, there is danger as well. Bears bigger than barbarians, giants, griffins - and one dark elf in particular you’ll want to avoid. ‘Course, if you don’t avoid him you’ll be dead before you know it. Zytl, his name is, and stay away from his buddy Gix, too. If you stay alert and careful, you should make it to the Kithicor Woods.” I was struggling to remember it all, but I wanted to see this Misty Thicket, and the rest of the world. I would remember.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now girl, if you go into those woods before you see the sun over the trees, it’s you who’ll be dead and not me, and don’t say I never warned you. Night belongs to the undead there and we’re all best to stay clear. Come daylight, simply being watchful will keep you alive. Head north, and if you’ve got sharp eyes you’ll see a rocky hole in a hill, and you’ll have found Rivervale.” The halfling looked as though lost in memory at the mention of the city, but I didn’t press him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ahh, Rivervale. A fine city, a wonderful place. From there anyone can tell you how to reach the Thicket, just out through another hole in the hill, but easier to see than describe. You’ll find plenty to occupy your blade there, sister, Rivervale’s been sending it’s young out to train in that Thicket as long as I can remember.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The trip went much as the halfling said it would, except for the rain. Why is it when I must make a long journey, it rains? I saw none of the giants or griffins he threatened, and arrived in Rivervale with nothing but a sneeze to show for the trip - better than scars, I guess.<br>
