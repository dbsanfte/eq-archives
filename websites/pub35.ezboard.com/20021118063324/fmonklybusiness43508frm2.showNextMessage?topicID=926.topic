I then proceeded to hand in TONS of bonechips, and during periods when I got so bored I couldn't do anything else I went to the caves in Field of Bone's cliff near the sea to kill bandits.  This raised guard faction, and a few others.. notably Necromancer faction (Which does not get raised via bonechip quest).

get 1 or 2 backpacks, go into kurns for 20 minutes and fill up on bone chips, find a iks newbie who wants to make some money and xp, group with him and give him the backpacks get close to the bone chip guard and fd, have the newbie turn in the chips you should get the faction hits for the chips he is turning in i believe. If you get the faction hits you should be able to walk around cabilis soon..and never have to return to the old world at all except for dragon and plane raids.<br>

<br>
however becoming non KOS should be possible in Cabilis as I as as Iksar monk am not just non KOS but Warmly to the KNights of truth atm, and amiable to the ashen order through only orc killing<br>
<br>
however its not a very fast process, getting to dubious you will proably bottem out your Sarnak Faction, and Goblin Faction which will take a pretty long time<br>
<br>
but then you can be the only person on your server to walkthrough cabilis as a non Iksar and be proud of it, I know the first time I ran through NFP as an iksar ppl stopped and said WTF? <br>

You can turn in the bonechips in FoB yourself and sneak up behind the quest guard. Just do not Hail him first or he will turn to you. Watch that he doesn't turn anyway. Takes ALOT of bonechips for this.<br>

I did this a long time ago as a Quellious monk. Kill sarnaks and goblins until you are dubious to Cabilis Troopers. Clearing the goblin fort in Warslik Woods over and over again in my mid 40s to get a shrunken goblin skull earring got me there after roughly 1000 kills (logged them all).<br>
<br>
It's important that you stop killing goblins and sarnaks the minute you get dubious to troopers. If you continue like I did and end up amiably to trropers before you do the bone chip quest, the ONLY faction you will raise by doing the bone chip quest is Cabilis Legions and you will have to lower your Cabilis Legions faction to get Crusader faction from the bone chip quest. <br>
<br>
Once you start the bone chip quest, count on 1000+ bone chips to get you past threatening with Crusaders. <br>

As far as quests are concerned, you may be able to do it, one set of chips at a time, as long as he takes the chips while he's still indiff.<br>
<br>
The only problem I see would be that you'd die a lot trying to do it this way unless you could somehow get a friend to pull him to the zone. Just to save time, arrange the chips into 4 stacks of 4, and turn them in that way. <br>

I understand you can hand in items while KoS like this:<br>
<br>
Have a non-KoS friend cast invisibility.<br>
Start handing in the item.<br>
Before you hit the trade button, have the friend recast invisibility.<br>
<br>
I haven't tried it myself, but it's a trick from the Harbingers page.<br>

The post saying you stop sneaking when handing in item and hitting trade is in error according to my recheck of this on Saturaday of this week ( oct 14th would be the date ) as it concerns Trooper Mozo, the npc which need to turn bone chips into. <br>

to make handing in Bone Chips faster i got a tip of a necro who did the quest too:<br>

hand in 4x4 bone chips at a time, you will get 4 faction/exp messages scrolled up, wish i had known that way earlier hehe this handing in one by one was making me mad  <br>

I tried this quest long ago with my gnome necro, and we had a big discussion on it back then. Im not sure about the above post about killing too many goblins, but i was indifferent to start with to Mozzo. Had to be, necros dont have sneak. I've turned in SEVERAL thousand bone chips to the guy, and im STILL KOS to the crusaders.<br>
<br>
Seems the only non iksars that were ever able to become non KOS in there were followers of Cazic. A few inkies and erudites mainly. This was only figure out after close to a million bone chips had been handed in by frustrated necros out there looking for a place to bank after ruining their OT faction by hunting in Karnors.<br>
<br>
Anyways, hope this helps, it sucked for my poor little gnome, he spent weeks doing this for nothing. There are simply too many crusaders in and around there to bother with this unless you arent KOS to them too.<br>

 I'd just like to say that I, an Agnostic Human Monk, have been able to get all faction dubious or better (ie Legion of Cab which is Kindly) except for the Necros, which can only be raised by killing the Iksar bandits, and their ilk.<br>
<br>
After getting to dubious with the Troopers, Legion of Cabilis, I then started turning in bonechips. I think I turned in around 2000 bonechips before all factions, but Necros, were dubious. Then, using sneak I have been able to use the merchants and the guild masters. Works great.<br>

 I am now dubious with the Troopers so I am now handing in bone chips to Trooper Mozo. You can give him 4 stacks of 4 at a time, and get 4 hits. You just have to watch for the Crusader the paths in and out. If I ever get non KOS with the Crusaders I will tell you how many faction hits it took. I am a Quellious monk too btw... <br>

<br>
/cons amiable, yes, *AMIABLE* to troopers <br>
I was even able to talk to the Iksar warlord in FoB about the scorpio pincer quest.<br>
<br>
/cons dubious to merchants (sneak up to indiff for trades)<br>
<br>
/cons KOS to crusaders<br>
<br>
Do I *have* to do the bone chip quest to get faction w/the the crusaders? <br>
<br>
Are there different types of faction bumps? ie: should I clean out the newbie goblin whelps for faction? Or doe sit take 20 whelps of faction to equal one goblin warlord faction?<br>

 ...Getting into Cabilis as a human monk is pretty simple once you are warmly or so to the troopers; basically, where ever in the faction they wont assist agrod crusaders anymore (although you can still do it if yer not KOS to the Troopers). If you need to bank, just head to a cabilis zone (I use FoB when I do this, any of the other zones I might as well head to FV. FoB will be my example). Let the two crusaders that hang out at the FoB zone walk away, then run into the left side zone. Occasionally, there's a crusader behind the two troopers on the other side; let him wander off, then run by him, past the Shaman/SK temple (try not to think of what is in there), and to the bridge. Feign, check surroundings. There's usually a crusader on the bridge, let him move off, then head towards the bank. Might be another crusader in yer way; at any rate, make sure you are familiar with Cabilis. Piece of cake from there, just move into bank, just make sure you FD and bank, since thebankers hate you too  Then move out same way you came. I havent tried zoning through Cabilis to other zones, as I havent wanted to push my luck, but I'm sure it's possible if you are careful; the iksars have really pathetic agro ranges (as any Iksar newbie running up to Trooper Taer could tell ya  <br>

I'm now dubious to the troopers and indifferent to Vekis (the iksar necro that spawns in FV). I put most of that down to hunting for Iksar Blood, Bracer of Scavenging (all my twinks and a lot of friends have one now ) and an earing from Grachnist. I still don't have an earing though.  <br>
<br>
It does take quite a while to raise the factions, but it will happen. Unfortunately, by the time you raise the faction, your need to be able to travel through Cabilis isn't so great any more (since the surrounding zones are now considered low level). I haven't bothered handing in bone chips (the crusaders still scowl), but I at least know it IS possible now. I may do it one day, just to amaze the iksar n00bs.  <br>

So I make all the newbies happy, buying bonechips off them (they actually farmed bones like mad), and turned them in. many a stacks. Sorry, didn't count them. But let's guess... I spent about 400 pp on chips thats 100 stacks.<br>
<br>
Faction with Troopers is indifferent now, and can't possibly get any better (nice new feature). Crusaders still scowl. WTF???<br>
<br>
I still get messages for faction with everyone but necros, and I will keep working on it until at least Friday, if Crusaders still scowl by then I'll give up.<br>
<br>
Was no problem to go hit the bank while kos to crusaders anyway  <br>

Working on them at the moment, but when I ran out of money recently to buy bones off newbies I gave it a try and it's ok for banking.<br>
<br>
Just know where to step and where not.<br>
<br>
Will be back with more info. Troopers maxed out at indiff for me in case I didn't mention yet. Took them from dubious to indiff without moving crusaders. Doh.<br>

Hand in 4000 bonechips. (do any newbie quest 1000 times- sarnack brains, pincers, tounges etc.) to get to dubious with everyone bar necros.<br>
<br>
Kill 1000 Iksar outcasts (minus whatever you killed previously) to get to dubious with necs.<br>
<br>
That'll work, although with these new faction is maxed messages (bugs?) who knows.<br>

It is/was twice as hard to get in as a Quellious monk, than an agnostic one. i.e -500 hits. <br>

<br>
Kill iksar bandits, manslayers, exiles, etc. (The Forsaken faction) to raise your faction with the Cabilis necro guild in West Cabilis (Brood of Kotiz faction) if you plan to use Cabilis as a shortcut between the four surrounding zones.<br>
<br>
The bone chips quest raises:<br>
Legion of Cabilis (warriors aka troopers)<br>
Cabilis Residents (merchants)<br>
Crusaders of Greenmist (SKs)<br>
Scaled Mystics (shaman)<br>
Swifttails (monk)<br>
<br>
I got my faction via bone chips so I'm not sure why the shaman guild still hates me. The quickest place to get bone chips by far is the newbie area in Paineel if you have a friend who will port you. Paying the newbies in FoB and Kurn's Tower works too though.  <br>

I'm a agnostic monk, currently warmly to troopers, amiable to monks, scowling to necros, and dubious to the rest.<br>
<br>
Like the previous posts say, the best way to raise faction is to kill sarnaks/gobs till you're non kos to legion of cab faction (troopers).  After that you can hand in bone chips and do that quest.  There's also a couple other quests you can do but the bone chip one is by far the best since bone chips stack and are cheap.  You can hand in the bone chips in 4 stacks of 4 but cannot hand in stacks of 20.  You can also do the scorpian pincers quest in FoB or the froglok tad tongue quest in SoNH (watch out when doing this one because once in a while a shaman is up instead of the warrior you need to turn in the tongues to).  After you have gotten to dubious with the crusaders you will also be dubious to all the other factions inside cab except for the necros.  The only way to raise necro faction is to kill forsaken iksars.  (If you're starting out working on faction I suggest you kill these to get your legion faction to dubious to begin with, you might as well kill 2 birds with one stone and it avoids any potential problems with going the wrong way and getting killed.)  At this point you have enough faction to move around cab pretty freely and bank and shop (using sneak).<br>
<br>
The best way to raise monk faction is via the penance quest.  (This will also get you your shackle of dust so you can start the shackle quests.)  Go to master Niska and tell her that you do not have your bracer.  (I used sneak for this though I don't think it's necessary even if you're only dubious faction.)  She will give you a book.  Now you wait till daytime hours, and go to the slave pens and hand the book into the Toilmaster (legion faction).  He will give you a book that tells you how to do the rest of the quest, you must save this book.  Then tell him &quot;i need the hammer of exoneration&quot; and he will give you the hammer.  Also tell him &quot;I need a bag&quot; to get the combine bag.  If you are not kos to necros you can find the Toilmaster in the inn during the night (this is in aggro range of grype [necro faction] so if you are kos to necros i highly suggest waiting till daytime unless you wish an unfriendly cr.  Next head to west cabilis.  In the building to the right before you get to the necro guild on the second floor is the Mortician.  Both he and the necro merchant on the first floor are on residents of cab faction and should be dubious or higher to you at this point.  Tell him &quot;I need a mortar and pestle&quot; and he will give it to you.  Now you have everything you need for the quest.  Head back to east cabilis and find the soulbinder (get some shammy dex buffs on the way if you can).  Stand next to the soulbinder and whack on him with the hammer of exoneration until it procs, put the bone fragment you get from the proc into your mortar and pestle, then whack some more.  Once you get 8 fragments combine it and put the powdered bone into the penance bag.  You need 7 powdered bones and a flask of bloodwater (bought from a merchant) to fill the penance pack, combine this and hand in the filled penance bag and the book of exoneration to master niska.  This will give you + legion and + swift tales faction.  These are much larger faction hits than the bone chip quest.  It took me about 4 times doing the penance quest to get from dubious to amiable (I also handed in about 40 or so more stacks of bone chips during this time.)  Amiable faction was enough for me to start the quests but...When I got to Shackle of steel my faction was not high enough to get that quest.  I have not checked if my faction is sufficient now to get it though.   Good luck to anybody trying to get faction, it's a long and very frustrating process.<br>

I happened to get a tell from a nice 44 mage and we procceded to teach those goblins a lesson. Anyway while camping the Destroyer the shurken goblin skull earring dropped once (i lost the roll) but I did manage to snag the gloves needed in one of the shackle quests. In about 2 hours I had dubious easily. Now I will try to convince some newbies to part with their bone chips for a few plat I guess. Anyway the gobby fort is very good for those high levels cause you'll easily get to dubious and probably snag an earring and the much needed shackle component (I saw it drop only once in 2 hours), and if your bored Dalnir is a short run away. I would seriously not recommend killings sarnaks cause of the Chardok quests and the sarnak earrings drop more often in CoM and Chardok so I'm told. Anyway that is my opinion on how to raise Trooper faction relatively fast. And by the way doing those lowbie quests in the outlands (torch quest and pincer) should fix scaled mystics, and just go to WW again and slaughter the bandits for faction and maybe a bracer of scavenging for an alt or somethin, and that should fix the necro faction so you can tap Vekis on the shoulder without gettin Feared, DoT'ed and send back to your bind spot.<br>

Reply | Edit | Del All  KOS To Crusaders? How to Hand in Bone Chips With No Risk<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 I discovered this little *trick* last night when I saw a 60 necro using it.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are standing with your back against the wall, directly behind Trooper Mozo, slide to your left until you are in the tiny corner area of the wall. You can now hand in your bone chips without ever having to worry about Crusaders aggroing on you. For whatever reason, as long as you are against the wall in this corner the Crusaders never see you.<br>
<br>
I'm no longer KOS to Troopers but I suspect you can also sneak from this location and hand in chips without beeing seen by Mozo or the other troopers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Give this a try and see if you don't find it a LOT safer.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

I opted to do the penance quest rather than MQ the newb note for amusement.  Be forewarned, it's an annoying and time-consuming quest - you have to get a 4/60 2HB hammer to proc 56 times.
