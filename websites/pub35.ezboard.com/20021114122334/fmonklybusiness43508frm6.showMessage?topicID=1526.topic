<br>
Well I must say this is a great sight. Thanks to those who labor here. I am a little confused on a few of issues that I could use some help on. <br>
<br>
I might want to restart a monk (see below have current 4th level monk) and am leaning to an agnostic human mostly for faction reasons. I realize that the Iksar get some nice advantages. Based on this I have a few questions:<br>
<br>
1.Is there any tremendous advantage or disadvantage other than starting location for the Agnostic or Quellious human monk?<br>
<br>
2.Where should I put my initial 20 points at creation?  I am really confused on this one as one monk creation guides I read at another site says put all 20 in Strength. I read Raski’s “Monks in Norrath” and he says all 20 in Stamina, when you get or buy Wu’s all the bonus points are agility so is that the most important? When you read all the threads there are a few different recommendations lol.<br>
<br>
3.I started a human monk and put 15 into strength and 5 into agility at this early point should I start over and put into stamina (if that is the best one or whatever??)<br>
<br>
4.Can’t I just fight H2H all the way to 60? <br>
<br>
<br>
5.If I use two fine steel polished ulaks is that the same as H2H?<br>
<br>
6.Is the max melee skills 5 x level plus 5 like most skills?<br>
<br>
7.How far will cured silk take me, and when should I get Wu’s?<br>
<br>
8.Is Wu’s that much better? <br>
<br>
9.How does the agility help?<br>
<br>
Well thanks all for any help all.<br>

4. You could probably fight h2h all the way to 60, but there are some hella nice weapons that are 1hb and 2hb (IE Sceptre of Master, Tranquil Staff, Tan Po's though i dont know if it still exists)<br>
5. Yes, two PSU's are Hand to Hand skill, so they work the same way skillwise, but do their dmg/delay instead of your fist dmg/delay<br>
6. Yes, tradition formula is (Level + 1) X 5<br>

That's all i really know hehe<br>

The following answers are strictly my opinion.  As with many areas of the game, you've asked some questions that boil down to what you feel like doing.  anyway<br>
<br>
1) I've got 2 Human Quellious Monks (40+) and I have yet to encounter a situation in which I said &quot;If I were agnostic, I could have done that easier&quot;.  I can still forge Antonican javelins(rg 250) in the Qeynos Royal Forge.<br>
<br>
2) My first Monk was split between AGi, Dex, and Str.  When I made my second, I filled Sta.  If you look through the board, you can find lengthy debates about this one.<br>
<br>
3) This one is entirely your call.  If after hearing all the feedback, you feel you should have done it differently, your not losing much scrapping 4 levels.  I would reroll.<br>
<br>
4) You sure can.  That's what's nice about games like this, you can do whatever you would like.  You may find circumstances where the additional damage or lower delay on a weapon may impact your ability to solo, but fists are always appropriate for a monk. <br>
<br>
5) Yes.  Any weapon that is H2H uses the same skill(s) as your fists.<br>
<br>
6) Yes.  See the list at: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=68">www.monkly-business.com/a...icleNum=68</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
7) When you can afford Wu's, get it.  Another alternative is Spore Covered from Netherbian Lair.  It's free if you kill the fungoids. =)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Wu's is worth upgrading from Cured.<br>
<br>
9) I'll defer to the many lengthy threads about the value/function of agility.  I  will take hp and AC over agi when i compare equipment.<br>
<br>
Good Luck<br>

<br>
-- Overall no.  There are a few instances that work better for one or the other...but nothing that directly impairs your ability to enjoy the class.<br>
<br>
2.Where should I put my initial 20 points at creation? I am really confused on this one as one monk creation guides I read at another site says put all 20 in Strength. I read Raski’s “Monks in Norrath” and he says all 20 in Stamina, when you get or buy Wu’s all the bonus points are agility so is that the most important? When you read all the threads there are a few different recommendations lol.<br>
<br>
-- Most guides are horribly out of date on those "other" sites.  The current opinion of the community is STA.  However, given the various items available in the game, it is not mean that you cannot be effective and enjoy your monk.<br>
<br>
3.I started a human monk and put 15 into strength and 5 into agility at this early point should I start over and put into stamina (if that is the best one or whatever??)<br>
<br>
-- That is up to you... When I started I put my human monk I put 5 points into STR, DEX, AGI, and STA(before we had guides).  When I made my iksar, I put most into STR (which was the consensus at that time).<br>
<br>
4.Can’t I just fight H2H all the way to 60? <br>
<br>
-- Yes you can...You will not be as effective as other monks who choose to wield 1hb and 2hb weapons in various circumstances.  You may also find soloing a bit more difficult, although there are some nice H2H weapons available these days.<br>
<br>
5.If I use two fine steel polished ulaks is that the same as H2H?<br>
<br>
-- They are H2H weapons.<br>
<br>
6.Is the max melee skills 5 x level plus 5 like most skills?<br>
<br>
-- yes except dual wield and you just substitute a 7 in place of the 5.<br>
<br>
7.How far will cured silk take me, and when should I get Wu’s?<br>
<br>
-- Cured silk can take you a long ways...used to be into your 40s...but you should consider obtaining wus as soon as possible or even some spore covered as soon as you are able to afford or kill fungoids.<br>
<br>
8.Is Wu’s that much better?  <br>
<br>
-- Basically 1 more AC on each item.  Spore covered is 1 more AC that wu's.  There are a lot of options for armor though.  Most monks tend to mic and match based on stat need and what they can find.<br>
<br>
9.How does the agility help?<br>
<br>
-- AGI adds AC.  There are some disparate formulas used, but I've always calculated it as 3AGI=1AC...HOWEVER I would not focus on AGI at all.  Just make sure it stays higher than 75 (once you outfit yourself later in life, you will likely have AGI over 100 most of the time).<br>
<br>
Hopefully this helped. <p><br><br><CENTER>

<br>
Not beyond geography.  I personally prefer playing new characters in the Qeynos area, as I like the progression of zones there.  The downside is though that you're a wee bit isolated, especially as most buying/selling seems to go on on the East Coast (FP/EC)<br>
<br>
<br>
2.Where should I put my initial 20 points at creation? I am really confused on this one as one monk creation guides I read at another site says put all 20 in Strength. I read Raski’s “Monks in Norrath” and he says all 20 in Stamina, when you get or buy Wu’s all the bonus points are agility so is that the most important? When you read all the threads there are a few different recommendations lol.<br>
<br>
With hindsight I'd go back and put it all into STA, but that's simply because I like lots of HP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3.I started a human monk and put 15 into strength and 5 into agility at this early point should I start over and put into stamina (if that is the best one or whatever??)<br>
<br>
I spread my stat points across AGI, STR and STA.  Like I said, going back I'd put more into STA but it's not that important, as you can always buff stats with items.<br>
<br>
Also, the most important thing is to enjoy playing your Monk.  If you find that your choice is effecting this, start again.  If not, keep playing!<br>
<br>
4.Can’t I just fight H2H all the way to 60? <br>
<br>
Yes, you could.  However, most of the H2H weapons seem a bit poopy unless you're paying K's worth of platinum for them.  You can pick up a Cane of the Tranquil for about 300pp and this is a very, very nice 1HB weapon.  I haven't seen anything as cheap/nice in the H2H range yet.<br>
<br>
5.If I use two fine steel polished ulaks is that the same as H2H?<br>
<br>
Yup.  Just keep an eye on your Punch damage/delay stats, though, as you'll outgrow your Ulaks.<br>
<br>
6.Is the max melee skills 5 x level plus 5 like most skills?<br>
<br>
Yup, with the exception of Dual Weild, which is on a 7x multiplier.  You should be able to max it out in your mid forties.<br>
<br>
7.How far will cured silk take me, and when should I get Wu’s?<br>
<br>
If possible, I'd skip Wu and go straight for Spore Covered.  <br>
<br>
8.Is Wu’s that much better? <br>
<br>
As has been said, Wu's is &quot;okay&quot; armour.  Mix it with other pieces to see what results you can get.  Just remember to put the other items back in the bank, as if you're carrying more than your weight limit you won't be able to judge the difference!<br>
<br>
9.How does the agility help?<br>
<br>
There's a LOT of debate on this, with some people claiming it effects your defensive skills (Dodge, Block, etc).  I don't buy into that.<br>
<br>
Generally, AGI will boost your AC.  However, given the choice between a high AC item with no AGI modifier or a low AC item with an AGI modifier, I'd always go for the former.<br>

Just have few more questions please.<br>
<br>
1. Does the Spore armor from fungoid's have a graphic and does anyone know of a screen shot with the graphic if there is one.<br>
<br>
2. Are the sash and headband quests worth the effort and would these itemss be replaced at early levels or carry me for a while. Can I do both Queynos and Freeport ones<br>
<br>
3. Most of the mobs in the Queynos newbie area are now green what is the progression for leveling after newbie area Quyenos Hills BB and what level???<br>
<br>
Once again thanks so much for all your help.<br>

<br>
2 The sash and headband items will very quickly be replaced by bigger and better gear.  Wu's for starters.  You can and should do both.<br>
<br>
However if you plan to get some of the best monk gear later on (Robe of the Lost Circle, Robe of the Whistling Fists, Epic) then you will need to do these at some point.  Best bet is to do them as you become able, that way you won't have a long time waiting on rare mobs at camps where you get no xp.<br>
<br>
The alternative here is to kill certain mobs at a high level to get the items.  Personally I enjoy quests and have avoided the shortcuts.<br>

<br>
2.Stats have only the TINIEST impact on the game, and your 20 starting points are only a tiny fraction of what you will get throughout your career. In other words, it makes no difference in the long run. In the short run, AGI and DEX will help you most at the low levels; at high levels, STA is the hardest to raise. Choose whatever you want, and apply a strategy to your choice in equipment.<br>
<br>
3. No! <br>
<br>
4. You can use just fists all the way to Level 60, but you won't be particularly effective. In the current game, the damage output of fists are pathetic compared to available weaponry. Practice all 3 melee weapon skills so that you can use whatever is most advantageous for the situation.<br>
<br>
5.Polished Steel Ulaks use the Hand to Hand skill.<br>
<br>
6.Many Monk skills advance at the Level*5 + 5 formula, but there are key exceptions. Dual Wield advances at Level*7 + 5 for Monks. Defense advances at Level*5. Offense advances at Level*5 for part of your career, then becomes Level*5 + 5, then becomes Level*5 + 10; they may have changed the level at which the changes take place, but these used to occur at Level 30 and Level 40 (Level*5 until level 30, Level*5+5 until Level 40). Weapon skills do use the Level*5+5 formula.<br>
<br>
7.Cured Silk can take you all the way to Level 60 if you want, if you aren't soloing or acting as a group's main tank. Remember that when it was added to the game, it was the best Monk armor available until the Planes. However, there are much better armors in the game, and as a melee class you should always be looking for armor upgrades.<br>
<br>
8.Higher AC than Cured Silk, plus AGI bonuses. There is no downside, other than the fact that there are better armors also available.<br>
<br>
9.AGI increases AC; specifically, the Damage Avoidance component - this controls the chance of getting hit by an opponent. Furthermore, it increases the chance of a skill increases in some of your defensive skills (so in the long run, they advance sooner as you gain each level) - these also help you avoid melee damage.<br>
<br>
How much AC you gain per AGI is a matter of some debate, so it probably varies somewhat by level and/or current AGI. My Monk gains 1 AC for every 4-5 AGI.<br>

Does the Spore armor from fungoid's have a graphic and does anyone know of a screen shot with the graphic if there is one.<br>
<br>
-- Not sure what you mean by graphic.  If you mean how it appears on you, all I can tell you is that it looks like a basic armor with a green tone on my iksar.<br>
<br>
2. Are the sash and headband quests worth the effort and would these itemss be replaced at early levels or carry me for a while. Can I do both Queynos and Freeport ones<br>
<br>
-- You should do the quest if you plan on achieving your epic.  This is another highly discussed topic.  I would recommend waiting until your teens before worrying about it starting, as the first 2 sashes/headbands can be done quickly and easily by level 15 or so.  After that you must decide to camp for or buy the items needed.  Most of the items are available in the auction zones/channels from time to time.  You can do both at once.  Also, the headband/sash is truly not worth wearing...just keep them in the bank.<br>
<br>
3. Most of the mobs in the Queynos newbie area are now green what is the progression for leveling after newbie area Quyenos Hills BB and what level???<br>
<br>
--  Ahhh my home.  Qeynos Hills is your next stop for a level or two (minimum).  Do not fight the bears or wolves if you can help it...there are druid/ranger npcs that will kill you for doing it(Holly Windsalker is one).  There is also a necro (can't recall the name) that wanders around and will attack as well.  You can certainly fight the bears and wolves, jut watch for the npcs.<br>
<br>
There are usualy plenty of bats, snakes, and beetles to kill for a level or so.  As those light blue/green, just keep moving further into the hills.  At level 7 or so, you can move into Blackburrow, but if will be hard going.  Once you reach level 8-9, you'll have a better time there.  Also, be sure to play BB from top to bottom as it gives you a good feeling for dungeons that you will encounter later in the game.  You can stay in BB till your mid-teens if you wish...by your late teens most will be light blue/green and you will just slaughter the place.<br>
<br>
After BB you have a few options...go to the Freeport area and play in Oasis, West Commons, South Ro, or stay on the Qeynos route and go to West Karana, North Karana...even South Karana (wildlife or aviaks if you can get a group).  Plenty of options in the old world...you can even visit the moon if you want...lots of good places to xp at younger levels from what I hear.   <p><br><br><CENTER>

First set<br>
<br>
1. There isn't really many advantages.  Agnostics have to work a bit more to be able to do the sash quests than the Quellious bretheren do to be able to do headbands, but that is trivial.  Only need to kill a few orcs.  Being agnostic does put you in an interesting place, though, being near two of my favorite newbie dungeons.  Blackburrow is lots of fun, and the Warrens are a blast if you can learn the layout.  (Don't recommend Warrens until at least 7 or <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
2. The consensus seems to be Stamina now, as evidently getting it over 100 means not having any penalties for running out when fighting.  But distribute it how you like.  It won't make too much difference in the end.  I like putting some points in WIS myself to help with non combat skills, but I might be considered slightly odd.<br>
<br>
3. If you feel comfortable with your character, don't worry about it.  But if you're still below level 10 and feel uncomfortable by all means restart.  It's much easier to get out of complete newbiedom these days, so pre 10 it's fairly easy to fix any 'mistakes'  In the end I don't think it matters much, though.<br>
<br>
4. Go right ahead.  It's still a good idea to keep all weapon skills built up.  I'm certainly guilty of letting my 2HB slide, and I intend to work on it as soon as I hunt down a bo for me to use.<br>
<br>
5.  Well this has been answered but I'll fill in the details.  The Ulaks have a 1:3 dmg/delay ratio, so that is comparable to your fists alone until the high 30s, though I would consider switching off before then to save the weight, though they are still viable because of their HP and Str bonuses.  (Dmg/Delay at 35 to 39 is 11/33 so weight will be your deciding factor how long to use them if you don't have anything better by then)<br>
<br>
6. As above, though offense and defense start at 5 x level instead of 5 + 5 x level, though the offense cap will raise several times to 5 + then later to 10 +<br>
<br>
7. Cured silk is viable into the 30s if you really want it to.  Other things are much better, but that's beside the point.  You aren't really built to take damage in the first place so unless you solo a great deal, your weight should be a much greater concern than your equipment.<br>
<br>
8 + 9 - Already been covered by the others<br>
<br>
Second set:<br>
<br>
1. Spore covered is the same graphic as leather, with a green tinge on it, though not as green as wicker.  The pants are the same exact hue as Wu's if that is any indicator.<br>
<br>
2. You will have to do the quests for your epic, but they aren't really very incredible items in and of themselves.  Though I like to wear mine sort of as a matter of pride.  (Not to mention I don't like helmet graphics so I use my band whenever I don't have my hood on.)<br>
<br>
3.  I would recommend Qeynos hills for a little while and Blackburrow.  If you might be able to assemble a small group, the Warrens is an oft overlooked location.  The experience is decent, the loot is really incredible for the level (Any kobold can drop bronze and also drop molars for quests, plus if you are looking for armor, wicker is a good leather substitute)  Just be careful of trains.  (Trains?  In a dungeon?  Never!)<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.  Welcome to the path, brother.<br>

Over all religion means little to monks compared to other classes like illusionist, bards, and rogues (because of illusion masks) since illusions don't cover religion for some odd reason. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kiroc>Kiroc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 161<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/24/02 3:12:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1526.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 2nd lot of answers</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>

(already covered)<br>
<br>
3. Most of the mobs in the Queynos newbie area are now green what is the progression for leveling after newbie area Quyenos Hills BB and what level???<br>
<br>
I'd do Qeynos Hills until about 8 or 9.  Take out the gnoll watchers outside BB - nice exp, reasonable loot (for the level) and they drop Gnoll Fangs - great exp (Turn them into Tillin in the Arena in South Qeynos).<br>
<br>
Then do BB.  Again, Gnolls are good for exp and once you're high enough (teens, I think) do Giant Snakes.  Their fangs/venom sacs are worth about 4gp each.  Nice loot.<br>
<br>
In mid-teens, get on the boat in South Qeynos and go to the wisp island.  You'll need a pair of Magic gloves or Magic weapons, but it's worth the effort.  Kill Wisps and loot Lightstones and Greater Lightstones.  Go back to Qeynos, bank 'em, repeat.  Once you've a few backpack's worth, head over to North Karana and hand them (one at a time) to Ezmirelda (I think - hail all the gypsies until one tells you about Concordance of Research).<br>
<br>
For every LS/GLS you'll get a book.  Sell it to another gypsy (Concordance of Research is worth about 9pp).  Repeat.<br>
<br>
Hello first big money!<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
