As a 60 Wizard I love to deliver damage and I think it is time to start a non caster alt. I have 2 possibilities:<br>
<br>
A Monk or A Rogue. I actually have a 22 Barbarian Rogue and a 20 Iksar Monk.<br>
<br>
There are some issues about the monk class that I have dificulties to deal with like:<br>
<br>
1- Monks have to be the pullers! <br>
<br>
What happens if I dont like to pull? Can I still be a monk? Are monks suposed to do this job when they join a group? Cant I just punish the mobs and help the group this way? Please note that I am not saying that I will never pull. I just dont want to be seen as a puller. I wanna be a monk. That is all.<br>
<br>
2- Monks can be nice dungeon explorers and solo indoors.<br>
<br>
Is this true or you are talking about monks with fungi, black phanter and Tstaff? Could you give me examples of what a monk is capable of? I remember when I used to group at CC that monks from level 33 - 37 used to solo there but I couldnt tell if they were twinked because I cant recognize  monk items.<br>
<br>
3- Monks DPS is as good as rogues DPS. What about rangers? I seems that they are hitting harder and harder.<br>
<br>

<br>
Monks make excellent pullers, but then again so do many other tanking classes and SK's for example.  It just is a power or skill - probably something you will want/enjoy doing if you like to group.  But if you rather sit down and be just a melee, you'll be ok.  However as a melee, when there are no others present, you'll have to pull just to get some mobs to fight.  On raids in guilds you might be expected to pull, but in pick up groups etc I wouldn't force someone to do something when someone else could do it.<br>
<br>
2 - Monks as dungeon crawlers<br>
<br>
I could go anywhere in a cave without invis just fd'ing all over.  This would make it easy to join groups far in without having to clear mobs in the entrance.  FD also prevents adds in dungeons where everything is aggro, when used correctly.  In CC, as you were describing, I was a non-twinked monk, wearing near complete Wu's armor (30pp a piece) and had just looted a CCS (crystal covered shroud there) and began to solo even more efficiently.  I had soloed up to that point and much past it quite easily.  Fellow rogues I know must use a fungi and even then find it very annoying to solo - they then sell their fungis.  (Odd that 2 of them that I knew had fungis.  Still even with that uber item they could not do it as efficiently as a monk.)<br>
<br>
3 - DPS<br>
<br>
I think all classes properly equipped have major dps.  Rangers and warriors tend to use the same slashing weapons, making these items sometimes more expensive or rare to get.  I think monks tank better and therefore as a weight, can last longer and do more damage a fight, at least solo, without a healer.  My bandage does as much heal as a ranger's spell as well.  I do not know enough about rogues to really contribute my thoughts further.<br>
<br>
Best of luck. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=180047"><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~sneezer/kaledoll.gif"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usorok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/3/02 6:58:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1747.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have the heart of a Rogue and the mind of a Monk.</span><hr size=1> One thing: monks and rogues do not have the same DPS, at least post-50. Once a rogue gets a 15 damage piercer their DPS will move ahead of a monk's by a significant amount due to crazy backstabs. In order to have an equal DPS, the rogue would have to be equipped quite a bit worse than a monk, or be in a position where they cannot backstab for a long time.<br>
<br>
And on the topic of rangers, their DPS will never be as good as a monk's but it can be fairly close. Our skills cap higher, we get better weapons as a rule, and we get extra martial arts attacks. All of these things ensure that our damage stays ahead of everybody's except rogues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulittlun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Littlun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/4/02 10:31:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1747.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have the heart of a Rogue and the mind of a Monk.</span><hr size=1> In terms of soloing the problem with a rogue is that their best damage comes from behind.

<br>
I just have quite a young monk, but I find that now that FD is fairly reliable, I can run a long way through a dungeon if there aren't many casters or other PCs to train, then just FD to clear aggro.  Way easier than having to fight my way through.  This may not work on 32+ mobs, though.<br>

Rogues solo very well.  I solod alot of my career as a rogue.   play both a rogue and a monk, my monk isnt as high though, btu still very fun, and i have to say i wish my rogue has FD.  Its a wicked skill.  But Hide/Sneak work well, just have to know WHAT SEE'S INVIS, then you will be fine.<br>

Seriously though, monks tend to solo better than rogues due to mend (cannot beat free HP every six minutes) and feign death (sneak+hide does not save you when three mobs are on you). That is not to say that rogues are slouches, but they usually cannot solo as safely and as easily as monks. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usazic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sazic</A> at: 8/6/02 3:53:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udakkin2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dakkin2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/6/02 2:24:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1747.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have the heart of a Rogue and the mind of a Monk.</span><hr size=1> Rogues are easier to play, and much more in demand.<br>
<br>
Monks solo better but are much harder to learn to play well; particularly learning to pull is tough and gets extremely technical.<br>
<br>
To answer your questions in turn:<br>
<br>
1.  Yes, you'll be expected to pull a lot and therefore it's hard to play monk primarily as damage dealer.<br>
<br>
2.  Exploring dungeons is fun, doesn't need great gear but can be almost as technical as pulling.<br>
<br>
Most people when they say monks can solo mid/high level dungeons are thinking of using fungis with good weapons (not necessarily something as hefty as a tstaff), decent haste and plenty of AC gear.<br>
<br>
3.  On the whole, rogues significantly outdamage other melee classes.  Put a lot of effort into endgame gear and aaxp on a ranger or monk and you can deliver equivalent amounts of damage, but if you're level 22 this won't happen anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, if it's your first serious melee alt, you don't want to pull a lot and are looking to deal the most damage, I'd go for the rogue; but that's just my opinion. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udakkin2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dakkin2</A> at: 8/6/02 3:14:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udalarianwashere.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalarian was here</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/7/02 9:03:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1747.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Rogue or Monk</span><hr size=1> Man, just lost a whopper of a post I typed out. =/<br>

Summary:<br>
<br>
I've played paladin, rogue, and now a monk.<br>
<br>
From what you're describing, I'd say go rogue. If you don't like to pull and plan on being grouped for most of your character's life I'd definitely say go rogue.<br>
<br>
If you want to be the best melee soloist in the game, go monk. FD is easily the single best skill in the game, especially so for a soloist, damage output is nothing to laugh at, and we aren't too shabby in the tanking department either as long as you look for +HP gear. However, you will be expected to pull and pull well, especially in dungeons as mentioned. A monk who isn't pulling in a dungeon really isn't pulling his weight in the group unless you have someone playing a tank class that is an extremely good puller. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udarkcrayz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>darkcrayz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 402<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/7/02 7:42:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1747.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: Rogue or Monk</span><hr size=1> Rogues basically need to group for their DPS to be up their, since they cant backstab in the front til chaotic stab, which you wont get for a while.<br>

And not all monks have to pull, sometimes Ill the ranger pull with his bow, or the sk pull with his dot spells, or Ill pull depending on my mood. I did alot of soloing, so I could kill/fd and go chill then I could come back later and get up and go. Just really depends on what you are looking for.<br>

Solo, Monks will do more damage to warrior type mobs.  Rogues own caster mobs when solo.  I like to fight caster mobs more than warrior.  Not the wizzie types though hehe.  Shamans in Sol B are easy exp, the King is tough though.  I highly suggest that you learn the class you choose.  Its worthless getting to level 40 in 2 days and not know a thing about the class.  Sneak and Hide are not what they're cropped up to be, sure it helps, but now new added patches, its VERY hard in some circumstances.
