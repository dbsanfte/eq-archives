Player DT in 5 seconds with focus.  Don't bother going over the limitations  Unbalancing is unbalancing even if it is only once every 2 hours.  3 free kills in a 6 hour play session is 3 too many.<br>
<br>
Don't tell me you can just interupt it.  Thats bs.<br>
<br>
Don't tell me I it wont kill me if I'm buffed, it will.  This is true for 99% of people vs 99% of mannaburners.<br>
<br>
Solution: Nerf it in the same manner as fear and charm.  Should give an error msg when you attempt to use it on a player.<br>
<br>
Exodus, nexus gate.  With 1 or both a wizard is nearly unkillable even vs a group of people.  They will always escape unless they are stupid enough to a) waste it when normal gate will do or b) find their way to deaths door more than once an hour (or twice with both).  Basicly this removes all risk from pvp for a wiz or druid supposing don't waste it.<br>
<br>
Solution: Add a bit of code into the stuff thats executed when the game checks to see if 2 people are within pvp range of each other when an attack is attempted. Flip a flap and start a timer for both parties. When the timer expires the flag returns to its normal state.  When a player attempts to insta gate it will check the state of the flag.  If pvp combat of any type has occured within x amount of time.  Exodus/nexus gate will fail (but will not be used up) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 8:48:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=681.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AA skills that break pvp.</span><hr size=1> Even better solution would be for VI to consider PvP affects before implementing new code. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvzvixie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VZ Vixie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 4:13:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=681.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AA skills that break pvp.</span><hr size=1> &quot;Even better solution would be for VI to consider PvP affects before implementing new code.&quot;<br>

I don't think manaburn should be disabled in PvP. Rogue backstabs are unbalanced too but you don't scream to disabled them in PvP I notice.<br>
<br>
Manaburn should be capped in PvP in relation to the target's HPs, so that a manaburn wouldn't chop off more than say 75% of a target's maximum HPs. The same rule could be applied to other DD's, harmtouches and melee attacks.<br>
<br>
I don't really mind the nexus gate ability. Wizards should be the masters of travel and it makes sense that they can insta-dodge a crude monster chasing them, or a rogue for that part. <br>

<br>
I got my butt hammered the other day by a monk who was crushing me for 80% of the dmg of my Backstabs.  He didn't have to be behind me.  He didn't have to wait for the special attack to recycle.  He didn't have to first detrmine if he hit and then determine if the BS landed.<br>
<br>
As for casters, please spare me.  LoS casting.  Low level spells that defeat Hide.  Gate, thru a series of succesful hits.  <br>
<br>
The only thing that keeps the rogue from being eveyone's biatch on the PvP servers is their Backstab. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dunkelheit>Dunkelheit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 7:18:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=681.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> wizzies</span><hr size=1> Wizzies are masters of dealing much damage VERY fast.... so Manaburn is balanced for me. <br>

<br>
if you're sitting, backstab will pwn you, if not, backstab is unpredictable at best, and keep in mind, backstab is not only the definining ability of the class, it IS the entirety of the class.<br>
<br>
we are warriors without HP and 2h jousting weapons<br>
we are monks without mend and 2h stun weapons<br>
we are rangers without 51 levels of spells and archery mastery<br>
we are pallies and SK's without spells HP, HT, lay of hands, or 2h weapons for jousting<br>
we are bards without songs (DS songs that can't be dispelled)<br>
<br>
we ARE backstab<br>
<br>
for you to say backstab is unbalanced is like me telling a necro, &quot;OK you're pet is ok, but you shouldn't get spells&quot;<br>

<br>
Ive had pox resisted three times in a row by a paladin with negative 1 disease resist. Guildmate of mine have had pox resisted twice in a row by someone with negative 25 disease resist.<br>
<br>
Of course these are somewhat freak occurences, but seeing as how insid.decay debuffs 67dr (1.5 multiplier on a zek server) these people had really crap resists to start with. The people i usually pvp have 90+ pr/dr unbuffed, with melees even higher. That means they still have a bit of dr left even after insid.decay and have quite a good chance of resisting me.<br>
<br>
If you check my magelo and the contents of my bags i think you can imagine what I usually have to resort to in order to kill people. <p>--------------------<BR>

Mannaburn is a 59+ skill.  If you want to be realistic about it its a 60 skill because of the amount of aa involved.<br>
<br>
60 wizards with AA aren't weak without MB unless they suck.<br>
<br>
Consider...<br>
Lure of ice<br>
Sunstrike<br>
Focus items<br>
Free 800 melee dmg rune<br>
1/8 crit ratio with aa (1200+ pvp dmg crit lures of ice ow)<br>
SOC speed with a horse<br>
Immunity to dispell with 2 insta items now that insta dispelling is out.<br>
Consider the fact that now that insta dispells are out a wizard can basicly be immune to all melee dmg in any zone with large elevation changes via a simple lev spell.<br>
Ghosting<br>
Wall exploiting<br>
Yonder<br>
Insta gates<br>
Immunity to backstab while on horseback<br>
<br>
If the caster is uber enough (and I know you guys LOVE to use uber melees when you talk about melees even if 95% of us aren't so well equiped)  theres also a few uber nukes to consider. 3000k+ (pvp dmg) focused crits with the uber nuke of all nukes garrisons superior sundering.<br>
<br>
Balance my ass I hate to hear newbies and bluebies comment on balance.  Peoples whose pvp experience is limited to dueling 60 melee guildmates with NTOV and primal in a limited environment like say arena zone or EC tunnel...shouldn't comment about pvp.  Wii is a member of a lvl 60 only raid guild on the karana server.  I'm sure he has lots of experience with pve and thats what he should stick to as he is obviously pretty clueless about pvp.<br>
<br>
A free victory no matter how skilled I am, no matter what gear I obtain, no matter what I do isn't balance and never will be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukagerozaka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kagero ZaKa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/02 11:01:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=681.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Kagero/fullsize/ninscrollgif2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AA skills that break pvp.</span><hr size=1> no one is immune to backstab on horseback fyi<br>

<br>
&quot;Yes, I am in blue server but that is where 95% of eq players belong to. &quot;  <br>
<br>
Ya that means that you don't have to pvp EVER and it because of this it doesn't matter what your pvp experience is like.  Nor should your concerns be given the slightest weight compared to those of the people who chose to play on pvp and must and want to pvp daily.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Lure of ice (rare like hell)&quot; <br>
<br>
 Please if you expect me to obtain lvl apropriate gear to be balanced I think you should do the same.  Nobody would equip a 60 rogue with a trak tooth and whine that they didn't do enough dmg.    If you can't obtain kunark dropped spells its probably because you are busy raiding zones where they don't drop.  Feel free to kill in the zones where it does or shell out some pp.<br>
<br>
Sunstrike (only 1 out 4 lvl60 wizzies has it. If Sunstrike can land on you then you suck)<br>
<br>
See above but as to it landing well resists aren't consistant I've actually fully resisted sunstrike (once) but I've also had it crit for over 1k with over 100 fr.<br>
<br>
&quot;-1/8 crit ratio with aa (1200+ pvp dmg crit lures of ice ow) (if wizzie live long enough to cast 8 Lure of ice when you do /deulist with aa combat crit)&quot;<br>
<br>
Work on your reading comprehension.  The point is not what dmg you would do with lure of ice x 8 (which would be way more hp than I have) but rather the chance of a high dmg crit which could totally alter the course of the fight.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Immunity to dispell with 2 insta items now that insta dispelling is out. (Immunity? yeah like you gonna to tell someone..hey man i'm dispelling you so please use instant items...you can dispell him while his is casting a spell right?)&quot;<br>
<br>
LOL ummmm as a pure melee you dispell casters while they are either suprised or in motion.  If you try to pumice a wizard in mid cast you will get dead long before you get any signifigant buffage off them...just so you know.  <br>
<br>
In reality because of this people with 2 insta items hotkeyed really are immune to dispells and pretty much immune to melee dmg while leved in many zones.<br>
<br>
about yonder and epic rune.  I wasn't saying you shouldn't be able to yonder or have your epic rune.  Those 2 skills are still signifigant though if your considering how balanced a wizard is vs a rogue same with focus items.  The fact that they are part of caster &quot;balancing&quot; in no way renders them moot as far as this discussion.<br>
<br>
Oh btw being a bluebie on a pvp forum is worse than being a newbie.  The newbies are more likely to admit when they don't know jack.  60 ubers think they know everything about eq even if they don't have a char above 10 on a pvp server.<br>
<br>
When reading these forums remember to take stuff with a grain of salt.  A LOT of posters don't have the slightest clue.<br>
<br>
Example: the guy who believed it would be neato to let all casters cast while moving like bards.<br>
<br>
The problem is we have <br>
<br>
bluebies, <br>
<br>
total newbies, <br>
<br>
people that don't know how to play their class, <br>
<br>
people commenting about classes they don't play without doing proper research, <br>
<br>
people who blame the pvp system for their lack of skill, <br>
<br>
people whose pvp experience is limited to being ganked because they aren't willing to be the agressor and gain the advantage, and<br>
<br>
people whose general situation is atypical and not representative of the normal state of afairs.<br>

<br>
any wizard can be very deadly if they have even the slightest skill in evasion.  If a wizard is letting a melee get close enough to hit them (when they have lev, skin, yonder, and sow/jboots) then they are doing something wrong.  if you say dispel then see the following argument<br>
<br>
&quot;-Immunity to dispell with 2 insta items now that insta dispelling is out. (Immunity? yeah like you gonna to tell someone..hey man i'm dispelling you so please use instant items...you can dispell him while his is casting a spell right?)&quot;<br>
<br>
since wands now take 4 seconds to cast, and most wizards will keep lev far back in thier buff order, by the time i have wanded/pumiced them enough to make them fall out of the sky into melee range i have taken somewhere between 2 - 3 nukes.  being as i have 1750hp unbuffed i'm dead before i even get through thier skin.<br>
