[Thu Dec 06 13:36:52 2001] You say, 'Hail, Soroush Koroun' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 13:36:53 2001] Soroush Koroun says 'Greetings to you, Laksh. I have just returned from another trip to Katta Castellum and am trying to organize my notes, I apologize that I've little time to talk. Everything happened so suddenly what with the odd circumstances surrounding the last diplomat, I have not quite had time to get used to my new post. <br>
[Thu Dec 06 13:36:56 2001] You say, 'what circumstances' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 13:36:57 2001] Soroush Koroun pauses to find the right words, 'Behari, the last to hold this post, disappeared on his last trip to Katta. He was a friend of mine for some time, I never dreamed that I would have to undertake his duties in this way. I believe that I was the last to see him alive. His behavior at the time seemed peculiar, but I shrugged it off as simply a man blissfully in love,' he says with a heavy sigh, and adds somberly, 'I was very happy for him.' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 13:37:08 2001] You say, 'what behavior?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 13:37:08 2001] Soroush Koroun says 'I never mentioned this to Kalila, I thought it would hurt her more than it would help, but when I bumped into Behari just before he disappeared, he was going on and on about a love potion of some sort. He was very excited, said he thought it would be the perfect gift for Kalila on their wedding night, so you see why I never mentioned it. Anyway, he said that he had just gathered all of the ingredients and was heading back out of Katta. <br>
[Thu Dec 06 13:37:50 2001] You say, 'what love potion?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 13:37:51 2001] Soroush Koroun says 'I have no idea what he meant by a 'love potion.' I have never even heard of such a thing, it just isn't my field, I am afraid. Maybe one of the spiritists knows something about it. I doubt that it will do anything to help you track down Behari, but I wish you luck my friend. <br>
<br>
** <br>
so, I go to the nearest spiritist I can find... <br>
and he tells me he isnt very knowledgeable about potions, and directs me to one Spritist Ragnar, who runs a shop in the merchant area. <br>
** <br>
<br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:11:58 2001] You say, 'love potion?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:11:58 2001] Spiritist Ragnar says 'Love potion? Never been done and not worth the risk to try after what happened to Kanaad. <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:12:16 2001] You say, 'what happened to kanaad?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:12:16 2001] Spiritist Ragnar says 'Old Kanaad taught me a lot of what I know- he was about the greatest potions expert in the city back then. He started gathering legends and lore about some infamous love potion. Not some silly thing to make the girl of your dreams fall in love mind you- this fabled tonic was intended to be shared only between two who had found true love. If their feelings were strong enough it would... well, that was part of the problem, no one knew what it was supposed to do. Kanaad learned of some crazy human in the mountains that had supposedly figured out the secret to the potion. The results were not what anyone had hoped for. <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:12:55 2001] You say, 'what were the results?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:12:56 2001] Spiritist Ragnar shuffles a bit uncomfortably, considering whether or not he should be telling you this, 'This is not something that I would normally talk about, but Soroush came by and told me that you are on the trail of Behari- if this will help you find him, then I will tell you all that I know... Kanaad had a time getting the ingredients and was only to make just a very little bit. He sat down with his love, alone in a room and intended to share the elixir. Well, that was the last anyone saw of her, and he was manic, out of his mind... The mixture had driven him from his senses and he snapped. It took quite a bit to restrain him and figure out what to do next.' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:13:54 2001] You say, 'what happened next?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:13:54 2001] Spiritist Ragnar considers you for a moment and, as though reminding himself that you are trustworthy, continues, 'Well what we learned was that not only did the mixture drive the drinker mad, but it was incredibly addictive as well- a horrible combination. All that we could do was give him a controlled intake of the potion for his addiction and try to treat his dementia. With his returning sanity came the realization of what he had done to his love. It was the most harrowing thing I have ever seen someone go through in all of my life... He is better now, but has never quite been the same and rarely speaks to strangers. Give him this and you should at least get a chance to explain.' <br>
<br>
** <br>
k, so now I have Kanaad's tool box.. so I go and give it to him, like Ragnar suggests... (kanaad is the listless vah shir to the left of the beastlord guildmaster) <br>
** <br>
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; crashed here, and forgot to restart my log before I gave him the box... he says something, and following the thread leads you to a point where he says &quot;I suppose you want to know about Hoober&quot; <br>
<br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:04 2001] You say, 'yes, I want to know about hoober' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:05 2001] Kanaad says, 'I will try not to repeat what Ragnar has already told you.' After taking a deep breath, clearly taxed by the memories, he continues, 'My research had brought me to Katta Castellum. After a long day's work I took a seat at the end of the bar in a local pub. Trying to get my mind off of potions for a while, I overheard a story about a crazy man roaming Tenebrous Mountains. Everyone seemed to know him as Hoober the Delirious. Seems he had become something of a local legend for his very odd habit of asking people to gather some rather obscure ingredients in exchange for a very rare reward.' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:08 2001] You say, 'what ingredients?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:09 2001] Kanaad says 'The promise of true love and everlasting happiness can make even the most scarce ingredients seem trivial. People laughed him off as a lunatic and after finally meeting Hoober I could easily tell why, but his story piqued my interest given my current... project. I asked the fellows to repeat the ingredients this man requested, but they were drinking rather heavily and had paid little attention in the first place. They were very vague, but what they could remember sounded very similar to a partial recipe I had found a record of earlier that very day. Against my better judgement I sought out this wanderer and we had a most interesting conversation. <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:40 2001] You say, 'conversation?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:40 2001] Kanaad gently closes his eyes and paints a picture in his mind, 'There was no denying the man's state of mind, he was utterly delirious. That was why I was so convinced...' he drifts off, 'so convinced...' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:53 2001] You say, 'convinced of what?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:19:53 2001] Kanaad says 'At this notion, he takes a deep breath and opens his eyes to look at you once more, 'you see when he finally did tell me of the things he was looking for, he was eloquent, impassioned, unmistakably controlled. He knew what he was talking about, it seemed like this had to be it, the answer to what I was seeking. So I gathered up the components and combined them myself, and then it all went so horribly wrong...' It takes him a moment to regain his train of thought, 'You wouldn't even be able to have an intelligible conversation with this man due to the cripling nature of the addiction unless someone made you up a batch.' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:20:19 2001] You say, 'can you make a batch?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:20:19 2001] Kanaad glances nervously about, 'I am not sure that I should, the temptation would... perhaps Ragnar could... no he hasn't experience with this mixture.' Kanaad seems to wrack his brain for alternatives, silent for a long moment. His inner conflict evident, he steadies himself for what he is about to do, 'I suppose that I am the only one who can mix this potion for you properly. I can... yes, I have no doubt that I will be fine.' His inner demons put somewhat out of his mind, Kanaad looks you straight in the eyes and says, 'I will need a Luclin clover, a drop of moonlight and some essence of sonnet.' <br>
<br>
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aha! now to the heart of the matter... <br>
<br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:20:51 2001] You say, 'luclin clover?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:20:51 2001] Kanaad says 'The Luclin clover is in many ways just like any other ordinary clover, but the ones that grow out in the Thicket seem to posses an extra sensitivity to magic and enchantment. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a forage item in Shadeweaver's Thicket <br>
<br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:21:02 2001] You say, 'drop of moonlight?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:21:02 2001] Kanaad says 'A drop of moonlight is exactly that- not solid, not liquid but a captured drop of light itself. Any astrologer worth their salt will be able to harness one for you. Dont know much about astrology myself, but I'd guess that the platforms above the palace would be an ideal place from which to see the stars. <br>
<br>
** <br>
Went up there looking around, found a harem, some bards, a couple of seer types, and alot of guards... but no atrologers. <br>
** <br>
<br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:21:27 2001] You say, 'essence of sonnet' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:21:28 2001] Kanaad says 'This will be the biggest hurdle between you and the potion. The essence of sonnet is a rare and wonderful thing, only the most gifted bards will ever produce one in their lifetime. No amount of effort or studying will help them either- it is an unexpected thing. You see, bards dedicate their life to the telling and retelling of stories, it is their job to inspire others with tales of triumph and tragedy. When a bard of the highest order sees or hears something that so genuinely and so overwhelmingly inspires them, something magical happens. <br>
<br>
** <br>
but one thing I did see while I was rooting around upstairs was a cat named Elder Hymnist Hortitosh... hmm I say... I bard GM.. perhaps he knows about sonnets... <br>
** <br>
<br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:26:57 2001] You say, 'essence of sonnet?' <br>
[Thu Dec 06 14:26:57 2001] Elder Hymnist Hortitosh stops what he is doing and looks at you, most surprised, 'An essence of sonnet? I have never produced such a thing my friend, though the fact that you would even request one from me is very flattering.' His eyes leave your face and settle off in the distance somewhere as he continues, 'I was present once when one was created... it was beautiful. I was only a child, but there was no mistaking the significance. Oh how I would love to produce such a thing myself- an accomplishment without peer for one of my art. They say that the inspiration must be genuine, should you know of something that could inspire me so then by all means, I will see if I have an essence of sonnet within me.' <br>
<br>
** <br>
and I couldnt find anything that would lead me further... <br>
** <br>
<br>
so, need to find three things for Kanaad to make the love potion: <br>
<br>
1) Luclin Clover -- forage shadeweaver <br>
<br>
2) drop of moonlight -- hints to palace roof, perhaps an Astrologer can help <br>
<br>
3) essence of sonnet -- EH Hortitosh can make one if you find a way to inspire him <br>
<br>
From there, take the ingredients to Kanaad to make the batch, then off to Tenebrous Mts to find Hoober and see where it goes from there. <br>
