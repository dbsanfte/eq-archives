The Life of a Rogue...</span><hr size=1> Bio-- Sneaking Uponya lvl 30 Rogue, The Rathe Server<br>
Gnomish tinkerer extrordinaire, 3 foot 4 inches, and<br>
68 pounds of pure killing power. He wears brigadine <br>
tunic mithril arms ravenscale boot, legs, elf hide <br>
gloves he made off one of his enemies, serpentine bracer on <br>
one side with his fire emerald bracer on the other, <br>
dual serrated bone dirks in their holders positioned <br>
crossways behind his back, an exe hood covers his bald<br>
head and a troll hide belt is around his waist, adorned <br>
with black pearls and his grotesque mask he is an <br>
adversary to be careful of.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
And it begins...<br>
        Sneaking wakes in his crude bed amongst the ticking<br>
in Ak'Anon's banks upper room where he frequently hides out<br>
for the night. He slides his stash out of his box and puts on <br>
his armor, and ventures out into the bank out the door and into<br>
the four way hallway. Careful to watch his back he spies the room <br>
and finds nothing out of sorts, other than a little miss-tick in <br>
one of the merchants which he just let go as usual malfunctions.<br>
He stocks up at the ration and water merchant and gets a few gnomish<br>
spirits from the bar and safely tucks them in his pack of evil eye.<br>
Up the stairs and down the ramp he goes to the blacksmithing area of <br>
Ak'Anon. Walking through he hears the mystic songs of a bard near by,<br>
stopping and remembering the song from what seems like a distant dream.<br>
He shakes his head and remembers he has business to attend to. Rushing<br>
down the corridor and past the guide by the water, he goes past the POD, <br>
out up down the hall up the ramp and to the exit of Ak'Anon. Sneaking <br>
steps forth from the gates and breaths in the cool and sweet air of <br>
Steam font Mountains, he then looks around seeing the cargo is on its way<br>
to the windmill, he jumps on and rides up to Watchman Dreeb, and hops off.<br>
Looking up he sees a bird who then flies down and lands on his arm.<br>
Its a message from Litto, which states,&quot; Sneaking, I need your help! Come<br>
quickly to freeport. I will speak with you when you arrive, you know where<br>
to meet me.  --Litto &quot;. Sneaking placed a platinum piece in the birds pouch,<br>
let it fly away and started his journey to the land of Antonica...<br>

windmills and quickly made a pair of powered gloves and a catapault.<br>
He grins, &quot;never leave home without these&quot;. Off to freeport he went, <br>
following the path from the windmills he waves at Watchman Halv and <br>
made his way to lesser faydark. Looking through the small edge in the<br>
mountain out into LFay he sees a familiar half elf bard.  ~*pause*~<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Bio -- Mandolin, Brd, Half Elf, lvl 15<br>
Tall Handsome wearing almost all Lambent armor; Bp, Legs, Boots, a<br>
pair of Elf-Hide gloves which Sneaking had given him long ago, Serp <br>
bracers, Troll-Hide belt, and some other trinkets of oppaline and black <br>
pearl. He stands 5 feet 10 inches, with dark hair and a slight scar on <br>
the side of his neck. He is one who is trusted by all and by none being<br>
a bard he travels far and wide and seeks adventure in any form, along <br>
side his little friend Litto they can never be stopped.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Cont...<br>
Sneaking greeted him,&quot;Mandolin my good friend, I got that item you requested.&quot; Mandolin being the strong silent type, accept when he is playing his songs nodded with a smirk. Sneaking hands over a small leather pouch to Mandolin <br>
who accepts it and pulls a small dagger from within the pouch. It is a <br>
whistling dagger of Kunark origin, an item he had sent Sneaking to find a week<br>
before. Mandolin says, &quot;I got a letter from litto via the usual channels, she <br>
wants me and you to go to freeport, and we will find out why when we get there.&quot;<br>
Sneaking nods and points towards greater faydark and says,&quot;shall we?&quot; Mandolin joins the group and starts to sing the song of accelerando while playing his <br>
hand drum. Sneaking follows behind Mandolin trying to keep up and still not leave foot prints. The group enters Greater Faydark towards Kelethin they went.<br>
Mandolin says on the fly that he must go to the bard guild and get his new song.<br>
They journey up to kelethin and ride the lift by the POD to the top. Sneaking and Mandolin agree to split up and meet back there in one hour. Mandolin runs off to his guild to get his song while Sneaking hides in the shadows and seeks out some mischief to get into.....<br>

Sneaking finds himself stumble apon two children playing with a ball. They throw it back and forth, he sneaks up on them and watches from the shadows. It is a little girl wood elf and a little boy half elf about 4 seasons old. The boy tosses a long throw to the girl and she stumbles to try to catch it and falls from the platform. Sneaking quickly uses his grapling hook and swings down to catch the girl in the nick of time replacing her back apon the platform and vanishing before anyone knew what was happening.  Sneaking watches the boy run to the girl check her out and she seemed ok, then Sneaking took a flying leap to the next platform and walks back to meet Mandolin. Mandolin was already there entertaining a few folks with stories and songs when Sneaking comes out of the crowd of many faces. Sneaking waves to Mandolin who then rapped up the song and bid everyone good day and took his hat that held few coppers and silvers that onlookers left. Sneaking and Mandolin return on their journey with haste. Leaving kelethin POD lift behind they run quickly down the path wandering through tree after tree of this grand forest to finally find Butcher-Block mountains. Seeing that its mid-day Sneaking says,&quot;maybe we should see if there are any magickal beings to which could port us to common lands?&quot; Mandolin nodded and shouts to Butcher-block Mountains,&quot;anyone able to port a young bard and a mid level rogue to common-lands, we are willing to pay a few plat.&quot; They hear no response and decide to hoof it to the docks and see the dwarves about a boat......<br>

The group wanders down a somber path through Butcherblock Mountains and find their first destination, The Docks. Two dwarf guards greet them with a clang of their axe and shield,&quot;welcome to BB Docks. Where are you headed?&quot; Mandolin looked towards Sneaking who was already running off to the right dock. Mandolin says,&quot;im with him we're off to freeport, we know the way thank you...&quot; Mandolin quickly runs and catches up to Sneaking at the end of the dock to find Sneaking already sitting and fishing whilst waiting for the boat. With a little tune and some fresh fish, the time went past quickly and the boat finally came. The group jumps on the boat and heads for the bar below deck to listen to other adventurers tell their tales and have a few drinks. Sneaking spies around finding a Barbarian warrior, a High elf cleric, and a young dwarf rogue who seems to be up to no good. Sneaking watches this dwarf carefully as he moves around trying not to be seen and decides to help him by teaching him a lesson. Sneaking hides in darkness, sneaks over to the young dwarf and places his dagger up along side the dwarf's neck and speaks as a ghost from nowhere to him. &quot;you will become strong and great some day but you will need more practice in the arts, go to ak'anon search the cleric guild, you will find the rogue guild leader within. Take this note to him and he will train you in the way of stealth and cunning.&quot; Sneaking removes his blade and then walks back to his chair and makes up a round of drinks for Mandolin and himself. The young dwarf read the note but it was in gnomish and he wasnt able to read it he then sits in the corner of the room and practices hiding in the shadows. Sneaking and Mandolin drink a few more and think its time to sleep, fore the sun was setting. The group goes up in a back storage room and makes up their sleeping bags and fall asleep to be undisterbed for now....<br>

Cont ...........</span><hr size=1> Sneaking wakes from his night of slumber to find Mandolin sittin in the shine of the sun by the doorway shining his lambent armor with a small tattered piece of cloth. Sneaking walks past Mandolin out to the deck to find they are about half way to Freeport. The group missed the brother island and the siren stones at the entrance to OOT. ~~~ a while later~~~ Coming past the oracle and sister island in the far side of the water, the boat slowly nears its last destination Freeport. Mandolin sings a song to the passengers of the boat while Sneaking searches through the crowd; short men, tall men, little girls, and big women, all crowded around for the musicians tune... Sneaking comes apon the small dwarf who is picking a rather large elves pocket and just watches intently on how the rogue worked. Sneaking thought,&quot; he needs training but he could be good.&quot; Sneak goes by and sees something of interest out of the corner of his eye. A locket sitting on the ground. He rushes over and lifts it up to find its made of a metal he has never seen or felt before, small crested gems and little vines wrap the locket and lead to a small latch. Sneaking pushes the latch open and sees a small girl and a boy inside, looking around he finds the boy to be the elf that the small rogue pickpocketed. Sneak thought,&quot; hmm must have been what he stole..&quot; Sneaking hands over the locket to the elf and tells him he found it on the ground, the elf bows and thanks sneaking and introduces himself as......&quot;Boleraphon&quot;<br>
<br>
Bio- Boleraphon, wood elf ranger of 18 seasons<br>
a tall woodelf of 5 foot 11 inches, muscular, skin with a slight tint of tan, green eyes, light brown hair, wielding two short swords of fine steel and wearing a full suit of banded armor adorned in silver jewelry he is a man of many travels, seeking out danger and those who hurt tunare to protect all who shines apon the land...<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&quot;Boleraphons my name and seeking adventures my game.&quot; Boleraphon tells Sneaking of the locket. &quot;my sister and i were little when we got separated and this is all i have of her. she took care of me and i jsut want to find her some day. Her name is Eliza Marie, she is a wood elf rogue, she got taken away from me by some shady fellows one of what seemed to be erudite origin and one of dark elf origin, couldnt really tell they were enshrouded in darkness, all i could make out was their outlines. &quot; Boleraphon stops talking and just watches off the edge of the boat for a moment, just then they hear a loud shout &quot;BOAT!&quot; <br>
<br>
~~~~ the boat docks....<br>
Sneaking and Mandolin ask Boleraphon to join the journey and he accepts knowing that they all are going the same way. Steping off onto the dock the group finds themselves in the land of Antonica..... Where to now?...<br>

Cont ...........</span><hr size=1> The group has arived in freeport and needs to tend to their business. They walk through a door just at the beginning of the dock walk down the hall around the corner past the merchants and out the other door. Apon exiting the door we see the true entrance to freeport. The gates... Two metal clad guards wielding swords and shield awaiting to greet the group into antonica. The group walks through, the guards wave them by and greet them. Boleraphon says he has to tend to some business they will meet up later. Sneaking and Mandolin venture through the corridors and go off to west freeport. The group walks into west freeport past a few guards, Sneaking salutes the two rogues by the monk guild and the group heads directly for the bar. They enter the bar and take a seat at a back table. The bar is dimly lit so all kinds of shady deals could be happening. There is eight tables and a bar with stools along it, the bartender is a barbarian fellow with a slight scar across his right eye. There is a few other people in the room sitting at the tables and one man at the end of the bar. Sneaking sees the man at the end of the bar, shadowed and adorned in all black wearing full plate and a great sword apon his back. The man pours a slightly green liquid into his cup and take a drink. Mandolin goes up and orders a few drinks from the bar and sits down. Handing Sneaking a drink, mandolin sees Sneaking is occupied with the stranger. Mandolin sits back in the hand carved wooden chair and sips his drink. Sneaking gets up abruptly and walks to the man at the bar. Sneaking introduces himself to the fellow and the man nearly drops his drink. The man speaks;&quot;Oh, your Sneaking. I have a message for you from a little lady who called herself litto, she saved my life. Her and her elemental Gobantik helped me and brought me safely back to freeport from najena.&quot; Sneaking nods and asks;&quot;where is litto?&quot; The fellow who introduces himself as Kjata the lowly ShadowKnight, answers,&quot; she gave me this note and said to find you here.&quot; Sneaking takes the note reads it, its in gnomish. &quot;~~~Sneaking, and Mandolin, I have been followed for the last few weeks by a necromancer of unknown origin, I fear I will be taken soon. Please find me in the land of Lava and pray for my safety.~~&quot; Sneaking thanks Kjata and runs up to Mandolin, showing him the note they run out of the bar and head straight for the west gate. Kjata runs out the bar shouting, &quot;WAIT!&quot; The group stops and Kjata catches up. Kjata speaks,&quot; I want to go with you if she is in danger I want to help.&quot; Sneaking nods and accepts his proposal. The group heads for the gate, meets up with Boleraphon and they head to commonlands to get supplies...<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Bio- Kjata, Lvl 14 Shadowknight, Human<br>
Kjata wears all black iron armor and wields a Black iron bastard sword, other than that he wears silver and gold with one pearl one star ruby and a few other stones which cannot be enterpreted. This SK does not trust those who do not earn his trust, Litto has and that is his only true trust in the world, as of this day he has been hated by all and one little gnome has treated him good enlarging his heart twice as much as it ever was.<br>

Cont ...........</span><hr size=1> We come back and find the group heading through the commonlands. The group follows the mountains past the sand and finds the entrance to nektulos forest.<br>
Apon entering nektulos forest the group is greeted by a bard singing by the entrance. Mandolin asks which way to lavastorm. The friendly bard points down the path and to the left... The group then starts their journey through the treaturous land of the dark elven race. Mandolin takes lead to keep everyone moving fast with accelerando. The group runs down the path and finds a bridge. It is a wooden bridge with three dark elf guards standing midway cross it. One corporal and the rest lower guards. Sneaking decides they cant go around because there are pahrana in the water and it would be best to go dead on and take out the guards. Boleraphon casts grasping roots on the corporal while mandolin nods one of the other guards off to sleep and sneaking and kjata attack the third. Boleraphon had successfully rooted the second guard and they all let in on the third. Fight Fight Fight... one down then two down... all thats left was the corporal who was standing rooted cursing tunare. The group runs up and ties up the corporal with a vine rope boleraphon concocted. They decide to keep him for security and drag him along the path towards the fork in the road. They take the left fork as the bard suggested and it lead them to the zone to lavastorm. At the zone were 2 guards. Kjata had an idea,&quot; we should make the corporal tell them to go to watch the bridge or we will finish him off.&quot; The group agrees and they untie the corporal and tell him what he is supposed to do. The corporal does as he is told and the guards run off to the bridge as fast as they can. Sneaking appears behind the corporal and puts his twin daggers through the corporal's neck. The corporal falls with a thump to the ground and the group goes on to lavastorm...<br>

<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Our group decides to split up, notknowing where litto truly is. Sneaking deduces that him and andBoleraphon should head to Najena and speak with the habitantsinside, and that the rest should head towards Sol Temple. Ourgroup splits and bids eachother a fond farewell and we followSneaking on his journey with Boleraphon. Sneaking and Boleraphonfollow a slight path traveled alot which should lead towardsNajena. The group sets apon a quick pace and runs over a gianthill and sees the old charred remains of the entrance of Najena's lair. Boleraphon takes the lead being the ranger he is andenters while tracking to see whats around. A slight skeletonat the entrance tells the group that a little gnome came throughquite a bit ago and has not yet returned. Our band of travelersbegins wandering deeper into najena...<br>

We find out group entering najena. Sneaking takes point while boleraphon tracks around to find litto. Bo says, &quot; there are so many tracks i cannot find a bearing on which way to go. Sneaking tells Bo to stay back here and watch out. Bo responds by using his racial hide and vanishes from sight. Sneaking goes futher to the tenticle terror room but nothing was there but some slimey endtrails splattered on the walls. Sneaking then goes back to the fork and down the other way past the bonecracker hallway. Sneaking heads to najena herself, for he knows she will tell him where litto is, with a sneak and a hide there we go to see najena in her underwater room or prison as you could say.<br>
