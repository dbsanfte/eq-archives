Best Lie</span><hr size=1> Vehemence,<br>
<br>
 Are you Vehemence from Pellinor? If so hello. I thought about the being specced above your level thing, I really did, but berserkers, with crazy skills like 62 LA, 60 axe, and massive troll str, still are hitting much less then they should.<br>
<br>
I get hit, everytime, for minimum damage of 300 a round, up to and above 400 a round by a slash infiltrator, I really have to question why I can do a maximum of 300, and often as little as 220-250 on leather, and as little as 200 on a caster.<br>
<br>
What truly bothers me the most is, the outrageous lying and spin doctor crap.<br>
<br>
<br>
If they didnt make much change, they wouldnt mind to reverting LA code back to pre 1.50 then would they? Course they won't even think about trying that. Also, I question their sincerity, I do not believe they tested it at all, if so, they would see, what everyone else who uses left axe sees. Why don;t they post their logs? Hell they would doctor them anyway or use two of the same patch logs.<br>
<br>
As above poster said, as if they would program a 3% reduction, that is so silly as to be almost super villian funny. But heh, I will go on being underpowered and outnumbered, while Albion classes get better, hibernia stay the same, and midgard goes downhill, weee!<br>
<br>
I hit an archer for 200 ish, he hits me for minimum 500, up to and above 900, ya, archer killer I am, hell they melee me for 150 a pop. When respec goes in, all scouts will have shield slam, will literally be impossible to kill. We all know what this means on pellinor, literally the death of the realm, or at least the death of middies rougues, if it isnt dead already. How much freakin skill does it take to hit a couple buttons from 1/3 mile away and obliterate any target in one or two shots? And drop by folks and see, it gets real ugly on Pellinor.<br>
<br>
<br>
Surly Duff, disgruntled, but not surprised SB<br>
<br>
<br>
how many high level hunters on pellinor? You guys realize how bad they suck? our rogue power is the absolute worst of the three realms, and they have to go nerfing us, real smart, weak get weaker, strong get stronger.<br>
<br>
It simply is not fair. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvehemencebelaern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehemence Belaern</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 12:14:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3427.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: haha, check out herald, LA not nerfed they say.

Hmm... I agree with you all that there may be more to this problem. Hopefully they get this worked out soon. <p><B><FONT COLOR=”#800080”>V</B></FONT>ehemence <B><FONT

Best Lie</span><hr size=1> no, they said if you specced to 34, you would only notice a 3% reduction.  thats a blatant lie.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The reduction should not have been noticeable, and in fact players at higher levels (both in character and left axe) should be seeing a small improvement. Worst case scenario: If you have left axe specced ONLY to 34, if you have no realm ranks, and if you have no bonus items, you will have the maximum possible reduction – approximately a 3% reduction. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
she said that the maximum possible reduction noticeable to overall damage would be 3%.  that is a blatant lie.  people who are 34base + rr + items are noticing a 50-60% reduction in their doublefrost bonus.  this is saying if before it said +200, it now says +100.<br>
<br>
sanya is either blowing smoke up our asses, or she has gotten some misinformation on the fix, or possibly the fix didnt happen as intended.  no matter what the reason, the fact remains that shadowblades were lied to about the change for a long time, because 2 different devs at e3 knew exactly what the change to left axe was, as i posted it before lum posted here about it, and sanya at e3 told fricka that she knew nothing about the change.  we have now been lied to a second time, in regards to how badly the damage was nerfed.<br>
<br>
that is problem number 1.<br>
<br>
problem number 2 is, rogues were balanced around the pre patch damage of left axe, and the ability for rogues to 1 shot and stay stealthed.  now both have been revoked, and there hasn't been any talk of compensation for those things being taken away. <p><a href="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=38056&raceid=10&classid=44">Dither Disgustipated</a><BR>

Now if you 'forgot' to say &quot;everytime they hit with both weapons&quot;, you must consider that swinging both weaps does not happen all the time, and therefore should do more damage when it happens, as LA dmg is reduced to account for the fact that both hands swing everytime.<br>
300 already seems a bit high for a minimum with both hands, even with the +15% bonus against leather, but maybe that's just me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3427.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3427.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3427.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3427.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3427.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3427.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3427.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
