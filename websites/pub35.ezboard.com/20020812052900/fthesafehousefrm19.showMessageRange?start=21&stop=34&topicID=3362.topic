I spoke with the style guy, Matt is his name I think, in the same conversation as vehemence.  Basically, Doublefrost was given a bonus similar to reactionary styles like hamstring, but it was an anytime style.  He noticed this glaring mistake when he went through the styles to boost the scaling like was said in the patch notes.<br>
<br>
Here is the problem:  Rogues were balanced with left axe doing tons of damage, and to offset this, infiltrators were given more spec points.  Currently, left axe is no longer superior to CD/DW with or without styles.  Infiltrators are getting 2.5 spec points to potentially put into 4 skills, because DW works so well with little to no spec points invested in it.  Now shadowblades are sitting with 50 more hp, and a limited range of weapons to choose from, and 2.3 spec pts to put into 5 skills, while infiltrators are running around with 2.5 spec pts. and a can of whoop ass.<br>
<br>
With talks of the possibility of increasing the already disgusting usefulness of cd/dw, this will set shadowblades even further back in the pack.<br>
<br>
BTW, anyone that bitches about a shadowblade using a 2h in combat at level 50 in RvR is full of @#%$.  you don't face an evade based class with a 5 delay weapon and expect to win.  10-11 seconds of no swinging on an evade or miss in rvr means death.  without the possibility of a 1 shot, there is no option to use a 2h weapon as a class that cant live through the possibilities of a miss or evade.<br>
<br>
If the changes stay as is, then CD/DW need to stay how they currently are, since the only complaint anyone ever had was that they weren't as good as doublefrost.  also, all rogues need the same number of spec points as well, whether its giving infiltrators less, or shadowblades and nightshades more.<br>

Garrok tested it and seemed to agree that this seemed to be part of the problem. He had larger variance than with the 16.2 and got logs.

Not many LA users use the 16.5 weapons, if they are really smart. the unique midgard on hander &quot;cleaver&quot; is only 4.0 speed, but 16.5 dps, get less style damage. I use arcanium double bladed axe, is 4.2 16.2 I believe.<br>
<br>

Quick question here. I just got double frost as a style and was completely dissapointed.  I hit Spindel Silksters for (+50) - (+60) with some lucky shots around (+70).  I use Darksteel spiked axe and the Flaming Darksteel Bastard Sword (can't remeber the name of it). This is only about 10 more damage then other styles I use- and I use a TON more endurance. <br>
<br>
Using DoubleFrost as a back up to the Hamstring/Leaper Combo, I end up with little to no end at the end of a fight.<br>
<br>
Using Ravager -&gt; Scathing Blade combo as a back up, I usually end with about 1/4 bar end on low evade fights.<br>
<br>
Specs at 43: 34 CS, 34 LA, 29 sword, 29 stealth, 16 env.<br>
<br>
QUESTIONS:<br>
    I know my Weapon spec is low right now, but that is top priority with next levels- will it help the LA damage?<br>
<br>
    Will crafted weapons help me that much? I just hit 1000 tailor and it is a joke- with new eldritch padded starklaeder leather (highest tier of armor) orange to me and lowest piece at 96%- I get 28 more AF over my current combo of drops AND I lose 160 HP, 30 STR, 33Dex, 26 CON, and 11 Quick.<br>

<br>
In PvE, you can stun monsters multiple times, so rely on plain melee and use comeback/frosty as much as possible.  I never noticed a decrease in DF in pve, rather, comeback/frosty has been made more powerful, and of course they use less end.<br>
<br>
<br>
I havent noticed much difference since raising LA 4 more points to 45 base, and one more rr, doesnt seem to increase damage at all, either style, or off hand damage.<br>
<br>
I do know that a slash infil hits me harder and faster then I can hit him, although they have str relics right now, without them it would probably equal out. but then they have envenom, and I do not. If I run out of end, my damage is roughly half of what a infil or NS is right now.(base damage problem)<br>

Rejoice Hibernia and Albion, the only feared melee-classes from the melee-realm Midgard (Berserker/Shadowzerker) have been brought to heel.<br>

I no longer need to worry about speccing a character or anything else.  Reasons below not that anyone will care but I asked for information and least I can do is let you all know how it turned out.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
I can say it wasnt any one thing that botherd me to much. Although, a bunch of things combined finished the game for me. Probably the thing that did it, the final straw so to speak. Was an anouncement that the strike team was looking at Merc dmg. Then inexplicably they nerf Berzerkers LA dmg. WTF OVER <br>
<br>
So inparting I canceled the account not sure how long the characters stay once canceld but if you see Ufdah or Garrotte its probably someone in my old guild that reactivated them. <br>
<br>
PVP server sounded nice but I will not be around to be apart of that it just took to long for it to come out. <br>
<br>
Wasnt enjoying myself enough to resubscribe. <br>
<br>
Yall take care and see you in another game name will be Ufdah/Garrotte. <br>

I think the reason that people are upset, is not that LA should be better than other styles, but that the assassins were balanced when it was better than other styles, and when 1-shot stealth was in. After that balancing, Sbs were nerfed twice hard.<br>
<br>
Mill: I think shadowblades are now fairly balanced - the real problem is that infiltrators are too strong. Giving them 2.5 spec points, evade 7, a skill that grows in effectiveness with level, and dragonfang was too much. I don't want to nerf them, though, so maybe undoing the shadowblade nerfs is the answer.<br>
<br>
Finally, the overall concern I have is that Midgard's strongest classes have all been nerfed. Healers, hunters, shadowblades, and zerkers have all been nerfed hard. Last seven days Albion and Hibernia got 3 realm points every 2 Midgard got.
