But i"m sure you already knew that.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm like kordeth.  I don't download music off kazaa except MAYBE 1 or 2 songs every couple months.  It's simply not efficient for me to download a song at a time.  I don't just rip CD's.  I rip a friends entier CD COLLECTION because that's the way you get unique and intersting music.  Kazaa really is limited in tha trespect.  I use kazaa, (when I am using it), to download Television series most of the time.  Things like anime or tv show's I'd like to have a copy of.  The MPAA can kiss my hairy white ass if they don't like that.  If I could watch the show every week I'd just do that.<br>
<br>
But if I left my computer on?  Man I'd always have my bandwidth up maxed and my uploads up maxed.  I have a fast connection and we all know people on kazaa will download a 600mb file at .4kbps.  it also makes it so I can't remove that computer from the hub (my hub is 1 computer too small) and it makes puts a measurable amount of stress on that hub as it's a 10baseT and so hits it's maximum bandwidth very quick.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to become livid because someone is not sharing their MP3's all the time is silly.  One of the beauties of peer to peer networks is you are allowed to share or not to share.  If people chose not to share that's their perogative and not something to become angry about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukordesh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kordesh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/28/02 12:43:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5167.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.emerchandise.com/images/p/GJO/pdPAGJO0001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the way KaZaA works</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'd just prefer you didn't leech from me when you have no intention of returning the favour.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It's not as if I'm sitting on top of a T1 line and saying &quot;hahaha you can't upload from me.&quot; My upload is about the same as a 36.6k If I had the upload speed to do it, I would.

<br>
If you have the upload capabilities of a 33.6 user, maybe a 33.6 user would download MP3s from you and think &quot;Wow, 5k a sec, NICE!&quot; <br>
<br>
And I agree, I don't use Kazaa for MP3s. I get Family Guy episodes, mostly, and the occasional music video. I wish Channel 4 would pick up the rights to series 3 and 4 of Family Guy, dammit :P <p><p><b><font face="Tahoma" size="5"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48384">Jokah Pandahunter</a><br>

<br>
I think you are speaking from a purely ethical / moral standpoint, and not a legal standpoint (since anyone must agree that copyright infringement is against the law).<br>
<br>
My comment was undisciplined in mixing legal and moral contexts.<br>
<br>
Remove all references to &quot;stealing&quot;, then, and re-phrase - <br>
<br>
I think that simultaneously holding the following two perspectives - <br>
<br>
1.  Record companies have no right to claim that music is thier property and to tell me therefore that I must give them something in exchange if I access it<br>
2.  Kordesh has no right to not allow me to access his data if he accesses my data<br>
<br>
shows a remarkeable nimbleness of thought.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Sarcasm aside, I think it shows that the whole line of reasoning is truly based on personal convenience, and not on high faluting arguements of &quot;can't own information&quot;.<br>
<br>
The above two perspectives are perfectly consistent with &quot;make my life easy&quot;.<br>
<br>
1.  Record companies, you can't keep me from taking all the music I care to take, whether or not I want to pay for it.<br>
2.  Kordesh, you can't keep me from taking all the music on your hard-drive I care to take, if you access my data.  You must pay me in kind.<br>
