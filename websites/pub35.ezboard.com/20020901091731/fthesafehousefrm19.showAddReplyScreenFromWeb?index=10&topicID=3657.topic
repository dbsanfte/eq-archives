<br>
SB's should not get crush. Agreed.<br>
<br>
5% longevity bonus by 50 hitpoints (its not always 50, its a formula based on con and some magical other numbers... the instance is as low as 30 in some cases), in the current state of the game of mass damage thanks to realm skills.. works out to what?  One third damage from a swing?  8% absorbsion from a common spell?  If you break down the average time of a fight, 5% longevity bonus would roughly equal .5 - 1.5 seconds, not even enough time to get in an extra style.<br>
<br>
2handers are useful in rare situations.  So is distraction, and danger sense =)  the word &quot;liability&quot; pops up alot, because if using a 2hander shouldnt be factored in as a class defining bonus =) If it is factored in as that, then yes, its a liability. (since there are many other more desireable options for a class bonus)<br>
<br>
The only issue I see while you factor in numbers and percentages, is the fact that the infiltrator with their spec points can flesh out their character more fully  Have higher specializations accross the board, which of course, equals higher damage.  Curious how you see that extra damage factored in that is unreachable by the other two assasins. For example, the ability they have to bump up their poisons, critical strikes, main weapon, and offhand,  to a much higher degree than both the other assasin classes.  Yes, they have to sacrifice some areas to do so, but on a much less percentage base to max it out.  As an obvious example, for a Shadowblade or Nightshade to max out their envenom it costs them much more,  in other spec lines, in comparison.<br>
<br>
Hence, extra spec points are needed (if we are balancing the assasins against each other, or some need to be taken away)  I dont think NS and SB's should get 2.5, probably more like 2.3. The other inherent bonuses are still bonuses, but pale in comparison to extra specialization points.<br>
<br>
Class envy is based off the obvious things, all envy is.  I want your wife because she is better looking than mine.  Your car goes faster, so I want it. You house has a swimming pool. Its hot out.  Your assasin, on a same skill based level, will perform better than mine, while performing the same tasks in the same situations. Whats the weather like in albion anyway? =)<br>
<br>
Still a great post and an interesting way to look at things.  Thanks.<br>

<br>
My proposal of adding 12.5% to the primary would increase the base damage of the primary weapon by 20%, or 10% boost in overall melee damage (I would up both primary and LA by 15%, but I would like to see the effects of the scaled down version first).<br>
<br>
An Infiltrator can have:<br>
50 Thrust<br>
15 Dual Wield<br>
For the same amount of points it takes a Shadowblade to have:<br>
34 Axe<br>
39 Left Axe<br>
<br>
It's already proven that Shadowblades have to spread out their melee points more evenly to maximize their damage potential. The Infiltrator's bonus points can be spent to raise Dual Wield to 33%, which adds 6.2% to the overall melee damage. It isn't that high, because the Infiltrator spent it in a specialization with diminished returns. It can range anywhere from a 6% to 28% melee damage bonus for the Infiltrator, so that is why I use 15% as a good figure from which to work with (or +7dps) to get Shadowblades and Nightshades to measure to catch up.<br>
<br>
Even with the above mentioned template, and multiplying the result by x1.05 to account for Shadowblade hit points, Infiltrators still come slightly on top (that is why it could possibly need a 15% boost to both weapons by level 50, but I would wait and see with the effects of 12.5% first). One of the argument to give Shadowblades more points is the utility that Infiltrator can get through added points. Instead, I suggest analyzing the styles you can obtain with your points (34-44 range) and looking to make those worthwhile to add more utility. (For example, longer stun on Frosty Gaze or better damage, or removing the 25 detaunt and returning it to the base of the chain for Atrophy and reserving 25 for another style, or looking at Swords and Axe styles that are redundant). That way, you get the added damage + hit points + utility without having needed any more specialization poitns.<br>
<br>
...and it's okay if LA is slightly less damaging in base damage in DW...<br>
<br>
I never ended up posting the results of the style damage in all my NS vs SB tests because it takes so long to crunch, only to get flamed or misread by board trolls, but this simplifies some of the data collected:<br>
<br>
For the Shadowblade:<br>
Garrote adds 75% damage to the primary at 34 + 2 (36) CS, and 34 + 2 (36) Sword<br>
Doublefrost adds 175% damage to the primary at 34 + 2 (36) LA<br>
<br>
For the Nightshade:<br>
Garrote adds 68% damage to the primary at 50 + 5 (55) CS, and 34 + 3 (37) Pierce<br>
<br>
And my formulas almost proved the way base damage is calculated. Styled damage is still a relative unknown that I'm learning more about, and I've been working with it more lately and testing CS damage caps and such.<br>
<br>
The Nightshade result (yeah, that's me!) had me scratchig my head! How could my Garrote do less damage for having +19 CS ?? (and that was after normalizing damage from resistances) I'm attributing it to Nightshade Quickness effects on damage, since I have a base of +40 QUI than the Shadowblade has, but that's a seperate issue altogether for Nightshades to wrestle with when it comes to their style damage. (My testing basically proved Nightshade base damage to be fairly decent, while something was left to be desired in SB base damage. That was why I proposed base fixes for the damage back then. It was style damage that shocked me because I originally thought my garrotes were returning more damage, but after normalizing for resistances and taking into consideration my +19 CS bonus, it caught me off guard that I did less garrote damage).<br>
<br>
The point of the comparison is that the best use anytime tool available to the Infiltrator is Garrote for 75% added damage. The best tool available for Shadowblades still adds 175% added damage (and this was before the left axe level based scaling boost).<br>
<br>
but Infiltrators get Dragonfang... which is the best evade counter style in the game...<br>
but Shadowblades get Doubleforst... which is the most damage use anytime style in the game...<br>
but Nightshades get a poor man's Dragonfang (Diamondback), and a 4 chain use anytime combo /snicker<br>
<br>
You can see where I am going with on tradeoffs here when it comes to style. Dragonfang looks awesome, and those extra points make it just as easy to obtain as it does for a Shadowblade to spend 34 points to obtain Left Axe and dish out +175% additional damage, and Infiltrators have nothing like it. It burns endurance, but it does layeth the smack down in 1v1 when it is needed, and is still widely used.<br>
<br>
<b>To summarize it all up, my point is:</b><br>
<br>
With the base damage proposal of 12.5% to the primary by level 50, and appx +50hp by level 50, your damage output will be more than fine and in the ballpark of being made up for having less points. If you are looking for added utility that the Infiltrator obtains with those points (ie Dragonfang), no amount of specialization points will ever grant Shadowblades that ability, it simply doesn't exist in Midgard. Instead, focus on the styles you can obtain with your points and look to make them more worthwhile to you. It is very unlikely Mythic will add anymore specialization points for Shadowblades, or any class for that matter. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 7/1/02 3:23:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 7:48:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theblackwatch.biz/Balor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ashame this makes perfect sense...</span><hr size=1> Unfortuantely Elaa, you'll never be listened to.  }:)<br>

You said you have normalized the numbers, which, I assume, means you took into account all variances - <br>
<br>
Normalized AF in your test subjects<br>
Normalized Stats (to base stats?)<br>
Normalized DPS, Qua, Con of weapons<br>
Normalized items worn<br>
Normalized exact specializations (very curious how you did this)<br>
Normalized realm ranks, realm abilities<br>
Normalized levels<br>
Normalizesd bonuses/resists<br>
<br>
When testing swings, and taking into account the variances, how many times did you test each style? 100? 1000?<br>
<br>
Or are all your numbers based off of public formula from Mythic?  I know for a fact they keep a lot of those formulas secret (I've asked for a few of them to be explained to me, and was told just that - that info isnt released to the public)<br>
and Im sure the spreadsheet you have all of this listed on is a real big mess =)<br>
<br>
Perhaps if I had a better understanding where you formulated your percentages and numbers on, I would have a better understanding of your proposed solution.<br>
<br>
And extra spec points was not for the utility of catching up to dragonfang, I disagree that more stuns and ways to disable people from controlling their character are good for rvr and this game.  I was using the example that while an infiltrator can easily obtain Envenom 50, doing an extra 80 damage per cycle, while a shadowblade or nightshade to keep their base damage on par could only do an extra 40 damage per cycle (via poisons - this number is largely based on where and how they specialize, of course.), I was curious how or if  you factored in that extra damage to the base damage - because frankly it does make a big difference.  As well as the enveneating poison line which reduces damage being done needs to factored in, since the infiltrator can reduce that by a greater margin than the other two (via poisons, again).<br>
<br>
You have to factor in poisons to base damage, because they are always being used.  When one class can use a combination of higher poisons compared to the other two, technically it effects base damage.<br>

As  Kobold SB, I'd much rather see us get a Thrust type weapon that could be at least partially based on my Primary stat as an SB.  I think that's a big one that's missing from you analysis of the 3 Assasins, 2 of them can spec a weapon that based off of their primary stat, one cannot.  I also think that the 2-hander option is much more of a liability than most will admit.  Unless you're going against greys, or siting targets you know that you can one-shot, the time-delay on a 2-hander is just not worth it, especially now that we all unstealth on a one-shot.  In addition to not being able to spec a weapon based on our primary stat, the one we can spec is Slash based, limiting our target selection severely.  At least if we had hte option of a Thrust spec, we can choose who we limit our targets to.  As it stands now, if an SB goes up against a chain wearer, he's suffering multiple negatives, some of which are forced on us.  You have the negative of slashing vs. chain, acceptable, since you chose the target, but we also have the negative of not speccing a weapon based off of a primary stat. (negative compared to the classes that can spec a Primary stat weapon)  We're forced by Mythic to use a weapon based off Strength, that's funny for a Kobold.  Even with Str buffs, I've never gotten my Strength up as high as my Dex, and I wear a lot of +str gear.  We need the option of a Thrust weapon to balance us out with the other Assassin classes.  <br>

What bugs me, is we're the only Assassin class that can't choose a weapon based on our Primary stat.  Hell, the only class in Midgard that gets a Thrust option at all is Hunters.  I'm not a Hundred percent sure, but I believe there are both Slash and Thrust Spears available to them.  This to me says that once again, Midgard is the red-headed step-child of Mythic.  All I'm asking for, is a Thrust based Sword.  Give me a Rapier, Hell, I'll even keep the crappy slash-only Left Axe that I have to spec to get the damage output up to par with an Inf or NS who doesn't spec at all in CD/DW.  Just give me a Thrust based weapon so My Primary stat can be of more use than just Evading.<br>

<br>
First off, I firmly believe all assassin classes should have 2.5x.<br>
The result of having 2.5 go beyond being able to spec higher in this line or that. <br>
<br>
2.5 allows a lot more flexibility as to how to train, which brings about variance in the class as a whole. It also allows access to more styles,whether or not these styles are effective or not is completely moot. The fact is, the means by which to obtain these styles is provided, as well as the option.<br>
<br>
As we all know, DAoC is a dynamic game. Keeping this in mind, what happens 1,3,6 months from now if/when Mythic decides to overhaul a line we spec in. Upping my base damage isn't going to do me any good IF they revamp the CS line (or any other line for that matter) and one day the 44th and 50th CS styles become more attractive. What then?<br>
<br>
As a SB, even if respec was avaliable, I could not reach either style with a 5 spec template because of LA. At the moment, as things stand, I am a true jack-of-all-trades. I excel at nothing, but am quite decent at everything.<br>
<br>
The other huge problem I'm having, is seeing both NS and Infs posting about &quot;Please don't allow SB's to spec thrust/crush etc.&quot; WHY THE HELL NOT?? Both NS and Infs get to CHOOSE what weapon they want to use. How is it not fair for SB's to want to be able to do the same thing? Especially kobold SB's who are forced into using a 100% STR based weapon. Soaking wet I might weigh 50 pounds and maybe even be able to bench press twice my weight...So tell me again why it isn't fair to give us a weapon we can spec in that takes advantage of our DEX?<br>

For the same amount of points it takes a Shadowblade to have:<br>
34 Axe<br>
39 Left Axe<br>

What you left out is that that same inf gets lifebane and higher level snare, debuff and disease poisons. The sb would get the lvl 40 dot the lvl 37 str/con debuff and lower snare and disease (that's including 9 in items no rr).<br>
<br>
That's a big difference that needs to be counted.<br>
<br>
I have worked out many templates with something like 30 dw, 36 stealth, 34 cs and 37 envenom 50 thrust.  The sb simply can't spec this well.  They get an inferior evade stun and lower level poisons.  Any solution needs to address this both for nightshades and sbs.<br>

Read again, there's more information after that table explaining what the Infiltrator can do with those bonus points.<br>
<br>
I'm going to abandon my own thread, because things are getting repeated and no matter how many times I present information, someone is likely to say &quot;you didn't take this into consideration&quot; when in fact I do. I give a ton of references in the initial post for everyone to work with, but it seems that education and awareness is not enough.<br>
<br>
I'm in it for the long term balance. I walk away from this thread with this...<br>
<br>
Which Assassin will be on top of the food chain if 2.5x points were given to each of them? How would the entire DAOC community react to giving each Assassin 2.5x points? AND, most importantly, how will those extra points diminish the cost/effectiveness ratio of Assassin-wide abilities from ever getting fixed? think... long term <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uwindariachopsalot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Windaria Chopsalot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/02 2:45:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Elaa that's not right... although normally I agree with </span><hr size=1> As a Shadowblade I actually don't want any help.
