<br>
Not sure I can make this work but would appreciate some advice on my current template to make him battle ready in the BG when he’s level 24. <br>
<br>
Level 20 Shade <br>
20 Blades <br>
20 Envenom <br>
5 CS (I had planned on hitting this hard in later levels) <br>
5 Stealth (2 points were auto-trained) <br>
<br>
I know I need to raise my stealth heavy over the next 4 levels so this was what I was thinking at 24: <br>
<br>
At level 24… <br>
20 Blades <br>
20 Envenom (lethal poison) <br>
5 CS <br>
21 Stealth (2 points auto-trained) <br>
<br>
or… <br>
<br>
At level 24… <br>
20 Blades <br>
22 Envenom (would give me minor enervating) <br>
6 CS (this would give me first low level 3 style chain) <br>
19 Stealth (2 points auto-trained) <br>
<br>
My questions… <br>
<br>
Which of the two above would be my best bet? <br>
<br>
Would it be worth using the second template to use the MINOR Enervating Poison…is the level 22 enervating worth it or would the level 20 lethal be fine for battleground? <br>
<br>
Assuming I went with 22 enervating, what poison would I use on my primary and secondary weapons? <br>
<br>
Can you use at item to raise your envenom, apply the poison you were able to reach with the item, take off the item, and still have the poison remain on the weapon? <br>
<br>
Assuming I had 6 CS, would I even bother using the low level (2, 4, and 6) chain or use my stronger blade styles and forget about CS? <br>
<br>
Would my stealth be high enough in either case? <br>
<br>
Am I screwed with what I have to work with? <br>
<br>
Can I be effective with high weapon, high stealth, high Env, but LOW CS?  I guess that's what I need to know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tali>Tali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/4/02 9:48:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Level 20-24 BG: Need advice as a Shade please... </span><hr size=1> a NS with high blade skill is unusual ... I would love to hear how it goes in the BGs.<br>
<br>
At BG1 level, you can get +2 points of stealth gear pretty easily. So either stealth option will be okay.<br>
<br>
But, with little in CS, you are NOT going to be a scouting assasin. (~looks at that Envenom again~). Hmm, I could be wrong there. I think you'd likely be an effective but often-dead assasin (yer target dies shortly after you ;)<br>
<br>
If you go with this template .... I'd recommend lots o' strength buffs and items ... and set yourself up as a bodyguard. Defense of your realm's vulnerable backside (the casters ;) With over 16 spec in stealth, you'll be able to spot sneaky assasins regularly, and shout 'm out for the casters to take down, and melee the others to death. (i.e., get fantastic armor).<br>

Other assassins were tough and many killed me first despite my getting PA in first.  It convinced me to raise my Envenom to be able to stick and run, as this turned out to be my most successful tactic.  Since my Env was low, I often watched my prey struggle off and recover just with a few Hits left as the poison ran out.  Unless I was sure my target was alone, I would hit PA, shout, Garrotte and let my second weapon hit to deploy its poison, then run and try to stealth away.  If I thought they were alone or far enough away from help, I'd do the above, then switch to my third weapon with its poison and duke it out with Garrotte.  As the BGs mostly have stealthers, I had decreasing success killing other assassins, as they hit for unbelievably more than I did, even if I got PA off first.  <br>
<br>
High stealth was a must.  I obtained a +2 stealth item from 23-24th level and the difference was very noticeable.  I was getting seen frequently at 23rd level (with stealth at 22) and saw the reverse at 24th level, with stealth at 25.  I had enemy characters walk through me and keep going and I had lots more success discoverying stealthed enemies.  This is all subjective, but was very noticeable to me.<br>

<br>
Stealth 16<br>
Pierce 15<br>
Env. 18<br>
CD 6<br>
CS 7<br>
<br>
I think you made the right call, the main thing you will want is see hidden.  By 24 I will have second back stab chain.<br>
<br>
My logic was that no one in under 24 bg gets PA and a few get Garrott and I have Greater imballance poison so I will not miss garrott, I don't think.  Personally, I feel that Greater imballance makes Garrott too costly in End when you could just use a poison for what seems to be an identical effect.  Eventually, we will face those with purge which will throw off poison, but by then we will have Garrott.<br>
<br>
With the spec we share, (not counting blades vs. pierce) I would suggest GI poison and DOT, melee till you have half your life and then run for cover.  Most players in low level BG have a messed up template and they can't respec till 25 so we should be ahead in RPs with Poison Shade template.<br>
<br>
I get as many str and con items as I can and then the rest are dex/qui.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urehklo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rehklo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/10/02 3:32:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: poison shade</span><hr size=1> I play with garikk in the BG a lot.  I have high CS / Pierce and he has high env / blades.  <br>
<br>
Both of us have 20+ stealth and I can tell yah we suck verily.<br>
<br>
Alone I really can't kill anything execpt a lone mage (really how often does that happen, eh?)  When we're together we can take out single targets,  stragglers and such.  I PA, he poisons we run away and laugh when the guy drops dead - or curse when he gets a heal.   With CS I can also take out weekened, or new rez targets that are sitting down.... overall though, Shadowblades kick our asses on a regular basis - embarassingly so.  I mean really embarassingly so, like toe to toe no freekin chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all I'm glad I made a nightshade to 24, since I really have a good feeling for what the class is all about now.  We're not the stealthy puma laying in wait to ambush our prey.  Rather a better metaphore is that we are the bottomfeeders of the realms, the carrion buzzard who feeds on decaying flesh to sustain itself. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sure we have our place, detecting other stealthers - protecting our casters, preventing theyre new-rezzes from hanging on the open field, and jumping out when someone else is in a 1 on 1 to tip the scales of battle, but in general its not a class I'd want to play passed 24. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufaeralspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faeral Spirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/02 12:42:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: poison shade</span><hr size=1> I have to add that things change as you level higher.

These were not all casters, some had a friend with them and at least one was a fighter type.  She was rockin'!  <br>

Standing outside a keep, supposedly defending it, and watching the banners change realms after a group of enemy stealthers killed the Lord...that's power as well.<br>

In my experience, the skald/minstrel mezzes me, then all his pals surround me and I get wacked.<br>
<br>
The time the minstrel got greedy, I was with a bard, he mezzed us both and then started attacking the bard.  An Eld walked up and bombed him so he ran back to attack Eld.  About that time his mez wore off so I finished him.  I have never seen a rabid minstrel before, but I enjoyed putting that dog down.<br>
<br>
By the way, my spec above is incorrect by one thing, I only had 12 in CS.  <br>
<br>
I am finding that the main shortcomming that  lev 23 spec is that I get seen a lot when invis.  I do well as a defensive player where I am guarding casters, but I am frequently seen if I try to sneak up on a group.<br>

And the toughest assassin class to play IMO. You can be very effective, but it just requires a tremendous amout of patience. <br>
<br>
Im not sure how viable your template will be. I would definately have your stealth at 23 or 24. You can bet yer arse that there will be several Infiltrators in the BG at any given time. Most of them will have max stealth and most will have PA, and most will have a respectable envenom. I'll put it to ya this way. My 24 Inf is gonna look like this:<br>
<br>
Stealth 23(20 +3 in items)<br>
CS 22(21 +1 in items)<br>
Thrust 21(17 +4 in items)<br>
Envenom 15<br>
DW 4<br>
<br>
I think thats a pretty standard template. And this is without twinking. Im new to the server so I cant twink, but if I could I could have 25+ in stealth and probably 20+ in Envenom. And the BGs are normally loaded with twinks. <br>
<br>
You go in there with a 19 stealth your gonna struggle as the Infiltrators will get the jump on you. Its gonna be tough no matter how ya spec. Not only are infiltrators a strong class, but again, there is no shortage of them in them in the BGs, and most work together. I really wouldnt try to work alone in there as a Shade.<br>
<br>
Grugen, the assassins really dont come into their own until later. For a thrust/pierce assassin, Skalds are probably the most dangerous Midgard class to take on. I got a 38 Skald, and I felt the same way you did in the BG1. I'd pray for an assassin to come at me. But that changes at higher levels. When they get the nastier poisons and Creeping death, you are gonna have your hands full. <br>

If NS had a descent bomb attack, it WOULD make up for the disparity in points because we don't have to spec in spells.  In my experience, people run from 1 on 1 fights so a descent range spell would do wonders.<br>

Again, I find my place as a NS guarding non melee classes and being a support to a tank.  NS would have a tough time solo in the lowbie BG with any spec. because if they have high stealth... something else is lacking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uagluhowy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AGLuhowy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 12:55:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: inf spec vs. NS spec</span><hr size=1> if you don't have perforated artery when you are in the battle grounds you are gimp...period.<br>

<br>
But in the 35 BG all i did was run with a full 8 man stealth team and ambush reinfocements coming from mids PK.  3 rangers 5 NS's = 30+ dead mids/alb and not a single loss.<br>
<br>
Anyway  I had medium env and high crit with very high stealth along with a decent amount into pierce.  I could almost solo anyone out there except other assassins it all depended on who got the perf off.  The secret to the BG's are that you dont stick around to go h2h with them you hit move off stealth and come back. If you do stick around to fight keep straifing (sp?) around them so they cant get you in LOS (line of sight for the people who dont know) 90% of the time they have no clue how to deal with that and end up just standing there freaking out.  If they do start to turn with you switch directions. Note: this only works if you are /stick to them.<br>
<br>
Also if you want to try the ambush thing.  set 2 rangers on one side of the road close to where the trees end closest to mid PK and one on the other while the 5 NS's stand in the road watching all directions all most on top of each other.  Dont go after a too large of group we got lucky and took out a group of 8 due to killing the healers first.  Restealth after they are dead and dont move off.  More will come to rez the dead but they almost always come in small groups.  Then the albs will get curious or bored and make the same mistake.  I wish i could have taken a screen shot of this i wasnt thinking i was laughing to hard.  But there were close to 30 blodies lying around the area and not 1 was a hib.<br>
<br>
Please someone else try this in any BG and let me know how it worked out and if it was as fun for you too.  After a while the non-stealthers hear of this and start hanging out in the area and it become a slaughter fest.  Never had so much fun!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/11/02 10:07:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: inf spec vs. NS spec</span><hr size=1> I dunno if I've been lucky or not.

<br>
I'm 24 with: <br>
<br>
21 stealth (16 + items)<br>
18 piercing<br>
21 CS<br>
15 Env (13 + items)<br>
<br>
My armor (minus hands and boots) is high qual player made oj con stuff, and I use a oj con cobalt guarded rapier at 97% for my main hand.<br>
<br>
I can usually take out anybody I please 1 on 1.  I haven't been confident enough to do the PA + env + run thing, I usually beat em down to make sure they're dead...but that usually leads to their friends noticing and then joining in for the invariable alb gang bang.<br>
<br>
If I stood still and actually took these people blow for blow, I'd be dead most of the time, but during the fight I'm constantly strafing, pausing long enough for my style to hit and then I'm on the move again.  With them missing (when they do hit, it's huge), my poison going to work and my DD shouts, they get hurt real gud.  lol<br>
<br>
Was fighting this pole armsman chick and missed my PA, one of my env items was broken and couldn't apply lethal...I still got her down to 10% before I died.  And that was due to 2 other bowmen filling me with arrows.  Oh well.

Finally left in style with 360 rp. Yes soloing infiltrators and ShadowBlades during my time in there. And the Skalds I run into are usually dead or they mez and haul tail. Of course having stealth (20+5 items/21 CS /16 env) is a must. Was some of the most fun I had in a while playing DAOC, tell you what during my time I would put together a all steath crew (4 shades and archers) and just tear peeps a new orafice by setting traps and instant killing grouped healers surrounded by tanks. Then we would pick off the tanks one by one. Lots of tactics and guerilla warfare used. Mostly with no deaths. You want to come camp our Hibbie pk? No problem, watch as your stealthers and healers get waxed, then you have retreat. (heh) The Nightshade class is a challenge to play, I love that they say we are a gimped class.
