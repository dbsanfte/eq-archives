<br>
I have a 35 Sarcen Infil. When I rolled him I put 10pts into Str, Dex and Qui. Sarcens naturally have high Dex. The jury is still out on if I should've spent points on dex, but no biggie.<br>
<br>
First off - how do I find out my cap on any given skill or ability? Not only Str, Dex, Con and Qui but other things such as Stealth, CS, Thrust etc? I'm &quot;assuming&quot; skill caps such as Stealth, CS, etc are capped at one's character's lvl. For example, at lvl 35, my Stealth would be capped at a skill lvl of 35. Correct?<br>
<br>
Another thing is since I have a natural high dex, I'm wondering if it would be possible to surpass my dex cap if I - for example - max Aug Dex - ie; wasting valuable RP's.<br>
<br>
And lastly, has there been any changes/discoveries on what Str, Dex, Qui and Con effects for infiltrators? It's been so long since I looked into this I've forgotten most of this.<br>
<br>
Con = HP's ?<br>
Str = How hard you hit and weight you can carry?<br>
Dex = I get this and Qui confused. Which does what?<br>
Qui = ?<br>
<br>
And how do these effect things such as evades, thrust and DW.<br>
<br>
I'm looking for a definitive answer for all of this - if there is a site with this listed, by all means point me to it.<br>
<br>
Many thanks! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujammermon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jammermon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/02 12:56:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dex, Str, Qui, Con and caps</span><hr size=1> Str <br>

Secondly, do any of the primary skills (con, qui, dex, etc) affect Dodge, Critical Hit (not CS) or Duel Wield? If so, what? <br>
<br>
What about Attack Speed (atk spd and weap spd are two different things right?)? Does only weapon stat effect Atk Spd? Or do one of the primary stats play a part as well? And why did they choose Augmented Str as a pre-req for Mastery of Arms which grants an additional 3% per level attack speed with melee weapons when Quickness affects Weap speed?<br>
<br>
<br>

Crit Hit is a pure mathmatical chance to add Crit Damage (25% I recall) and nothing makes it go up or down.<br>
<br>
Dual Wield and Celtic Dual** are a mathmatical chance to SWING the second weapon in an attempt only. All Chance to hits, damage, etc are still driven off that weapon training and Primary Stats. <br>
<br>
** You also get some styles off DW/CD but they are mediocre for assassins and tend to use more endurance. Even the Mercenary/Blade Master they were truly designed for describe them as &quot;not great&quot;. <br>

However, you can also get bonuses from items at a rate of (level/5) +1, so at 35 you'd be able to get +8 from items.<br>
<br>
Each realm RANK you get (not level) starting at 2 adds a +1 to all your skills, and that cap is above and beyond your bonus from items.<br>
<br>
Stats cap at 1.5 times your level in boosts from equip. (Level 10 could have +15 to each stat from equipped items but adding more wouldn't increase it) There is a cap to how much buffs can increase your stats as well but I don't know what that is. (They are cumulative with item stat bonuses, however)<br>
<br>
Hope that helps! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uditherdaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dither DAoC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/18/02 2:04:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/dither/smiley2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dex, Str, Qui, Con and caps</span><hr size=1> buffs that raise 1 stat are capped at 1x your level, and buffs that raise 2 stats are capped at 1.5x your level, i think.<br>

At levl 50 you  will have gained +15 str, +23 qui and +45 dex while leveling up.<br>
<br>
For a briton:<br>
<br>
Str: 60 + 15 + 75 + 50 + 75 = 275  (+initial points &amp; RA)<br>
