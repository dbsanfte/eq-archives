&quot;US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies<br>
<br>
The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.<br>
The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum of 4 per cent of Americans to report &quot;suspicious activity&quot;.<br>
<br>
Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale investigations of US citizens.<br>
As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.<br>
Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees, truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted recruits.<br>
A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov, is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the 10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.<br>
<br>
Historically, informant systems have been the tools of non-democratic states. According to a 1992 report by Harvard University's Project on Justice, the accuracy of informant reports is problematic, with some informants having embellished the truth, and others suspected of having fabricated their reports.<br>
Present Justice Department procedures mean that informant reports will enter databases for future reference and/or action. The information will then be broadly available within the department, related agencies and local police forces. The targeted individual will remain unaware of the existence of the report and of its contents. &quot;<br>

<br>
Secondly, that piece is so far out of whack with reality, it is silly.<br>
<br>
TIPS isn't some sort of secret police, or anything of that sort, regardless of what paranoid conspiracies the author of that piece thought up. (I'm 99% certain it is from an paper in Sydney, Australia.)<br>
<br>
All that TIPS is, is a basically a phone number, like community watch or crimestoppers line or something on a national level, devoted solely to terrorism.<br>
<br>
If someone sees soemthing highly suspicious, they should call it into the authorities anyway. This gives one central contact point, that is all.<br>
<br>
Heck, if I see someone stockpiling fertilizer and Diesel Fuel, A la Oklahoma City, I think that it would be a pretty darn good idea to let someone know that suspicious, possibly terrorist related activity is going on. That is all we are talking about here. a hotline to call if you see something highly suspicious.<br>
<br>
I would agree that it is probably useless in its curent form, because the FBI doesn't currently have the manpower and resources to track down the leads given by actual law enforcement personnel. Throwign this into the mix will probably add more noise than signal. However, to refer to this as part of some nefarious police state apparatus is just silly. <p><hr><center><a href=http://trojanhorseshoes.blogspot.com/>Trojan Horsehoes</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usplendora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Splendora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 7:40:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8864.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/ann_anderson/dragoneyes1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: USA edging closer to being a police state ?</span><hr size=1> Oh ya and wasn't Bush just talking about giving the military<br>

Learning to love Big Brother<br>
George W. Bush channels 'George Orwell'<br>
<br>
Daniel Kurtzman<br>
chronfeedback@sfchronicle.com<br>
<br>
 Here's a question for constitutional scholars: Can a sitting president be<br>
charged with plagiarism?<br>
<br>
As President Bush wages his war against terrorism and moves to create a huge<br>
homeland security apparatus, he appears to be borrowing heavily, if not<br>
ripping off ideas outright, from George Orwell. The work in question is<br>
&quot;1984, &quot; the prophetic novel about a government that controls the masses by<br>
spreading propaganda, cracking down on subversive thought and altering<br>
history to suit its needs. It was intended to be read as a warning about the<br>
evils of totalitarianism -- not a how-to manual.<br>
<br>
Granted, we're a long way from resembling the kind of authoritarian state<br>
Orwell depicted, but some of the similarities are starting to get a bit<br>
eerie.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; PERMANENT WAR &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
In &quot;1984,&quot; the state remained perpetually at war against a vague and ever-<br>
changing enemy. The war took place largely in the abstract, but it served as<br>
a convenient vehicle to fuel hatred, nurture fear and justify the regime's<br>
autocratic practices.<br>
<br>
Bush's war against terrorism has become almost as amorphous. Although we are<br>
told the president's resolve is steady and the mission clear, we seem to<br>
know less and less about the enemy we are fighting. What began as a war<br>
against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda quickly morphed into a war against<br>
Afghanistan, followed by dire warnings about an &quot;Axis of Evil,&quot; the<br>
targeting of terrorists in some 50 to 60 countries, and now the beginnings<br>
of a major campaign against Iraq. Exactly what will constitute success in<br>
this war remains unclear, but the one thing the Bush administration has made<br>
certain is that the war will continue &quot;indefinitely.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; MINISTRY OF TRUTH &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Serving as the propaganda arm of the ruling party in &quot;1984,&quot; the Ministry of<br>
Truth not only spread lies to suit its strategic goals, but constantly<br>
rewrote and falsified history. It is a practice that has become increasingly<br>
commonplace in the Bush White House, where presidential transcripts are<br>
routinely sanitized to remove the president's gaffes, accounts of<br>
intelligence warnings prior to Sept. 11 get spottier with each retelling,<br>
and the facts surrounding Bush's past financial dealings are subject to<br>
continual revision.<br>
<br>
The Bush administration has been surprisingly up front about its intentions<br>
of propagating falsehoods. In February, for example, the Pentagon announced<br>
a plan to create an Office of Strategic Influence to provide false news and<br>
information abroad to help manipulate public opinion and further its<br>
military objectives. Following a public outcry, the Pentagon said it would<br>
close the office -- news that would have sounded more convincing had it not<br>
come from a place that just announced it was planning to spread<br>
misinformation.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; INFALLIBLE LEADER &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
An omnipresent and all-powerful leader, Big Brother commanded the total,<br>
unquestioning support of the people. He was both adored and feared, and no<br>
one dared speak out against him, lest they be met by the wrath of the state.<br>
<br>
President Bush may not be as menacing a figure, but he has hardly concealed<br>
his desire for greater powers. Never mind that he has mentioned -- on no<br>
fewer than three occasions -- how much easier things would be if he were<br>
dictator. By abandoning many of the checks and balances established in the<br>
Constitution to keep any one branch of government from becoming too<br>
powerful, Bush has already achieved the greatest expansion of executive<br>
powers since Nixon. His approval ratings remain remarkably high, and his<br>
minions have worked hard to cultivate an image of infallibility. Nowhere was<br>
that more apparent than during a recent commencement address Bush gave at<br>
Ohio State, where students were threatened with arrest and expulsion if they<br>
protested the speech. They were ordered to give him a &quot;thunderous ovation,&quot;<br>
and they did.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
The ever-watchful eye of Big Brother kept constant tabs on the citizens of<br>
Orwell's totalitarian state, using two-way telescreens to monitor people's<br>
every move while simultaneously broadcasting party propaganda.<br>
<br>
While that technology may not have arrived yet, public video surveillance<br>
has become all the rage in law enforcement, with cameras being deployed<br>
everywhere from sporting events to public beaches. The Bush administration<br>
has also announced plans to recruit millions of Americans to form a corps of<br>
citizen spies who will serve as &quot;extra eyes and ears for law enforcement,&quot;<br>
reporting any suspicious activity as part of a program dubbed Operation<br>
TIPS --<br>
<br>
Terrorism Information and Prevention System.<br>
<br>
And thanks to the hastily passed USA Patriot Act, the Justice Department has<br>
sweeping new powers to monitor phone conversations, Internet usage, business<br>
transactions and library reading records. Best of all, law enforcement need<br>
not be burdened any longer with such inconveniences as probable cause.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; THOUGHT POLICE &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Charged with eradicating dissent and ferreting out resistance, the ever-<br>
present Thought Police described in &quot;1984&quot; carefully monitored all<br>
unorthodox or potentially subversive thoughts. The Bush administration is<br>
not prosecuting thought crime yet, but members have been quick to question<br>
the patriotism of anyone who dares criticize their handling of the war on<br>
terrorism or homeland defense. Take, for example, the way Attorney General<br>
John Ashcroft answered critics of his anti-terrorism measures, saying that<br>
opponents of the administration &quot;only aid terrorists&quot; and &quot;give ammunition<br>
to America's enemies. &quot;<br>
<br>
Even more ominous was the stern warning White House Press Secretary Ari<br>
Fleischer sent to Americans after Bill Maher, host of the now defunct<br>
&quot;Politically Incorrect,&quot; called past U.S. military actions &quot;cowardly.&quot; Said<br>
Fleischer, &quot;There are reminders to all Americans that they need to watch<br>
what they say, watch what they do, and this is not a time for remarks like<br>
that; there never is.&quot;<br>
<br>
What would it take to turn America into the kind of society that Orwell<br>
warned about, a society that envisions war as peace, freedom as slavery and<br>
ignorance as strength? Would it happen overnight, or would it involve a<br>
gradual erosion of freedoms with the people's consent?<br>
<br>
Because we are a nation at war -- as we are constantly reminded -- most<br>
Americans say they are willing to sacrifice many of our freedoms in return<br>
for the promise of greater security. We have been asked to put our blind<br>
faith in government and most of us have done so with patriotic fervor. But<br>
when the government abuses that trust and begins to stamp out the freedom of<br>
dissent that is the hallmark of a democratic society, can there be any<br>
turning back?<br>

That's what they would WANT you to think =p. What better way to hide spies than letting the people think they don't exist.<br>
<br>
Like I said before, I expect all &quot;freedom&quot; to be extinguished by the year 2050. By then it's pretty much going to be like minority report where they know almost everything you do and are always watching. *kicks United Sheep Of America*<br>

You cannot deny that over the years surveillance and general tracking have done nothing but gone up. Security is being taken to extreams at the cost of privacy. Have you forgotten that not too long ago they were thinking of having tracking chips implanted in all newborns? They said it was to track them in case they were ever kidnapped or something but the implications of what they could do with it are scary. There are lots of things in the works.

Aidden - I don''t really think the US is about to become a police state. Just that there are disturbing trends recently<br>
which are edging in that direction. For instance, that whole informer network reminds me of growing up in the cold war and hearing stories about people inside the iron curtain who always had to watch what they said for fear a neighbor would rat them out to the police. Also it was often misused to settle<br>
personal scores instead of true dangers to the state.<br>

<br>
My ancestors came over from there in the 1880s and my cousins have all visited the &quot;Homeland&quot; and loved it. Some cousins have gone more than once. <br>
<br>
Growing up entrenched in the North, where so much is taught about our battle with the British ( War of Independence) and Civil War ( 4 hrs. from Gettysburg) the concept of the USA ever being a police state is absurd. <br>
<br>
The ACLU ( American civil liberties union) will challenge any/every law put forth that limits personal freedom. Jeez, just the state of California alone will do that!<br>
<br>
The repression of individual rights goes against the very essence of Our Constitution, hence there are lawsuits from appellate courts that change the law and it's interpretation: Roe vs. Wade, Miranda Rights, search and seizure. It is safe guards like this that watchdog the freedom in the USA.<br>
<br>
Besides, the Constitution is a living document, considered this by it's amendments. The law, tempered by time , changes to reflect society, but it is very slow (average 2 yes.) so that the change is universal, not reactionary.<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides, Martial law (declared in states of emergency by Governors) and National security are separate from standard day-to-day living.  The NSA and the law that created it is to promote the well being of the nation, not tear away at the freedoms we hold dear. The average Joe down the street will not be impacted. <br>
<br>
Remember, writers get published by starting controversy. It is up to us as readers to see if their is any real truth to what they put out. Anyone just reading anything without exercising their own judgement and filtering known facts into place, deserves it. Editors put their spin on it to get more &quot;copies&quot; or &quot;hits&quot; to sell more ads, to make more money, etc. <br>
<br>
I always think of Plato and truth<br>
<br>
the artist : truth<br>
artist creation: 1 step away from truth<br>
person seeing the creation: 2 steps away from truth<br>

Now I dont know about the rest of you, but I know a woman (mothers friend) named ****. Shes 62, very religious, a Lutheran actually, an unrelenting bigot, and extremely xenophobic.<br>
<br>
I bump into her quite a bit, and none of its pleasent. Im not a far far out counterculture kid (what they called a freak a few years ago in my high school), but sometimes I can have my moments. I wear black leather wrist restraints as everyday jewlery, I wax and mess up my hair intentionally, I wear teeshirts by bands with names like Whorebutcher, Cannible Corpse, Atari Teenage Riot, Pop Culture Rape Victim, Chemlab, Glorious Mother @#%$, etc. I even wear dirt wash jeans (which seems to freak her out more than anything). <br>
<br>
Now, this woman constantly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> constantly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CONSTANTLY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> picks on my mother for letting me grow up like this. I refuse to attend the church, I took an interest in Middle Eastern politics and Islamists after 9/11, I date outside my race, etc. My mother has a good sense of humor about all of it, cause she knows me better than anyone, and knows that Im not about to go kill anyone cause Allah or the lead singer of Circuit Wound told me to. Shes a liberal science teacher, and the most accepting and tolerant person I know.<br>
<br>
But **** still has extreme distaste for me. If I wear a Ghost in the Shell teeshirt with some barely exposed anime breasts on it, I get the treatment. If I say that I think we should look at why Israel and the US is terrorized, instead of blowing another third world country up about it, I get the treatment. <br>
<br>
If she had a chance, shed report me. I dont want my file floating around in the government system, having them even take a passing look at me, just because some racist bible thumper took it on herself to report that guy she knows who wears funny clothes and knows conversational Arabic.<br>
<br>
I think its a stupid idea, and this encouragement of 'reporting' to the government is utter bullsh*t.<br>
