<br>
I'm new to PvP, and I want to play a rogue, but I also don't want my ass handed to me everyday. I've heard that bards are the best in PvP, but then someone said they suck now and that rogues kick ass in PvP. I'm fairly certain rogues aren't the best at PvP, but I would like to know how they stack up against all the other classes, would they win against most classes or lose? Which is the best class to be in PvP and which is the worst? If you were to list all the classes in order of best to worst in PvP, where would each class be placed?<br>
<br>
I understand that a lot of PvP battles depend on the skill of the fighters, but if they were both fairly good at their class and were about the same level with around the same level items, I'm curious as to which class would come out on top. I can't decide whether to play a rogue class which I know pretty well, or to play a bard class which I don't know at all but have heard are great at PvP, or to play a totally different class such as druid, who I would imagine would be good at PvP.  <br>
<br>
Any thoughts or comments are greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Vynthor<br>

A rogue w/ lots of MR and Fire Resistance can own many casters.  So, thats what I would save up for.  Next just work getting decent wepons, ac armor and str/sta gear.  I prefer a good amount of sta gear so that you can pierce all day and not fatigue too much but str is also sweet.

They can just tash or malo you and then you're screwed, unless tash is also MR based, but I think I heard somewhere that tash is charisma based, or maybe thats charm I'm thinking of. <br>
<br>
But if that is the case, wouldn't it be better to be a monk? A monk can get all the MR gear and still be able to do nice damage from any angle, unlike rogues. In that respect, I think a monk would be more formidable and be difficult for a rogue to beat. As I mentioned, I'm a PvP virgin, so please correct me if I am wrong.<br>
<br>
As for the server, I just started playing on Sullon Zek and have made a bard (level 6). I don't really enjoy the bard all that much, but from what I've heard in the past, bards are the way to go for PvP. Now though, I'm hearing that bards aren't that great at PvP anymore, and that rogues are very good at it. So, now I'm thinking of making a rogue, a class I enjoy playing. I just want to be sure that I'm making the right choice for PvP.<br>

good luck getting 150 mr on sullen, or expect to get your ass handed to you alot.<br>
if you start the attack on a sitting caster with a good bs you will quite likely win, if they root yer ass from 600yrds away your toast. <p>Diabalein Avidya <br>

They can actually channel their lowest level root enough to get one off before you can kill them.<br>
<br>
Let me state this to ya *the original poster* Theres a buttload of rogues on the server. There werent half as many rogues on test til the Pickpocket and invis changes were added then you have rogues crawling out the wazoo. Normally there are 2-3+ rogues to a group. your lucky to find any true tanks which is REALLY gonna start hurting at 35+. <br>
<br>
Also regarding rogues getting owned in PvP... Thats very true. I have quite good equipment for my level and I get owned by all casters within my level. Melees its usually a standoff. If the melees are dumb enough not to joust I can outdamage them. If they joust with there 24 damage hitting 2handers its pretty close. I have never been able to finish a single PvP melee battle without either 1) their friends joining in b) my friends joining in or c) blue con mobs joining in<br>
<br>
The closest PvP battle I have had is with a shadowknight same level as me. I hit her enough that she got her spells off rarely. She was dumb enough not to joust therefore I was able to BS, and outdamage her. However, heres the kicker. I attacked her when she attacked a mob. granted this monster was green to her but it still counted as a slow DoT. Second she still had Harm touch up when we had to end the fight becuase a blue Kodiak in WC attacked me. she went her way with about 1/8th her hp left and I got to zone with 2 bubs left. now. Had we redone that fight with no mob on her. No Kodiak aggroing me and her using her HT the damage would have been about equal. btw this is with her landing spells on me that do damage. With the orc on her even with her HT I still would have won with about a bub of hp left. I forget why I told you this.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok recap of what I meant to say lol.<br>
<br>
theres a buttload of rogues. we dont need anymore or the server wont make it to 50+ for lack of tanks hehe.<br>
<br>
Rogues get owned in 1on1 PvP until you get some levels and resists. Once a rogue gets 150+MR and 100+others you dont even have to worry whether its a caster or not. Also I couldnt PK sh** until I got to 18ish when my duel wield and double attack skill was high enough to add to my damage output.<br>
<br>
In a PK group rogues are good at any levels. Against even players backstab is what does the most damage as they have such high AC that normal pierces just dont hit enough.<br>
<br>
crap. am I rambling again? been up way to long and ended it by being killed by a cheap evil gank squad using a 29+ wizzy to root, snare, nuke to 1 bub and let someone in your level range kill you hehe.<br>
<br>

In a group situation, we're one of the best classes to have in a pvp situation.  BUT if you're gonna solo as a rogue, you have to learn to use poisons or you're just a poor man's monk.  With poison and resists you can be king.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to choosing your own battles and knowing your enemy.<br>
<br>
Regarding bards, I'm sick of hearing all this talk about bards owning in pvp (talking just about solo pvp, they're good in groups).  Sorry, but I've run across maybe two bards that I viewed as "dangerous" on Vallon.  They are, however, the best at NOT getting killed, which is a nice quality to have.<br>

<br>
If you know the strengths and limitations of your class and you understand the strengths and limitations of all the other classes - you will be a force to be feared whether you are a rogue, ranger, mage, wizard, warrior, cleric, or whatever.<br>
<br>
Knowing what to do and when to do it in all situations is the key - this includes knowing when to attack as well as when to run when you are outmatched either in levels or by skill. <p>-lodragan <br>

Simply because I know the class, and the previous poster is 100% correct. How well the person plays the class makes all the difference. I've done a job on a level 40ish enchanter (before the bitch gated...grrr, I'll get you next time Karma...) but yet me and Pumpkin got pretty beat up by a level 30 ranger.
