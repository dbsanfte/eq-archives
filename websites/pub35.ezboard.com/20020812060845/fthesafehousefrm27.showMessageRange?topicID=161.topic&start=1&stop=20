Then I rested after every trap and it was a waste of time.  At least a dozen, including ones set up on the way to the sewer entrance in the root cellar.  Obviously wanted some newbies to die.  <br><br>Well, the server is going to need reseting the way the sewers are (1 frame per second), but how about disabling P v P in all zones but certain small places like arenas?  If we're not supposed to steal from each other, then how can killing others with traps (particularly when some have unlimited budgets) be justified? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A> at: 7/31/02 1:16:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uglipthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glip the Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pantless Asst.
