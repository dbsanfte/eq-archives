I'm five days late for the one year aniversary of the scout saga!<br>
<br>
Well happy birthday Sett, Xvar and all the other good poeple of the story. Mabye one day you'll all make it into a book!<br>
<br>
And [b]Koz[/b], I'm still here. I just havn't been able to read the last 5 or so chapters, they just make no sense to me. It's not becuase of you, but you know how when you read a story and your not done for a year and you forget what happened at the begining of the story? Well thats what happened to me. I guess I won't be able to critisize your writing for a while. Mabye when school is out i'll print out all 114 pages (I'm stil collecting the chapters to read at a later time) and read them in a way i'd read a novel. <br>
<br>
So cya later and happy belated birthday!!!<br>
<br>
--edit--<br>
Dam I spelt it Koz. I guess Kooran is dead then.. You win.<br>
<br>
--Second Edit--<br>
Well Dam Do I feel stupid now. It turns out I'm a month and 5 days late for the anniversery. 13 months Koz.

<br>
Note: Kerrans speak a strange slang language. I thought since they’re animals it makes no sense for them to speak perfect English. Just as I did with giving Tyu a strange accent on his words with “s” in them the Kerrans have a dialect to themselves. The dialect is taken from many slang languages and partially made up. Most words will be defined from context but if you’re lost here’s a short list of definitions:<br>
Segs, segots – friends<br>
Lemmycuts – a term between Kerrans for a close friend or battle companion<br>
Mott’s – mott means wife, mott’s means something a wife does<br>
Gomogue, gom – idiot<br>
Gurrier – thug, enemy, bully<br>
Guff – nonsense<br>
Vittles – food<br>
Slash and clipping – fighting<br>
Surpose – think, suppose, wonder, figure<br>
Un-reechy – good<br>
<br>
Several Kerrans were moving through the forest doing a bit of hunting in the early morning. These particular hunters were volunteers in the Kefkan army so they could go through any of the Kefkan empire’s reaches and kill whatever they so pleased.<br>
<br>
The first and obvious leader of them was a stocky cat with large tufts of fur coming out of his ears and a fierce set of teeth. If those teeth weren’t enough the heavy cast iron pike thrown casually over his shoulder was. He wore a tight leather jerkin dyed black with a red scale cuirass over it. The cuirass had one bit near the left side that was patched up with thick brown leather.<br>
<br>
He threw a glance at one of his companions behind him and barked in the strange Kerran vernacular, “You gom, hasten up for I clip you under the chin!”<br>
<br>
The smaller one cowered slightly and nodded his head. This one had a couple thick bastard swords in scabbard on his back. His armor was a light blue chain link with a couple rusty spots here and there. He smoothed out his leather slacks out of nervousness then hopped forward a bit to catch up.<br>
<br>
The cat next to the smaller one sneered at him and quipped, “Gomogue.”<br>
<br>
The smaller one looked frustrated and replied, “Mean gurrier.”<br>
<br>
The largest one pulled back his ears and identified the two in a stern voice. “Menith, Uuen no more guff out of either of you lot!” <br>
<br>
Uuen shifted uneasily in his chain mail. Menith toyed with a tassel hanging off the shoulder strap to his thick iron breastplate. The breastplate was a strange purplish color, which the Kerrans saw as green. Menith was carrying a large mercenary double handed blade strapped to his back.<br>
<br>
The larger one, his name etched on his pike’s tip ‘Gram’, continued plodding over the moss-covered rocks near a small creek. On either side of the gently babbling brook was a small leaf covered hill with a thin frost. The water was icy and Uuen winced as one paw slipped into it.<br>
<br>
“Bah.” Menith complained, “I miss my mott’s good vittles. Yesser, yesser I sure do.”<br>
<br>
Uuen nodded sadly. Gram snarled at them both, “You miss your mott’s bed is what you miss. We’ll have plenty vittles soon.”<br>
<br>
Eventually some drizzle started from overhead. Reaching well through the now naked tree’s thin hands and plopping bit by bit on their heads. Gram continued his mumbled grumbling while Uuen and Menith spoke of their wives at home amongst themselves. <br>
<br>
They spotted a cottage from through the gray and brown wet tree trunks.<br>
<br>
“Uuen, you’re quite the artist, can you tear over, fiddle the lock, and have a look and figure if the gaff’s got floorboards?” Gram asked looking over his rain soaked fur shoulder. Water was steadily dripping from the end of his nose and few cats have a fondness for water.<br>
<br>
Uuen complied and after rubbing the bridge of his nose with his furry thumb and adjusting wiping off the handle of his sword he sauntered over to the cottage. As he approached he heard a low little snoring sound.<br>
<br>
“Well, well, we’s second to claim it I surpose.”<br>
<br>
He peeked in through the bare window and ran his eyes over the occupants of the room. An old man was laying on a cot on the far side and three what looked to be Kefkan soldiers were sleeping in a huddle on the floor. They all had well worn sleeping bags and their swords were poking out from under makeshift straw and seed bag pillows. <br>
<br>
“Segots, segots. Well now though not much room for even my tail. No not a sliver of space for my pack. But they’re friendly. Yes, segots. Surposing they know of another nearby barrack for mine own lemmycuts?”<br>
<br>
Since paws are rather difficult to knock with Uuen gave a small shout through the window. “Mornin’ segs, mornin’!”<br>
<br>
Xvar bolted up dagger in hand looking over the Kerran with a confused look.<br>
<br>
“No slashing and clipping, segs, no, no. Just curious as to where my lemmycuts could find a roof.”<br>
<br>
“Lemmycuts?” Xvar repeated.<br>
<br>
“For a Kefkan you sure are dim and glassy. Lemmycuts, you know my companions of iron arms and dirt roads. Now about that roof segs you surpose you can give us some direct towards one?”<br>
<br>
By now both Jerra and Asunder had woken and were carefully moving their hands towards their weapons as well trying without success to understand what in the world the Kerran was saying.<br>
<br>
“Segs, eh now, calm your segs dim. No slash and clipping just a roof!”<br>
<br>
“Yes, no slash and clipping.” Xvar said looking over at Asunder and Jerra who moved their hands back to their laps.  Xvar moved to the window and pointed in the direction of the nearest village he knew. He leaned out to explain how to get there and the rains started to streak and smear his disguise.<br>
<br>
The Kerran watched with a mix of astonishment and horror. He mewled loudly out of fear pointing with a single extended claw. “Segs your cheeks and image are all dripping off!”<br>
<br>
Gram and Menith bounded out of the forest into the clearing and called to Uuen if he was in danger. “Wee lemmycut are they segs or gussiers?”<br>
<br>
Xvar tried to calm him. “Shh, shh, no slash and clipping. We’re segs, not gussiers, segs just giving you directions to a roof. I have fighting paint on it’s running that’s all. I’m an albino Kefkan, hush.”<br>
<br>
“Great cat whistling! An albino?” Uuen shouted back to his companions, “Purr lemmycuts, no troubles from the segs. They’ve given direct to a roof.”<br>
<br>
Gram narrowed his eyes still suspicious.  “If the roof has so much as a worm hole I’ll put out all my claws and give them a slash and clipping of the likes they’ve never seen.”<br>
<br>
Gram flashed his porcelain teeth at Xvar and shook his tail back and forth furiously swishing water through the air. His claws burrowed into the earth as he curled his toes from anger. “Still wagering on that direct, ‘segs’?”<br>
<br>
Xvar knew three Kerrans wasn’t an easy fight. He’d survived much worse but with Jerra and Asunder he couldn’t risk an injury it would take too much time. Xvar could take on several Kerran if they were all on him but they’d go for the weak first or kidnap one of them. Kerrans are remarkably more clever then given credit.<br>
<br>
“It’s in better shape than this cottage last I knew. That’s all I can tell you about the condition it’s been awhile.”<br>
<br>
Menith and Gram leered at Xvar then beckoned for Uuen to come over. Uuen looked over at Xvar then his companions and back again eventually jogging over to speak with his ‘lemmycuts’. <br>
<br>
The spoke in hushed tones for a few moments then looked back over.<br>
<br>
“You’ll lead us.” Gram said in a harsh no-nonsense tone.<br>
<br>
Xvar swore under his breath. They’d have to go miles out of their way to show the Kerrans to an inn or village. Jerra tugged on Xvar’s tunic from behind whispering, “Why don’t we just let them have this cottage and leave?”<br>
<br>
Xvar nodded and Jerra slipped back to pack her things. Asunder took the cue and followed Jerra’s lead.<br>
<br>
“Why don’t we save you the trip and you rest here? We should be moving on to our next camp anyway.”<br>
<br>
Menith was about to agree but Gram cut him off. “You lot aren’t going anywhere, something’s sketchy and is irking me about you segs.”<br>
The old man was now seriously annoyed by the whole situation. He pushed Xvar out of the way, flung the door open, and walked out onto the little bit of gravel in front of the door.<br>
<br>
“This is my cottage. Mine you understand? I’ll say who stays and who goes!”<br>
<br>
Gram, who was already on the edge of his senses, finally lost control and tackled the man giving him a large set of 5 parallel cuts on his chest from his left paw and several scrapes on his arms. <br>
<br>
Xvar leapt on Gram and hit him with a rock in the chest. Asunder and Jerra jumped behind him, weapons in hand, ready for a fight. Gram was lying on the ground gasping for air and struggling to loosen his cuirass. <br>
<br>
Menith and Uuen stood ready as well. Xvar ripped part of his linen undershirt to bandage the old man, pressing down on the wounds while trying not to crush the fragile friend. Jerra immediately started on a healing spell and was able to close the wounds but not free him from the stinging pain.<br>
<br>
He lay in the wet gravel writhing and shuddering. Asunder lifted him up and brought him back into the cottage lowering him gently onto the bed after kicking another sleeping bag on top of it.<br>
<br>
Menith and Uuen had dragged Gram several feet away in the mean time. Menith was kneeling by him watching Xvar while Uuen was undoing Gram’s cuirass. Once it was properly loosened Gram lay in the wet dead grass trying to regain his breath. Lucky for Gram Xvar hadn’t hit him hard enough to crack his solar plexus that would’ve killed him.<br>
<br>
Gram coughed up a little blood but not enough to suggest he was drowning from it. He panted for several minutes and then propped himself up on his elbows with some help from Uuen. Menith took a cursory look back and asked quickly if Gram was all right. Gram nodded but his face was contorted with pain and he was still gasping slightly.<br>
<br>
Jerra stepped in front of Xvar. She looked back at him for approval and he nodded gently.<br>
<br>
Mercy wasn’t the right word for Xvar’s decision since it was mostly out of self-interest that they not kill any Kerrans. The rain and long since ceased but clung in the air as a heavy sent of dew and wet wood and plants. He knew that for Jerra however, the decision was not out of strategy but out of the kindness of her heart.<br>
<br>
She carefully made her way over to them. Their ears swiveled back and their whiskers twitched with anger. <br>
<br>
She mumbled in a low tone the healing spell and little clear bubbles of mana emanated from her hands, which she tossed around in an odd shape then cast forward towards Gram. <br>
<br>
Gram stiffened for a moment then let out a comfortable breath.<br>
Xvar said slowly. “No slash and clipping.”<br>

Grimmers – Bandits/thieves/rogues<br>
<br>
“Aves, Naeus!” An exhausted voice called from further down a long flight of spiral stone stairs.<br>
Aves and Naeus turned around, Aves hesitated a second looking impatient to reach the top of the outer guard tower. The man crouched over himself, his hands on his knees, catching his breath. Interrupted by a few huffs and small gasps for breath he spoke.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Gram of Gralack’s hunting party is missing in the area of the road to Fliran.” The man let out a big breath, trying to calm himself. “They suspect a party of rogues intercepted him.”<br>
Aves looked indignant, “And how is this remotely important? I don’t care about some Kerran hunting party!”<br>
The messenger cowered slightly but continued. “A necromantic guild had claimed jurisdiction of the party and wants our help of capturing them. They are willing to pay quite a bit.”<br>
Naeus and Aves spoke almost at once, “A necromantic guild? What do they want with a small band of mugging grimmers?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The messenger looked frustrated. “Well, apparently sirs, you’ve greatly underestimated the power of the rogue band. No necromantic guild would get themselves in a huff over some bandits. They’ve stolen something or else are wanted for crimes.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aves furrowed his brow for a moment. “How much are they offering?” The messenger smiled slightly. “Let me put it this way, for a few days work you could buy yourself a coach set of horses.” Naeus looked rather indifferent but Aves grinned. “Tell them I’ll take the job. Summon my bribons and tell the stable man to saddle my horse. Care to join us for a romp, Naeus?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Naeus nodded. “I suppose.” The messenger asked if Naeus wanted his personal fighting band to be summoned as well but Naeus declined. “Aves has fine bribons. But do have my horse saddled and make sure to add an extra days rations just in case.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The messenger nodded and sprinted back down the cold stone stairs winding into darkness, as the sound of his feet grew lower until he disappeared.  Aves went to the top of the tower to inform his commander to find a replacement for his shift because he had a private commission. At first his superior was reluctant but after being promised a fine warm meal he couldn’t resist and waved Aves off.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once Aves and Naeus reached the ground they walked through to the stables then galloped out with half a dozen bribons armed to the teeth. Each man had a sturdy horse, dark green plate armor (sans a helmet which was hanging off the saddle), 4 days rations, and a short thick bastard sword encased in a winded leather scabbard strapped to their steed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aves looked on them with an air of personal satisfaction because of course it was him who had to pay for all of the armor, weapons, and horses. Before he had become a soldier he was the song of an honored duke in the Kefkan south country with 400 serfs and a great mansion. Although his title wasn’t nominal now he spent much less time in domestic matters as he did in finding trouble he could get himself into or what kind of bottle he could reach the bottom of.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Naeus on the other hand was withdrawn and always prudent. Also the son of a duke he had twice the fortune of Aves but half the spirit of adventure. Aves and Naeus had grown up together, fishing, fighting, and creating mischief on their father’s manors since they were old enough to walk. Generally balancing each other’s faults they were a reputable team and close to undefeated in battle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Naeus had been married twice already and wasn’t yet 25. His first marriage, planned even before he knew Aves, had failed when his young wife died in childbirth. The second ended when his wife caught the black blood, dying within only a few days and only a month since their marriage. Naeus never spoke of his wives or of the fact he had to conceive an heir to his position or else instability in the power structure might arise. Recently his entire life had been preoccupied with having fortune hunting beauties paraded around his halls while making vapid comments about the carpet or art on his walls. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aves had been married but his wife died under mysterious circumstances that were never quite solidified into a direct cause. Since then Aves had taken up dragon scale ale and bed-warming wenches from taverns. He boasted a 478 long list of his trophy stays in overnight inns and could down a mug of ale in one gulp. But it was suspected that what seemed to be a healthy young man’s appetite for normal pleasures was more a distraction than an indulgence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The bribons themselves were typically the top of their class at the academy but without noble title or birth right. Most were fighting to give their sons a chance to be real soldiers and rise up in the world. Being a bribon was the highest you could possibly rise if you didn’t have lineage and although the nobles looked at them as scum, the poor looked at them as noble heroes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While Aves and Naeus nonchalantly galloped over the cold cobblestones leading out of the city to the rugged and unkempt country roads leading to Fliran, the rogues they pursued were cooking a meal for some Kerrans. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uuen, Menith, and Gram were watching with apprehension as Asunder hummed while adding some herbs to a light stew. He had managed to build a fire despite how most wood was damp. A broken table from inside the cottage had been smashed into firewood over which a bubbling concoction of rabbit and potatoes was being stirred. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apprehension turned into anticipation as the heavy smell permeated the air already thick with the smell of rain and elicited the smallest bit of drool from Uuen’s tongue. His eyes watched anxiously as a wooden spoon slipped into the thick liquid mixing the sprinkled herbs in with the chunks of meat and vegetables.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jerra smiled at the now pacified animals. Throwing a knowing, amused look over to Xvar whom reciprocated with a small smirk. “Who needs a dagger when you’ve got a soup spoon?” She said to herself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uuen and Menith were fighting over who should have the biggest of the 7 polished wooden bowls when Gram smashed one of them and then instructed them to share a bowl. “That’s what you two bickering urchins get for being rude.” Jerra eventually managed to sneak Uuen a small pot that he could eat his soup in and the two embarrassed cats remained quiet until their meal was ready.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a proud smile Asunder took each bowl and served an equal amount of soup to each of them with a dull metal ladle. To him it brought back memories of sitting around a crowded campfire handing out bowl after bowl of soup to the tired Dakan troops in the revolution. Each man taking his soup and with bandaged, bleeding, or dry dusty hands trying to make his trembling from battle subside long enough to bring a cracked wooden spoon to his parched lips. Asunder rubbed his callous hands remembering the particular texture that the dust and blood made, which would flake off to show small cuts or blisters.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He remembered the texture acutely. It was like a thick grimy second skin stuck on him as if a physical coating of guilt, sorrow, and exhaustion. He was snapped from his reverie by a gentle tap of a paw on his shoulder. Uuen pushed his empty pot forward and Asunder smiled and emptied another ladle full of soup into the pot.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Xvar perked up momentarily and looked in the direction where the Kerrans had entered the clearing. Asunder and Jerra immediately looked that way as well. “At least half a dozen horses going about half full tilt. Not Kerrans.” “How do you know that?” Jerra asked quietly. “Kerrans don’t use horses.” Menith interjected.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Xvar hurriedly swallowed the rest of his soup and ran into the cottage. Tightening his frog straps as he came out he rested his hand on the pommel of his dagger and looked over at Asunder. Asunder nodded and poured a bucket of water on the fire and began quietly picking up his things.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He jogged over back to the cottage and put them down waving over Jerra and the others. As Jerra passed Xvar she stopped her and said, “Give me till nightfall. It’s getting close to sundown and they’re more likely to be setting up a camp. I want to see exactly who they are. Understand?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And if you don’t return?” Jerra inquired gently. Xvar didn’t look surprised. He answered calmly. “Then try and escape the Kerrans and make it to the road to Fliran. Asunder should remember the way there.” Jerra nodded and shut the door to the cottage behind her looking out the window to watch Xvar disappear into the line of trees on the edge of the forest.<br>

There will be whole new fight scenes and maybe even some new characters. <br>
So if you want to get the full scoop on Red Dove read it from the beginning.<br>
However, the site needs a good browser since it uses java and such. <br>
So for people with slow modems/crappy browsers you'll have to wait to see the new version until Elfwood gets their @#%$ together.<br>
