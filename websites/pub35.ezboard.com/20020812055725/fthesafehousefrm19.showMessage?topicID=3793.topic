Previously, the armor tables worked in such a manner that it was advantageous for melee characters to specialize only in crushing/blunt/hammer weapons. Now, the armor tables are spread out more evenly, giving all armor advantages and disadvantages against every weapon type. <br><br>In doing this change, we have also added armor types specifically for the Hibernian Scale and Reinforced armors. No longer do they mimic chain and studded armor tables as they used to - now they have their own unique characteristics. <br><br>Also, in RvR only, we have doubled the amount that a particular armor's bonus reduces damage against a weapon type that it is protected against. This will reduce the overall damage that players take when hit by a weapon or bolt spell that their armor protects against. <br><br>Plate Chain Scale Reinf Stud Leath Cloth <br>T High Vuln Low Low High High Neut <br>C Vuln Low High Vuln Vuln Low Neut <br>S Low High Vuln High Low Vuln Neut <br><br>Vuln = vulnerable <br>High = high resist, etc. <br>T = Thrust, C = Crush, S = Slash <br><br><br>Here's the user friendly version and how it applies to us:<br><br><br>Thrust bonuses/penalties:<br>-- Plate<br>++ Chain<br>- Scale<br>- Reinforced <br>-- Studded<br>-- Leather<br>-+ Cloth<br>(Piercing got hosed a bit)<br><br>Slash bonuses/penalties:<br>- Plate<br>-- Chain<br>++ Scale<br>-- Reinforced<br>- Studded<br>++ Leather<br>-+ Cloth<br>(Hibbie scale wearers [heroes/wardens/druids/champs] can get smacked around now by Infiltrators and Shadowblades.

You can try to make a case that a bladeshade is designed to take out Assassins, but their natural stat and class abilities will continue to be sub par to Inf/Sbs. What really hosed Bladeshades is that they only have a bonus against Leather. Slash Infiltrators and All Shadowblades also now have a 15% damage bonus against Scale in addition to Leather, increasing their slash targets in relation to vs Assassins only in blades. A Nightshade will never get the benefit that Inf/SBs get through Slash.<br><br>The blades situation affects all of Hibernia. Is it a problem for the tanks? No, they can be just as effective by specializing in Blunt which is starting to sound like the Hibernian thing to do, like Slash might be in the best interest of Midgard in some cases, works out for Shadowblades as well. Only problem for Nightshades? The weapon trend of the realm is not specializable, Nightshades cannot take up blunt. The best they can do us used unspecialized 2h staves.<br><br>I didn't think it was possible to nerf Nightshades without nerfing Infiltrators or Shadowblades too, but Mythic shows it can be done. If you ever want to counter Infiltrators or Shadowblades, boost up Nightshades. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 7/25/02 4:38:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrendelblackhammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brendel Blackhammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/02 6:27:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3793.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> NEW RESISTANCES</span><hr size=1> Everyone please look at my post above about the old resistances.
