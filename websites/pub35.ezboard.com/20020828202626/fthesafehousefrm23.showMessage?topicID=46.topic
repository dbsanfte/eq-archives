<br>
I took a thrust briton up to 13, then realized that was the totally wrong combo and did a thrust saracen. While the briton could hardly hit the ground if he fell on it, the saracen did a good job of not whiffing 3 out of 4 attempts. <br>
<br>
My thrust saracen is now lvl 41. Against casters and archers he does good. As long as i'm not fumbling for buttons and dropping my mountain dew I rarely have too much of a prob with a nightshade. Shadowblades take a chunk outta my behind and come back for seconds, which is why i'm looking long and hard at playing one on the new server. <br>
<br>
Left axe looks vicious. I have a lvl 6 SB and his first LA style does as much as my backstab does. Granted I'm poor and can't afford 3 weapons, so the backstab is possibly at 60%. <br>
<br>
It seems to me like LA and CS are two separate paths, and to try to spec in both early on will end up gimping you til lvl 45 or so when the skill points are really coming in. While one shotting mages without unstealthing is pure fun and sends me on giggling fits, I would be satisfied with being a nasty dual wielding norseman of death. It would prevent me from sneaking into an army to kill the hib taking a nap against the tree, but oh well. <br>
<br>
One shotting only seems to be feasible in the battlegrounds anyway. When I try sneaking into a group nowadays some stupid bard sees me and reacts much quicker than they did 10 levels ago. <br>
<br>
I'm thinking of a couple possabilities. The end result I'm looking for is to be able to assassinate, but be able to fight my way out of a corner much better than my infil currently can. <br>
<br>
Norse Shadowblade Lvl 40 <br>
<br>
#1 <br>
Stealth 30 <br>
Swords 28 <br>
Envenom 15 <br>
Left Axe 39 <br>
the dual wielding machine. No perf, but maybe with 2 weapons and poisons it won't matter much after 5 or 6 seconds. <br>
<br>
or... <br>
<br>
#2 <br>
Stealth 29 <br>
Swords 24 <br>
Envenom 22 <br>
Crit Strike 39 <br>
nice initial shot with that 2 hander. Envenerating for that occasional miss. No endurance left for fighting off the justice league. <br>
<br>
<br>
#3 <br>
stealth 30 <br>
Swords 26 <br>
Crit Strike 39 <br>
left axe 18 <br>
Still big on the CS. You can either do the super perf with your 2 hander, or Go in with 2 weapons. Or the first, and then switch to 2 weapons. <br>
<br>
#4 <br>
stealth 29 <br>
swords 24 <br>
CS 34 <br>
LA 29 <br>
<br>
still got the stun, and a little higher damage on your dual styles. <br>
<br>
#5 <br>
stealth 26 <br>
swords 21 <br>
CS 34 <br>
LA 34 <br>
<br>
this guy looks the best to me. Stealth and swords are a little low, but item bonuses could fix that. CS and LA both get their best styles. <br>
<br>
since I love infiltrators, I'm thinking of this guy. Keep in mind that I can wear that awesome +crit gear from midgard now. <br>
<br>
Saracen Infil Lvl 40 <br>
<br>
stealth 29 <br>
thrust 25 <br>
env 30 <br>
CS 39 <br>
<br>
not as likely to lay both poisons, but by lvl 41 i can have DW up to 20. <br>
<br>
I like the way the infil looks, but the last SB will be much more effective in a fight. Since the new server is going to be anarchy (I'm expecting darktide with better graphics) I want something that can fight back if I get pulled into a battle unwillingly. <br>
<br>
Thinking about it, axes would probably be better than swords<br>
<br>
Any thoughts? <br>
<br>
<br>
On an offnote, who is going to the server? Any thoughts on guilds?<br>

<br>
 Infiltraitor:<br>
 Most skill points of the 3 <br>
 Dual Wield / Thrusting styles suck<br>
 DPS on Thrust weapons kind of low<br>
<br>
 Suggested Spec:<br>
 50 Stealth<br>
 50 Crit<br>
 45 Envenom<br>
 15 Dual Weild<br>
 2 Thrust ( Just for a low level Style )<br>
<br>
 This would be a hard hitting 1 shot killer and scout<br>
<br>
 Shadowblade:<br>
 HIgher HP then other 2<br>
 Most Damage of the 3 assassins<br>
 Styles of Axe/Left Axe designed more for Zerkers<br>
 Range on Throw Weapons sucks<br>
<br>
 Suggested Spec:<br>
 50 Stealth<br>
 39 Crit<br>
 31 Envenom<br>
 29 Left Axe<br>
 21 Axe<br>
<br>
 This allows for a more combat oriented assassin, with the ability to still do the PA triple combo<br>
<br>
Nightshade:<br>
 Best DPS on 1 handed weapons ( Piercers)<br>
 Both Races are weak<br>
 Magic is a good benefit<br>
 Pierce styles OWN ... They are the only true &quot;Assassin&quot; ones<br>
<br>
 Suggested Specs: <br>
 50 Stealth<br>
 39 Crit<br>
 31 Envenom<br>
 29 Pierce<br>
 21 Celtic Dual<br>
<br>
 The Celtic dual and pierce styles lend for excellent uses after the initial PA combo, but the Hibby races lack str/con real bad so if you don't kill quick your dead<br>
<br>
<br>
Just my thought on the 3 assassin classes... I am leaning toward the Infiltraitor just because I think a intial attack with PA/High Envenom will be a terrible thing <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 2:32:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm I figure inf is better</span><hr size=1> What the???  50 stealth? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uletumbleed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>letum Bleed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 12:11:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://darkhand.lagmonster.com/avatar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the new pvp server</span><hr size=1> Tessie ... One quick comment on your Infiltrator stats ...<br>
<br>
I was told (by many people &amp; thru many articles by Mythic) that your chance to hit with Minimum/Maximum damage<br>
on your critical strike .. is directly related to TWO skills ..<br>
<br>
Minimum damage roll = thrust or slash skill<br>
Maximum damage roll = Critical Strike<br>
<br>
So by you only spec'ing 2 points into thrust ..<br>
you are gonna serverely GIMP your ability to One Shot Kill.<br>
<br>
Maybe Im wrong ... but That is what I have read everywhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
this is basically due to a large number of axes,giving you left axe skill,and faster axes,&lt;used in left hand&gt; that give you axe skill.<br>
<br>
this might potentially change,but its almost impossible to tell if it will,with spellcrafting,alchemy etc etc etc going in sometime in the future. theres a very good sword,in DF but its not worth investing 45 skill levels in sword,just because you Might get one.<br>
<br>
also,on this server as a rogue,your dps is more or less going to be king,theres no way a sb can raise all 5 skills at the same time,and remain even close to being effective.<br>
<br>
better off taking axe/left axe,envenom,and later on stealth. since you wont be using cs early in the game,you wont need max stealth.<br>
<br>
all that said,with a SB your stuck with a slash based damage ,vs an infil with thrust,and higher spec points,letting them remain effective longer.  given the makup of the server, having thrust,and higher spec points might be better in the long run.<br>
<br>
