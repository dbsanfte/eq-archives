That sucks. Big.<br>
Did he do his epic quest already? Does Renux always drop that thing? (i'm a monk, got no clue)<br>
Maybe make sure you get the one that will drop for him... set that in stone with officers and leader. Or, leave the guild.

I don't know if it drops everytime or not. <br>
<br>
The thing that upset me in the first place before any of this happened was that the day before he did his. I was online at the time and had gotten a port to GFay and was zoning to LFay to go to SteamFront where you do Renux, and he refused to wait for me to get there.. by the time I did get there it was over and people had left even...<br>
<br>
It did drop for him but he had a pally loot it or something I dont even know what heppened.. but for some reason he decided that he wanted one after all and took mine..<br>
<br>
So there really isnt anything to do as recourse.. I can get the one that drops for him.. I have also been in the Guild a lot longer (he just joined 2 weeks ago ) and I am 2 lvls higher, I have priority for my Epic anyway.. so..  <br>
<br>
It's just something I wanted to share with you all, here your thoughts and I appreciate your feedback thus far )<br>
<br>
I really like the guild but if I cant tust a member of the family ... then it isnt worth devoting my time and skills to.. *shrug* =/<br>
<br>
I'll have to just see what happens.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usquinkmcpoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squink McPoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/20/01 8:31:13 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue at his worst</span><hr size=1> It sounds like not only have you lost faith/trust in that particular person, the leaders of the guild are basically saying that that's okay for him to do to a fellow guildmate.  It's wrong to treat a fellow gamer/rogue like that (what he did to you) and it's even more wrong for your guild leadership to passively accept it as just fine.<br>
<br>
It appears they've shown what's more important to them.<br>
<br>
I vote leave also. <br>

Only one guy in my guild (former guild, rather) ever ninjalooted anything (he wasn't real bright... Paladin guy. Looted the Ashenbone Shield and that crappy Unrest dagger from the General then logged out. People weren't so much pissed as in @#%$ disbelief that this guy looted two items that not only could he not use but were also either worth jack @#%$ or nodrop. He was guildremoved next time he logged on. <p><h1 align="center"><font face="Tahoma" size="3"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48384">Jokah Saotome</font></a><br>

When I spoke to the guild leader, I asked him if he was aware of what had happened.. because he was not there.<br>
He said that he is aware and that  ( this person ) has a 'bad mark ' on his record or something.<br>
<br>
I really like the Guild and will give them the benefit of the doubt and see how things progress.. I was the only Rogue in the Guild for at least a Month before this other person joined.. and when this happened he was still a trial member.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you're right, maybe they have shown whats more important. Because he has a 60 Necro Alt .. he has friends and brought a 60 druid to the Guild also.. the Guild is all 50 + but very small and the 60 Druid is the only 60 we have so .. you see everyhting involved here..<br>
<br>
The other thing that bothers me about this is that since he has this higher alt, his equipment in most ways is superior to mine, where I am wearing Hate Woven Shadow armor, he has Dragon Armor ....  but if anything sketchy happens like that again, or if I feel that the Guilds priorities are not where they should, I have a justified reason to leave..<br>

<br>
This is a bit strange though, IMO.  I guess I have really lucked out with fellow rogues on my server and in my previous guild.  All have been great people, always willing to help each other.  Sometimes it seems that there is a certain comraderie among rogues that I don't see among other classes, and I think it's really cool.  I see some classes undermining each other to try to become more uber than the same their fellow classmates, but I have not seen that with rogues in general.  It's one of the things I love about this class.<br>
<br>
I am surprized that one rogue would do that to another.  I don't care what people say about the rogue epic being easy - it's your EPIC dammit - and you are entitled to all the benefits and drops that come with it.   <p><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=100716> <b> <i>Kalynn Taranis</a> - Blackguard </B></i>

He should be gone. I think your guild is being blinded by his 60 char. Prolly a class thats quite useful on raids? War or cleric maybe?<br>
<br>
Thats pretty weak, in my guild he'd have been gone, right then and there. Not saying my guild is superior in our morals, but I think ninjaing something from a guildmate is pretty common grounds for removal in any guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upergatortherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PergatorTheRogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/21/01 11:44:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue at his worst</span><hr size=1> <br>
<br>
The lvl 60 character he has isnt even on this server I don't think.. I believe he had friends on the server he transfered to and that's how he obtained soo much.. or because he's a Ninja.<br>
<br>
When he came to the guild he brought a friend, a lvl 60 Druid with him, not really useful IMO.. ..<br>
<br>
The guild I am in is reformed from an Exodus of sorts when it was a lower level guild .. I feel the reason he is not kicked out is because they are trying to rebuild and kicking someone out would not be productive towards that end..<br>
<br>
I am giving serious consideration to leaving after listening to your opinions and how things work in other guilds..<br>

If this guy was in his trial phase, he should have been gone as soon as the guild leader found out.<br>
<br>
I think they kept him because he brought that friend and because he's another 50+ rogue (insanely useful on raids).<br>
<br>
I would SERIOUSLY consider leaving this guild... it's a matter of principle... this is not right.<br>
<br>
I'm especially disappointed that it was another rogue, but lo and behold, he is just a necro playing a rogue alt... fugh I hate necros. <p><br><i>52, <b><font size=+3>ROGUE</b></font></i>
