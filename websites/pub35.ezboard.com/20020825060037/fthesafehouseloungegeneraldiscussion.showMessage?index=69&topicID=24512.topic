That should be obvious to all the folks coming to help out.  But, that's not the scenerio that was initially brought up in this thread.  The wizard in question was camping Lodizal because they wanted a high-plat sellable item to fund what they wanted.  In that situation, it's foolish and selfish for the wizard to camp him with the expectation that their guild will allow them a &quot;finder's fee&quot; of first choice of loot, especially when someone in the guild could benefit immediately from the item.  Remember, the important context here is *guild* -- this is not a random grouping or pick-up raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udarusgray.showPublicProfile?language=EN>darus gray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 3:41:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24512.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> How would a melee neccessarily benifit more?</span><hr size=1> Everyone keeps saying the melee would benefit from the drops while the wizard is just too greedy to want to sell it?

How is it selfish to assume your guild would reward you for waiting for Lodi to pop? Helping your guild should be an important priority, but shouldn't the guild also be looking out for the wizard in question as well?

As a player that has camped several spawns like Lodizal, I can say that it is a serious sacrifice.  Any player that undertakes that effort should have the first pick of the loot with the rest awarded/rolled on in the usual manner.  At the very least the player who camps Lodi should be guaranteed one item even if not one of their chosing.  If a ranger, tank, shaman, or anyone else in the guild wants a lodi shield, then they can camp Lodizal the same way the wizard in this example did.<br>
<br>
For the record, Lodizal has not appeared during times that I have camped him.  However, as an officer in my guild, I have allowed the person camping Lodi his choice of the drops when we come to take out Lodi.  The rest has been assigned/rolled on in the normal way for our guild.  This system works well and helps to ensure that we almost always have someone interested in Lodizal to be camping it.  There is no shortage of Lodi shields in my guild. <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5309"target="_blank"alt = "Korak's Megalo Profile"><FONT SIZE="2"><b>Korak Sarathai - 59 Barbarian Myrmidon - The Hand</b></FONT><BR></a><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12530"target="_blank"alt = "Dumesh's Megalo Profile"><FONT SIZE="2"><b>Dumesh Uhl'Belk - Retired Troll Reaver - The Hand</b></FONT><BR></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugladoitor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladoitor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 1:48:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24512.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Gladoitor/thumbnails/Sig+pic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How would a melee neccessarily benifit more?</span><hr size=1> Lodizal dont drop any of the spells listed.<br>

(Around $200-400 sticks in my head for some reason)<br>
<br>
THAT is the main reason that NBG is a good thing in a guild situation, if someone gets something of value you see them on raids using the item, you know that the person isn't just using the guild to fill their RL bank account.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when items are given to guildees for the express interest of selling them, there is NO accountability and they can easily explain reasons around why it disappeared with little guild improving stuiff replacing it(&quot;Oh, I was drunk that night and sold it for 2k according to my log&quot;).<br>
<br>
If you want to sell an item for the express interest of improving your own equipment on a guild raid, bring up the idea to an officer - tell them what you would plan to get with the cash from the sale, and let them handle the sale of the cash item and the purchase of the new item. Especially with the new bazaar functions, there is no excuse for them to be unwilling to fundraise the plat with extra items - and you as the one who wants the item being saved for can check the bazaar occasionally for one to show up for them to buy for you.<br>
<br>
If your guild doesn't use a guildbank for coffins, peridots, spells, epic items, resist jewelry, etc. you do not want to be raiding with the guild - every class finds itself short of cash for something that would help it alot at some point in time, and that is what a family helps with in RL(and guess what the closest equivalent in EQ should be...) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 10:08:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24512.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Quote:<br>

<br>
I'll take that as an insult.  And in the spirit of having recieved an insult, just imagine my retort please, because I do not want to be banned from this awsome forum for expressing it in text.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as me getting involved - I didn't &quot;get involved.&quot;  She just told me what happened and I thought it was BS myself, and so I asked for opinions on this subject.  I guess I could have said it happened to me, but it didn't.<br>
<br>
I appreciate all the opinions I have recieved except yours.  And I even somewhat agree with some aspects of certain viewpoints that have been expressed against my initial take on this subject.  <br>

LOOK at what you said &quot;she was one of the FEW to wait forhim to pop&quot; she didnt help at all besides killing it (they could have probably killed it without her help) she deserves a roll on a wizard spell if it drops against other wizards, sure, but she doesnt deserve an item that can go to the class that will USE the item that dropped. just my 2cp <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukilaara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilaara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 5:53:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24512.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f49.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Hm I think you have to do a look at some terms.<br>
<br>
When you camp something .. that means you have the force on board to kill it. When you then kill it it goes to the campers.<br>
When you look at something you do not have the force for it. You call the force. It will go to the force.<br>
<br>
In the guild in which I have the pleasure to be .. we do it real simple.<br>
<br>
We have several ppl that have trackers .. lookers .. on their accounts and these ppls log them in from time to time to have a look for some mobs. ( you know the mage for sevi ..... )<br>
<br>
So when one of these has success he/she alarmed the guild and .. in time or not. <br>
<br>
We make Class spez. loot out of some lists all member can have a look at, so all can see which spez class will have the first try for that part depending on points between the member of the classes.<br>
<br>
So a Lodi shield will always find a shaman/druid ... User.<br>
<br>
When all user (which are on that raid) do not want that Item it depends on that item  if it will be banked or given for twink ... .<br>

Lodizal dont drop any of the spells listed.<br>

If you want spells go spend a day in juggs. You will get all the spells you need and them some.<br>

<br>
Hmm, you missed a smiley face on that one.  Either that or you have never killed any Juggs before.  Sure, we can get spells...about 30 copies of those spells that maybe sell for 200pp in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
There are shamans that have logged /days played in Juggs killing more than they care to admit to not see any of these spells ever fall off of them.  If you really want to get them then kill Kunark dragons...if you can beat out team MB.  They kill the mean old dragon and put the spell up for sale.  Now I am looking at 60k for Malo, but then again I could get it in a day of camping Juggs...../roll<br>
<br>
So, casters need cash for these high end spells.  We need to get big cash from big things, and Lodi is one example.  Once again, what is better for your raid: one tank with a Lodi shield or the ability to cast Malo? <p>Torelorm<br>
