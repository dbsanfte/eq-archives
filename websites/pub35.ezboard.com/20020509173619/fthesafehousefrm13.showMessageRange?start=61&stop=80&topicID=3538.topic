Why?  The steps are supposed to get incrementally harder.  In step 2, we had to kill a single guard that could be solo'd by my 60 rogue.  It doesn't make sense that the next step would have you killing _4_ red-to-60 mobs in a dangerous area.<br>
<br>
Plus, the guys who gives you the report satchel (forget his name at the moment, am at home for the holidays and don't have my notes) says &quot;I do not know who will have these reports&quot;.  If the head guy in each Consillium was the one who had them, I'm guessing the spies from Katta would have been able to figure that out (I mean, who would your first choice be?).<br>
<br>
My best guess is that the trick here will be to find the right people and say the right things to them, possibly doing 4 mini-quests (bring me x and y and z and w, then you can have the report).<br>
<br>
But by all means, if you want to try and kill the Praesertums, go right ahead. =)<br>

I am also of the opinion that killing the 4 Praesertums is not the solution, certainly not at this stage of the quest; perhaps later.... maybe. Now? I'd be very surprised.<br>
<br>
Here is some additional information I gathered, maybe some of it will strike a nerve with someone, I am at the point I am ready to try anything, last resort being to kill npcs there in case faction is a variable for this step.<br>
<br>
Forageable in Sanctus is a Tarnished Ancient Coin, identitfied as a Tarnished Ancient Coin,  I gave this to Vantorus, he ate it, said he would pass it on to his superiors.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I thought what about that 3rd unnamed spy in step 2?  He was never named, maybe he has additional information that would give us a lead for step 3.  So, I went and got another replacement record, cast identify on it and it stated the same Replacement Records.  Then I turned them into the file cabinet again, killed the guard, and cast Identify on the Original Records.  Disappointed, they ID'd simply as Original Records.  Dead end on that idea.<br>
<br>
Next, I went around drilling the 4 named Praesertums.  Something I noticed is a couple here and there don't care for the others.  In fact, there are even hints of doing away with the other Praesertums.  So is there a way to pit them against each other? Maybe some sub-quests of some sort that are along that line of thinking.  Here is the dialogue from the Praesertums about what they think of each other as well as if they had a unique response about seru or katta, no one put it in text yet here, it might be helpful to see it together in one place:<br>

[Mon Dec 24 23:19:04 2001] You say, 'Hail, Praesertum Vantorus'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:19:04 2001] Praesertum Vantorus says 'You are a brave one, are you not? Few dare to disturb a Praesertum in his chambers, and fewer still dare to disturb me. Ha! I like that. What is it you seek? I promise nothing, but you earned some small portion of my time to listen to you. I also warn you, any treachery will meet a swift and final end. Of this have no doubt. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:20:16 2001] You say, 'Who is seru'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:20:17 2001] Praesertum Vantorus says 'Seru is a brilliant leader. I truly feel that he could run the city without the Praesertum, such are his talents. He is a greater warrior than I will ever hope to be, and I consider myself very talented indeed. I am sure the other Praesertum will agree that he is equally competent in their fields. Seru is the reason the Combine was as powerful as it was, and were it not for treachery most foul, from a source Seru could never suspect, I believe that the Combine would still exist on Norrath today. That treachery, and the destruction of a great and noble dream made reality, is the reason we are here now. The Combine will again return to glory, once our task here is done. Seru will lead us to victory and greatness, make no mistake about it! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:22:37 2001] You say, 'Who is Bikun'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:22:37 2001] Praesertum Vantorus says 'Praesertum Bikun is in charge of Commerce and Industry, or the Shoulders of Seru as it is commonly known. An able man, he does more than a fair job in keeping the city supplied. He as always provided what I asked for in regards to the Hand, and he is quite the entertaining character. If he has any flaws, it is that he tends to do things to excess. He seems to feel that if it is not large, it is not worth his time. This applies to his drinking, his eating, and even his wenching. He is honest about his appetites, and I think that in a strange way, it is good for morale. Work hard, play hard, work well, live well, is his motto. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:23:37 2001] You say, 'Who is Rhugol'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:23:38 2001] Praesertum Vantorus says 'Ah, yes, Rhugol. A necessary evil, so to speak. He and his provide a valuable service to the city. Though I must confess, I despise his methods, and resent his constant interference in my domain. He knows this, and sometimes I feel he takes great delight in inflicting himself upon me and mine. This is a petty thing, but I make it a point of thwarting him where I can, in matters I feel he has no business in. Nothing that risks the security of the city, mind you, for that I would never do. I simply feel that he needs to be kept in check, much like a dog needs a leash, or a good smack on the snout. But I warn you, it is the rare person indeed that is able to cross Rhugol more than once. Do not underestimate him, for he is truly a dangerous man. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:24:18 2001] You say, 'Who is Matpa'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:24:18 2001] Praesertum Vantorus says 'If Rhugol is a spider, Matpa is an ant. Nothing gets done in the city without his involvement. His offices are in charge of almost all aspects of city administration. Anger him or one of his legion of bureaucrats, and you can find yourself without pay, without housing, or assigned to the worst duties a citizen can imagine. Matpa is a petty, vindictive man, but despite that, the Heart functions well under his leadership. I would lief not have to deal with his offices on every little matter, but such is the will of Seru. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:25:08 2001] You say, 'Who is katta'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:25:08 2001] Praesertum Vantorus says 'The city or the Betrayer? No matter, both are foul and corrupt. Katta was the leader of the Combine, at first revered as a wise and just Imperator. He was revered because Seru, loyal to the extreme, made it so. Katta had nothing more than a fair countenance, a melodious voice, and charm. That would not have been enough to forge an empire, but with the aid of Seru, it was more than enough. But the power was too much for Katta to handle. It corrupted him. He began entering into pacts with the very forces the Combine was created to defeat, making whimsical decisions, and exhibiting signs of madness. Seru had been cautioning Katta that he was going astray, but Katta refused to listen. Seru did what he could to keep the Empire strong, as a counter to Katta's worsening influence. <br>

[Mon Dec 24 23:35:25 2001] You say, 'Who is matpa'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:35:25 2001] Praesertum Bikun says 'Arrgh! Life is too short to have to deal with petty men like him. He and his entrie cadre are quill pushing, parchment shuffling, feet dragging clods! Sometimes, I wonder how ANYTHING gets done in this city with him having so much control of things. I know it would be a far better place to live without him. But that will not change anytime soon. <br>

[Mon Dec 24 23:36:56 2001] You say, 'who is rhugol'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:36:57 2001] Praesertum Bikun says 'Oh, what a terrible bore he is! No taste, no appreciation for the finer things in life, and no tolerance for anybody who does. He has his people watch me constantly, but I do not mind. Nothing I do is secret, nor does it need to be secret. I work hard, my people work hard, and I like to reward hard work with a good life. Nothing wrong with that, is there? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
No reponse at all about Vantorus.<br>
Bikun is the only Consillium leader to give a generic response to Who/What is Seru as well.<br>

[Mon Dec 24 23:41:31 2001] You say, 'Hail, Praesertum Rhugol'<br>

[Mon Dec 24 23:41:31 2001] Praesertum Rhugol says 'Greetings, Xephrena. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:41:39 2001] You say, 'who is seru'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:41:40 2001] Praesertum Rhugol says 'My lord and master, the only being that I truly fear and respect, in every aspect. Only the ignorant and foolish dare oppose him. Are you ignorant Xephrena? If so, let me help you correct that condition. Do not cross Seru. Do not cross those that labor for Seru. I am somebody you do not want on your back. Vantorus is a bad person to have on your back. Matpa is a bad person to have on your back. Even Bikun is a bad person to have on your back. Collectively, we pale in comparison to Seru. Do not travel down that road. In small words, in case you are both ignorant AND stupid. Seru strong. Seru wise. No make Seru mad. Seru hurt you. Seru hurt you bad. Now that I have told you this, you are no longer ignorant. If you then choose to cross Seru, you are simply a fool. We do not long suffer fool<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:42:38 2001] You say, 'who is matpa'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:42:39 2001] Praesertum Rhugol says 'Ha! A fine example of Gnomish industry, Matpa is. He manages the Heart to perfection, and cooperates well with me. As it should be. This man wastes nothing, be it a piece of parchment or a worker, he uses everything to its fullest extent, and uses it well. If he has any fault, it is that he has a long memory. Cross Matpa, and you may think you have gotten away with something. But weeks, months, years, or even decades later, you find that Matpa has not forgotten, and has, in some way, made your life worse. Oftentimes, MUCH worse! Ha! I appreciate that sort of patience, though I am more fond of immediate action, and looking you in the eyes when I enact my revenge. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:43:26 2001] You say, 'who is vantorus'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:43:26 2001] Praesertum Rhugol says 'Vantorus is the Praesertum of the Hand. An able warrior, and competent general, he serves Seru well. But he makes the mistake of thinking he is outside my reach. The Eye watches everything and everyone, especially those in posistions of power. Most especially those with power AND control of an army. Ha. One day, Vantorus will push his luck too far, and I will be forced to make a change in the Hand. He already coddles his men. They are more loyal to him than they are to Seru, and that presents a problem, as you can well imagine. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:43:55 2001] You say, 'who is bikun'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:43:55 2001] Praesertum Rhugol says 'An overfed, slovenly pig, that is who Bikun is! Were it not for the man's obvious talents as a con artist and racketeer, which serves him well in his position as head of Commerce and Industry, I would have dealt with him years ago. Why Seru tolerates his excess is beyond me. And what is worse, Bikun actually ENCOURAGES his subordinates to exhibit the same behavior. He says it is good for morale. I say it is good for his conscience. If everyone is a pig, he does not look so bad. I am still not sure what will happen first. His heart exploding from overwork, or his heart exploding when I thrust a spear into it. Time will tell, I suppose. Ha. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:44:38 2001] You say, 'who is katta'<br>
<br>
[Mon Dec 24 23:44:39 2001] Praesertum Rhugol says 'Katta is the name of perhaps the greatest fool of all. This man was gifted with power and influence far beyond the imagining of most mortals. Yet he squandered that gift, betraying the very person who gave it to him. Seru made Katta what he was, for Seru had the same dream as Katta. Katta, in his hubris, thought he was above needing Seru, and worse, saw Seru as a threat. Seru was NEVER a threat to Katta, until Katta took steps to make him so. This foolishness shattered the Combine. Seru had no choice to but to oppose Katta in the end, in hopes of salvaging the Combine, and its noble purpose. To this end, he could not allow Katta to escape, for as long as Katta was at large, the Combine could not be healed. This led us to Luclin, as you are no doubt aware. Such a tragedy, but i<br>

One of the fiercest warriors the worlds have ever known, Halasmen envy him. In matters of espionage, even the Tier'dal could take lessons from him .

Well, no wasted material resources that is. There is no shortage of warm bodies willing to do work for him, so when one is lost, it is of no great importance. <br>

No other keywords associated int heir greetings to me provoked any response, much like everyone else.<br>

There was a gnome a gnome "Praesertum Functionary" in the courtyard holding a book, hailed no response.  I think someone else mentioned him earlier, he is dark blue to 60, and red to 45 /shrug...  thought about killing him to see what the book is, but not KoS there as of yet, so leaving that as a last resort.  Has anyone killed this mob by chance?<br>
<br>
Anyone have any more crazy ideas to try?<br>

Another note that probably means nothing: I was talking with my girlfriend today, and she told me she logged me in one time I had camped in SS.  Apparently of the NPCs said something about &quot;aah, my eyes, my hand, my shoulder...&quot; without her talking to them.  She did not remember what NPC said this, but I had camped near the doorway between the outer area and the inner area with the Consilliums.  I spent about 20 minutes there hoping to catch an NPC saying that, but it was to no avail.<br>

Ive gone back and tried talking to bregun and Torsten about what it was Bregun had found out.  no luck.<br>

Tried talking more with Euzan.  no luck.<br>

Tried all 4 Praesertums with no luck. (other than the odd note that none will talk about the shoulder sect.  and none of the citizens of the city will either)<br>
<br>
Even pick pocketed every blue con mob i could find to see if one had something.  nothing.<br>
<br>
Only 2 options left i can think of myself.<br>
1.  slaughter every killable mob in the concillium and see if one drops a report.<br>
2.  go back to Katta and try drilling Tibok for more information.<br>
<br>
<br>
What is it we are all missing?  This part of the quest gives like no information whatsoever on how to accomplish what you are to do.<br>

I might be inclined to say false lead.   By all means, correct me if i am wrong.<br>
<br>
A few of my guild friends where killing several ncps near the statue/pool area and pulling some out of the consillium courtyard as well, nada at this point.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Additional thoughts.  If Katta was going to place spys in Seru, I would think they would attempt to place one in a position of power.  So far the known npcs we have encountered aren't really to my knowledge in a power-position.  What about the praesertums?  My first guess would be Praesertum Bikun.  There seems to be a bit of hostility towards him from Matpa and Rhugol, although Vantorus doesn't seem to care one way or another.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, some observations that set Bikun apart from the others<br>
<br>
 - The other 3 praesertums have a unique, very loyal and exuberrant response to "Who is Seru", however Praesertum Bikun gives the generic_random_Mob_01 response to "Who is Seru".<br>
<br>
- Bikun quite ovbiously is intended to accept some sort of quest item, this is why.  Go to the other praesertums, and hand them an item you can lose... their response is blah blah blah I will pass this on to my superiors and they eat it.  Go hand any type of item to Bikun, and you get I have no need for this item, you can have it back.   So I tried handing him the replace records, original records and even my etched earring of veracity, and a dawnshroud cider (since his appetite was mentioned) he handed them all back to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally, what about the bars?  There are four bars, with respective symbols on the entrance in town: heart, eye, shoulder and hand.  I spent some time in the shoulder bar, questioning patrons and bartenders to no avail, although the spawns aren't always the same.  Maybe a certain npc will give information that I haven't seen yet.<br>
<br>
Those are my random ramblings for the day :)  I guess I will pursue Bikun a bit more, unless some genius has a better idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kailynnquel>Kailynn Quel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/26/01 2:36:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3538.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> <br>
I also wondered about Bikun as well and tried giving him the cider to no avail.  Didnt feel like risking my earring at the time tho and looks like i wont have to :P<br>
<br>
Ive wondered about the bars, as well as possible timed mobs in the consilliums?  Something like a courier spawns at a set time in the praesertum rooms and walks out or something i dont know.<br>
<br>
Bikun seems like a possible option at first but then he may just be for a seperate quest.  Dunno.<br>
<br>
Tried drilling more info from Tibok and doesnt seem to repond to anything else.  <br>
<br>
In the eye of trust quest they talk about a traitor who you trade out coins in his pockter and some other antics.  starts with a C.  Can find on the eye of trust quest thread.  That could be the third person they talk about but i found him and he wouldnt respond to any key words either.<br>
