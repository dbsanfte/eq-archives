<br>
When our shout was implimented how did this hurt &quot;blades&quot;?  The Blades were given the offset HP as well, I'd think our shout and your hp was damn near equal /wink  After all our shout hits for what, 60? you got what? 60 HP?  Heh.<br>
<br>
We both got 2.2, so no issue there.<br>
<br>
Armour resists getting set to negative slash.  Well this effects 2 of the 3, &quot;blades&quot; and &quot;infs&quot;, most definately moreso Blades as this is thier only option.  I for one don't agree with that. I also believe I have made it perfectly clear that in my opinion, blades need the option to spec crush or thrust with thrust weapons being added to Midgard.  Why wouldn't the melee realm have all three variants of weaponry?  I really don't think this patch needs to be added.  However, like I said, that is just my opinion and I am looking at it from an &quot;Assassin&quot; point of view.  Not a Realm Wide point of view.  I'm sure it helps the &quot;tanks&quot;.  Not sure how, but I'm sure it does.  /wink.<br>
<br>
I think that compared to Viper and Vanish, Shadow Run is just laughable.  Maybe a boost in the RA department could help?<br>
Well I also think Viper is too expensive, but I know that Blades would trade their eyeteeth for viper over shadowrun.  That's a case of me seeing the glass half empty, blades seeing it as half full and Inf's hitting the &quot;vanish&quot; button /wink.<br>
<br>
Elaa has been a very outspoken voice to the Rogue community.  The comments that he(she) has made in the course of the existence of DAoC have helped more than hindered the entire rogue community, not just Nightshades.<br>
I think that the Shadowblade community need someone LIKE Elaa to step up to the plate and follow in the footsteps he(she) has forged for his(her) class.<br>
<br>
I am for the community that we had in EQ, however, reality dictates like Bile stated I suppose.  Oh well, a Rogue can dream eh?<br>
<br>
Oh and as I see it, right now it's Inf&gt;NS/SB.<br>
<br>
Not to say Infiltrator's need a nerf in anyway.  Just giving my thoughts on the balance issue.  I find my SB fights more equal now than ever before.  Of course there is always that buff'd vs unbuff'd, but we will always have those running around.<br>

Not to be combative here, follow me for a few moments.&quot;<br>
<br>
The previous boosts to NS didn't really hurt SB's, but this patch with the armor resists will hurt SB's in Assassin vs. Assassin RvR tremendously. Couple the Armor Resists with NS getting a str/con buff ( which is being asked for, hasnt been granted yet) and SB's will be worse and worse.<br>
<br>
With the old leather resist set up it was fine. SB's had no option to spec anything but slash so we always had a plus damage to NS/Inf. Inf/NS had an option, spec slash and have the SAME bonus to other Assassins that SB's have or spec thrust/pierce and  be worse versus SB's but have a nice bonus versus tanks and healing classes in Midgard and as an added deal for NS have a nice plus to Clerics, Mercs and Minstrels.  This is a very important thing, to me anyway. Infil and NS always had the option to be equal to SB's but the bulk to the route of wanting a bonus to tanks and healing classes.<br>
<br>
Now, no matter what SB's do we are worse versus Infiltrators and much worse versus NS.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think that compared to Viper and Vanish, Shadow Run is just laughable&quot;<br>
<br>
And many classes, including many NS and Inf, said this was fair because SB got more HP, a 2 handed weapon, and Left Ax.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and as I see it, right now it's Inf&gt;NS/SB&quot;<br>
<br>
Right now I agree. After the patch is Inf&gt;NS&gt;SB.<br>

<br>
No, I think that the Inf's will still give you the most problems.<br>
That's just my opinion though.  The armour resists are going to hurt, but how much, only time will tell when it gets to the real battlefield.  Afterall, it's not even live yet.<br>
<br>
As for the 33 Infiltrator that just gave us his battleground view of the world?

<br>
It's gotten so bad that the Nightshades and shadowblades are starting to argue over who sucks more.  It's no longer about bringing everyone up to the same level..it's now about being the worst of the three assassins<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I dunno the answer but I am going to say that both sbs and nightshades need the love and infs and nightshades got the love this patch.  So sbs are feelin a bit out of it.<br>
<br>
In any case, I am looking forward to the tests someone from pend said they would run<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Braack can you run some as well perhaps?<br>

<br>
that leads it s a matter of luck on evades and the time to place the DB/harmstring/leaper/rib combo.<br>
if u place just a single combo, u take the edge and have a really good chance to win.<br>
<br>
post 1.52, NS should have a really good chance to own SB, since slash ll be resisted and SB r neutral(i think on pierce), i feel sorry for the critblades but i won t cry a river on the SZ, DF should overcome that easely.<br>
<br>
good players can sometimes win despite they don t have the advantage, it s a matter of luck and a matter on how well they know their classes.<br>
i just wish we had some more usefull spells.<br>
