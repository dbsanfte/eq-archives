I know everyone has a great story to tell (there's always one).<br>
<br>
~Edit Note~  Would probably help if I put my own in.-Sterk<br>
<br>
I zone from Kithicor to WC and automatically check the zone--was pretty sure I was bound in HPH but you'll see in a second...South Qeynos--I see Asliel, Linyll, 3 other yahoos and Raivin. From a much earlier conversation I remember Asliel telling me he's out hunting Raivin tonight so I shout to the zone, &quot;Raivin? Hello my pretty...&quot;<br>
<br>
I poison up and figure she's far away and stuck running or in melee....as I near the Dervish Camp I get a tell from Asliel, &quot;I have no idea where she is, she gates somewhere in here...&quot;--the rest is garbled mush as I'm distracted by the sounds of casting to my left. Rooted.<br>
<br>
In my rush to charge across zone I've forgotten that I'm not wearing MR gear. None at all. Oh @#%$...<br>
<br>
I throw shurikens like a mad man and finally break free to charge in and -boom- Raivin's blinded. I start to feel better about the situation. Hack and slash, Backstab, Disarm (never FRICKIN' WORKS), lather, rinse, repeat. I'm rooted again and Raivin, dear Raivin, is smart enough to stand just far enough away to be in range but not hittable...she meds. I dream of pre-nerfed pumice and re-poison. (Denied).<br>
<br>
I'm blasted and manage to get a message to Asliel as to where I am...I believe I yelled, &quot;Camp!&quot; as in &quot;Come to the Camp&quot; but Asliel's reply told me he wasn't thinking along my lines....&quot;Yeah, I should camp.&quot;<br>
<br>
ARGH! &quot;No, come to Druid Circle--Derv Camp!&quot; Here comes the swift-footed cavalry as I watch my life bar dwindle...finally I break free and figure, screw it-CHARGE! Raivin takes many blows and she's getting interrupted--can only wonder as to the state of her mana at this point and I haven't even watched her life bar at all.<br>
<br>
So I con her--red. Red to 37...max 45. Tunare save me. Asliel and Linyll arrive and finally Raivin is on the severe defense...but not taking her eye off me.<br>
<br>
And I die...but what do I see? You have been slain by A Dervish Cutthroat. You are returning to Level 36.<br>
<br>
Sonuva...but it gets worse. When the Gods see fit to return me after a brief tongue-lashing in Limbo...I'm in a bank. The South Qeynos Bank. I cried from laughing--no problem following the One-Hour rule here.<br>
Raivin rez's me out of Good Sportsmanship (Still 36 though) and I come back to WC to find Asliel, Linyll and Raivin all in mid-discussion. Strangest meeting I've ever been a part of. Appears the fight ended as soon as my exp death occurred.<br>
<br>
I offer Raivin the contents of my pockets (who destroys money anymore?) and she politely declines--must think I'm crazy for even doing so. I relax and, smartly, put the MR gear on for the rest of my trip. Raivin and I will continue at a later time...I am told I had her down half and near oom (per Asliel, I wouldn't know unless Raivin actually replies here).<br>

Well there was this one time in South Karana I think it was, this caster I chanced upon had suddenly wasn't so interested in fighting once I got a lucky proc off from my SBD.  It seems the lass wanted to give me some money, so there I be merrily wacking her and lo and behold she hits trade too, and then promptly collapses a few seconds thereafter to my blades still cutting into her.  <br>
<br>
Oh another good one comes to mind now, it seems that a certain dark elf wizard had alot of opinions on other classes in PvP.  While running along I blundered into the fellow, obviously badly injured from some fight with a mob.  How could I resist inquiring in OOC about his thoughts on rogues? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It was with great amusement that I then proceeded to creep up on him while he meditated and proclaimed 'We do not suck!' while backstabing him to death in response to his rambles on the shortfalls of rogues in PvP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hah I'm getting warmed up now, but now thoughts turn to my own foolishness.  Narrowly escaping death, I sit down to hide in the Oasis lake and bind my wounds.  All is well, I have evaded the pursuit and I shall rise to fight again soon.  Suddenly... I'm drowning, what the?  my fishbone earing?  arg... that wasn't my fishbone I equipped. <br>

Everyone is gathering around him of course, "May I inspect you" etc etc and he keeps telling people NO.<br>

So my cousin, the impudent guy he is (haha) strides right between everyone right up to the guy and inspects.<br>

I have never in my life seen someone get mobbed so badly. A unanimous dozen or some people "Soandso begins to cast a spell." and all the melees attack immediately. Heck I think I even jumped in, I mean, 20pp was quite a load of cash back then ;)<br>

I saw them fighting someone so I decided to try to let him escape and hope I could escape as well.   I layed into the mage because he didnt have a pet up with pillages and mezzes and @#%$.  They figured out they were under attack real fast and started attacking me i dont know but i think the poor guy got away.  Then I tried casting on the others but I didnt have any effect and I know I mezzed the mage and it turns out he was the only one in range so I was killing him and the other 2 were doing their best to keep him alive.  The shaman chain healed him and the wiz kept hitting him with her stick when i mezzed.  I found out mez wasnt the way to go real fast so mid fight i memmed root instead and kept blinding and rooting him.  I got him down to no hp with the shaman oom and the wiz got the evac off right when my DD was about to hit, 1 to 2 seconds left on cast time.<br>
<br>
The other time was the same day there was a group of 1 pal and 2 wiz I was fighting who were on the bridge to iceclad on the east wastes side and I kept running into range and dispelling and stuff then jumping off the bridge trying to get them to follow me in.  None of them were ever that stupid because they knew what dazzle+no air does to a player.
