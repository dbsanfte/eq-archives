 ATTENTION: In game poison testing has started. <br>
Ahmed, a really cool Saracen Infiltrator, joined me in the cold waste lands of Odin's Gate a couple days ago. Though we are mortal enemies, we came together with a common goal, to figure out what our mystery poisons actually do to other beings. I myself have a 25 spec in poison and I am going all the way to 50 with it. Ahmed, he has a much lower spec in envenom, but, being the lab rat of our pair, he exclaimed often that he wished he had more spec in envenom. I felt terrible slashing him repeatedly while he stood there. Many times he evaded, I know it was just a the jitters from how bad my lil blade hurts, but he he stuck it through. The real irony of our meeting was when Demnos showed up at the end, a very quarky Hibernian Nightshade niether of us had invited. Ill tell you of Demnos' appearance at the end of this post. On to the results! <br>
<br>
We tested each poison at least twice, some 3 or 4 times. On each poison, an icon appeared on the victims screen. When right cliking this icon, you can see what poison is active in your bloodstream at that time. We tested all poisons availabe to a 25 envenom skill. <br>
<br>
Lets start with our snare poisons: <br>
Minor Imbalance duration 35 second - no real valuable slow down <br>
Lesser Imbalance - same as minor <br>
Major Imbalance - same as minor <br>
Greater Imbalance - same as minor <br>
Minor Crippling - 2 minute duration, slightly noticeable slow down <br>
<br>
Now on to our mysterious disease poisons: <br>
While Ahmed was infected and sitting, he did not naturally heal any hit points. We could not test whether or not it cut heal spells in half or not, but I believe it does. We did, however, discover that the disease poisons DO carry a slight str debuff to them, and we now believe, though its very hard to test, that they also carry a slight attack debuff with them. <br>
Minor Infectious - duration 1 minute, -9 to strength <br>
Lesser Infectious - duration 1 min 30 sec, -14 to strength <br>
<br>
How about those Damage Over Time (dot) poisons!?! <br>
Minor Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 9-11dmg <br>
Lesser Letha Poison did 5 tics of 10-13dmg <br>
Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 16-18dmg <br>
Major Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 17-22dmg <br>
Greater Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 22-26dmg <br>
Minor Lethal Venom did 5 tics of 26 to 31dmg <br>
<br>
Now for the big surprise of the poisons. I rarely used the weakening line of poisons because I did not see much use for them in personal use. But, according to our good victim Ahmed, they really put the ripple effect in cripple. <br>
Minor Weakness 20 pt str loss, 1 minute duration <br>
Lesser Weakness 27 pt str loss, 1 min duration <br>
Major Weakness 37 pt str loss, 1 min dura <br>
Greater Weakness 47 pt str loss, 1 min dura <br>
Minor Enervating 62pt str loss, 8pt con loss, 320hp loss, 1 min dur <br>
Second attempt on Minor Evervating caused different results: <br>
41pt str loss, 41pt con loss, 210hp loss, 1 min dura <br>
So, the enervating line really purts the hurt on tanks. It steals their mighty strenght and their valuable version of power called endurance. Watch that duration, though, they get it all back if they are not dead before the 1 minute is up. <br>
<br>
It was NOT easy testing all these. It was a LOT of fun, though. Special thanks to Ahmed for helping me out. I look forward to meeting you to test other rogue things on, especially our higher up poisons. Anyone still curious about Demnos? hehe. That little bugger! <br>
<br>
Well, Ahmed and I had JUST finished testing. We both had gotten comfortable with each other and were lax about not using stealth. All I will say is, we were inside a structure that protected us from the cold elements of Odin's Gate. The room we were in had windows. I was chilling there, arranging some poisons to test in combinations on Ahmed while he was sitting and recovering from a very painful Minor Enervating + Minor Lethal Venom combo, when suddenly he dies. I glance up from my backpack thinking maybe the dot had killed him, but to my surprise I see a tiny dark figure jump out of one of the windows! It was freaky! I didnt know anyone could get in and out of those windows! But a Lurikeen sure can! I tried to squeeze my lil kobold body out of it in pursuit, but he got away. I knew he had seen me. He though he was the cat, haha, but little did he know, he was the mouse. I chased him stealthed all over that wall while he looked for me. At the right patient moment, I let fly a nasty envenomed trio of blades into his backside. He crumpled before he even knew what hit him. Little bass terd. I hope we can meet again, I salute his wondeful style! <br>
<br>
Thanks to Ahmed <br>
Salute to Demnos <br>

Xunis has basically retired, so someone else needs to pick up the ingame testing.  My own SB intends to get 50 envenom, eventually, but for right now, I'm at 30 envenom at level 35 and it won't be going up majorily for a few levels still.  When I do start upping it again, I wouldn't mind hooking up with someone with a high level poison using assassin on MLF (hibby or alby, obviously) and doing some ingame testing.

<br>
So I decided to repeat the poison tests run at The Tarnished Dagger since some people had thought they changed, and some things were not tested completely. I play Sammy on Gawaine, a 40 Nightshade, and Krelios, a 41 Infiltrator agreed to help. We met in the Albion frontier since no one ever goes there, found a secluded area and ran some tests.<br>
<br>
I have a 26 Envenom, Krelios has 30. Here are the results:<br>
<br>
Lethal poisons (DoTs): These do varying damage based on the target's level (is it lower level than you, higher level, etc.). These poisons last 5 or 6 rounds, it seemed to be random which it was.<br>
<br>
Lesser Lethal Venom: 29-35 / rd when 41 used on 40 (Krelios used on me)<br>
Minor Lethal Venom: 24-30 / rd when 41 used on 40, 22-26 when 40 used on 41.<br>
<br>
Lesser Enervating Poison: 75 pt str/con debuff when 41 used on 40. My hps went from 693 to 325. I was still at full health, but my max was now 325. After one minute, when the poison wore off however, my con and str returned to normal BUT my hps stayed at 325 while my max went back to 693, leaving me at less than half health. The damage caused by his attack did NOT add to the damage, meaning the debuff is applied after the damage.<br>
<br>
Minor Enervating: 58 pt str/con debuff when 41 used on 40, hps went from 693 to 421. 41 pt str/con debuff when 40 used on 41, hps went from 715 to 539. So the level of your target affects how these debuffs work.<br>
<br>
Infectious Serum This caused a 20 pt str debuff no matter what - 41 on 40 and 40 on 41. It prevented any health regen and we assume would cause heals to work at half. It lasted about 2 minutes, all the others lasted one minute.<br>
<br>
Lesser Crippling Poison Worthless. Caused maybe a 20% reduction in run speed. Didn't even slow as much as Garrotte does.<br>
<br>
Well that's the results, hope I didn't forget anything. After we were done, we decided to duel. We equipped poisons, but did not use PA to open, we just started whacking. Well, Krelios' Enervating poison stuck, and he resisted mine! That means that after the first hit, I was at less than half hps, and he was near full, and my str was -7! Needless to say, he owned me totally, I never had a chance. If you are not using your PA, the enervating is really very good. BTW, I was worth 301 rps at the time ). Hope this helps peeps in choosing their poisons, and I want to say thanks to Krelios, that was a lot of fun. Next time my poison will stick!<br>

<br>
Some obversations I've had from these tests and from RVR and PVE use.<br>
<br>
I would highly advise against going full spec in poison.  Our tests confirmed that a couple of the poisons were pretty useless.  For example, I really expected the lesser crippling poison to snare an opponent more than it did.  Plus infectious serum just seemed to be a much weaker version of the enervating poison.<br>
<br>
In addition, I found that putting more spec into envenom means putting less into more important skills such as stealth, critical strike, and thrust.<br>
<br>
After frequently using poisons in battle, I'd recommend using enervating on the main weapon, and lethal on the side.  It's all about doing max damage as quick as possible, especially if you catch an orange con or lower solo on the frontier.<br>
<br>
As has already been noted, in RVR players will observe their hps relative to their target.  So enervating is a good way to &quot;fool&quot; the target into thinking they have more hps left than they really do.  It helps lower the target's melee capabilities in addition to the immediate hp loss, especially against melee using strength related weapons like crush and slash.<br>
<br>
Finally regarding using poisons in PVE, you need to be careful. It's often best NOT to be the puller.  Also, you should wait until the main tank(s) get a good hit or two before attacking, otherwise you will certainly get agro.  Grouping with an equal level paladin running heal chant helps a great deal.  However, hitting too early with poison and crit strikes can even outagro heal chanting paladins sometimes.<br>

<br>
A dot poison will hit the mob for 5 rounds (typically).  If you drop another dot poison on them before the other has run it's course you do not get 2 times the damage.  The second Dot will cause the first one to end, and the second one will then hit the mob for it's customary 5 rounds.<br>
<br>
I generally have the DOT and weaken poisons on my 2 primary weapons when I perform my backstab.  After 5 or 6 rounds of mele that dot will be running out. so I change my right hand to weild the weapon in the 2hand (I'm still dual wielding with the weapon in my left hand.)  I keep another dose of the DOT on that weapon, so I can dot them twice a fight.  I also keep 2 other blades in my backback with different poisons on them incase I get in trouble or get an add.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure many of you already do this, but just thought I would phrase it a bit more clearly for any newbies that happen through.<br>

As a shadowblade, I open with a two handed sword and weakening.  If the mob looks mostly dead by the end of my CS chain, then I finish it off with the two handed sword.  If it isn't (I miss or something dreadful like that) I click my one hand sword icon, my left axe icon, and then swing again (with DOT on one, and snare on the other).  I've also tried changing the order that I apply these poisons, such as opening with snare (which seems to greatly increase the critical damage of the second and third hit) then going to DOT and weakening, however, I've found that having DOT and snare on my 'backup' weapons is useful if I draw an add after finishing off the primary target (sort of a 'parting gift' as I run away). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udghamilton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dghamilton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 1:25:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Careful...</span><hr size=1> ...I hope you have a guild lined up or buddies to play with....Infiltrators are hard to get into groups my friend. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=drolk>Drolk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/15/02 2:35:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Poison FAQ Update?</span><hr size=1> Is an update in order for the Poison FAQ?<br>
