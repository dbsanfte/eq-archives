a nice idea though would to have a &quot;bash&quot; effect added with chaotic stab. where if u front or backstab a person it has 100% chance of interrupting a person/mob just like warrior kick. omhi if i was backstabbed i THINK i wouldn't be able to cast something <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugholamstickyfingers.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gholam Stickyfingers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 5:49:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=162>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ambidexterity</span><hr size=1> I disagree with ambidexterity being a good investment. I parsed my results of a chardok royals run tonight, and came out with 54% hits being done by main hand and 46% hits with offhand, wielding ragebringer and tri-plated golden hackle hammer (the one off dain), which comes out to about 90% chance of a successful dual wield. Offhand did 25% of overall damage, primary did 40% and backstab did 35%. Suppose ambidexterity will improve dual wield chance to 95% (this is what I expect it to do) - this will add about 1% to your overall damage, 2-2.5% if ambidexterity gives you 100% dual wield success (best case scenario). I consider alternate abilities directed at survival (innate stamina, natural durability, combat agility &amp; stability) FAR more beneficial than that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaddopovar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AddoPovar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 7:16:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=163>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ambidexterity</span><hr size=1> Hmm... Gholam, you are saying that in the timespan that you had autoattack on, your Ragebringer (delay 25) provided 54% of the hits, while your offhand (delay 24) provided 46%? That sounds like about 82% dual wield chance to me. A bit higher than I thought it would be, but not 90%.<br>
<br>
Could you please show the calculations you used to show a 90% success rate?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just in case someone asks me to provide the same, here is how I figured the rate to be about 82 percent using the numbers given. Since haste and double attack (as far as I know) effects both main and offhand the same way at high levels, I didn't include them in the calculations.<br>
<br>
Have autoattack on for, say, 6000 units of time. A Ragebringer with delay 25 would then have had a chance to swing 240 times. His hammer would with 100% dual wield success have had a chance to swing 250 times. Since his hammer swung only about (46/54)=85% as many times as his Ragebringer did, that would put it at about 204 swing-chances instead of 250, for a dual wield success percentage of about 82.<br>
<br>
If you chose another length of time, or included haste/double attack, you could alter the size of these two numbers (240 and 250), but not their relation to eachother. The number 204 was calculated from seeing how many times his offhand swung in relation to his mainhand, so it would scale along with the others. The relation between the 204 and the 250 was what gave me the result of 82%<br>
<br>
This took longer to write down than I spent on figuring it out, so if I did some error, feel free to correct it. For the best results, I hope misses were included in the calculation, but it shouldn't make any big difference unless your piercing skill varies alot from your 1hb. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/24/02 3:22:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ambidexterity</span><hr size=1> well regardless in a time x the 24 del weapon will number swings 104% of the 25 del weapon.<br>
<br>
1)skillpercentage * time /deloff = actswingsoff<br>
2)time /delpri = actswingpri<br>
<br>
<br>
3)skillpercentage* delpri *actswingpri / deloff = actswingsoff<br>
<br>
4)skilperc*delpri/deloff = actswingsoff/actswingpri<br>
<br>
5)skillperc*delpri/deloff = .46/.54 = .85<br>
<br>
6)skillpercentage = .85 / 1.04 = 82%<br>
<br>
so i concur with the objector its an 82% off hand rate.<br>

<br>
after that natural durability but because its a percentage most bang for the point comes from spreading out over ND CA CS.  do the math.  though one might say that even though ND gives you less damage compensation overall it still has the best general use.  which is true.  <br>
<br>
after that ambidex comes before chaotic stab.   its a nice ability.  some like escape. i see it but i also see the rather nice increase in damage you get with ambidex.  <br>
<br>
<br>
lol i would never get past ambidex enough for escape and frankly escape might rightfully come after maxing ND,CA,CS.  sooo who knows from there.<br>

14: CA1<br>
18: CA2<br>
----------- At this point Class abilities are available to you<br>
20: ND1<br>
24: ND2<br>
30: CF3<br>
36: CA3<br>
42: ND3<br>
----------- This is the point that you plan to switch to class abilities<br>
48: Chaotic Stab<br>
57: Ambidexterity<br>
66: Escape<br>
<br>
There are a few things about your list...<br>
-- 1st off in your list you have the line &quot;Next 4 points into Combat Fury 3&quot;, however, CF3 is going to take 6 points to get, not 4.<br>
-- 2nd point to note is that after 12 points in the Arch abilites you have access to the class ones, which may prove to help you more in the long run.<br>
-- Personally I would have recomended that you stop at CF1, the improvment in crits is nice for CF2, but not a great upgrade.<br>
-- Since you've all ready spent those points, in CF2, I would recomend that you skip CA and don't get ND3, stop at ND2.  That way you can get to the class abilities sooner.  You can always go back and get the Arch abilities your missing out on later, after you pick up the class ones you want.<br>
-- CA is really only helpfull to you, if your being hit.  Which as a rogue, its your objective not to be hit.  I do think CA is good, and would have recomended CA1 in the list if you had not all ready spent the points in CF2.<br>

Run 1 (1)<br>

Regen 1 (1)<br>

Melee Archetypes <br>

Combat Fury 3 (6)<br>
Thats 12 more points, your a Veteran now and can spend points on any skill you wish.<br>

Rogue Archetypes <br>
Ambidexterity (9)<br>
Chaotic Stab (6)<br>
Head back to melee archetypes and do them all with the exception of Fear Resistance and Finishing blow.<br>
<br>
After all that it really doesn't matter too much what you do.<br>

Anyways, thats my take on things. It's all good, no matter what order you follow.<br>

can someone give some significant statitics about critics and ambidextry on you dmg output.<br>
<br>
How much critic 3 improves your dmg output ?<br>
<br>
How much ambidextry improves your dmg output ?<br>
<br>
Just want a percentage from people who already have those skills. Parser and log analyser should help.<br>
<br>
Let's say you've doing 10K on Vindic, now how much you do in this fight with critic 3. And how much you do since you have ambidextry too.<br>
<br>
I ask questions cause i wanna know if it really improves dmg output significantly (i guess ambidextry do of course).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sobal>Sobal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/25/02 3:57:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=171>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The way to go</span><hr size=1> With crit 3 you land a critical hit on 7% of your landed attacks, including backstabs. Crits are 170% normal landed damage, I'll let you do the math on that one. <br>
<br>
As for Ambidex, there is some debate as to exactly how much bonus this skill adds to your DPS. It's somewhere around 4% added offhand DPS imo.<br>
<br>
What it all comes down to imo, is what increases DPS at all? Well, Combat Fury (crits), Ambidexterity (increased duel wield), and Chaotic stab (min damage front backstabs) are it.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what the DPS % increase is, training these skills is the best you can do to increase your combat damage output.<br>
<br>
Do what rogues do best, ALOT of damage.<br>

<br>
Innate Run Speed 3<br>
Innate Regeneration 3<br>
Natural Durability 3<br>
Chaotic Stab<br>
<br>
Those would be where I put the first slew of points, since I deal with not being able to get to a mob's back due to positioning on mobs. Plus with the stupid high ac and hitting for 1, 1, 1, 2, 12, etc, it's nice to add in that 120, once in a while. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukelcekindredsouls.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KelceKindredsouls</A> at: 5/26/02 5:49:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelandileldaron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elandil Eldaron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/02 2:52:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=173>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The way to go</span><hr size=1> Why i asked this is that maybe what we do best is Damage, i agree with this, but the point is that i maybe prefer upgrading some of disadvantages of rogues.<br>
<br>
With the weapons i hold, i already do a lot of damages, but the fact is, it's good to do a lot of damages but you better stay alive during a fight, a dead rogue means no damage at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So i might maybe put critic 1 for the simple fact that landing a critic while Duelist on a backstab can do much on a target that you need to drop quick.<br>
<br>
But i think i will go on natural durability to increase significantly my HP.<br>
<br>
I think mostly aa pt depends of what you do in the game, for me i think i need more Hp than doing a bit more dmg, cause i do a lot of raids with many targets AE Sontalak, Keeper, etc...<br>

The nice thing about these aaxps skills is you are receiving a % increase to your dps. It doesn't matter if your still wielding Ragebringer or it's sitting in your bank, that percentage increase will carry over to every new weapon you get.<br>

Once again, all this is just my personal opinion.

I'm currently level 45, but I've already begun to consider some AA possibilities.  A lot of people seem to suggest Run Speed 1-3 first, but I recently obtained some JBoots so this would only help me indoors.  Of course, the other general choices (Regen, First Aid...) don't seem crucial either.  So I need to know what to spend my six points on to reach the archetypes.  Is Run Speed still worth it for the indoor use?  Or would there be others more beneficial? Thanks in advance.<br>

<br>
i logged a morning of UD velks.  im a 60 rogue with crit 2.  i got  2% crits on primary and bout that on offhand. <br>
primary numbers:<br>
5682 primary hits non crit<br>
117   primary hits crit<br>
<br>
offhand numbers:<br>
3985 offhand hits non crit<br>
94    offhand hits crit<br>
<br>
<br>
see one rub bout the 4% is that its a warrior skill too.   im thinking there innate hasnt been properly removed or something. ill tell you how crit 3 goes.  this is pretty easy to parse since time isnt a factor you just need to log a hard grind and get the number of hits.  easy.<br>
<br>
as far as dex.  maybe a factor.  before you say YES it has been proven to be a factor.  i say your not being rigorous in your thinking.   it has been proven to be a factor with innate crit.  for AA skills this might be a simple percentage that checks before innate.  or after innate /shrug.  and if innate doesnt throw a crit then it checks the aa skill.  so you could have two different crit systems.  someone would have to demonstrate to me that dex is a factor in aa skill and thats HARD becuase you need rather large samples for this rather low percentage or youll have strong variance.   as for what i had.  i have base dex of 170ish.  and HoS bout half the time. so it was a good &quot;field test&quot; percentage.<br>
