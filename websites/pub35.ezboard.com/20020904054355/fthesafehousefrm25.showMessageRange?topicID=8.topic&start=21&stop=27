Don't be afraid to just make something up if you don't know.<br>
<br>
In the end playing is about having fun. Fun usually (well, for most people) does not equate to searching through 12 different source books to figure out the 'right' skill and damage check. A general rule of thumb is if searching for the exact rule is going to ruin the pace just make something up. Only rules lawyers like having the exciting &quot;chased by hungry worgs&quot; part disrupted for 20 minutes of finding the exact Dragon magazine article that printed the 'right' movement rates and damage for moving through the Cursed Fields of Death.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter who plays the GM or if the GM has never played before. It's like an EQ skill, you get better at it with practice - only thankfully you don't need to spend 3000pp to get good at it! I'd say swapping the GM around until you figure who's good at it and who enjoys doing it is a pretty good idea. You'll also learn the rules a bit faster seeing things from both sides of the GM screen.<br>
<br>
Four people, one of them as GM sounds fine. You don't want to have too many people when you're starting or anyone who's new to it will get even more lost and confused. Four or five is just perfect for starting and really a good number even for more advanced groups. It's a LOT easier to manage a small group of 4-5 than say an 8 man group.<br>
<br>
Koru's bare basics list of things you do need:<br>
*Player's Handbook<br>
*One of each of the following dice type, 4 sided, 6 sided, 8 sided, 12 sided and 20 sided. Two 10 sided dice, preferably different color for % rolls.<br>
*Character sheets<br>
<br>
You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> make do with just that for a little while, especially with all the websites out there to get monsters and adventures from. If you're the player you really just need the Player's Handbook or something that tells you how to roll up a char, fight, and make a skill check/saving throw. A lot of people I knew started out with just these. It has to be noted though that that works better if there's someone who knows the game well playing with you. It's basically a good idea if at least one person also has the GM handbook and Monster Manual.<br>
<br>
After that I recommend adding in the following order of importance:<br>
*Monster Manual - Because fighting the same orcs all the time gets boring.<br>
*Dungeon Master's Guide - For all the rules Player's Handbook doesn't have.<br>
*Dungeon Master's Screen - Because looking up tables all the time sucks!<br>
<br>
*Modules or other sources for adventures - premade adventures, sometimes published in series. Even if you don't use them as they are they can be a great inspiration. Sometimes just reading then makes you realize that you hadn't even considered adding 'cool thing X' to your campaign. They can also save your butt when you forget to make an adventure for the group. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The great thing is these don't have to cost a whole lot, an issue of Dungeon or a print out from the internet can do. Though it has to be said the official beginner adventures are a lot easier for both GM and players to learn.<br>
<br>
*Campaign setting books like the Forgotten Realms source book -  The wonderful thing about them is that a lot of the work has already been done for you so there is a great 'living' world to jump straight into with lots of detail. Even if you want to make your own world adapting and altering elements from these books can save you a lot of time.<br>
<br>
*Class enhancement books - Now we're gettting into fluff basically. Lots of cool new toys in these books and everyone loves toys. They're not at all needed but having ideas for new traps and temples can lend some spice to playing. Once you get to the point of buying one of these you'll probably know enough to know what you want or need next. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthal0012.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thal0012</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/20/02 3:18:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> All good advice. The best rule was already said, your job is to get a feel for what the players want to do and present it in a fun and challenging manner. Many game master play as if its them vs the player in some contest to 'win'. Especially if rogue centric, you can play months doing nothing but adventures in the city, ranging from good ole npc bashing, to politics, blacmail, assassination, working for the govenor etc.<br>
<br>
The other most important rule and don't follow the rules word for word. Fudge dice rolls for the sake of gameplay, make quick decisions to keep the flow of the adventure going. Nothing hurts a game more than flipping through manual every encounter. Lastly I hate to coin a Verant term but let the players know they are in your world now<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Nothing is worse than that one whiny player who tells the GM he can't do something because of players handbook page 17, paragraph 3(and he has it memorized!).<br>
<br>
Lastly I believe there is a computer cd with a compilation of dragon magazine back issues. That magazine is so full of campaign idea and stuff, you'll be getting dizzy at all the options to flesh out this new world in your head<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufricka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fricka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/20/02 3:23:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> Wow thanks for the responses all.<br>

As for GURPS, well sadly one of the reasons I'm interested in playing a DnD game is because it was THE pen and paper game for so long and I missed out on the whole bit, hehe.<br>

I'll check out the links a little but I may not be brave enough to join an online game with people I don't know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelerion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elerion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/21/02 2:17:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.tiscali.no/~t-brandr/shadow_face.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> I believe SX nailed it pretty well. The number one, numero uno, nummer en rule for any aspiring GM is to remember you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> do not play to win</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. You play to make it fun for the other players. But do remember, you are not there to carry them in a Comfy Chair (TM) to gold and glory. Make sure you challenge them, but never create situations that have no way out. And punish them for their stupidities (Example: In my current campaign, one of the players gave an unknown, poor boy in a town 1gp to hold his leather armor for him while he &quot;borrowed&quot; some money from careless people in the street crowd. Of course, when he returned, the boy was gone, along with the leather armor). Mild punishments the first few times, especially with newer players, and harsher punishments for repeated stupidity. Don't be afraid to kill them either, if they did something REALLY stupid (Another example: In my first campaign, a young mage player was standing under Elminsters tower screaming and yelling for Elminster to teach him some &quot;Majikks&quot;. After three warnings of increased seriousness, the ol' wizard simply burned the young, annoying thing into a crisp). <br>
<br>
Fricka, if you or anyone else want to know some basics about the system, you can e-mail me at elerion@superhelt.no and I'll send you an acrobat reader version of the 3rd ed Player's Handbook that you can look at. This will give you a general idea of what it's like. When you have looked at that, I highly encourage you to buy the real thing. First of all because it's an amazing system and they do deserve the money you are paying, for the sourcebooks at least. And second because it's practically impossible to play a game without the real book unless you have a laptop and good deal of patience <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One last thing, about the D&amp;D Adventure Game (or whatever the starter set is called). Unless this has been changed a whole lot in 3rd ed, I do NOT think you should buy it. The 2nd ed starter set was so far from the real version of the game that it only served to confuse us when we got the &quot;real&quot; books. The starter set had board-like maps that you moved miniatures around on, involved practically no roleplaying, and had no interaction with the environment other than rolling dice to kill orcs and gnolls. You are much better off getting one of the official beginner adventures and using that as an intro to the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustytchyapgud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stytch Yapgud</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 6:19:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=26>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> dice, a players hand book and imagination<br>

If the players think of a really good but odd way of trivializing an encounter, that seems like it shoudl work, should you let them do it, or because it would trivilize the challege give some reason it doesnt work.<br>
