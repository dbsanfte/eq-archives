Legna I played with you on rz btw.<br>
<br>
And the solution presented above is certainly not bad for NS.  They have good resist vs slash and neutral to thrust.<br>
<br>
Thats decent against either realms.  The only way to make it better would be resist vs both slash and thrust.<br>
<br>
No one is against NS getting help but for some inspiration let me say there was a nightshade on my server who felt if u were not getting 20k rp a day you were wasting your time.  (In which case I suck).<br>
<br>
He was hardcore but I struggle in killing him or a few other of the good nightshades.  <br>
<br>
I think you guys could use some help, but honestly..you aren't that gimped imo.  At least the nightshades on Galahad aren't really hurtin..some are quite feared.  Maybe they have buffbots I dunno.<br>

I do not have access to this dreamy configuration everytime I go out to RVR, hell I'm lucky to go out with a dex/quick buff.<br>
<br>
I raised my starting constitution to 50.  I put 5 in dex, 5 in quick and 10 in strength.<br>
<br>
I am a Level FIFTY ( 50 ) Nightshade in FULL con/hits gear.<br>
<br>
I have a unbuffed with items con of 125 which results in 1103 hit points UNBUFFED but with about +150 in HP gear.<br>
<br>
So? How, with a starting con of 70 have only 63 hitpoints than me?  That's impossible.  You must have neglected to put ANY points into constitution if you only have 2 more con points than me.  Something sounds fishy.  Someone clear this up for me please.  Is con primary, secondary or teritary for Shadowblades?  Your going to tell me that someone who starts with 70 CON, vs someone who starts with 50 CON ends up with 2 more con at End Game?  I have a hard time believing that.<br>
<br>
Bile, I also agree, we have the CHOICE to spec pierce/blades, however we don't have the CHOICE to go for the higher con/str points.  We are restricted to being a spell casting class base.  <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
[edit to clear my point due to some completely seeing red where there isn't any due to the bitterness in this game now] <br>
<br>
I really think Shadowblades should have the CHOICE just as we have the choice to spec weapons.  However, I also believe that Nightshades inherently need the choice to be able to take that 60 con bonus that being a Celt would give us.  Regardless it's a invalid option for me at this point and time.  There is no way on gods green earth i am taking another character to 50. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A> at: 8/1/02 8:18:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujekyllrogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jekyll Rogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 8:07:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3849.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Correcting a Misconception</span><hr size=1> &quot;however we don't have the CHOICE to go for the higher con/str points.

your primary stat is DEX, not STR/CON isnt it ?<br>
STR is not so important for you, especially if you use thrust, however you can alter STR/CON by using items, if you wish.<br>

I'll be sure to post the results here.<br>

Is it a viable choice?  Not likely.  I'd much like to see some RVR testing with blades as opposed to Bloodletters before I make that decision.  I don't hunt many bloodletters at 50.<br>

<br>
It's funny, Balor. I post my stats endgame at level 50 and because SB's don't have 300-400 more HP then a Nightshade you feel I am a liar or I guess you call it &quot;fishy&quot;.<br>
<br>
I didn't put any points into con at start, as no one knew anything about stats when the game came out and I started playing.  Con gets NO raises for SB's as they level. Str, dex and qui are raised, same as the other Assassin classes.<br>
<br>
As my equipment is now, I have 2 more con then you for a total of around 50 more HP then you have.  This is why SB's complained that we were screwed in the patch that gave NS the new shout and Infil's 453 extra spec points.<br>
<br>
Sorry to burst your bubble about SB's having some overpowering load of Hit Points more then NS do. Of course, most NS feel they should get a con buff to even out the hit points now, which is quite funny to me. <br>
<br>
Ask the Kobold level 50's here what there unbuffed con and HP are, and ask what it is naked. Very similiar to a 40 con starting NS.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is still 2 handed weapons that make SB's uber &lt;rolls eyes&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 6:42:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3849.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.camelotherald.com/guilds/nightshade.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply for Balor</span><hr size=1> Lupas troll somewhere else.

Your problem was you didn't put points in con.  You had the CHOICE to do it.  You chose not to.<br>

That is such BS.  I didn't put any extra Con into my Kobie (my bad... Con wasn't explained very well) and have since maxed my Con/STR gear out.<br>
<br>
With Items the HP increase SB's got is TOTALLY  negligible. In fact, when Lifebane hits 2 times (compared to my 35 DOT hitting 2x)  those hitpoints are more than made up for. Then throw in a higher enervating poison and you see a much bigger HP drop. <br>

<br>
Fact: Shadowblades have the option to choose Norse or Kobold.<br>
<br>
Fact: Norse Start with 70 Con<br>
<br>
Fact: Mythic implimented Shadowblades to get a HP increase<br>
------------------------------------<br>
Fact: Nightshades have the option to choose Elven or Lurikeen<br>
<br>
Fact: Both Elven and Lurikeen start with 40 con.<br>
<br>
Fact: Mythic implimented a DD shout which adds around 3 dps on a 20 second timer<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Conclusion:  Con has a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  helluva™ </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lot more to do with things than just hit points.  It has to do with how well you take a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  hit </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
So explain to me, how it's total BS that people are saying Shadowblades have more HPs than other assassins?<br>
<br>
You were correct when you said the increase was NEGLIGABLE, but nothing I said in any of my previous posts was untrue.  Shadowblades DO have more Hit points.<br>
<br>
Now, as for them being negligable, that is an issue just like our shout hitting for shiat damage.  Up to the team leads to raise this issue and scream in their ear.<br>
<br>
Like I said previously, This is the ROGUE community, not the Nightshade, Infiltrator and Shadowblade Boards.  Show me where I'm not allowed to make comments about Shadowblades and I'll stop.  I think over the course of 9 months and fifty levels I think i've fought enough of them to realize they are a compact little bundle of death.<br>
<br>
We have all had to endure tough times, this is another one of those for the community.  It is time for us to stop backstabbing, pun intended, each other and get back to the betterment of the COMMUNITY as a whole.<br>
<br>
I honestly think that part of our problem was the influx of the battlegrounds.  Everyone and their brother rolled an assassin twink.  Perception is 100% of the Vision.  We effectively got screwed.  I really don't think mythic realized how effective we were against lowbies of the same level.  The view that we were overpowered was perpatrated here in the Battlegrounds and fueled the most recent set of nerfs that the community has had to endure.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey, I was here back in the begining, documentation was poor to none.  None of us knew how to spec, how to spend our inital points or even how to freaking auto train.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I have never asked for or supported nerfs to this community.  I for one wish to go back to pre December, back when we were &quot;gimped&quot;.  Seems things were a lot more fun back then.<br>
<br>
It's time to stop bickering people.  If we don't get our proverbial shiat together and become the community that we used to be, we are going to go the way of the dodo bird.<br>

<br>
I see SB's not getting things and being nerfed and it always seems to be based on the following things:<br>
<br>
1. SB's have more HP then the other Assassins.<br>
<br>
2. SB's get 2 Handed Weapons.<br>
<br>
3. SB's get Left Ax.<br>
<br>
Have you read the TL Report and Elaa's &quot;Nightshade Balance&quot; here? Seems like they are asking for spells to give a con/str buff. NS already have the capability of being extremely close to SB hit points, a buff will make it so NS have MORE hp then SB's.<br>
<br>
&quot;So explain to me, how it's total BS that people are saying Shadowblades have more HPs than other assassins?&quot;<br>
<br>
Just as in the example above, it IS total BS when you use SB's having a minute HP amount over NS to advocate getting your class improved. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now, as for them being negligable, that is an issue just like our shout hitting for shiat damage. Up to the team leads to raise this issue and scream in their ear.&quot;<br>
<br>
There is no issue here to raise for SB's. We have the same HP as Skalds and Thanes, which is a negligible amount more then NS and Infiltrators. Do you really think they will give a Rogue Based Class more HP then a Viking Based Class? Should Rogues have more HP then the Tanks in their Realm?<br>
<br>
&quot;Like I said previously, This is the ROGUE community, not the Nightshade, Infiltrator and Shadowblade Boards&quot;<br>
<br>
As Bile tried to explain in the one post DAOC has an adversarial system which segregates the assassin classes. In EQ it was fairly easy for all rogues to agree on posts and work things out as they are not in direct competition with other rogues in PvP/RvR. It is kind of sad, but I agree that NS need some kind of boost. But when the boost always seems to come at the expense of SB's it is kind of hard to advocate NS getting a boost.<br>

Not to be combative here, follow me for a few moments.<br>
<br>
When our shout was implimented how did this hurt &quot;blades&quot;?  The Blades were given the offset HP as well, I'd think our shout and your hp was damn near equal /wink  After all our shout hits for what, 60? you got what? 60 HP?  Heh.<br>
<br>
We both got 2.2, so no issue there.<br>
<br>
Armour resists getting set to negative slash.  Well this effects 2 of the 3, &quot;blades&quot; and &quot;infs&quot;, most definately moreso Blades as this is thier only option.  I for one don't agree with that. I also believe I have made it perfectly clear that in my opinion, blades need the option to spec crush or thrust with thrust weapons being added to Midgard.  Why wouldn't the melee realm have all three variants of weaponry?  I really don't think this patch needs to be added.  However, like I said, that is just my opinion and I am looking at it from an &quot;Assassin&quot; point of view.  Not a Realm Wide point of view.  I'm sure it helps the &quot;tanks&quot;.  Not sure how, but I'm sure it does.  /wink.<br>
<br>
I think that compared to Viper and Vanish, Shadow Run is just laughable.  Maybe a boost in the RA department could help?<br>
Well I also think Viper is too expensive, but I know that Blades would trade their eyeteeth for viper over shadowrun.  That's a case of me seeing the glass half empty, blades seeing it as half full and Inf's hitting the &quot;vanish&quot; button /wink.<br>
<br>
Elaa has been a very outspoken voice to the Rogue community.  The comments that he(she) has made in the course of the existence of DAoC have helped more than hindered the entire rogue community, not just Nightshades.<br>
I think that the Shadowblade community need someone LIKE Elaa to step up to the plate and follow in the footsteps he(she) has forged for his(her) class.<br>
<br>
I am for the community that we had in EQ, however, reality dictates like Bile stated I suppose.  Oh well, a Rogue can dream eh?<br>
<br>
Oh and as I see it, right now it's Inf&gt;NS/SB.<br>
<br>
Not to say Infiltrator's need a nerf in anyway.  Just giving my thoughts on the balance issue.  I find my SB fights more equal now than ever before.  Of course there is always that buff'd vs unbuff'd, but we will always have those running around.<br>

What i see out of these posts is that there just arent enaugh true hearted players that play the SB.  I mean look at it.  If you would do the research before the complaining you could actualy (maybe) be successful.  If its the Infils yer worried about, DONT HUNT INFILS THEN. =P<br>
<br>
My god thats why i be very careful to hunt a troll warrior or something.   How many experienced smite clerics do you successfuly kill.  Probably none unless they are afk.  But i dont see you comparing yourself to a smite cleric.<br>
<br>
Mythic will do what they think is right.  Wheather it is or not, to them it is.  So live with it and learn how to conrol yercharacter now.  From wha i see its not the class and most time not the race you choose but instead its how you SPEC him/her.  If you spec it and it may take 20 mins in a bg to get the shot/perf lined up, but if you do it right you can be successful.<br>

Not to be combative here, follow me for a few moments.&quot;<br>
<br>
The previous boosts to NS didn't really hurt SB's, but this patch with the armor resists will hurt SB's in Assassin vs. Assassin RvR tremendously. Couple the Armor Resists with NS getting a str/con buff ( which is being asked for, hasnt been granted yet) and SB's will be worse and worse.<br>
<br>
With the old leather resist set up it was fine. SB's had no option to spec anything but slash so we always had a plus damage to NS/Inf. Inf/NS had an option, spec slash and have the SAME bonus to other Assassins that SB's have or spec thrust/pierce and  be worse versus SB's but have a nice bonus versus tanks and healing classes in Midgard and as an added deal for NS have a nice plus to Clerics, Mercs and Minstrels.  This is a very important thing, to me anyway. Infil and NS always had the option to be equal to SB's but the bulk to the route of wanting a bonus to tanks and healing classes.<br>
<br>
Now, no matter what SB's do we are worse versus Infiltrators and much worse versus NS.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think that compared to Viper and Vanish, Shadow Run is just laughable&quot;<br>
<br>
And many classes, including many NS and Inf, said this was fair because SB got more HP, a 2 handed weapon, and Left Ax.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and as I see it, right now it's Inf&gt;NS/SB&quot;<br>
<br>
Right now I agree. After the patch is Inf&gt;NS&gt;SB.<br>

No, I think that the Inf's will still give you the most problems.<br>
That's just my opinion though.  The armour resists are going to hurt, but how much, only time will tell when it gets to the real battlefield.  Afterall, it's not even live yet.<br>

that leads it s a matter of luck on evades and the time to place the DB/harmstring/leaper/rib combo.<br>
if u place just a single combo, u take the edge and have a really good chance to win.<br>

post 1.52, NS should have a really good chance to own SB, since slash ll be resisted and SB r neutral(i think on pierce), i feel sorry for the critblades but i won t cry a river on the SZ, DF should overcome that easely.<br>
