<br>
LOL. What disc is that?  <br>
<br>
The disc that needs 40+ AA points to be viable high damage benefit (that we get once a RL hour, provided we don't need to use another disc, that is)?<br>
<br>
If you think archery is really that great, you might want to try it.  It's terribly buggy and really only useful on a handful of mobs.  It's god-awful in Luclin because of the high AC on the mobs.  It's worthless for any mob that get pushed into a wall because arrows poof because of bugs.  It's not real effective for any &quot;smaller size&quot; mob that you have lots of melee surrounding because you'll just shot into the backs of the melee.  You only get half damage on rooted or moving mobs.  You can't be too far below or above a mob or you can't even shoot your bow.<br>
<br>
Archery is, at best, highly situational.  And it's so buggy that VI doesn't need to nerf it.  It's already been nerfed by all of the bugs.  <p>Sulamwen Arrowblast<br>

He is not calling to nerf Archery, and admit, &quot;in certian situations&quot; it can be done.  No it is not all the time, no its not often, yes you had to dump AA points to get it.  Just like SU3 with palies.<br>
<br>
Archery has enough problems with it for it to be nerfed.  Nice ability when you have it and can use it though.  <br>
<br>
I think it might be wise for those calling for other nerfs to other classes to stop.  Just as it might be wise for those comming here to gloat on our &quot;nerf&quot; to stop also. I am tired of seeing it from both ends truth tell.<br>
<br>
Some venting is going to happen, and most is going to happen in the 1st 24 hours.  But I would like to see more from all the classes as to what is going on with the test server.  We are hearing second hand reports from monks on what other things are happening over there. <br>
<br>
Seems to be confirmed:<br>
<br>
1 Damage per hit seems increased (Mitigation decreased)<br>
2 Number of hits have gone down. (Avoidance increased)<br>
3 Ranger get a boost in dodge.     (Confirmed and quite possibly needed)<br>
<br>
Rumored to be happening:<br>
1. Warriors Dodge increase.          (Avoidance increased)<br>
2. Palidans Dodge increase.          (Avoidance increased)<br>
3. Shadow Knight Dodge increase. (Avoidance increased)<br>
<br>
Now look at what was posted.  To bring the defense in line monk defense has to be lowered on the mitigation side. This was told to us and we blew up, lots of threats of quitting, lots of canceling the next subscription run.  You wonder why the other 4 things to tune defensive skills has not be brought up yet? <br>
<br>
You think the Wizzie,Mage,CH.Monk thing raised a stink.  This has not been acknowleged by VI as part of the retruning, yet we hear about it, and it is put in at the same time the monks get &quot;nerfed&quot;. <br>
<br>
Guess what people are getting upset about it.  I am not sure that this did not need to be done.  However, when one lays things out, they should lay it all out.  Not just the &quot;bad&quot; parts, for fear that someone is going to be doubly mad.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW Please reign in the rangers that want our defense dropped to 235. I know it is not a majiorty, but it really pisses off people that have just gotten smacked. <br>

<br>
     I agree this problem was caused by poor design by VI with all/all items, but now they are fixing it what do you want them to do? Remove MNK from all/all loots, retroactively lower the ac on supposed &quot;monk loot&quot;? They can fix this by nerfing a class they screwed up in the first place or fix the class by nerfing every other class in the game? It may hurt but this was really the only choice VI had to bring monks back into line with where they should be.<br>

I understand that a nerf wasn't called for.  But the damage numbers were &quot;outrageous&quot; and not representative of even 1% of the Rangers playing the game currently.<br>
<br>
My problem is that it was made to sound like there are a lot of Rangers out there doing ungodly amounts of damage.  Even if someone got lucky and did something close to that once, it's evened out by the *many* times that archery doesn't work because all of the bugs that it brings.  Like I said in the post, archery is highly situational.  Many of the Luclin mobs are out of the question because of their AC.  As for Velious raid mobs, it's probably 50/50 on using archery vs melee (that is, if TS is available.  If not, it's definitely melee)  <br>
<br>
And personally, I doubt any Ranger is getting close to 60k damage in the 2 mins that TS lasts.   <p>Sulamwen Arrowblast<br>

Everybody gets smacked around like a red-headed stepchild in luclin anyway, the only reason monks were chosen for rampage tanks is because they avoid more hits than any other class.<br>
<br>
If they now avoid even MORE hits, then does the situation change at all?  It doesn't sound like it will, to me.  If Luclin mob ATK values are too high to ever be properly mitigated, then the one who avoids the best takes the least damage.<br>
<br>
All they would have to do to make warriors the tanks they should be would be to forever remove any sort of AC softcap in the game.  Warriors have always had higher potentially much more AC than monks; it's just that it stopped working like it should have past a certain point.  If you make it so the 1400 AC monk tanks horribly compared to the 1600 AC warrior (to use an 'uber' example), then the game would be fine.<br>
<br>
Instead of actually fixing the poor code they wrote in the first place, which was never intended to be fed such enormously huge AC numbers as are possible in Kunark through Luclin, they decided to adjust a class, which is easier to do.  It also carries with it the potential of making one class, well, suck.<br>
<br>
I hope they do this correctly, but I have little faith that it will all balance out properly any sooner than 3-6 months after this first change is made.  They will tweak, and tweak, and tweak, until they're satisfied.<br>
<br>
Don't blame monks for their being good rampage tanks.  Blame Verant for being unable to code mitigation AC to work properly past a certain point.  Don't ask for monks to be changed; ask for Verant to re-code their shite AC procedures so that more AC = better tanking, period, no ifs, ands, or buts.<br>
<br>
With enough AC, damn near anyone can tank in xp groups.  My gear is not too shabby, but I have been out-tanked by tricked-out level 60 rangers, a class that is SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to tank POORLY.  Granted, the fact that they had more HPs and the primary heal used was complete heal played a part, but they were able to get their DPS taken down to a reasonable level.  <br>
<br>
I don't see why a cleric with 1300 AC shouldn't be able to outtank a monk with 1100 AC, for example.  AC should be far more important than block/dodge(parry)/riposte, imho.  Innate abilities should never be more important to a class's survivability than acquired gear / abilities / spells (I don't consider spells innate, they're purchased / dropped).  If an enchanter gathers up some uber gear and hits 1000 AC, then he should be tanking better than the same-level warrior with 900 AC.  &quot;But he's only wearing cloth and the warrior has plate!!&quot;  Well, maybe the warrior is wearing 1/16th inch thick aluminum plate, and the enchanter is wearing 1/4 inch thick steel-thread reinforced kevlar.  Whatever.<br>
<br>
AC should mean more.  Right now it doesn't mean enough, and that's why we're getting nerfed.  It's not the monks' fault that Verant designed the game with little to no foresight, and they shouldn't be penalized -- except by virtue of an increase in the effectiveness of gear only available to classes with fewer armor restrictions.  The game has been needing a retune of the risk/reward of PvE for a LONG time, what with all the mudflation, there is no good reason why they couldn't retune the game based on a new change that would make mitigation AC mean something beyond the softcap. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=249499">Slithers Sa`angreal</A>, 56 Iksar Monk of Prexus<br>Proud Member of <A HREF="http://azuresky.droz.net">Azure Sky</A><br>

Now you know what monks are looking at.  As it was announced, the upper 1% of monks were able to talk as well as the warriors can, but the class got nerfed.  I am still reserving total judgment till I see what comes out of it in the end. <br>

Ranger Dodge increase is in actually needed at this point.  What we are going to see come pop is Extream High Damage low HP mobs.  Avoidance &gt; Mitigation in that case, UNLESS they fix the mitigation problem to begin with.  We shall see. <br>

I did not point this phrase out to throw a flame your direction, but I do want to do a little word replacement and show you another side to the arguement.  (I do agree with you btw when it comes to ranger damage with a bow)<br>

<br>
This isnt a issue for 99% of us monks (tanking exceptionally high-end mobs through the use of high-end gear) -- just as archery isnt an issue for 99% of rangers (doing ungodly DPS for a time through the use of a very long to attain AA skill) -- but that one percent, the times that are out of whack and through &quot;skill&quot; and gear are made unrealistic and unbalanced, is what will get their class abilities nerfed.  That is what I have a problem with.<br>
<br>
Doesnt really matter though, as proven time and time again, VI listens to the whining masses.<br>
<br>
The unfortunate thing is that once this blows over, some other poor class will be next on the chopping block -- maybe druids and the snare ability, or maybe rogues and the time recycle on backstab, or maybe Pallies and their undead crits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wubao>Wubao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1627<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/02 2:33:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What was broken?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yes, the only reason that monks are getting nerfed is because other classes cried, it has nothing to do with there actually being a problem now could it?&quot;<br>

<br>
So what was this problem that existed that needed this action to be fixed?<br>
<br>
Please enlighten me as to how monks were breaking the game?<br>
<br>
How were monks trivializing encounters?<br>
<br>
How were monks making the game so flippin easy for everyone that they needed to be totally tweaked?<br>
<br>
&quot;Every single time any class is nerfed it is because other classes whined. EVERY TIME. &quot;<br>
<br>
Bah. Whatever. I've yet to see one sound argument for why monks were overpowered. What was so overpowered about what monks did?<br>
<br>
Everytime I ask this question I get the same answer:<br>
<br>
Because they can solo.<br>
<br>
Big FREAKIN DEAL!<br>
<br>
How many classes in this game can solo?<br>
<br>
ALL OF THEM.<br>

<br>
Personally, I think this &quot;nerf&quot; had very little to do with a few monks being able to tank very high level mobs and everything to do with the abundance of all/all low weight items that allowed monks to compete with plate classes for the ability to get their AC up to very high levels.<br>

Remeber that AC number is made of 2 real numbers.  Avoidance and Mitigation.  If the lower the Mitigation and increase the Avoidance, same AC number.<br>
<br>
So it cant be the number that monks can concivably push up.  Something else is in play.  Damage the monks take/and or/ avoid.<br>
<br>
Lets see what happens and roll from there. <p><div class="Section1">

Just because we got nerfed (we dont know by how much yet) DOESNT mean we should call for nerfs of EVERY SINGLE OTHER CLASS. if you want VI to fix it, try and do it without nerfs.

Instead they chose to nerf monks and for what? They are already redesighing half of the velious and 90% of the luclin mob's. why not fix warrior's and other plate classes instead of ruining another class to try to bring them in balence. Simple fix is reduce mage resistance checks on mob's raise plate tanks defensive ability's a little warrior's a bit over  pally's and sk's. Then with there balence changes to mobs they could have gone into interesting battles with PoP. not to mention make some of the older content a little less trivial. Still i guess being nerfed isn't that bad atleast the warrior class pally class and sk classes are still broke and happy about it!! what it comes down to is my 1300 ac will probley still leave me room to improve where you stupid warrior's with 1700 ac are still stuck at a soft cap of 1350 ac. have a great day =) <p><img src="http://www.webspawner.com/users/gadzook/NEW%20signiture.JPG" border="8">

Guess who whines next? Hybrids.<br>
<br>
Then who next? Monks and all other melees.<br>
<br>
Look, you make it so warriors are taking half hte damage of what luclin mobs are dishing out now... then Verant sees oh great we screwed up the mobs, the game is too easy again, and soon mobs are hitting for double <br>
<br>
Look at it this way..<br>
<br>
You can buff up warriors, make it so they take half the damage you take, then they have to change all the raid mobs or its trivial.<br>
<br>
Or you can nerf monks (and for god's sake we dont even know the speciifcs yet, so don't say you can't pull when you havne't tried it yet!) which won't affect anything but maybe their solo.<br>
<br>
~~<br>
<br>
yes im sure you don't want your monk to be nerfed but many classes don't want to be gimp for so long either. Have you seen how long SK's have been gimped? Mages?<br>
<br>
They still complain about their issues, so since when did one class get to escape it all?<br>
<br>
This is somewhat why many of the old timers said it was gonna happen.. and now it has. Now wait and see what happens before we come up with the conclusion all other classes should be nefed or buffed wihtout considerin how even more classes would hate it.<br>
<br>
If they despise us so much.. asking to nerf them would only make it worse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uleonardoe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>leonardoe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/02 9:29:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need to petition for changes?</span><hr size=1> chew .what part of "they are redesigning half of velious and 90% of luclin mob's" do you not understand? see if they are already redesigning these same mob's you worrie so much about becomeing trivial they could design the mobs with a higher soft cap for them classes and still keep it from being trivial. by nerfing monks it dosen't do you no good  but giveing warrior's a defensive table of say a 15% mitigation and pallys and sk's a 5 % defensive mitigation table increse that would balence all classes out and they could fix the mobs they are redesigning with this in mind.<br>
and so you know i do not think any monk woudl have a problem with warrior's getting a new defensive table after all it was like a mounth ago where we had a rather large thread on the subject and roughly 80% of the monks agreed that it would be a awsome way to fix warrior's defensive ability's. so until you gather a brain please don't spew your BS here.<br>
