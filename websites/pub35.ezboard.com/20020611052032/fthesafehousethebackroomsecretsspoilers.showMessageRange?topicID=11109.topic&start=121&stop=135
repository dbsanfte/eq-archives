No way would a established guild volunteer to leave a server that they hold such an advantage over. <br>
Personally, I think they should. The only reason that Euro/Asian people would want to stay is because of friends (most of whom would be in the guild already) and because they like the significant timezone advantage they have. Too bad, so sad I say. <br>
Hell, they'd even be able to race for mobs when they logged on, instead of them being dead already. What would they have to bitch about? That they now have to play on even footing with other guilds on a server instead of having a mob buffet set up for when they log in? I'd really try to be sympathetic, but I don't think I'd do a good job.&quot;<br>
<br>
What? Enforced movelogs based on nationality would see my Euro-ass account cancelled so fast it would make your head spin. With randomisation of server-up pops it's being worked on. Shifting Asian/Euros off to a ghetto server WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT is not the answer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usulaspsychoblades.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sulas Psychoblades</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 7:34:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11109.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Server Competition</span><hr size=1> Actually Kinu I was not being biased.

I never said they'd make people happy, just that Euro/Asian guilds will always have a significant advantage over US guilds as long as they can share servers.  <br>
And I really hope you aren't trying to say that the random spawns fixed a damn thing, laf.  Most mobs still spawn before US guilds can get online on patch day.  And even if they don't, US guilds have about a 5-6 hour window where a mob can spawn and they can get to it.  If it spawns before that window, it's dead to Asian/Euro guild.  If it spawns after that window, it waits for a couple hours til a Asain guild gets it.  Randomizing the spawns did exactly zilch to solve the problem.<br>
As far as you quitting if they force you to move, I can understand that.  I wouldn't want to move from a server where I log on, rub my hands together in anticipation, and freely choose from a list of currently spawned mobs while US guilds are still at work.  <br>
I'd be pissed if they made me leave too.  But as I said, I'd try to be sympathetic but I don't think I'd do too good a job.<br>
<br>
Btw, please don't take this as an anti-Euro/Asian rant.  It's not.  It's simply a statement of the way things are and why they will not change as things are done now.  I don't hold my lack of mobs to kill due to the Asian/Euro timezone advantage against those guilds, I place the blame squarely on Verant for not addressing this issue.  <br>
I'm happy that you all have stuff to kill, it sucks when you don't.  At the same time, though, don't expect me to feel sympathy if you are forced to play on even footing with other guilds on a server when US guilds currently don't even get that chance.<br>

<br>
1. How many Guilds do NToV ?<br>
Leviathan and TR, but NToV usually rots, Leviathan cleared it last night because nothing was up, a rarity on Stormhammer with all the server crashes.<br>
<br>
2. How many Guilds kill Mobs in Ssra ? (XTC,...)<br>
Leviathan and TR<br>
<br>
3. How many Guilds kill &quot;Tier 8&quot; Mobs like AoW, HP,...<br>
AoW - Leviathan (4) and TR (12 or so)<br>
HP - Leviathan and TR have each killed HP once I think<br>
AL - Leviathan once, TR a few times<br>
<br>
4. How many Guilds race for Blood of Ssra ?<br>
TR only guild killing Blood, Leviathan only has 30 keys<br>
<br>
5. How many Guilds trying out Emp ?<br>
Just TR now, see #4<br>
<br>
6. At what time Mobs like KT, Burrower die's on your server?<br>
KT never lives more than an hour, Burrower dies every patch day.  But TR and Leviathan seem to both be getting a little burnt out.  Mobs seem to be living a little bit longer each crash or patch, but every major mob other than North ToV dies every patch.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just to give you an example about Stormhammer, Leviathan has 14 Creator kills under our belt in less than 2 months (since March 9th when we started to do DKP), with TR having a good 8 or 9... 22+ Creator kills in 7 weeks.<br>

And even if they don't, US guilds have about a 5-6 hour window where a mob can spawn and they can get to it. If it spawns before that window, it's dead to Asian/Euro guild. If it spawns after that window, it waits for a couple hours til a Asain guild gets it. Randomizing the spawns did exactly zilch to solve the problem.<br>
As far as you quitting if they force you to move, I can understand that. I wouldn't want to move from a server where I log on, rub my hands together in anticipation, and freely choose from a list of currently spawned mobs while US guilds are still at work. <br>
I'd be pissed if they made me leave too. But as I said, I'd try to be sympathetic but I don't think I'd do too good a job.&quot;<br>
<br>
@#%$ H, that's not how it works at all. I'm not in a top-tier guild, in fact I lead a tiny one, but I do raid with a mediumguild. Right on our level, maybe a bit below is, is an Asian coalition that sometimes gets stuff before us, just above us is CoL who are after a similar calibre of targets to us. We *do* have to compete; everyone on Bristlebane does, be it the big 3 (although AO are more our timezone than the other two) and downwards, just like virtually every other server. We're no Tunare but we're no Lanys either. The TRUE reason I don't want to move is that my own guild is primarily east-coast USA, and I'd not get to play EQ with them anymore. I'd lose in-game contact with a lot of great friends. That to me isn't worth getting shipped off to another server for, just because I raid.<br>
<br>
Random Spawn times *HAVE* helped but I agree they could do more. Forced moving is not the answer; a max. of 7 day spawn times and a slightly more random element, is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 1:32:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11109.topic&index=129>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &gt;&lt;</span><hr size=1> 1.
