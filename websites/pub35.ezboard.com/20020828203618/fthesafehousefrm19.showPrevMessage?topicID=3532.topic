This is an update to an older post: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=31300045">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=31300045</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
These are not end-all fix-all solutions for class balance, and are only intended to address Core abilities, and not Itemization, not Specific Styles, nor Realm Abilities. For example, Archers and Minstrels should not justify obtaining more core melee ability to counter the See Hidden realm ability that Assassins can potentially have. Instead, realm ability balance should be balanced in terms of abilities themselves (even if that means nerfing them).<br>
 <br>
And especially for the board trolls:<br>
<br>
- Listed fixes do not mean that this is the only way to fix a particular class.<br>
<br>
- Not mentioning a fix for a class does not mean that they do not need a fix.<br>
<br>
- Why do I propose enhancements for specializations that classes never use? If you really have to ask that question, I’ll let your few brain cells that you do have figure that out.<br>
<br>
- Read again board trolls: This is a post about core abilities, not about overpowered realm abilities. If you want to complain about how overpowered See Hidden is and use that to justify adding more core abilities to a class, go post elsewhere. Core abilities cannot be balanced in relation to potential realm abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a few specific cross-class changes:<br>
<br>
All Regeneration buffs (Cleric, Warden) need to have their healing rate increased by at least 2x.<br>
<br>
All Regeneration Chants (Minstrel, Bard, Skald) need to have their healing rate increased by at least 2x.<br>
<br>
All HoT (Heal over Time) spells (Shaman, Mentalist) need to have their effectiveness greatly increased to account that it is a castable spell with a short duration.<br>
<br>
In response to the last patch: Now that resistances apply to DoTs, DoT damage should now scale with the increased 35% to RvR damage, to bring it in line with DD and Melee damage bonuses. Any subsequent changes to the +35% RvR damage adjustment will now equally affect all those damage types, so DoT damage is no longer neglected.<br>

I really gotta stop feeding the trolls in the vnboards when I post there and keep responding, I keep getting the same kind of thoughtless responses over and over again, and I get suckered into responding thinking that if I teach a troll, they will stop trolling. I'm am severely mistakened. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 6/16/02 1:56:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/16/02 11:05:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3550.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Elaa?s Implementation List for Class Balance for 1.51F 6</span><hr size=1> Having played a Shaman to mid levels, what I discovered is this: the regen is very very effective out of combat and sitting.  It's only mildly effective in active combat.<br>
<br>
I think that this would be true for all regen spells, so perhaps the better way to look at changing this is to up the in combat regeneration rate by 25 to 50%.<br>
<br>
Unless they increase the in combat regen rate, I don't think insta cast regens would be of worth and I would suggest insta heals instead..but.. I'd say only give shamans the first insta (target) at say 35 spec in mend and then the group insta at 44 mend.  This would mean that they are very commited to the mend line before they get instas.<br>
<br>
I would also take the dd/bolt off the same timer and leave it at that.<br>
<br>
I also think they need to give healers a pbae short casting time medium damage dd on a 2-5 min timer.  I would put the pbae dd in the pac line I think.  I would not make it horribly powerful, but something that would allow them to do some damage.  Either that or give them some more spec points and the ability to spec hammer to half their level (but not enough spec points to spec to half their lvl..so they have to make some choices).  Healers often feel so unable to do damage in rvr that they give up.<br>

They are too busy healing to cast it much more in a teamed fight.  <br>
<br>
I don't think it would be too overpowering to have that dd on a separate timer..if they were soloin they would want to poison anways as I am sure it would be more powerful in the end.<br>
