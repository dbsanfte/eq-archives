Most were 50+  maybe 2 groups lower lvls who decided to stay and pitch in.  Cant heal the dwarves,  pretty much like you cant sow them to make them run faster.  You can have someone agro them and drag them away.  So far Thurgadin is still empty I think,  nothing there at all.  The giants didnt so much align them selves in lines at the waterfall so much as they ambushed us there with two groups of elite guards, these elites where much lower lvl though.<br>
<br>
As you go down the river from thurgadin there are only 2 paths you dont have to climb mountains or hills.  Those are the spots the giants came from and where the spearmen where lined up. MR wasnt all that bad,  at 52 I was getting spells to stick on the warlord,  and once I had him sundered I got off a starfire before he summoned me and taught me the error of my ways.<br>
<br>
Warriors where hitting for 149 max on me,  veterans maybe 170 180,  general wasnt much better than a verteran but the warlord was hittin in the 320s 330s,  and fast. You leave him along and he heals himself as well,  not very nice.<br>
<br>
For some reason my log file saw reason to stop in the middle,  no idea why,  maybe it got too large at near 5 megs.<br>
<br>
Some nice little log tidbits.<br>

[Wed May 09 16:33:26 2001] Sentry Badain Breathes deeply and blows into an ornate horn. The sound echos through the mountain pass. All local inhabitants scurry to take cover. <br>
<br>
[Wed May 09 16:34:30 2001] Sentry Badain says 'Excellent! All of your commanders have reported to the Dain, and none too soon mind you. We are getting reports of Kromrif troop movement in the area and final preparations must be made. Follow me and the Seneschal will brief you. <br>
<br>
[Wed May 09 16:50:38 2001] Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Good citizens of Thurgadin, hear me! Our city, our people, our very lives are in danger this day. The Kromrif are at this very moment marching towards us in an offensive they hope will bring about our demise... <br>
<br>
[Wed May 09 16:50:54 2001] Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'I hereby command, by authority of Dain Frostreaver the Fourth, that all able bodied Coldain fight to the death in defense of our land. Children, disabled citzens, and unseasoned travellers are advised to evacuate immediately! <br>
<br>
[Wed May 09 16:51:10 2001] Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'My fellow soldiers, take heart! For we are not alone in this endeavor. One among us, an outlander, has earned the title Hero of the Dain for valiant service to our people. This newcomer has brought with him allies that will fight alongside you to help bring about our victory. <br>
<br>
[Wed May 09 16:51:26 2001] Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'My friends... Brell did not place us here so many centuries ago to be slaughtered by these heathens. Nor did our forefather, Colin Dain, sacrifice himself simply to have us fail here now. Through these events we were brought to this day to test our strength and our faith. <br>
<br>
[Wed May 09 16:51:42 2001] Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Will we be shackled together to slave away in Kromrif mines or will we stand united and feed these beasts Coldain blades? By Brell I promise you, 'It is better to die on our feet than to live on our knees!' <br>
<br>
[Wed May 09 16:51:58 2001] Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'TROOPS, TAKE YOUR POSITIONS!!<br>

[Hand Dain Dirk - you get it back]<br>
[Tue May 08 15:59:28 2001] Dain Frostreaver IV says 'My good Iustus , you have served me well. You have flushed out all who sought to oppose me and my people. I am afraid I need to call upon you and your friends one final time. The dissension and treason ran deeper than I had anticipated. Our population has been cleansed, but we lost a full third of our army to the poisonous words of those rebels. In retaliation for your deeds, the Kromrif have made plans to attack us in this, our weakest hour. Can I count on your help outlander? <br>
[Tue May 08 15:59:46 2001] You say, 'you can count on my help'<br>
[Tue May 08 15:59:46 2001] Dain Frostreaver IV says 'Several of our greatest officers, including a few veterans from the War of Yesterwinter are assembling just outside our city. Gather your army at once and give this parchment and the ninth ring to Sentry Badian. I will remain inside the city with a few of my troops to defend it against any who might penetrate your defense. May Brell be with you, Iustus . <br>
<br>
Greater Divide:<br>
[Wed May 09 14:23:34 2001] You say, 'Hail Sentry Badain'<br>
[Wed May 09 14:23:34 2001] Sentry Badain says 'I be on official business from the Dain himself. If ye haven't been sent by him then please just be movin along now. <br>
[Hand him note from Dain]<br>
[Wed May 09 14:23:58 2001] Sentry Badain Breathes deeply and blows into an ornate horn. The sound echos through the mountain pass. All local inhabitants scurry to take cover. <br>
[Entire zone repop, nothing is up in zone, including pets]<br>
[Wed May 09 14:25:03 2001] Sentry Badain says 'Excellent! All of your commanders have reported to the Dain, and none too soon mind you. We are getting reports of Kromrif troop movement in the area and final preparations must be made. Follow me and the Seneschal will brief you. <br>
[I missed some of the speaking here]<br>
[Wed May 09 14:26:06 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Very well, Garadain, the eastern post is yours. I'll place Kargin and his bowmen on the hill to the west, and Churn, you'll station your troops up near the caves just past them. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:26:10 2001] Churn the Axeman says 'Understood sir. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:26:13 2001] Sentry Badain says 'Excuse me Seneschal Aldikar, you instructed me to report to you when the outlander returned. I have brought him. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:26:19 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Perfect timing outlander, please be seated and listen carefully. Badain, yer dismissed. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:26:28 2001] Sentry Badain says 'Sir, yessir! <br>
[Wed May 09 14:26:44 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'We knew the day might come when the Kromrif would discover the location of our beloved city. It was only prudent for there to be a plan for such a circumstance. In light of recent developments, however, our plans have been adjusted. Outlander, the Dain has appointed you to lead our armies in defense of Thurgadin. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:27:00 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'I will stand here with a handful of men as a final line of defense. Should I fall, all will be lost. You will have these men and their soldiers to command. Use them wisely, you will be richly rewarded if your forces are able to keep them alive. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:27:16 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Garadain will post his men in the gorge to the east. Churn and his men will await your command in the caves to the west. Dobbin will have his forces at the ready in the clearing directly south of here near the towers. If any Kromrif make it to his vicinity he and his men will attack with or without your command. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:27:32 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Lastly, Corbin will hide his men in the worm caves to the south, call on him for a surprise attack. Remember where these men are stationed, outlander. Should they call out for help you may wish to send some of your people to aid them. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:27:48 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'The leader of this invasion is a powerful Kromrif named Narandi. Rumor has it that he is more powerful than any ten of his peers. He must fall. When he is slain you must show his head and the ninth ring to me. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:28:04 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Scout Zrelik here will follow you and serve as your herald. He will relay your orders to the troops. Show me your ninth ring now to verify your identity and I will give you the orders to memorize. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:31:59 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Outlander, the enemy won't wait for you to tarry. Show me the ring or we'll fend for ourselves. I'll only wait a minute longer! <br>
[Hand him ring - you get it back]<br>
[Wed May 09 14:32:04 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Commit these orders to memory, Iustus , have them ready to speak at a moment's notice. When you are finished memorizing, repeat them to me. Tell your soldiers to prepare themselves. When the orders are handed to Zrelik we will take up our positions. <br>
Dont have screenshot of orders, it is a note, that gives you these commands, for each Hero, and the last to summon them all:<br>
Garadain to my side!<br>
Dobbin assist me!<br>
Chum protect me!<br>
Corbin, attack!<br>
For the Dain, attack!<br>
[Wed May 09 14:37:18 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Outlander, the enemy approaches. If you do not hand Zrelik the orders you will not be able to command the Coldain armies. You have one minute remaining. <br>
[Wed May 09 14:38:17 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Sorry outlander, I'm afraid we cannot wait any longer. Do all you can to protect the city. We will fend for ourselves. <br>
[Zrelik despawned]<br>

[Wed May 09 14:38:59 2001] Seneschal Aldikar says 'Commit these orders to memory, Iustus , have them ready to speak at a moment's notice. When you are finished memorizing, repeat them to me. Tell your soldiers to prepare themselves. When the orders are handed to Zrelik we will take up our positions. <br>
[Give Zrelik the note - he becomes your pet]<br>
[Wed May 09 14:40:57 2001] Zrelik the Scout says 'At yer service, Iustus . Remember now, before issuing me an order ya must disengage from any combat and be sure yer speakin to me. Now let's get down to the business of killin some Kromrif! <br>
[Wed May 09 14:41:10 2001] Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Good citizens of Thurgadin, hear me! Our city, our people, our very lives are in danger this day. The Kromrif are at this very moment marching towards us in an offensive they hope will bring about our demise... <br>

You get your dirk back when you hand to Dain, and you get the ring back when handing in to various folks, so if you fail, you just need to wait for Dain and the Sentry to return.<br>
<br>
Since Dain is dead on TM, we wont be able to re-try till next week, but if there were multiple people on the server with 9 rings, then someone else could re-try after Sentry Badain (Dain misspeaks his name) repops. It looks like Sentry Badain is a 12-28 hour spawn, and not up on patch, but that is a guess at this point.<br>

[Note, its possible that if you hand your ring to the Seneschal during the war, the Scout will respawn]<br>
<br>
I did not try any pet commands on the scout, so I do not know if they work (/pet back off, etc). He does follow you around like a pet.<br>
<br>
If you have him selected and speak any of those phrases, they will call that force to you. Any that are engaged previously or enroute will not come. If they arrive and there is nothing to fight, they will return to their positions. They run to you, but walk home.<br>
<br>
The person running this battle needs to be very careful to not get engaged and if anything does hit him, to have his group there to take that thing out so he can back off and direct the fight.<br>
<br>
We had people snaring, fearing, and even a bard casting gate on mobs to thin them out as we fought.<br>
<br>
I was foolish and got killed in that attack (once I was agro, they kept summoning me), if that had not have happened, we would have been more coordinated.<br>
<br>
Then, when the warlord attacks, you need to have a plan to split them and get them dead.<br>

Anyone can say 'You can count on my help' to Dain to get a note.<br>

I think almost everyone there had a lot of fun, even though most died many times each. They all asked when we would do it again.<br>

Well, we will be doing it again, one week from tomorrow. I appologise to those who want to see the final stats, I suspect one of the other servers will get it done sooner, but we have sky this weekend and people need a rest. On Tarrew Marr we will be doing the war again on Thursday, May 17.<br>

from my view all was going ok till people trained back the last wave (ten level 58+ giants + the level 60 warlord) too early. they were fighting 3 or 4 veterans, than the warlord was trained in and than even more veterans. lots of shouts/oocs were maid to train them away, but there was either not enough people left to kite or nobody who was ready to doing it (with the massive lag i was too slow with jboots to do it for more than 30 secs).<br>
