<br>
You want to compare Bards to Wizards, and then cry that they can't nuke as well? Give me a break. Can wizards melee? Can they run at super speed? Can they charm? No, stfu, thanks.<br>
<br>
Compare Bards to Rogues, shall we? Yeah, they can both dual wield, good job. But again, Rogues can't charm, run, heal, or have any mana regen capabilities. Rogues can't solo 3 mobs at once, for decent exp.<br>
<br>
Bards to Clerics! Oh my god, Bards can't heal as well! Let's have a pity party! Clerics have a worse damage-absorption rate than Bards, Rogues (chain), or Monks (leather). Even Shamen tank better than Clerics. Clerics can nuke better, thanks to the 925damage Luclin spell. But can we Mezz? Not without alot of rooting and stunning ;) Can we Charm? Nope.<br>
<br>
Stop crying, please. Bards get ALOT of skills, but end up short-ended on all of them by the end. In the begin game, Bards are on par with every other class, combined. They have the charm/mezz/mana of an Enchanter, Regen/Healing of Priests, Slows of a Shaman, and tank better than alot of other melee classes. If you want to play a Bard, you know damn well from the beginning that your usefulness gets cut short two-thirds of the way into your life. You're still a great class, fun to play as well, but just because you can do alot of things other classes can't, and classes that can do things you can end up doing it better, doesn't mean that you're broken. Necromancers are broken, not Bards. <p><center><a href="http://fenthen.hypermart.net" target=Fenthen><img src="http://fenthen.hypermart.net/FenJea1.gif" alt="Fenthen" border=0></A><br>

<br>
... I LOVE it because it gets discussion across classes going and helps people learn about other classes, or a class learn about what others feel about them. I love that this thread is still active.<br>
Thank you The Safehouse community, thank you posters )<br>
<br>
&quot;Bardic speed is a class-defining skill.&quot;<br>
<br>
... Bardic speed WAS a class-defining skill. Cleric exp rezzes were a class-defining skill.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bardic speed isn't a convenience. It does not solely exist to make travel easier. My speed is my survival. Allowing Horses into the game -does- equate into giving away Backstab or FD. Don't believe me?&quot;<br>
<br>
... I have to agree.<br>
Bard speed is one of the cornerstones of the solo bards game: we can't root, our snare takes 6 seconds to cast and last 18 seconds (IF not resisted), we cannot survive most exp mobs toe-to-toe melee.<br>
Bard speed, track, and invis are the cornerstones to bard outdoor pulling, CRs (with coprse song too of course), and scouting.<br>
<br>
&quot;You take away my speed? You nearly eliminate my ability to solo.&quot;<br>
<br>
... agree, but who said they are taking away your speed? Mobs can't buy horses... can they?<br>
I figure horses hurt PvP more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any Bard worth their salt will never fess up to being a &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot;. Because we aren't.&quot;<br>
<br>
... agree, never quite understood that one. I always figured Druids were more of the &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Running fast does not effect anything but travel and kiting. It was a nifty thing, but not much more than a parlor trick... similar to illusion masks, NOT backstab.&quot;<br>
<br>
... totally disagree. I think you'll find MANY classes will agree anything that is essential to their kiting is substantially more than &quot;a nifty thing/parlor trick&quot;.<br>
... even in raids or taking or uber encounters speed can be essential for pulling or kiting (to avoid despawn, to seive, etc.).<br>
<br>
&quot;everyone would play a bard&quot;<br>
<br>
... hehe, I would love to see more bards.<br>
Most people hate the labor involved with continual re-casting that also makes you unable to chat.<br>
<br>
&quot;BTW everyone who was crying about the horses bein ALMOSt as fast as their selos, are you forgetting that they cost like 30k&quot;<br>
<br>
... I'll pay 60k for FD/Backstab, is that cool? I'll even take one that takes a few seconds to activate, I'm not picky.<br>
<br>
&quot;bards get a much more convenient, cheaper (and 3% faster) song that they can whip out at any givin time&quot;<br>
<br>
... &quot;bardspeed&quot;:<br>
1) requires most bards to tie up both primary and secondary slots with a statless 2-handed item, making certain songs requiring other instruments (like their invis) practically impossible while traveling (until level 49 at which time we get a 2.5 minute duration speed song)<br>
2) lasts 18 seconds (until level 49) requiring constant recasting (taking up 1/3 of the 3 songs effects bards can have up at one time from constant recasting): I bought my bards TBoots which he used extensively until he was level 49.<br>
3) can miss notes on cast, and for some reason when a note is missed they usually  miss 1-5 times upon subsequent recasting attempts.<br>
4) does not allow for medding like horses do.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want to compare Bards to Wizards... Can they run at super speed?&quot;<br>
<br>
... they can now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bards get ALOT of skills, but end up short-ended on all of them by the end.&quot;<br>
<br>
... my experience with my bard was that our playstyle and resources never scaled well. Consequently, our game evolves and changes to reflect new spells we get at different stages in our level advancement (as we ditch most the old ones that become worthless on mobs 5+ levels higher than the song). This really wasn't a problem for most levels as the new songs are GREAT as a bard advances.<br>
Until around 50, I did feel that bards were incredibly powerful.<br>
At 50+ most our old stuff breaks down comletely, and the new stuff we get is either unable to handle encounters at our level, or not enough be able to do more than MAYBE help another class get something done.<br>
Bard solo at high levels is all about using our 50- game on exp mobs from the 50- game.<br>
Bard group at high levels is all about helping enhance the real group you need to get the job done. The group doesn't need the bard, but maybe it can help speed em up. Conversely, if the group loses a key member (FD puller, Crowd Control, Tank, Healer, Damage, Slower, Rezzer) then it's over and everyone goes home.<br>
Old songs don't scale for bard (which in of itself is not a problem), and post 50, new songs are already inadequite to handle single group high level situations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uryanflaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ryanflaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/27/02 4:49:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24490.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uh...</span><hr size=1> Let's see, bards are very good soloers, very sought after and useful in exp groups, and very beneficial on raids.

They have a couple of bugs?  AA isn't fantastic?  Some abilities don't work the way they prefer?  Well a lot of classes have issues like that, big deal.  Despite all that bards are still one of the overall strongest classes, period.

I have seen bards kiting 20 mobs effectivly.  <br>
<br>
Everyone wants a bard in an AE group.  If ya don't your sorta silly.<br>
<br>
Its true you only need one or two bards on a raid, but then how many shamen do you need on a raid?<br>
<br>
I have played a bard and enjoyed my time as one but the class is just not for me.  I know many bards out there that LOVE their class and its abilities.  To many people play bards bad or without combining their abilities (this includes me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I think I have only met 2 people that actually play the class to its full potential. <p>Officer Synergy Collective

Ack! What an awful XP group, why the hell whould you possibly want a cleric, shaman, chanter,and bard in an XP group.<br>
<br>
Lets try this one ... Pally, Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, Bard - I think this was one of the best disco groups I've seen.<br>
<br>
I will take a bard over a chanter for an XP group any day.<br>
<br>
Bards are a great class, they can solo, group, and still have a reason to show up to raids (Mana Song, Haste, etc ...) they even get to cheat and stack things (Tash + JMan Stick + Tash Orb) that others can't. I don't see the problem. <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=72537>Nottom Thunderferret</a><BR>

<br>
What the heck is an XP group?<br>
Sounds like an oxymoron to me.<br>
Experience is best done for most (DEFINITELY not all) classes solo, or in an experience farming method like AoE groups.<br>
(NOTE: I WOULD DEFINITELY say that I think that ALL classes should be modified so they can have SOME form or soloing).<br>
Experience is one goal, and one that is most often best achieved doing repetitive motions in the same zone, on the same overcon mob... then moving to another overcon mob to do the same motions on when that mob light blues out.<br>
<br>
The real interesting stuff for me are the high level encounters/adventures that most often result in a LOSS of exp, but maybe camp/get a neat unique item or the chance to see a new zone/mob/etc.<br>
For these type things you need the classes that are gonna be able to handle situations: rez, heal, crowd control, tank, pull.<br>
<br>
I would like to see other non-bard classes changed so that they can enjoy some sort of real solo game (maybe make clerics able to solo certain undead mobs/encounters, etc.).<br>
<br>
I would like to see more dual class answers to basic needs of the group (like cleric/pal for rez); and done so that every class has a &quot;backup&quot; roll ability to at least one other, so many classes are already so close.<br>
<br>
On a side not, as a bard I think AoE songs hurts bards and should be removed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have grouped with bards and I have never seen a better class when played correctly. Karnors WL room. 58 level bard was main tank, crowd control, healer, and puller. It was almost comical at the ease the bard had control of the room.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tank: bards can't tank.<br>
Maybe he was UBER equipped, maybe the mobs were trivial to his level.<br>
Crowd Control: bards can't use any of their crowd control on mobs 56+, making this great in EXP situations (farming weak mobs that still give exp) but insufficient in higher levels encounters.<br>
Healer: IF a 58 bard forgoes ALL melee (ok, they CAN use hand-to-hand... which maxxes at 100 and does virtually no damage) by equiping an UBER 2-handed 9 Agi, 9 Dex, 15 cha chunk of wood, AND dedicate 2 of the 3 songs they can have up at all times, THEN they can heal up to a staggering 37 hp's every 6 seconds.<br>
Puller: Bards can't FD, any bad pull in a dungeon and you run out of options quickly.<br>
Why is a 58 bard in Karnor's?<br>
<br>
&quot;I have seen bards kiting 20 mobs effectivly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really?<br>
Bards can chant/fear kits one mob.<br>
Bards can quad kite with four mobs (1 pet and 3 mobs to beat on the pet).<br>
ANYTHING over 4 is just gonna aggro the bard and get in the way.<br>
Sure a bard can keep em on his tail to maybe more easily replace one of the 4 he is using to quad, but ultimately it is not mobs they are actually engaging.<br>
<br>
Bards CAN AoE TONS of mobs... as long as the mobs are low level green and are in one area. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uryandi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryandi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 3:16:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24490.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard issues</span><hr size=1> &quot;Tank: bards can't tank.&quot; Can't tank raid mobs you mean? Cause any melee or hybrid can tank exp type mobs. Even high lvl exp mobs especially slowable ones.<br>
<br>
&quot;Crowd Control: bards can't use any of their crowd control on mobs 56+, making this great in EXP situations (farming weak mobs that still give exp) but insufficient in higher levels encounters.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since the introduction of aa means the exp grind never ends exp is still a valid area of the game 60 and beyond.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Healer: IF a 58 bard forgoes ALL melee (ok, they CAN use hand-to-hand... which maxxes at 100 and does virtually no damage) by equiping an UBER 2-handed 9 Agi, 9 Dex, 15 cha chunk of wood, AND dedicate 2 of the 3 songs they can have up at all times, THEN they can heal up to a staggering 37 hp's every 6 seconds.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you can heal more than that while still meleeing with epic.  Also I've seen bards maintaining 5 songs at once meaning they could do 3 other things besides heal.  Btw that 37 hp a tick would represent 2220 dmg healed per minute indefinately spread out over 6 members.  Thats more sustained healing than a 59 cleric can put out using the 59 heal over time.<br>
<br>
This doesn't represent a very fast means of healing but it can potentially greatly reduce downtime. In some exp grinds it should be the only healing you really need.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Puller: Bards can't FD, any bad pull in a dungeon and you run out of options quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Build a robust and skilled group and you should be able to handle overpulls in exp situations just don't bring the whole zone.<br>
<br>
Also fd isn't required in every situation.  In some situations bard speed + DA may actually be more useful.<br>
<br>
One the subject of kiting I have heard bards bragging about kiting far more than 4 mobs via the quading method described above.  They called it swarm kiting.<br>

Hinterdir, I am hoping with this thread to:<br>
1) expand non-bard general understanding of bards.<br>
2) expand bard general understanding from other classes.<br>
3) bounce ideas off non-bards and see if they make sense in a non-bard centric world.<br>
<br>
It affects the rogus class because it help that each class understand the other.<br>
Don't you find it helpful in play as a rogue to know the abilities/limits of what the classes you are grouped with can do?<br>
<br>
If this thread bugs the board I will move it, but there is so much valuable input lost when this type of thread is just referenced in a bard board.<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
<br>
&quot;Any melee or hybrid can tank exp type mobs. Even high lvl exp mobs especially slowable ones.&quot;<br>
<br>
Given a standard character from each class what is the order of tanking ability from greatest to least?<br>
(NOTE: I have NO clue, so PLEASE correct me where I am wrong)<br>
WAR &gt; PAL &gt; SHD &gt; RNG &gt; ROG &gt; SHM &gt; MNK &gt; BRD &gt; BST  CLR &gt; DRU &gt; WIZ &gt; ENC &gt; NEC &gt; MAG<br>
<br>
&quot;Since the introduction of aa means the exp grind never ends exp is still a valid area of the game 60 and beyond.&quot;<br>
<br>
Exp is like practice for the game.<br>
I agree that bards have an easy time at practice, they just aren't very impressive come game-time. (except for niche roles filled by 1 or 2 bards on raids)<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you can heal more than that while still meleeing with epic.&quot;<br>
<br>
If a level 58 bard equips epic to enhance the voice based heal component, juggles (swap out epic and lute with the casting of each voice/string based heal) Kelin's for the string based heal , and twist in the song amplification every 8th tick, then he/she can increase healing 4 more points to a total of 41 pts every 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Also I've seen bards maintaining 5 songs at once meaning they could do 3 other things besides heal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Special&quot; songs that can stack to produce more than 3 song sustained effects at once:<br>
<br>
* Amplification - increases voice based songs, lasts 30 seconds (drops if not cast every 8th song)<br>
* Song of Sustenance - freezes food consumption, lasts 1.5 minutes<br>
* Selo's Accelerating Chorus - bard speed, only works outdoors, lasts 2.5 minutes<br>
* Cinda's Charismatic Carillon - increase faction with one type, last until zone is left, self only, no icon<br>
* Breath of Harmony (bard only weapon, primary only) right insta-click - weapon must be equipped and does not stacked with bard healing songs<br>
* Song of Twilight - mez for level 55- mobs that lasts 5 ticks (2 more than normal)<br>
<br>
&quot;Btw that 37 hp a tick would represent 2220 dmg healed per minute indefinately spread out over 6 members. Thats more sustained healing than a 59 cleric can put out using the 59 heal over time.&quot;<br>
<br>
How many mobs are kind enough to spread damage over an entire party?<br>
Maybe in unique AoE only damage encounters.<br>
41 pts/tick would represent 410 dmg healed per minute.<br>
How many tanks take 410 damage per minute from a mob?<br>
I think ALL classes could tank at that dpm rate.<br>
(yes, dpm taken would be different for each class)<br>
<br>
&quot;In some exp grinds it should be the only healing you really need.&quot;<br>
<br>
Like fear kiting, quading, etc.? sure.<br>
Slaughtering massive amounts of overcons does not require tremendous defense or healing, I understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Build a robust and skilled group and you should be able to handle overpulls in exp situations just don't bring the whole zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
In which case just about any class can pull.<br>
<br>
&quot;On the subject of kiting I have heard bards bragging about kiting far more than 4 mobs via the quading method described above. They called it swarm kiting.&quot;<br>
<br>
swarm kiting = (messy) quad kiting.<br>
When quad/swarm kiting, bards can only target 1 mob at a time, and only a max of 3 mobs will attack that mob when it is charmed (by the bard) and gains aggro (when it attacks another mob).<br>
All the other mobs will just be adds, ignoring the pet and chasing the bard.<br>
Bards use the 3 aggroed mobs to beat on their pet and get its hp very low, then when charm breaks the mobs damage is wiped, and a bard can get credit (exp) for chant kiting (running and DoTing) the now almost dead former pet.<br>
There are a max of 4 mobs involved at any one time.<br>
Sure, a bard can pull the entire zone, but they can only use 4 at a time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umalimuse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malimuse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 9:23:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24490.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard issues</span><hr size=1> err....I have been soloing exp mobs in toe-to-toe melee since I was level 53, way before I got epic.  I have duo'd with rangers, warriors, monks, rogues, paladins, and shadowknights, and my regen (47th + 55th) is generally more than enough to keep up.  I have tanked mobs in the new CT, ssra, PoF, PoH, etc.....generally add mobs that can't be mezzed.  I have been in 6 person exp groups where the cleric nukes because our regen is just that good.  General exp mobs are cake for a bard to tank (VL, FG, Seb, the Grey, etc.), once they are slowed (even our piddely 31% slow at 60th).  I never chant kite, swarm kite, or charm kite (too boring for me).  I will occasionally fear kite in the Grey when waiting on raids to start.  Most of my solo exp is toe-to-toe melee, and I usually am surprised if I lose more than a half bubble of health.  And for reference, I am the 3rd or 4th best equipped bard in our guild (AoW, HP, Cursed, Tunare, etc capable guild).  There are a couple of bards outside our guild who have better stuff than I do.  I have roughly 3150 hps unbuffed and 1250 or so AC.....not even in the same zip code as Thott, Kinu, Bay, etc.<br>
<br>
As far as how effective we are on raids, anything more than 3-4 bards gets a bit much....but that can usually be said about shamans, enchanters, mages, Beastlords as well.  I am generally in the rogue group, because we have two bards that are farther along in AA points, and have Instrument Mastery etc., so one of them is generally in the main tank group.  With Damage shield stacking, our Main Tank gets a sustained 135 point DS.  In a fight against a mob like AoW (unslowable, flurries), that is basically like having 2 extra warriors hitting it for free.  In the rogue group, I add the 25% stackable haste, Rondo's (attack buff), and whatever utility song needs to be song (OOS, mana, whatever).  That means I am adding 12.5% free damage to every rogue in the group.....multiply that by 5, and there is about 3500 points/minute in damage just from the haste song.  I do roughly 3000 points/minute in melee myself (unless it is in Ssra, with the sick AC mobs) on raid mobs.  Other responsibilities that get split among the bards are Orb of Tishan (-33 to magic resistance), Journeyman's stick (-23 to magic resistance), and Claw of Zlandicar (AC, str, and agil debuff).  Because of our stacking, we can drop all of these on a mob (in addition to shaman/enchanter debuffs), meaning the mob is weaker and our raid force is stronger.  Having AoE mana means that only one bard has to sing it, and the other bards are free to do other things.  Saying that AoE mana song is bad for our class, basically says that you think bards are nothing more than mana whores. <br>
<br>
Not sure where you are getting that bards suck on raids, because we always want to have 3-4 bards on our raids.  I am not sure what you are raiding, where you are raiding, or what level you are, but a 60th level bard with IM3 and epic is a powerhouse.  I guess I must just be one of those lucky bards who is in a guild that has knowledge and respect for the class.  Don't generalize that &quot;all bards can't tank&quot;, &quot;raids don't want/need more than 1-2 bards&quot;, &quot;bards suck on raids&quot;, because at least in our guild that isn't even close to being true.  If you are going to make those statements, give the frame of reference you are working in.<br>

I don't want to run off non-bard readers by getting overly detailed in the semantics of bard play.<br>
<br>
Hopefully it will at least shed some more light for non-bards on the relative versatility of different bards at different levels.<br>
<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;I have been soloing exp mobs in toe-to-toe melee since I was level 53&quot;<br>

<br>
That is absolutely UBER UBER hp and armor and accomplishments.<br>
What the hell does your Magelo look like?<br>
3rd or 4th best? How insane are your guildmates equipped?<br>
<br>
In contrast, (while I am only level 54) I am considered VERY well equiped (&quot;twinked&quot;) with gear worth WELL over 100k+ and have maxed defense (for my level), and my stats are:<br>
1630 hp and 1049 AC unbuffed<br>
<br>
The feats you have been able to do, and the gear you have at your disposal are NOT indicative of the bard class for MOST people in the game.<br>
<br>
It's like tossing a Fungi on a lowbie and using that as a guideline to assess a classes abilities at the low end game.<br>
<br>
I have a level 26 Shammy with about 60k in gear and he can melee w/ no spells even cons without much difficulty, HOWEVER, this is NOT the rule for most Shamans at this level.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saying that AoE mana song is bad for our class, basically says that you think bards are nothing more than mana whores.&quot;<br>
<br>
AoE mana/resist songs reduce the need for multiple bards to fill those roles.<br>
As far as &quot;mana whores&quot;, there are times when a bard can be most effective for a group/raid by providing mana, but this is just one role that they can provide.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not sure where you are getting that bards suck on raids&quot;<br>
<br>
Bards do not suck on raids.<br>
I said &quot;bards... aren't very impressive come game-time. (except for niche roles filled by 1 or 2 bards on raids)&quot;<br>
How big are these raids using 3-4 bards?<br>
How many of them are needed on every raid?<br>
<br>
&quot;... not even in the same zip code as Thott, Kinu, Bay, etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
I really have not tried to address Thott's points directly in my posts, but I HOPE that Thott was addressing issues relative to the bard class in general, and NOT simply issues that he faces relative to his own game.<br>
<br>
That would be about as useful as Bill Gates asking the U.S. Treasury to print billion dollar bills so he can carry around cash easier.<br>
<br>
You are NOT playing a typical bard, nor do you play like a typical bard.<br>

So let me get this straight...  You are a 54th level, admittedly &quot;twinked&quot; bard (you have much more AC and HP at 54th level than I had, that is for damn sure, and you even make a point to say how much your gear is worth).  You don't have OOS, you dont' have Catana of replenishment, you don't have Chorus of Replenishment, you don't have 60th level slow, you don't have 57th level Rondo (haste/DS/attack buff), you don't have Warcry, you don't have bard group DA, you don't have 60th level mana drain, you don't have arch-type and class AA abilities, you aren't in a raiding guild....but you know the abilities and limitations of bards that have and do all of the above?  I am not going to  debate this stuff with you, because you are not working from a position of first-hand knowledge.  If you are going to discuss bards roles on raids, at least have done it.....or been in a situation where you can observe it first-hand.  <br>
<br>
and since you asked for it:<br>

<br>
&quot;So let me get this straight... You are a 54th level, admittedly 'twinked' bard&quot;<br>
<br>
Self-twinked. This is my only character above level 26, I am unguilded, and no one has given me pp or items.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=171445">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=171445</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
&quot;you have much more AC and HP at 54th level than I had&quot;<br>
&quot;I have been soloing exp mobs in toe-to-toe melee since I was level 53&quot;<br>
<br>
Then how did you straight up melee solo exp mobs at level 53?<br>
Or are you talking taking on light blue con mobs with heavy loss of hp?<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have OOS,<br>
you dont' have Catana of replenishment,<br>
you don't have Chorus of Replenishment,<br>
you don't have 60th level slow, <br>
you don't have 57th level Rondo (haste/DS/attack buff), <br>
you don't have Warcry, <br>
you don't have bard group DA, <br>
you don't have 60th level mana drain, <br>
you don't have arch-type and class AA abilities, <br>
you aren't in a raiding guild....but you know the abilities and limitations of bards that have and do all of the above?&quot;<br>
<br>
The mechanics of EQ are not overly complex.<br>
Do not kid yourself.<br>
This is a TIME expenditure game, accumulating resources and learning then coordinating to apply those resources to defeat encounters, NOT a game of skill.<br>
The AI is NOT complex.<br>
And, MOST players do not even figure out the solution for scenarios for themselves but instead follow instructions/guides from others in how to do it.<br>
<br>
Doing extensive research, reading articles, posting questions, and using player made tools allows for a tremendous amount of understanding... even prior to actual in-game experience.<br>
Which is why I have the items I have at my level.<br>
That being said:<br>
60th slow: slows at a lower percent than the 51 slow, lasts a minutre, has a dot component.<br>
Rondo: has a stackable DS component, a smaller, non-stackable haste than many other bard songs, and str/atk adjustment.<br>
Warcry: 25% stackable haste, lasts 21 seconds<br>
60th level mana drain: 13 second recast, high mana drain, great song MOST bards will NEVER see this song<br>
bard AA: what magic rabbit you gonna pull out of this hat?<br>
What is your point?<br>
<br>
NO I do not have extensive raid experience, and I do chalk my comments on that area up to feedback from others.<br>
From responses they do not seem to be that out if line.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not going to debate this stuff with you, because you are not working from a position of first-hand knowledge.&quot;<br>
&quot;I never chant kite, swarm kite, or charm kite&quot;<br>
<br>
You do not use bards in a manner consistent with the majority of bards out there, by your own logic (not mine) you should not comment on the playability of bards outside of uber guild raids and uber equiped bard soloing/group tactics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulammfallaway.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lamm Fallaway</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 4:40:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24490.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard issues</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You want to compare Bards to Wizards, and then cry that they can't nuke as well?

Compare Bards to Rogues, shall we? Yeah, they can both dual wield, good job. But again, Rogues can't charm, run, heal, or have any mana regen capabilities. Rogues can't solo 3 mobs at once, for decent exp.<br>
<br>
Bards to Clerics! Oh my god, Bards can't heal as well! Let's have a pity party! Clerics have a worse damage-absorption rate than Bards, Rogues (chain), or Monks (leather). Even Shamen tank better than Clerics. Clerics can nuke better, thanks to the 925damage Luclin spell. But can we Mezz?

<br>
&quot;I think you can heal more than that while still meleeing with epic. Also I've seen bards maintaining 5 songs at once meaning they could do 3 other things besides heal. Btw that 37 hp a tick would represent 2220 dmg healed per minute indefinately spread out over 6 members. Thats more sustained healing than a 59 cleric can put out using the 59 heal over time.&quot;  <br>
<br>
you think he saw a bard with 5 songs at once, i'll bet you money that 2 of those songs are procs.  a VERY well played bard with a VERY good connection can keep 4 songs up without dropping but that is it.  99% of bards only twist 3 songs.  <br>
<br>
then everything else has been said pretty much...<br>
