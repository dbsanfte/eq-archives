<h3><a name="about">About the FAQ</a></h3><br>
This FAQ originated as a EZBoard thread that started because the monkly-business boards were becoming very cluttered with the same questions, over and over again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The most recent version of this FAQ can be found as a stickied post in the main forum, or on <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com">Monkly-Business</a>.<p><br>

<h3><a name="quests">Monk Quests</a></h3><br>
<b><a name="mq1">Q: Is Brother Qwinn broken?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Probably not. It's not at all unheard of for Qwinn to go long periods without spawning, especially when there's a lot of patching going on. Since he has no PH that we're aware of, you'll just have to park in SK and/or bother someone with tracking. If a Guide or GM tells you he's on vacation, or is broken, chances are that they're just not familiar with how the quest/NPC works, and is making something up.  Note:  a recent patch (January 23) increased Qwinn's spawn rate, so he should be less of a problem now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq2">Q: How do I get the Ancient Cyclops to spawn for JBoots?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Check out the guide <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=494.topic" target=new>here</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq3">Q: Is Trunt/Eejag/Raster/Zephyl/whatever doable with this group/solo?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Depends on group layout/your equipment.  Statistics and abilities of the mobs are posted in various threads and guides, it should be easy for you to figure out on yourself how much power you need for what mob.  <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=618.topic" target=new>Keyeluke's guide on Zephyl ganking</a> will help you here, and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=1" target=new>Bodi's Epic Guides</a> will help you with the others.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq4">Q: Can I kill Brother Zephyl and Brother Qwinn for the Robe of the Lost Circle?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Yes, you can; however, they don't drop it every time.  Also, they won't always appear to be wearing it, even if they have it -- if you zoned in after they spawn, they won't show as wearing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq5">Q: <i>Should</i> I kill Brother Zephyl or Brother Qwinn for my RotLC?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Please don't kill Qwinn.  He's hard enough to find without people killing him, and Zephyl is easy to spawn.  If you want to kill Zephyl, go right ahead. It's up to you whether you want to spend the time camping Raster/Targin, or kill Bro Z. Nobody cares how you get your epic (as long as you don't kill Qwinn), so long as you're honorable about it towards other players. Posting this question on MB serves only to create flame wars. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq6">Q: How do I get Coldain Ring (insert number)?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: There are a number of excellent ring guides around, including <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=97" target=new>this one</a> for the first 7 solo, and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=109" target=new>part one</a> and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=108" target=new>part two</a> of another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq7">Q: I am trying to do this quest -- anyone know how it works?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: If we do, the answer will be either on the <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm7" target=new>Monk Quest Forum</a>, the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=2" target=new>Monk Quests Page</a>, the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=1" target=new>Epic Quest page</a>, or the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=3" target=new>General Quests Page</a>.  Otherwise, please post in the Quests forum, and we'll all get working on it!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq8">Q: Does Multi-Questing still work?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Yes. Any quest where the reward is given after multiple items are handed in is multi-questable, with the person handing in the last piece of the quest items gaining the item.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq9">Q: No, Multi-Questing must be broken, Brother Balatin just ate my Robe of the Lost Circle, and the 2 pipes I was getting multi-quested.</a></b><br>
<br>
A: No, multiquesting is fine. You just had charm break before the final trade in, causing an memwipe of any no-drop items that were handed in. Next time, use a fixed duration charm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq10">Q: No, I'm <i>sure</i> multiquesting is broken!  I just tried to get some velious armour, and the MQ didn't work!</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Everyone who hands in an item for a multiquest must have the faction necessary to do the quest.  So if someone didn't, the MQ qon't work (except that someone else could hand in the item the person with insufficient faction did, and get the item).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq11">Q: Can I complete the epic prior to being level 50?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: Yes, it has been done, though the effect is not usable until level 50.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq12">Q: What are the 'ancient thin flute' and 'mechanical Iksar tail' for?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: From <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kurrleeeci/ShackleGuideText.html" target=new>Kurrlee's quest guide</a>: <br>
<br>
Ancient thin flute: once given to brother balatin in the dreadlands, he will despawn and then respawn in a version that needs to be killed.<br>
<br>
The mechanical Iksar tail is used in the "Peace of Mind" part of the shackle of tynnonium. It is need if you have been gave a faded white tome by the librarian of kaesora.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq13">Q: How do i get the shackle of scale?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: There is no shackle by that name currently in EQ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="mq14">Q: What is beyond the Shackle of Steel?</a></b><br>
<br>
A: There is the Shackle of Tynnonium, and then the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Kurrleeeci/ShackleGuideText.html" target=new>Whistling Fists</a>.<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="monkeq">Monk Equipment</a></h3><br>
<b><a name="me1a"></a>Q:  Is FBSS haste 17% or 21%?</b><br>
<br>
A: There are 2 ways to measure haste. The first, and most generally used measure is of how much the haste increases the number of times you hit. The other measure is of how much the haste will decrease your weapon delay.<p><br>
<br>
The two measures are related in this way:<p><br>
<br>
% increase of number of times you hit = <b>a</b><br>
<br>
% decrease in weapon delay = <b>b</b><p><br>
<br>
(1-[100/(100+<b>a</b>)]) X 100% = <b>b</b><p><br>
<br>
If we use this for the FBSS, we get (1-[100/(100+<b>21</b>)]) X 100% = <b>17%</b><p><br>
<br>
So we see how FBSS will decrease your weapon delay by 17% and increase the number of times you hit by 21%.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me1"></a>Q: How does haste stacking work?</b><br>
<br>
A: There are 5 types of haste for purposes of stacking:<br>
<br>
1. Item Haste - e.g. that gained from wearing an item with the 'haste' effect on it. Such items include FBSS, Runed Bolster Belt, Cloak of Flames.<br>
<br>
2. Spell/Song Haste - e.g. that gained from either having a haste spell cast on you, or a bard song playing. This category includes the effect on the Robe of the Whistling Fists and the Celestial Fists and also the clickable effect on the Eyepatch of Plunder.<br>
<br>
3. Ervaj songs - There are 2 bard songs (a 5% one at 50, and a 10% one at 60) which stack on top of item and other spell/song haste but cannot go over the haste cap<br>
<br>
4. Vah Shir songs - Stack with item and all other song hastes and allow group members to go over the haste cap. <br>
<br>
5. Monk Discipline - 100 fist - stacks with everything<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are Haste Caps (for monks)of:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
85% (< lev 51)<br>
<br>
100% (51 - 60)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some examples:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some combos (with haste granted to clarify) assumed level 51+ for purpose of capping.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) FBSS (21%) + RoTWF (25%) = 46%<br>
<br>
2) FBSS (21%) + Epic (40%) = 61%<br>
<br>
3) FBSS (21%) + Speed of the Shissar (66%) = 87%<br>
<br>
4) FBSS (21%) + Shissar (66%) + Epic (40%) = 87%<br>
<br>
(note epic haste does not stack with shissar haste, however the<br>
<br>
ATK/AC boost elements do stack)<br>
<br>
5) Golden Sash of Tranquility (41%) + Shissar (66%) = 100% (haste is capped at a maximum of 100)<br>
<br>
6) SoTD (24%) + Shissar (66%) + Composition of Ervaj (10%) =100%, since Ervaj doesn't bring you over the cap.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are only 2 ways to exceed the haste cap of 100%:<br>
<br>
1) High level bard songs (e.g. Warsong of the Vah Shir - 25% haste) will stack with other spell hastes to take you to 125% <br>
<br>
2) 100 fist discipline ignores the haste cap and stacks with all other hastes in the game. Supposed 20%.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Max Haste Solo:<br>
<br>
41% haste item + 40% from epic= 81% (+ 20% from 100 fists if disc active)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Max Haste Grouped:<br>
<br>
41% haste item + Chanter/Bard Song Haste > 59% (eg. Shissar) + Warsong of the Vah Shir (25% stackable)= 125% (+ 20% from 100 fists if disc active).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me2"></a>Q: Do Holgresh Elder Beads still drop?</b><br>
<br>
A: No, they don't. Not that there's as much use for them nowadays, since they've been nerfed not to get aggro at all.  That said, there's a drop from the stone spider in SolB that has 5 charges of Eye of Zomm, as well as a tinkered piece called Stalking Probes that takes 106 tinkering skill to trivial and costs 16pp in components.  Make friends with a gnome today!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me3"></a>Q: Which of these two weapons is better?</b><br>
<br>
A: We can't answer this question unless you give us the complete stats of the weapons, as well as your level and the environment you intend to use the weapon in (i.e. XP grinding, raiding, etc). Even then, there are good <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/equipment.asp" target=new>guides and spreadsheets</a> you can use to do this comparison yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me4"></a>Q: I just got this AE proc weapon -- how do I use this thing?</b><br>
<br>
A: <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=126.topic" target=new>Cuthul Paindancer's guide to the Adamantite Bo Stick</a> will tell you all about your new toy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me5"></a>Q: Has the drop rate on the fungi tunic been nerfed?</b><br>
<br>
A: By anecdotal evidence, yes it has. It does still drop though.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me6"></a>Q: Is there going to be a change/nerf on the fungi tunic preventing monk use or changing the effect?</b><br>
<br>
A: No. It's been the same effect and usable by the same races/classes since day one. There is absolutely no reason they would/should alter it in any way shape or form.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me7"></a>Q: What is better? Fungi Tunic or PSC?</b><br>
<br>
A: Depends on what you plan to do and how much weight you can afford to wear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me8"></a>Q: What's pumice, and where can I get some?</b><br>
<br>
A: Crystallized Pumice is a 0.8wt, non-stackable, merchant-bought item that has 5 charges of Nullify Magic (a spell that removes the top 2 buffs an enemy has, for a 2.0second casting time). It's an invaluable tool for soloing, since you can pumice away SoW and damage shields on enemies and DoTs on yourself. It costs about 12pp, and is sold at any herb vendor (Ask your local alchemist. they'll know where the herb vendors are.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me9"></a>Q: I attacked a Wisp and a Ghoul and every attack said "You punch a Ghoul but it is INVULNERABLE" why can't I do damage to these monsters?</b><br>
<br>
A: Wisps, Ghouls and some other creatures require magic weapons to hit and do damage to them. At level 30 your fists become magical weapons, but until then you will need to obtain magical gloves to fight these creatures. Some gloves available are Wu's Fighting Guantlets(Tailor Created), Mesh Gloves(Frogloks in Guk and Qeynos Sewers), Treant Fists(Quest) All special attacks (except Kick) are magical too. However, the "kick" at the end of Instill Doubt is not -- so you need magic shoes to be able to successfully ID magic-damage-only monsters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me10"></a>Q: My bag just became NO DROP! What gives?!?</b><br>
<br>
A: You have a NO DROP item in the bag. Take it out, and your bag will be all better.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me11"></a>Q: What's the difference in AC between humans and Iksar?</b><br>
<br>
A: The difference is about 40AC at level 60; a rough formula you can use is that at level X, the difference in AC between equally-equipped, equally-statted Human and Iksar monks is X AC. Of course, the difference decreases as you go up in level.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me12"></a>Q: I just started fighting in Velious. What faction should I follow?</b><br>
<br>
A: Several lines of thought here. A)Follow the faction that your guild is on. B)Depends on how well equipped you are and who you group with. C)Depends on what quest armor you want <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me13"></a>Q: What Velious Quest armor should I shoot for?</b><br>
<br>
A: Depends on who you group with. Thurgadin is the easiest to do but also the one with the crappiest stats. Kael is pretty much the best of the four but is the hardest to get. Skyshrine falls somewhere in the middle.  Plane of Growth armour has the same stats as Thurgadin armour.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me14"></a>Q: How do I make the Thurgadin gate potion?</b><br>
<br>
A: Follow this <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=94">guide</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me15"></a>Q: Where can I find a good damage calculator/log parser/weapon comparer?</b><br>
<br>
A: There are a number of great log parsers -- <a href="http://www.kaishome.com/EQCompanion" target=new>EQ Companion</a>, MEqA, EQMonk, <a href="http://eqraider.tripod.com/index.html" target=new>EQ Raider</a>, even Copeland's will work for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me16"></a>Q: Where should I put my starter points?</b><br>
<br>
A:It isn't going to greatly affect your life as a monk where you put these, but given the importance of getting Stamina over 100 (which prevents combat abilities decreasing in long fights) and the lack of stamina on low end gear, its probably a good idea to put as many of them as you can into Stamina.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me16a"></a>Q: Should I go for hit points over everything?</b></br><br>
A: There is long a debate on HP>AC>RESIST>STAT<p><br>
<br>
Really it is going to be situational to your primary function, so you need to really sit down and decide what it is you most often find yourself doing.<p><br>
<br>
Do you solo? AC/HP is your goal (make your HP go further and get more hp. If you are soloing mobs, then you are at a level of encounters where AC still matters)<p><br>
<br>
Do you pull? HP/Resists (espicially end game, AC begins to mean squat. You will get barraged by spells however so the more you can take and the more you resist is imperative)<p><br>
<br>
Do you small group damage? Stats/haste (in most cases you are not MT (assuming you are post 30) so your role becomes damage. All else is secondary)<p><br>
<br>
Do you raid? Resists/HP (again, MTs should be doing their job so yours is to survive all collateral damage by resisting as much as possible and having the HP to endure. Yes, this puts you well suited for end game pulling as well, and that is by design.)<p><br>
<br>
Depending on what you do, is going to be your biggest push for how you stack your monk. Additionally, where your monk is at, is also reasonably important.<br>

<b><a name="me17"></a>Q: I heard that agi increases the effectiveness of dodge, block and riposte, should I focus on my agility?</b><br>
<br>
A: Increased agility appears to have two in game effects:<p><br>
(1) It slightly increases AC. Note there are critical levels for Agility though, if your AGI drops below 75 you lose a lot of AC, so don't wear anything that will reduce your AGI below this level.<br>
<br>
(2) It increases the chance that you will get a skill raise in defensive skills.<p><br>
Note: Whether agility affects AC more in a "quality" aspect as opposed to a "quantity" aspect is not known at this time, but it is a possibility.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me18"></a>Q: Strength makes me hit harder, shouldn't I put more skill into Strength?</b><br>
<br>
A: Strength has several in game effects:<br>
<br>
(1) It determines the amount of weight you can carry before becoming encumbered (This is not generally that useful for monks who generally only ever get encumbered when on their way to buy a tink bag in Sol A carrying 5250pp!)<br>
<br>
(2) It increases your average damage done per hit slightly (and it is slightly) by increasing your max damage<br>
<br>
(3) It increases your ATK.  Whether ATK increases due to strength help you hit a mob better the way ATK increases from Avatar and such do is up for debate; the general impression is that ATK increase from increased STR is a reflection of effect (2).<br>
<br>
(4) Very high strength also helps with the Blacksmithing skill.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me19"></a>Q: What does Dexterity do?</b><br>
<br>
A: Dexterity does NOT increase AC, i.e. it is nothing like dexterity in AD&D, which causes some confusion.<br>
<br>
Dexterity does:<br>
<br>
(1) Increase the chances that the 'Proc' on a weapon will go off.<br>
<br>
(2) Increase the chances of a skill raise in an offensive skill (Offense, 1hb, 2hb, HTH)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q. I'm level X, and my Z skill post 50 should cap at 252. Why isn't it going up anymore at level X?<br>
<br>
A. Because it caps there at level 60, it's a scaled progression throughout your 50's. Check the following for detailed information on your skill caps: Monk Skill Cap Tables<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q. Does Instill Doubt use the kick skill?<br>
<br>
A. No. Instill Doubt uses it's own skill and makes 2 checks per use, First to see if your kick connects, the second to see if you successfully fear your target. It is possible to gain 2 skills in ID from one use. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="me20"></a>Q: I am not getting any skill raises in Dodge, and I don't understand why!!</b><br>
<br>
A: You have to put at least one point in Dodge at a monk trainer before you can gain skill raises.<p><br>

<h3><a name="gnt"></a>Guides and Tactics</h3><br>
<b><a name="gt1"></a>Q: How do I split mobs, shake off adds, not bring too much mobs, and pull at a constant rate?</b><br>
<br>
A: Check <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=98" target=new>Laotzu's Guide to Advanced Pulling</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="gt2"></a>Q: What is "Tag Pulling"?</b><br>
<br>
A: Tag Pulling, also known as Chain Pulling, is different from, and yet similar to, chain aggro. Instead of each mob being triggered by the previous mob, players take turns triggering each other. <br>
<br>
If a mob is particularly dangerous, or the group camp spot is particularly far away, and it is unlikely that a single puller could bring this mob that far without dying, tag pulling is often used. Multiple pullers, usually all with the ability to Feign Death, either through spells or abilities, help bring the mob or mobs to the group. The first puller will aggro the mob and begin to run back to the group. When they reach a certain spot, or get too low on life, they will use Feign Death. The second puller stays back out of aggro range and has two choices. They can aggro all the mobs the first puller brought, or they can wait for some of them to wander off before pulling just a subset of them. There can be as many "legs" of a pull as necessary to cover the distance back to the group. <br>

<h3><a name="sns"></a>Stats and Skills</h3><br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns1"></a>Q: What's the ratio on my hands?</b><br>
<br>
A: You can find the answer in the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=70" target=new>Monk hand-to-hand Damage/Delay Table</a>. Once you get your epic, your fists will be 9/16, whether you're human or iksar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns2"></a>Q: What's this weight limit thing, and what's my weight limit?  I'm level X.</b><br>
<br>
A: Monks lose AC if they go over their weight limit (not their encumbrance limit -- this weight limit's a lot lower).  The higher level you are, and the further you exceed your limit, the more AC you lose; we're not quite sure what the formula is.  You can find your weight limit at any level in <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=107" target=new>Monkly-Business' guide on the subject</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns3"></a>Q: What level do Monks get Feign Death?</b><br>
<br>
A: Level 17 for both Human and Iksar monks. The skill must be trained.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns4"></a>Q: What breaks a successful Feign?</b><br>
<br>
A: Two things will break a sucessful feign: (1) getting hit by any spell except a dispell, beneficial or harmful, including AEs, and (2) moving.  There are lots of things that could make you move while FD -- steep slopes, accidentally right-clicking on a corpse (and thereby looting it) when you're trying to con a mob, or finishing a bandage all count as movement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns5"></a>Q: How often does Feign Death fail?</b><br>
<br>
A: After reaching Skill Level 100(Master), I would say the rate of failure is about 5%, possibly less. In these instances you receive a "[character name] has fallen to the ground" message, and the feign was never successful.  This is not a broken feign, it's a failed one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns6"></a>Q: What is my chance of memory-wiping a Mob?</b><br>
<br>
A: When feigning off mobs under level 32, Feign Death memory-wipes the mob every time it succeeds. With NPCs higher than level 32, you will usually(still have a chance of mem-wiping a mob at this level, just a much smaller chance) remain on the aggro list until they path back to their spawn point(assuming they left it to chase you) but they will ignore you if you don't stand back up. Once they reach their spawn point, they have approximately a 90% chance of forgetting you. If they do not forget you, they will have a larger aggro radius than usual with regards to you. One workaround is to camp out or use the /q feature. After a couple of minutes you can re-connect and you will know for sure you are off their hate list.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns7"></a>Q: Are there any known bugs in Feign Death?</b><br>
<br>
A: There are a few known bugs, all of which are notorious for being hard to repeat and hard to fix.  Sometimes, when using the first person view, attempting to immediately stand up after feigning will cause you to be unable to move. Sitting, then standing again will clear this, but be very careful because even green mobs will aggro on you if you sit. When pulling higher-level creatures I would recommend using a third-person view anyway, so practice using both the view and the skills early.  There is also a very annoying bug which causes FD to fail with no messages sometimes when there are multiple characters on a mob's aggro list(almost all the time during grouping/raiding). This is still being researched by Verant staff, and they seem to have reduced its occurrence (though it's not been totally fixed yet).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns8"></a>Q: When I get a new special attack, should I stop using the old one?</b><br>
<br>
A: Generally, yes. The newest special attack you have available is usually the best one to use. However, you may want to keep your Dragon Punch and Eagle Strike/Tail Rake skills up to speed, as some of our 50+ disciplines, and one of our Alternate Advancement skills use these abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns9"></a>Q: What is AAXP? When can I use it? </b><br>
<br>
A: Alternative Adancement Experience. You need to be level 51 or higher and have Everquest: Shadows of Luclin installed on your computer to enable it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns10"></a>Q: How do I enable AAXP? Do I choose the skill first then alot what percentage of xp I want going to that skill?</b><br>
<br>
A: In fullscreen mode(Not the view with all the buttons), press the 'V' key, as how you press the 'I' key to open your inventory. You earn the points first and then you alot them to whichever skill(s) you prefer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns11"></a>Q: What are the AAXP titles for monks?</b><br>
<br>
A: Baron(ess) at 6 points, Brother/Sister at 18 points, Sensei at 42 points.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sns12"></a>Q: Which AAXP skills should I go after first?</b><br>
<br>
A: Most people go for regen and run speed in the base skills, and then combat stability and combat agility in the archetypes, with Finishing Blow and comabt fury being other popular choices.<br>

<br>
<br>
<b><a name="msc4"></a>Q: What's the FD bug, and what can I do to fix it?</b><br>
<br>
A: "The FD bug" that people refer to is the one where you hit the FD key, fall over, don't get any of the various failure messages, but you still get beaten on like a madman. Some things you can do to fix it -- <br>
<br>
1. Make sure that autoattack is off when you hit FD. Make sure autoattack has been off long enough to catch up to your lag; that means waiting at least 3 seconds, if you're on a dialup or under raid lag.<br>
<br>
2. Move around a bit before you FD (unless you habitually get the "you have moved and are no longer feigning death" message). Most people jump back.<br>
<br>
3. Make sure that the failure wasn't caused by something more mundane, like a message you missed due to spam or lag.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, guides usually don't give rezzes for deaths due to "The FD Bug", since it's not a recognized one. Also, VI's said that they've tried to fix this one, and its occurrence has been greatly reduced since they've said it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="msc5"></a>Q: I failed FD 6 times in a row when I logged on right after the most recent patch! has there been a nerf to FD?</b><br>
<br>
A: Have you checked with other monks on your server? Chances are, it's just a bad string of failures. It happens to everyone -- it's just the luck of the draw. If there is a bug that's causing FD failures, chances are this board will explode over it. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="msc6"></a>Q: What is the Mend bug? </b><br>
<br>
This bug only occurs if you hit mend very soon after it has ungreyed. Upon hitting mend, instead of receiving back a quarter of your health you receive the message "You must wait 'x' seconds before you can Mend again."  X is normally between 0 and 6, however the message is a big fib, and basically if you see it, Mend greys out and you have to wait the full six minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was fixed once, and then re-appeared recently after the Luclin launch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can camp out and come back and the button will be ungreyed, if you really need to mend RIGHT NOW (i.e. to keep your spawn timing at the Raster camp).  The root cause of the bug (and any other "you must wait X seconds before you can Y again" ones) is fluctuating lag. The scenario is like this:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(under heavy lag)<br>
<br>
1. You hit the Mend button. Your computer starts a 6-minute timer until it ungreys Mend again, and sends a "Mend me!" packet to the EQ server.<br>
<br>
2. Several seconds pass while your "Mend me!" packet wends its way to the server.<br>
<br>
3. The server finally gets the packet, updates your health, and starts a 6-minute timer until you can mend again.<br>
<br>
4. The lag abates during the next 6 minutes.<br>
<br>
5. Your mend button ungreys, and you (being at .5bubbles with two mobs beating on you) bash it like a madman. Your computer sends a "Mend me!" packet again, and starts another timer.<br>
<br>
6. Since you're not lagging anymore, the packet gets to the server quickly-- so quickly, in fact, that it hasn't been 6 minutes since the server last recieved a "Mend me!" packet from you. Thinking that you're a hacking bastid, the server tells you you have to wait before you mend again.<br>
<br>
7. At this point, the server wouldn't mind at all getting another Mend packet from you. After all, it's been more than 6 minutes since your last Mend. But the client thinks you Mended just now, so it won't let you push the button for another 6 minutes.<br>
<br>
8. You camp out and come back. Part of this process is asking the server which skills you can use, and Mend is one of the ones you can -- so the client ungreys the button.<br>

<br>
If this formula and the associated table is correct, then Agi is the ONLY determining factor in Avoidance AC(again, assuming you buy into the concept of Avoidance and Mitigation AC, which seems to be a fairly well established concept).  Monks may have a different Avoidance table that doesn't exactly match this one, but it's reasonable to believe the formula is the same and I wouldn't be suprised if the breakpoints in the Monk &quot;T&quot; table are the same as well.  <br>
<br>
Some monks have reported that this formula reports their AC a bit low.  I think that may be due to the monk table having higher AC numbers at each Agi level than the regular table because of a Monk's natural Avoidance AC bonus.<br>
<br>
The traditional belief that Agi has a &quot;minor&quot; effect on AC is because a large change in Agi has a minor effect on TOTAL AC.  But this formula, and the table, suggest that there may be a &quot;quality versus quantity&quot; issue here.  A change in Agi, according to this formula, can have a HUGE impact on the Avoidance AC(which seems to be a small part of total AC).  A two or three point shift out of a range of 60 is a bigger change than a ten point shift on a scale of 1000.  Moving yourself up on this table may have more impact on how well you can tank than moving yourself up on the Mitigation side of the equation, and it would be easier as well.  <br>
<br>
More testing needs to be done, but if this formula is correct, then Agi is indeed one of the stats you want to watch.  I've adjusted my gear to get me over the 121 hump and I'll keep an eye out for it in the future to get it over the 140, 160, 180 and 200 humps as well.  Basically I'm choosing the set of gear that gets me over the hump without sacrificing too much in the way of AC/HP.  I've sacrificed Str mostly and swapped from +Str gear to +Agi gear.  Stat-boosting foods help too.<br>
<br>
I'm going to do some testing. I'll use stat-boosting foods and buffs to change my Agi without swapping out any gear and maybe create some level 1 chars with various starting Agi scores and see how they do in combat focusing on Avoidance.<br>

(Obviously apart from where you have added the hyperlinks to deeper within the document)</i><br>
<br>
Aye, I had copied the faq to make some changes for a revision, like the ref links and links he had noted that needed to be made.  That's why I happened to have a copy of the faq. =)<br>
<br>
I did make some changes, and it looks like there may need to be more (haven't read all the posts above just yet since I just came back from vacation and was sick yesterday).  All I've changed is the way some of the questions were asked, some spelling and grammar (I know there are probably still some errors in there but I wasn't finished when I posted), and I tried to make it a little less personalized since this is a collaboration.<br>
<br>
As for how recent, I guess that depends on when Fraxus had last updated it when I copied it... when I copied it, it hadn't been changed or updated in a while so I guess that's another reason why I wanted to just copy everything and try to update it.  I'll work on keeping it updated as long as people input what changes need to be made.  It's kinda hard to edit though, I guess EZboard doesn't like huge amounts of text in one post... or maybe it's just the machine I'm on at work. /shrug <p><b><i>Mukanil Sulimo <br>Iksar Grandmaster of the Celestial Fists<br>Xev<br></b><br><br><marquee>"Human Monks don't level faster... they just get more exp per kill.

<b><a name="me16a"></a>Q: Should I go for hit points over everything?</b></br><br>
A: There is long a debate on HP>AC>RESIST>STAT<p><br>
<br>
Really it is going to be situational to your primary function, so you need to really sit down and decide what it is you most often find yourself doing.<p><br>
<br>
Do you solo? AC/HP is your goal (make your HP go further and get more hp. If you are soloing mobs, then you are at a level of encounters where AC still matters)<p><br>
<br>
Do you pull? HP/Resists (espicially end game, AC begins to mean squat. You will get barraged by spells however so the more you can take and the more you resist is imperative)<p><br>
<br>
Do you small group damage? Stats/haste (in most cases you are not MT (assuming you are post 30) so your role becomes damage. All else is secondary)<p><br>
<br>
Do you raid? Resists/HP (again, MTs should be doing their job so yours is to survive all collateral damage by resisting as much as possible and having the HP to endure. Yes, this puts you well suited for end game pulling as well, and that is by design.)<p><br>
<br>
Depending on what you do, is going to be your biggest push for how you stack your monk. Additionally, where your monk is at, is also reasonably important.<br><br>
