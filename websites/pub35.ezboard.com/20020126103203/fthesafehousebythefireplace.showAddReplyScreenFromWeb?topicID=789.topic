<br>
Part II<br>
<br>
I leaned against the heated rocks; rubbing the dead finger with the ring on, in my pocket.  I smiled, marvelling at my achievement the night before in Hates' realm.  This finger being my new lucky charm... it would test my luck on this task set before me.<br>
<br>
I took out the map and letter the Dark Elf necromancer gave me; the paper tattered and frayed at the ends.  I was careful with my black gloved hands to not tear it on accident, for I would need the map for the Lords' Lair...  I opened it up and re-read what it contained to myself:<br>
<br>
&quot;  Dear Assassin,  I seek your assistance most promptly on a task I set for you.  The Lord encased in his firey tomb within' the depths of his lair... has something that is of ut-most importance to me.  You may inquire why I seek you, well I have heard of your achievements over the years; how you rallied your rogue bretheren against the higher-archey to request change among you, your skills are known, though quite a few others are very leary of your assistance due to rumors of you stealing some spells from the libraries...  But I will disregard these incidents if they are true... For I know you will be interested in what I set before you.<br>
<br>
Within the depths of Lords' Lair; I seek a staff, one with a be-jeweled skull and base... bones hang from the staff with strands of jewels... surrounding it, you will notice swirling skulls and grey shadows...  You cannot miss the staff I guarantee that....  What is in for you, is a dagger...  one made of the most magical and enchanted of steels... the blade is black and shiny, down the center you will notice the drop of poison bright and green, and at the base a splash of blood... the hilt is most treasured for it's precious stones that have been collected from far off lands and inserted carefully within' ... it is the Black Tooth...  which you will most enjoy... any other treasures you find, are yours, but... the staff is mine... and if you decide to steal it from me... I will make sure the Indigo Brotherhood hunt you down..... for there are many a thing I know about you, that you do not know yourself........    Until we meet again... Be off with you, I don't have time for more of an explanation...  The map will help you...             Asche Kal' Navae. &quot;<br>
<br>
I opened up the map, to see a twist and turn of paths and arche-ways.... I saw a big blotch of light blue, and a big red circle around it... 'Must be the spot', I thought to myself..<br>
<br>
Well in I went, it was hot and damp inside... even in the passage way I could hear them moaning and echoing ... the Kolbolds....  I walked inside, and down a few ramps... then had to stop, for there stood the Noble... he pased back and forth ... I waited for his back before I began sneaking by... half way he stopped, and turned, coming towards me,... I froze...  he stopped right in front of me... I could feel his cold nose sniffing my hand, not knowing I was there ... he blinked  then went back to his routine...     I sighed slowly to myself and moved on...  I looked up a few times while I passed the bats... hanging in their roosts, lightly chirping, but sounded like dozens of them... the echoing...  <br>
<br>
I reached the beetles and spiders... their clicking sounding like a clapping audience.. . I could see small wrapped pouches of gems near their legs...  past them all I saw the Noxious Spider... all of her comrades guarding her web...  She sat quietly in her web.. almost dead looking, her silence.. I began moving past them... all the while staring at those small bags of gems...  when I reached the ramp up, I looked down and saw a goblin walk in, pick up a few bags of gems and put them into a larger satchel he carried on his back... he wore a black cloak, the back of it looking like it was sewn with dragon scales...  it glistened in the flames of the torches that lit up the insects' lair...  he grabbed the edge of it, and wrapped it around himself, vanishing... but I could see him..as he walked away....<br>
<br>
The turns and twists in the passages almost got me lost, but Asches' map was quite helpful... I noticed a ledge up when I reached a dead end.. the steam from the lava below rising up ... I took out my grappling hook and launched it into the air, I heard a small &quot;clank&quot; of it hitting something solid, lightly tugging on it for security, I began my assent up the side of the cliff...  Finally reaching the top it was black... very dark... I was happy I brought my mask with me... I rumaged in my bag, and took it out.. knowing which was which...the mask I was looking for being be-jeweled, soft leather to the touch, but having rough stones sewn in... I picked it up and put it on my face... I could feel myself changing.. clear change was my vision, now able to see in the darkness.. as if a light stone was thrown in my hands... and I could hear more as well... ahead of me... the giants were talking to themselves...  and I felt myself growing shorter.... being a barbarian and all.. small arche-ways, being horrible to try and sneak through.. now being a Dark Elf.. I am the right size...<br>
<br>
I walked up to the large arche way... concealed in the shadows... I could see the giants sitting at a large table.. bones and flesh from half eaten aviaks and griffans strewn here and there.. Along the walls I could see the torches lighting the room with a solf orange-yellow glow.... on the far wall in the arche-way, was a huge dragon head... old it looked, the teeth fallen' out or brittle, the skin like torn parchement, soft pieces falling here and there...  But that was not what caught my eye... what did, was the huge mounds of gold on either side of the room, treasure chests full of gold and gems, jewelry and bags of items...  My eyes widened as I stepped closer, careful to make sure the giants did not see me ... I heard them talk amongst themselves as I passed by them,  through mouthfuls of meat...<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;, Skarlon began, &quot;Seems to me, a necromancer mentioned about sending some half wit here, for that staff...&quot;, then he took a mouthful of meat...<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Magus said, &quot;But I could spot him coming, even from down there,&quot; he pointed to the ramp, where I was not at....<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure Magus... last one that came in here, set a trap for you... haha, you fell for it... and slipped, and fell down...&quot;, Skarlon laughed.<br>
<br>
Magus raised a firey fist towards Skarlon, &quot;That was once, Skarlon... only once.&quot;, he gritted his teeth...<br>
<br>
Skarlon raised his hands, in defeat and began eating again...<br>
<br>
I snickered softly to myself... as I began collecting the bags of gold and gems for myself.. making sure I picked up everything I wanted...  I noticed in the back of the pile, an etched glass case... and within the dagger  the necromancer spoke of... I could see the drops of poison and blood splashing on the bottom of the case, and vanishing...  A wide grin pealed across my face, as I stepped close... almost touching the case I stopped myself.. I could see faint strings...near the top of the case I saw a string going up... looking around the room, I noticed that it lead to the large head in the arche-way.. the flakes of scales dropping from decaying head, were not scales at all... but drops of lava dripping into a stone bucket below that looked as if it were made into the floor... 'hmmm', I thought... had to find a way to detach this contraption... I noticed a few   strings from the base did not lead to anything... I took out my dagger, and licked my lips... I held the thin silk in my fingers, and lightly tapped it with the sharp edge.. if broke away.. I did this to three more strands...  then I was able to raise the case and remove the dagger... I placed a few rubies down, to balance it out again...  I began my way to the old dragon head in the arche-way... when I heard and felt something loud behind me... I slowly turned around...<br>
<br>
&quot;IT'S GONE!!.&quot; <br>
<br>
Oh no....  I could see Magus sending Skarlon after me, he held a large sword, that glowed a faint purple light...<br>
<br>
&quot;He's over there,&quot; Skarlon rumbbled as he ran in my direction, I quickly pulled out my grappling hook and launched it against the far wall, it hung tight on the large torch, and I let it pull me up.  Skarlon whipped around, and came at me again, I finally pulled myself up facing him, launcing the hook again for another torch, he came down with his sword, fading the flame and slicing the stone torch in two halves..  he came at me again, but now with his hand... 'now or never....', I jumped up with my hook and launched it at Skarlon, it dug into the flesh of his arm, and he howled out in pain as I scrammbled up, and grabbing hold of his head dress, I looked at my new finely magical dagger, my Black Tooth... and I came down hard into his flesh... he howled out instantly... he stumbled, and I could easily see a rash developing and Skarlon began vomitting instantly.. he stumbled around the large room..  grabbing at his throat, dropping his sword, grabbing at his chest... I yanked  the hook out of his arm, which he quickly placed his hand at, to stop the gushing blood... Magus was speachless... having never actually seen the Black Tooth in action..... Skarlon fell to the ground in a large and thunderous thud, blood spirting from the small wound I had made... I could see the veins rising in his skin... and it was quite difficult to move his hand, opening it to reach up on the table for a pitcher of water...<br>
<br>
Magus finally coming back to reality, realizing what was happening... he ran off in the oppisite direction... mummbling something about making an antidote..  Skarlon just lay on the floor weak, and bleeding everywhere...  I made sure I was far enough away from the room, but enough to see what was going on... I could hear them howling.. the echoe sounding like hundreds coming closer.... I put my hands to my ears, as I looked at what was happening... the kolbolds... smelling the fresh blood came inside the room... The kolbold King came himself, his pet holding a scimtar and a shield... the king grunted to the others, Noble, and Priest, half the King's massive size... he was about the size of a very large dog, easily enough to be a giants' pet, the King... he sniffed the air, and came closer to Skarlon... Skarlon, had vomit a string of it, hanging from his lip, and with his bloodshot puffy eyes, he strained to see the King... but he couldn't... The King howled as Skarlon howled, when the Kolbold servants, King, Noble, and Priest, began devouring him...tearing the flesh apart only to be sprayed with blood... they spat out the flesh, and shivering with a sudden chill, they began whimpering and backing away, even the King, noticing his comrades' distaste for the bloated and poisoned Skarlon, snarled at the dead body, and began walking away...  Magus never came back to help Skarlon...  I don't think I would have, if I were him.<br>
<br>
I just smiled at my new blade, and moved on.. only a few torches scattered along the walls lit my way down the dark path...  I saw the door with the two dragons facing each other, I began to turn the knob, but realized it was locked... I took out my set of picks, and taking the most finest of them, I began my work on the key hole.. turning this way and that until I heard a small 'click'...  I slowly opened the  door... and saw a dimly lit room...on either side were treasure chests, dusty with age, but full of gems and gold...  A long scaly tail, reaching around in a lovers' embrace... two huge wings, blazing red, curved ever so carefully over a massive body... claws digging into the hard stone... dark red scales, shining like fire in the room... a large head, with horns protruding from either side like cobras preparred to strike.. the neck curved around, nessled close the one of the massive claws...  The Lord himself, was asleep....  that was luck for me, as I lept over his tail... to the back of him... in a solid gold claw I saw the staff the necromancer spoke of... the base of the staff itself, jet black, only hinted here and there with dark blood red gems, the head, a small skull, eyes blazing with a smokey quartz...  and in the center, between the eyes, a blazing fire, an opal shown with blue skies, and fire flames... I placed  the staff in my large satchel...<br>
<br>
I felt the nose nudge my neck...  and  the hot breath breathing on me, sinnging my hair...I turned around... The Lord was staring at me, his huge slit pupil and yellow of his eyes, mirroring myself... he leaned back, wings flapping, shaking the lair, knocking his treasure chests over, keeping himself balanced...  I could feel the gusts of wind shaking everything...  I began to move back, looking around quickly as to where I was at... to the right of me was an exit, a passage way out... I slowly began moving towards this passage way.. <br>
<br>
I could hear the Lord moving, claws digging into the stone floor, sounding like breaking bones.. wings flapping, shaking everything and I could feel air growing thin as I tried to breath, as he inhaled.. taking all the air away from me.. I began to run... I ran as fast as I could, towards this passage way... feeling the heat begin attacking me, not the flames yet, but the breath... I pulled out a bottle from my pouch and drank it.... I turned around to see the Lord running towards me, head flat out, horns as snakes ready to strike at me, the flames licking the air around me, I grabbed my cloak, and wrapped it around my face, to shield from the flames and onslaught...  <br>
<br>
I stopped, and inhaled the air... it smelt slightly chilly, of autumn leaves... I lowered my cloak... and found myself on a large log, in the Dark Wood...I looked around, other Dark Elves staring at me blankly, a few laughing softly; a female dark elf in a violet robe, with her water elemental, dripping bits of water on the log; snickered at me, and ran off, her elemental pet, leaving a small watery trail behind it as it followed...<br>
<br>
I took a seat on the log...  and felt a cold icy touch on my forehead... I turned to see a large skeleton pointing at me with a boney finger... in a flash of dark red light, it vanished revealing the necromancer who had hired me... she stood with black gloves on, bits of it cut off, exposing her red nails, and dark blue skin...  She smiled with a soft face, and blood red lips.. her long white hair, shaking from side to side...and resting softly on her leather tunic, she wore black metal leggings, and black boots.  She stepped forward as she shook her head.. raising one of her hands, the staff in my satchel rising out, and floating into her hand by some unseen force...<br>
<br>
She pulled out a satchel of gold from her pouch hanging from her hip, and handed it to me...  she came close, and gave me a soft kiss on the lips... it felt warm, her lips were soft...  I closed my eyes as I felt her soft hand stroke my cheek, I opened my eyes, to see her further away than where I thought she was...  I could hear soft aged snickering near me, I turned and looked shocked at a skeleton with its' dark bone skull, staring blankly at me... then I looked for the necromancer again, &quot;Thank you&quot;, I could hear her whisper in my ear, even though she was not next to me...I saw a swirl of smoke and shadows as she vanished...  The skeleton next to me, falling to pieces in a shamble next to me..  I recoiled away, moving down a little bit on the log...<br>
<br>
My mind told me to sleep, but my body was still awake....  I  yawned, slowly patting the Black Tooth at my hilt, I stood up and found a large hole in an abandoned large stump, I crawled into it, puting the satchel of gold she gave me into my pouch.  I leaned back against the soft wood, I would rumage through my findings when I awoke again... until then I embraced sleep and the night like an age old lover....<br>
