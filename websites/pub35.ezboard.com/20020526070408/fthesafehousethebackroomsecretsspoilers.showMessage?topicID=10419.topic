Just curious, has anyone had any problem with Rampaging mobs?  Wierd things been happening on the usual mobs we kill&gt;.&lt;   Went to kill Creator in ssra after patch, he was on fire.  At the end he was rampaging more then handful of  targets.  2nd try, we had dead people &quot;relogging&quot; before res (to clear list), still had 2 cle 1 chanter 1 mage 2 war and others collapsing just because rampage at &quot;SAME&quot; time. (yes this is after cripple and zland claw in) <br>
<br>
As general knowledge I thought rampage was about 3~ targets per on high hate list.  Please correct me if I am wrong.<br>
<br>
On Cazic Thule(a wimp...) we had CT rampaging on the designated rampage takerX3 + 2 additional clerics.  Also funny thing, you get &quot;You have been healed for 5423 point&quot; THEN you get &quot;You have died&quot; 2 sec right after lol.  I thought it was lag, but happened 4 times total on different tanks...<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have similar things happening after this patch.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uranadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ranadin </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/31/02 6:00:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10419.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question on rampage.</span><hr size=1> guess tigole sumed it up on los page-.-;<br>

<br>
Tried Rhag2 late last night and I thought I had a strategy for him since he was a perma rooted mob.  Send in main tank who is being healed and then send in three rampage tanks with healers assigned for them.  It didn't work at all, the clerics were getting rampaged and we got owned.  This was my guild's first attempt at a rampaging mob and it was nasty, fun but nasty.<br>
<br>
So how do you guys set up the rampage list on a mob so that you know who is being rampaged.  Examples of how you start a fight and control rampage for various mobs would be very helpful if it's not too much information. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukanamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 8:35:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10419.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question on rampage.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Heal sooner. If you take enough damage immediately after you're healed that you'd have died without the heal, you die. Seems to be a synch problem between the client and the servers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->It's not a synchronisation problem, it's a more generalized problem.<br>
<br>
Quite simply, since the last patch, the client is utterly FUBAR regarding applying info that the server sends him.<br>
<br>
This is a common cause to all the current problems:<br>
- People getting hit by AOEs that aren't in fact hit (fake curses, mana drained that &quot;magically&quot; restores when you cast or use a right-click item)<br>
<br>
Curses for example are funny. You get hit by a debuff, your old buff is destroyed, you can get a cure<br>
which leaves you without the buff. But camp and relog, and voilà: your buff is back!<br>
<br>
- People that get a &quot;You resisted XXX&quot; message, and suffer the effects.<br>
<br>
Lots of encounters with an AOE knockback. You resist the knockback, yet fling all over.<br>
<br>
- Client counts damage reported in your HP total, but does NOT count heals (which means you're not healed until the next tick, when your current HP total is reported back).<br>
<br>
Well, that's what you see above. The trick is that the client counts all damage accrued, and none of the heals, and when you get below -10 (a holdover of AD&amp;D rules), it tells the server that you've died. Your only hope is that the client gets a summary of your current HP from the server before he thinks you died.<br>
<br>
It's all the same thing: client incorrectly parsing the protocol from the server!<br>
<br>
I sometimes regret the old whineboards. The stuff would have been soooo dissected and yelled at, you'd have been sure Verant would know about it. As it is, I'm not even sure somebody at Verant is aware of what exactly is broken in their client. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukanamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 8:37:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10419.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question on rampage.</span><hr size=1> Oh, and you can be pretty sure that, if the client had been broken, and damage was not accrued, but heals did (letting people survive when they should die), there would have been an emergency fix in long ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umojak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mojak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 8:39:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10419.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question on rampage.</span><hr size=1> The way I see it<br>

Rampage list will not remove your name till the mob is dead. You can get a CoH. You can die and get rezzed. You can zone. You will remain in your order on the Rampage list. <br>
<br>
Rampage radius is usually slightly larger than melee radius. <br>
<br>
If you are on high on rampage list but not in rampage radius, the mob will hit the next guy on the rampage list until you move back into rampage radius. <br>
<br>
Mobs will NOT move to you or try to summon you based on your position on the Rampage list, but only the hate list.<br>
<br>
Rampage radius are known to be buggy where the mob will hit you far outside the normal expected rampage radius (like across the zone).<br>
<br>
Mobs maintain rampage lists (e.g. pullers) even when hate list is clear and they stand unagroed. Even pets can get on rampage lists based on order of engagement. When they fixed it so pets stay off the hate list (and dont tank) they didnt alter rampage lists. We always have a newly sentry eat all rampages for the progenitor. Really helped when we killed him first time with 8 ppl. I'm pretty sure that if the pet dies the owner is on the rampage list next, forgot.<br>
<br>
It's easy to control rampages. Make the FIRST guy to get hit by a rampage stay in rampage radius and keep him healed. He can do no dmg to the mob if he/she likes. He will continue to take all ramgages. <br>
<br>
Clerics / Healers tend to get high on rampage lists if they throw one fast heal on the MT right after MT engages. Then they are very high on the "order of engagement". <br>
<br>
To ensure success against most mobs which require a CH order and rampage make sure the CH order clerics do not throw a heal (or stand in agro radius, till ppl engage). They will never get on rampage list, no matter their standing on the hate list.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps somewhat. With some practice you can easily assign one guy to get high on rampage list and take all rampages wiith a dedicated healer. <br>
<br>
Please correct me if any of this info is wrong.<br>

<br>
Fighting Yelinak the other night.  I waited probably 20-25 seconds before engaging in melee.  All other melee was already engaged.  I was twisting 3 relatively high agro songs.  About 15-20 seconds after I engage in melee, I am on the Rampage list.  I stop attacking (but keep twisting), and fall off the Rampage list in a little while....couple seconds.  I start meleeing again in about 30 seconds, and am back on Rampage within 10 seconds.  I could get on or fall off the Rampage list at will.  Almost identical when we fought CT....and Creator (last Creator fight, I managed to stay off the Rampage list the whole time....no idea how that happened)....and Arch Lich.<br>
<br>
It is not based on order of engagement.  You can get off the Rampage list, and you can get on the Rampage list without people dieing.  Absolutely there is more than one person on the Rampage list.  And healers HAVE to start healing on some of these mobs before the main force engages, or the main tank tends to die.  Not sure where you are getting your info from.<br>

Bards are a special case and need to be extra careful.<br>
<br>
Are you sure you turned your songs off before the MT and other tanks with song buff on engaged. Maybe a shaman who had your song buff went to Malo him early. etc etc.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, your song acts like a buff on the MT or other classes and you get high on the Rampage list becasue you "buffed" one of these ppl that were very early to engage. <br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

<br>
Engagement isn't the only thing that puts you on rampage, I have and I've seen others end up on lists just being the first person the mob saw (los). One person did nothing the entire fight didn't attack heal buff nada. They were standing out a bit from the raid and wham they were on rampage list. I know this to be true because one of the TMs in Ssra basement I pulled was rampaging the Mage who did nothing to them (not even a DS) when rampage had started.<br>
<br>
I've been told by people that rampage is zonewide. (Maybe just on certain mobs? Tormax is the one I was told this about.)<br>
<br>
The rampage list is a fixed and perm list. Once you're on it that's it. It's number of entries seems to vary per mob some have low some have up to 10. Once on it you are perm coh, camping, zoning, will not clear it but I guess time will<br>
<br>
I am very curious as to other experiences with this. <br>
<br>
I think that with rooted mobs rampage control shouldn't be too hard (this is an assumption). One night Rhag1 popped about 3am when i was single grouping in Ssra. I had read that you can pull around him so I did. On one pull I edged up just a bit too close and got his aggro (just some spam acknowledging he'd seen me no melee), So I figured you could just edge up the rampage people to that los line where he spams you then back off. Odd thing that night too is on one fight I lost aggro for a few seconds wasn't able to position him so he moved a bit and in repositioning him got within melee of rhag and got flurried but no dmg. I figure either he swung and missed or I'd moved quickly enough out of aggro again.<br>

Once you are on a mobs agro radius (much larger than melee or rampage radius) you are on his agro list and have hence engaged the mob. Anything that qualifies for putting you on his agro list, an entry is made to the bottom of the rampage list.<br>
<br>
Rampage lists are not finite.<br>
<br>
I am not sure but I think after a set amount of time a name gets removed from the rampage list. I have observed this in cases where early debuffers on rooted mobs get on rampage list sometimes, but other times dont if we get delayed a bit before going in. I will test this some more.<br>
<br>
If it's so, then this period is somewhere around 7min. I have frequently seen ppl get rezzed and die again to rampage as they were high on list and were rezzed fast and were on rampage radius.<br>
