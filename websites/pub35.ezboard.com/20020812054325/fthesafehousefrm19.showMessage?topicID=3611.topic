Lifebane has lost its coveted name, and Assassins do not even have to be level 50 to reap the rewards of Lifebane.<br><br>* List of the major problems: *<br><br>1) Cookie Cutterism: Almost every Assassin out there is specializing for a template to have between 36-40 points spent into Envenom, and using a combination of RPs and +Envenom bonuses to obtain the most powerful poison, Lifebane. Its use is so common, that the name of Lifebane is no longer feared, but is something all too expected. The damage is too predictable as well, always 80 damage, regardless of how they achieved their 50 points into Envenom.<br><br>2) Those that have a naturally high base Envenom end up being penalized for spending so many points and not having any added effect to their poisons. Their only benefit is that they have some extra room in which to use non +Envenom items in place of something else. Added realm points add nothing further beyond 50 Envenom as well.<br><br>3) Cost: Lifebane is very expensive. The Assassin must go on gold hunts just to keep a handful of envenoms ready, especially at level 50 when PvE ends.<br><br><br>* New Envenom Access Rules: *<br><br>Natural Envenom specialization determines the access of the poisons that you can apply. That means that +Envenom items no longer increase the access of poisons you can use, much like the way Weapon and Critical styles function.<br><br>Envenom specialization now has an improvement in damage variance in relation to the base damage of the poison. +Envenom items add to the bonus, much like the same way +Weapon and +Critical items do, but do not increase access to higher level poisons.<br><br><br>* New Envenom Scaling: *<br><br>At 0/2 base specialization, Lethal Poison has a damage variance of 75% to 125%, and the average damage output of the Poison on mobs is 100% equal to the base damage listed. This is the damage that non-Assassin classes will see when poison is applied to their weapons by an Assassin.<br><br>At 1/2 base specialization, Lethal Poison increases the minimum damage variance from 75% to 100%, so the damage varies from 100%-125%, or 112.5% of the base damage listed.<br><br>At Full base specialization, Lethal Poison increases both minimum and maximum variance to 125%-150%, or 137.5% average base Poison damage on mobs.<br><br>Beyond Full specialization, Lethal Poison continues to increase minimum and maximum variance proportionately, such that at level 50 with 60 points into Envenom, Lethal poison damage variance raises from 135%-160%. <br><br><br>* What does this mean? *<br><br>Assassins will have to make choices about the access of the poisons they would like to use through specialization, rather than shopping for the right items just to use Lifebane. Assassins that “shopped” for Lifebane (most Assassins) will see a decrease in overall damage, depending on how much the shopped for it, and those that naturally specialized will see an increase. Here’s a look into how the new Envenom rules work:<br><br>1) For those Assassins who have gone out of their way to specialize the full 50 into Envenom, and happen to have +10 Envenom through RPs and Items, their maximum damage output is now:<br><br>64 (base Lifebane) * 1.60 = 102 damage / tick max<br><br>previously, base 50 Envenom +10 Envenom:<br><br>64 (base Lifebane) * 1.25 = 80 damage / tick max<br><br>In other words, having a natural 50 in Envenom previously did nothing, and all extra +Envenom items and those earned RP bonuses go to waste. Increasing realm levels will further boost the damage as well with the new system.<br><br><br>2) For most Assassins that specialized 40 into Envenom and had previously used +10 Envenom through items/RPs to use Lifebane, they will not have to use Greater Lethal Venom, their maximum damage output is:<br><br>51 (base Greater Lethal) * 1.50 = 76 damage / tick max<br><br>previously, base 40 Envenom + 10 Envenom:<br><br>64 (base Lifebane) * 1.25 = 80 damage / tick max<br>51 (base Greater Lethal) * 1.25 = 64 damage / tick max<br><br>If you observe the last comparison, the new Envenom rules allowed a lower level poison to become more damaging than it was before, almost to the point of the way Lifebane previously worked. The 4 point reduction is a small hit, but the gold cost of the poison is less.<br><br><br>3) For those Assassins that specialized 45 into Envenom, previously used only a +5 Envenom jewel to use Lifebane, but now wants to up the bonus even further through items and realm points:<br><br>57 (base Insidious Lethal) * 1.55 =  88 damage / tick max<br><br>previously, base 45 Envenom + 10 Envenom:<br><br>64 (base Lifebane) * 1.25 = 80 damage / tick max<br>57 (base Greater Lethal) * 1.25 = 72 damage / tick max<br><br>A natural 45 Envenom is very high and ends up working against the Assassin for having specialized so high in a specialization that only rewards total Envenom points. By opting to further wear +Envenom items, even a level 45 Assassin can beat the previous Lifebane damage for having to sacrifice their melee ability.<br><br><br>4) For those die hard min/max Assassins that specialized 35 into envenom and used +11 Envenom items and +4 RP bonuses:<br><br>43 (base Major Lethal) * 1.50 = 64 damage / tick<br><br>previously, base 35 Envenom + 15 envenom:<br><br>64 (base Lifebane) * 1.25 = 80 damage / tick <br><br>The Assassin that “shopped” the most is going to get nerfed the most (which is most Assassins), and will no longer get the benefits of having Lifebane damage without having to specialize for it.<br><br><br>* Summarization of the effects of the new system*<br><br>1) It properly rewards Assassins that have a naturally higher base Envenom<br><br>2) It removes the cookie cutter Lifebane template, and Lifebane will once again be revered as the mother of all Assassin poisons, requiring a natural 50 to obtain it.<br><br>3) It lowers the average costs of Envenom purchased, while increasing the effectiveness of the poison used with the new variance system.<br><br><br>* Preemptive Responses *<br><br>“But that’s a 20% damage reduction to most Assassins! Especially with the new DoT resists going into affect from 1.51, Envenom is screwed.”<br><br>It might be determined after 1.51 that Envenom needs its damage boosted to compensate for the reduction, if that is the case, at least there is a new Envenom system that properly rewards those with high natural Envenom, does not inflate the power of those that didn’t specialize for their Envenom, and reduces the overall gold cost of Envenoms. In other words, the backbone for the way Envenom SHOULD work is set, then any new scaling adjustments would be in accordance to the new Envenom system.<br><br><br>“That also nerfs our access to debuffs, which haven’t proven to be overpowered”<br><br>Very true, and the value of a melee-hit poison went down as a result of the instant-ranged debuffs from 1.51. It means that the value of the debuffs would become candidates to get adjusted, and quite possibly, access to more debuffs (such as attack speed reduction or dex/qui debuff).<br><br><br>“Why nerf ourselves? I like using Lifebane!”<br><br>Taking a hit now and adjusting the way Envenom works can solve a lot of issues that Envenom is facing now, such as cookie cutter Lifebane, no benefit to high end natural Envenom, and poison costs. It creates a fairer system with which to work with, then balance issues with Envenom can be taken into consideration from the perspective of a new system.<br><br><br><br>Give it some thought before you respond. Take a break, think about it, then come back and respond with what you think about it. Maybe it will get implemented.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ufenz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/24/02 12:16:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3611.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Assassin Envenom Nerf/Adjustment proposal</span><hr size=1> Elaa I was wondering why you left out this part here and not on the VNboards?<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;I'm a Nightshade, why am I getting nerfed together with Infiltrators and Shadowblades, even though this still makes them more powerful than us?

I could continue to argue that Nightshades should get a boost to spell damage and everything would be the same, because this Envenom change would affect all Assassins.<br><br>You also have to look at the benefits in the summary part of the post, and the possibility that the damage could get reexamined as a result of 1.51 and a chance to get debuffs reexamined too (and maybe a new poison).<br><br><br>I also believe (but haven't composed a post for it yet) that the Critical Strike line is flawed, but Mythic will not touch it because of the effectiveness with which Infiltrators and Shadowblades already use it. In other words, a small hit might have to be taken somewhere in CS in order to look at it objectively about what styles have been needing to be addressed this entire time.<br><br>Think of it as Left Axe a few months ago. The base damage of Left Axe was overshadowed for a long time by the raw damage output of Left Axe. Then all Left Axe styles got a &quot;fix&quot; and it ended up nerfing Left Axe to some degree. After the fix, it became possible to look at objectively how Left Axe functioned, I did lots of tests on it. A week later, the Left Axe base damage was boosted for Shadowblades as they leveled, such that the style damage is very close to the pre-nerf state, but Shadowblades ultimately benefited with higher base damage that applies to all their attacks as well, regardless of using Doublefrost. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/usmallhorse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SmallHorse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/24/02 2:20:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3611.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Assassin Envenom Nerf/Adjustment proposal</span><hr size=1> I like the idea a lot!<br>I also think bringing a skill to a natural 50 should be rewarded.<br><br>The biggest drawback I think is, that implementing this would overpower the Infiltrators who get 2.5x skillpoints per level and are able to specialize much higher in their skills.<br><br>With this, they have the option to increase envenom without drawbacks on their other skills far more than we other assessins can.<br><br>Here two spec samples:<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Nightshade Lvl 50</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Stealth: Natural 40 (easily brought up to 50 with items)<br>Piercing: Natural 39 (able to bring to 50 as well with items)<br>Critical Strike: Natural 39 (last two styles based off evade not used)<br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Envenom Natural 40 (permitting &quot;only&quot; Greather Lethal Venom and &quot;only&quot; the second best Strenght, Disease, Snare)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Celtic Dual: 5 (leftover points)<br>In this sample we have 2 points left<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Infiltrator Lvl 50</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Stealth: Natural 40 (easily brought up to 50 with items)<br>Thrust: Natural 39 (able to bring to 50 as well with items)<br>Critical Strike: Natural 39 (again, last two styles not used)<br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Envenom: Natural 50 (permitting <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>ALL</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> poisons! not mentioning the dmgbonus gained from +equipment)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Dual Wield: Natural 10 (leftover points)<br>In this sample we have 1 point left<br><br>Imagine the impact!

The Shadowzerk (medium-to-high Envenom) seems to be lagging behind, especially with the recent series Left Axe nerfs. The changes you suggest for Envenom will basically clobber all the remaining viable SB template.<br><br>I, for one, do not support your suggestions at all.
