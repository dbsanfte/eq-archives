It looks like this game is a combo of EQ and Baldur's Gate 2.  It can be played as a single player game, online on internet servers like EQ and even on private servers that you or a friend set up.<br>
<br>
The game is 3/4 view, which is not as good as EQ's first person, but the view is a lot better than BG2.<br>
<br>
What intriques me is the use of near-exact Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition rules, meaning that monks are back.  Quivering Palm and all the other monk goodies are implemented too...even the Grandmaster of Flowers title  heheh.<br>
<br>
Anyone waiting for this?  Expect it to be good or to fail?<br>

It's too linear to be in the same LEAGUE as fallout/arcanum (Fallout 2 is definately the best computer RPG ever), combat is too boring to be rewarding as well. This leaves us with a game where combat isn't fun, and character development just isn't in-depth enough to qualify for making the game good. Compare this to Fallout 2, which has the greatest roleplaying elements of any RPG around, but also has the best combat/skill/stat system ever devised. Arcanum's combat is a bit flakier, and I find that the depth of character is a bit less (there's really only 2 paths you can take...unlike Fallout where what you do in each town will have little effect on the other ones, yet at the same time there are things you can do that will alter the entire world's view of you such as becoming a slaver).<br>
If I want a relatively linear story intensive game, I can get a better story from the myriad of console RPG series, and generally more strategic combat as well. FF might not have the best plots around anymore (they sure used to though), but that doesn't mean that other series don't keep the bar high.<br>

But what I meant is that the graphics/overall view are so much better in NWN vs BG: the ability to rotate the camera, zoom in and out, number of colors, dynamic shadows. textures etc.  The movies I have seen are really great, especially the shadowing and textures.<br>
<br>
None of this really exceeds EQ's graphics, but it certainly exceeds BG or BG2 etc.<br>
<br>
I see that some advertisements (CGW) call NWN a MMORPG also, but I'll let others debate that, as I have no idea what constitutes the differance...<br>
<br>
My interest is that a 20th level monk using D&amp;D rules will much more powerful than a lvl 60 monk in EQ...and maybe more fun to play because of that. I know the race restrictions are removed,so that 1/2 orc monks are possible, or elvish monks who are able to dual-class wizard and monk....scary thought.  Monk/Clerics, Monk/Ranger combos etc are also possible.<br>
<br>
What also appeals to me is setting up a server myself and inviting friends to play in it (you're in MY world now lol). I was just curious as to what other monks thought of the monk parameters NWN was using.<br>

From how I can see it, NWN will be a battle.net'esque setup, you DM a game, with up to 64 peeps joining - although it's likely that over 8-10 will stress a dialup and even more to stress a cable/dsl connection.(imagine this at a good lan party... that's gonna be fun)<br>

Don't get me wrong, I like Fallout.  But how can you say the combat is more exciting?  You get to control one guy total.  You get extra people, but you have almost no control over them.  (All you can do is select their weapon, armor, and fighting style.."Flee at 5 hp")<br>
<br>
<br>
Atleast in BG you get control over 6 people, requiring much more strategy than Fallout does.<br>
<br>
The maximum amount of strategy in Fallout's fights are "Should I use burst or aim shot?"<br>
<br>
<br>
Character depth in Fallout?  Explain.  BG isn't much better, but atleast there is a story behind it.  In Fallout, all you get is "The choosen one" and *very* minor factions.  (Mostly controled by Karma which is more of a global faction.)  They also have generally pointless titles (Most are, anyways.. Some play a part).  I ran around as a grave digger and a child killer for the entire game and never experience any problems. Am I missing something?  Maybe the point system, which lets you choose between fighting or sneaking, but <b>I <u>personally</u></b> don't like that type of system.  There's always the kick ass template that is uberer than all of the others, and then the weaker ones.  (I'm not saying that there's only one way to have a good character, I'm just saying it's not as deep as it appears)<br>
<br>
I'm not bashing Fallout, I love it.  I was a major addict at one time.  I just never saw the stuff you mentioned.  But like I said, it's not much better in BG..but the story does a lot for it.  Just being "The choosen one" is kinda dull..<br>
<br>
<br>
But that's just <i><b><u>my</u></b></i> opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utheyanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Yanger </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www1.iswest.com/theyanger/y.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1784<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/1/02 11:09:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NeverWinter Nights and the Monk</span><hr size=1> Being a Gravedigger or Child Killer greatly affects the initial reactions of NPCs. Trust me on that one.<br>
I'm sorry but fallout 2 is pretty damn non-linear. The first game is more linear with less options, but it's still way better than BG. If you think the story of Fallout 2 amounts to 'oh no get the geck' you are on crack. The coolest part is that you can discover the story and your objectives any damn way you choose. Sure there IS a direct route that you can follow, but there's nothing stopping you from going to say, New Reno, before you go to Klamath and finding out some information. <br>
Combat: I'm sorry, but the combat in fallout is excellent. Sure you only control one character, but so frickin what? The system is excellently balanced for one character (or if you play fallout tactics you can control 6). If you think Burst or aimed is as far as combat goes you're mistaken. APs work for everything and it really makes you consider every action. Do I want to dig into my pockets this turn and use some stimpacks? (2 ap for inventory use). Do I want to get closer to increase my aim and go for one shot, or do I wanna stay out here and have enough AP to shoot twice? Do I wanna use burst fire and risk pureeing that civilian, or just do a single shot and hope I kill this enemy? Do I aim at his groin for maximum damage, or do I aim at his eyes to decrease his hit percentage?<br>
It goes on and on and on.<br>
As far as depth of character goes, I was referring to the skills you can choose, not the titles (which are more of a roleplaying thing anyway). The stats you choose greatly affect your character, the traits you choose greatly affect your character, the skills you tag and raise greatly affect your character, and the perks you gain as you level greatly affect your character. It's difficult to raise a character exactly the same as someone else without really trying. It leads to characters that are incredibly specialized and more entertaining to get through the game with.<br>
We're talking about the difference between Half Life and Deus Ex here. Half Life is a decent game, but in the end it's just a good shooter. deus ex is a shooter where the choices you make about your character will affect not just simple NPC reactions, but HOW YOU DO everything in the game.<br>
I also admire the fallout series for the ability to be pretty much however good or evil you want to be straight from the start. There's nothing preventing you from insulting everyone you meet, slaughtering them to take their items, joining morally bankrupt organizations...and at the same time you can join police forces and the like and put a stop to these activities. The only thing that needed more work really was the last level, since as far as I know you can't actually join the bad guys (you can parade around as one until the last boss though, thus avoiding all combat in the base. Very handy).<br>
Even the NPCs you choose to take with you can make a large difference with many situations in the game. And perhaps the most rewarding aspect of all the possibilities, is that it has many different scripts describing what happens to every town or faction after you beat the game, giving you a feeling of closure =p Arcanum does this too, but I've found there are less possibilites for most towns in that game. IE: I saved the bessie toone mine in Shrouded Hills, thus triggering the 'boomtown' ending, but it kinda ignored the fact that after saving the mine I slaughtered the town.<br>

<br>
<br>
But I will say a few things.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;APs work for everything and it really makes you consider every action.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if I left out moving and opening your inventory, but it's still the same thing.  I hardly call it depth.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Being a Gravedigger or Child Killer greatly affects the initial reactions of NPCs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Like I said, I've played both, and I have yet to notice a difference with those titles.  Well, unless you consider a small decrease to karma a &quot;great affect&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Trust me on that one.<br>
I'm sorry but fallout 2 is pretty damn non-linear.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If you think the story of Fallout 2 amounts to 'oh no get the geck' you are on crack.<br>
<br>
<br>
Only non-linear thing I can think of the game are minor side quests that really mean nothing other than faction and money.  And yes, I know the whole story isn't &quot;Get the geck&quot;.  It's the whole fact that you're FORCED to do it or lose the game, even if it is a small portion of the game.  Only thing like that I can think of in BG (Number one, I haven't seen it in BG2) is when (in a small side quest) you're poisoned in your sleep and have to find out what the antidote is, or die in 10 days.  But it's something you can avoid.  You can't avoid it in Fallout.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There's nothing preventing you from insulting everyone you meet, slaughtering them to take their items, joining morally bankrupt organizations...and at the same time you can join police forces and the like and put a stop to these activities.<br>
<br>
<br>
And you can't in BG?  I'll admit I haven't tried it in BG2, but I did go around slaughtering random people in BG1 and faired just fine.  As for joining the police forces, sure, you can do that, but it isn't exactly called &quot;police&quot; =p<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;We're talking about the difference between Half Life and Deus Ex here.<br>
<br>
I personally liked Half life more =p<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sure you'll come up with a post saying how wrong I am, and that Fallout clearly owns BG, and I'm on crack to think Half life is better than Deus Ex, but you know.. Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.  That goes for you, and for me.  Continuing to argue about it is pointless.  We're both right.  End of story.  Drop it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On another note - Thanks.  You gave me an urge to play it again, I've been gameless waiting for a few betas to come around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (or for games to release.. *cough* WC3 *cough*)<br>

Fallout 2, not fallout 1 (yes you lose fallout 1 if you don't get the water chip. I agree its lame). In fallout 2 you can spend YEARS in the wasteland without thinking about the GECK, the shaman just keeps coming to you in dreams until you do. You can beat the game without ever visiting a single town other than san francisco if you want to.<br>
And YES being a gravedigger and child killer AFFECTS REACTIONS. Maybe the better question is whether you've played wihtout getting one of those two? <br>
And I'm not trying to say it's linear, You were, don't know if you typoed when you agreed with me there or if you admit i'm right =p<br>
Side Quests mean lots of things. If you want to trivialize it as 'faction and money' then you can do that, but you can do that in anything. Sidequests like joining the slaver's guild have a large impact on your life (People tend to not like to follow you when you've got a big scar on your face letting them know that you intend to sell them) and plenty of others have permanent reprocussions on the world around you. There are towns that you can simply let die off through your actions if you wish. New Reno and San Fran both act with faction the way velious was supposed to: You pick and you're stuck with it. That's pretty damn cool imho.<br>
Yes you can slaughter civilians in BG and BG2, but it's pretty damn obvious they don't want you to, and there are plenty of 'super' NPCs who because of their relevance to the story you can't kill. Screw that, in Fallout you can easily kill even the most important story figure if you're marginally powerful. Ever tried to kill the old guy at the beginning of BG? Lets just say that even with a party of 6 decked out thieves and backstab you can't down him. THAT is lame.<br>
I'm not trying to say Half Life is worse than Deus Ex (Even though it's true), I'm trying to say that Deus Ex offers a more compelling interactive element by letting you choose so many things, like fallout. In BG I always feel like I'm plowing through the game in a half-life-esque manner: Sure it's sorta compelling, but I don't feel like I'm doing anything for myself, just playing into the linearity.<br>
I think you'll find that Deus Ex is more fun on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th run-throughs than Half-Life is as well. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

I just barely gotten past the second 'level' and I was bored of Deus Ex.  In Half life, you turn a corner and there's 3 long arm like things coming out of the ground.. Make a sound and you die.  I just kinda liked that.<br>
<br>
Besides,  in a dumb sort of way, I feel like Half-life contributed more to the market than Deus did.  Without it, there would be no CS or DoD.  The whole team warfare thing probably would have been a whole lot less popular.  I just like the action packed gameplay of Half-life (Well..except for the damned annoying platform jumping =p) and the massive amount of MODs that spawned from it.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for BG and Fallout, like I said before, I'm done with that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Let us move on to another one! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utheyanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Yanger </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www1.iswest.com/theyanger/y.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1787<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/2/02 3:06:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NeverWinter Nights and the Monk</span><hr size=1> Just because I'm right. Anyway.<br>
Half Life does not = Counterstrike or any of the other mods. You can't compare a multiplayer game with a single player one. It's just that simple. I mean Pong is incredibly addictive because it's 2 player deathmatch. Deus Ex is amazing and I've played through it 3 times now without repeating the same actions to beat most scenarios. The first time I had regeneration, super speed, super jumping, invisibility to electronics, super strength, all kinds of junk. Because I pumped regeneration up to the max level I was able to sneak around as much as possible, but as soon as I decided  it was alright I could just jump out and smoke as many baddies as I wanted because of A) regen and health kits. and B) I carried like 8 weapons with me all the time for different situations.<br>
The 2nd time I played through, I was an expert at picking locks, sniping, etc, and I had enhancements like silent walking and cloaking. Totally different game, I couldn't do many of the things that my first character had done even if I wanted to. I wasn't strong enough to push crates around, or enduring enough for a long battle. The only weapons I needed were my sniper rifle, my pistol, and my missile launcher for the occasional walking tank thing (been awhile since I played...maybe I'll play through again right now).<br>
In Half Life it's always the same. I appreciate design that branches to fit the player's whims. Instead of being a line, fallout and deus ex are more like cones. They start small, and depending on what you do you can end up anywhere along the large end at the finish line. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

<br>
<br>
Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Stop with the &quot;I'm right&quot; stuff, because you're not.<br>
<br>
<br>
Simple fact is:  Just because YOU like it doesn't mean I like it.  Continue to argue if you want, but it's pointless.<br>
<br>
<br>
I truely am sorry if that concept is too hard to grasp, but it's true.  <br>
<br>
Some people prefer shooting games, others prefer simple card games.  Some prefer puzzle games, others prefer flight sims.  Some prefer Quake and the mods you can play with it, some prefer Half life and the mods you can play with it, some prefer Unreal, some prefer Ghost Recon, some prefer Operation Flashpoint, some prefer Deer Hunter.<br>
<br>
I personally include the mods that you can play with the game in rating how 'good' it is.  Hell, if you go out and buy Half life today, you get CS with it 90% of the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
You like Deus Ex, I like Half life.  You like Fallout, I like Baldur's Gate.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Besides, if you want to get technical about it, and say which is better, compare release dates of the two games.  Newer games generally improve upon the older games.  Not always true, but it usually is.  WarCraft, WarCraft II, and WarCraft III show this well.  But I'm sure you'll say &quot;It's from the same company, that's expected!&quot;  Well then, compare the current FPS games.  Wolf3D to Half life.  Half life to Return to Castle Wolfenstein.<br>
<br>
<br>
No offense or anything, but the whole &quot;My opinion is right and your opinion is wrong&quot; attitude that you have in more than one post gets a tad bit annoying.  Sure, it's fun sometimes, but learn when to stop with it.  Realize that people have their preferences, and just because YOU don't like it doesn't mean THEY have to dislike it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
And I'm sure you'll reply to this saying more random BS comparing games and try to justify how right you are, but it really doesn't matter.  If you can't grasp the simple concept that people don't always like what you like then I won't even bother. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utheyanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Yanger </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www1.iswest.com/theyanger/y.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1789<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/3/02 6:30:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NeverWinter Nights and the Monk</span><hr size=1> HAHAHAHHA Return to Castle Wolfenstein was the biggest waste of money all year.
