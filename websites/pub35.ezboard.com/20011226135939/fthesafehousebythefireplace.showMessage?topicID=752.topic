It should not be this way; it had not always been this way.  Madrain sleeps not far from me huddled in a corner trying to stay out of the wet.  It isn’t easy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My surroundings are bleak, a make shift tent we stole from a gnomish merchant held up by a couple of wooden sticks, keeps the rain off of us, but still we lay on the earth and it dampens as the rains continue to fall.  The gray bleakness of the overcast sky is fitting though, fitting of how I feel, of how my heart feels, bleak, gray, empty.  If it was not for Madrain and the hate that often consumes me I would live an existence of a mindless specter, wandering around seeking only to take life.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A sudden chill runs down my spine as a cold wetness hits my back.  The tent is leaking, I knew it would, the material was thin, worn from use, but it was the best we could provide in such a short time.  The rain came from no where, it seems to always come from no where.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aayren and Ryaana lay at the other corner of the tent, though there seems to be only one corner to the tent.  It is a large canvas, but still not enough room for four adults to stretch out in comfort.  Ryaana has an aggressive nature about her, not surprising she is a dark elf after all.  Born in hate.  Innourok the @#%$ of hate, driving his followers to strive for destruction through hate.   Fools, I have learned there is no @#%$ or if there is there is not one worth worshiping.  What has hate gotten me?  Nothing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Even as I look upon the three of them sleeping I wonder what it is that brought us together, to take on such a life as this.  The life of a wanderer, away from home and people.  Do they search fame and fortune, power, or something else?  It seems worthless to be writing this.  I should be trying to sharpen my sword, that is what will keep me alive, not this foolish scrap of paper with my damnable thoughts on it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aayren is stirring; I wonder what his dreams bring.  Torturer, maiming, death, hate, he is after all a cleric of Innourok, it is he I have to keep and eye on.  We all do.  To him we are second class, the fallen non-believers in the @#%$ of hate.  Yet strangely it has not been like that.  We have been a team, cohesive in battle.  Ha battle, I stroke my ego like my, well what another should stroke.  Rats, snakes, bats, this is not battle this is survival.  Scraping for ears, skins, teeth so we can manage to gather coin, to buy necessities to survive, and of course we must continue to hone our skills.  Armor is not cheap, but if we are to survive to find our place in this world, we must do what we are good at and fighting is my piece.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mindless wall in battle, blocking the enemy, hacking tooth and nail, while the others use skills I will never understand, but never ceases to amaze me.  Madrain her burnt steel colored flesh, reminds be of polished steel, smooth, unblemished, even now I long for her touch, but not here, how can I?  Dark elves don’t long for the soft touch of supple flesh, the embrace of skin on skin, the taste of another’s skin, the sensual taste and feel of a kiss, a soft, long lasting kiss, sharing breath with another, never wanting to release the embrace.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No.  Theses are not things of the Dark Elves.  The females do not have lovers they take mates.  Mates.  I was a mate, still am in a way, taken by the bitch Nurra, a powerful necromancer, one I dread to meet again.  I think on the first taking, a sensual experience, one that only a dark elf female could bestow, but it was not the embrace of my Madrain.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If I have not damned myself with my actions I have certainly done it on this paper.  I think I shall burn this before another sees it.  I am not sure what the others would think.  How would a cleric of Innourok take such words?  A dark elf in love, what a fool’s concept.  A black-hearted dark elf born of hate, murderer of all things living, friends of none, enemies of all.  Yes I have my hate, it keeps me warm at night, and those short hairy footed bastards have earned my hate and will feel it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What does it matter though?  Nothing matters, I will find no peace.  What society will accept one as myself?  Look where I am, in the rain outside in a land filled with overgrown rats and wandering Orcs, looking the blood.  How are we supposed to sleep like this, or even eat?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes eat, that has been a problem, until I discovered the underground in Freeport.  None of the damn merchants would sell use anything.  They judge us by our race, our heritage not by our actions.  We have slain numerous orcs, my blade still stained with the blood of the foul beasts, yet we are seen as no better than them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just yesterday after a day without food Madrain was weakening.  She could barely fight; she lost her connection to the energy of mana.  No longer could she pull the forces of life to her, no longer able to focus the power and manipulate it into fire or ice through words and symbols.  I can’t imagine the pain of it, but I think I understand.  If I was no longer able to walk, that is what it would be like.  Part of me gone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I could not buy food.  None would hear my pleas and even when I offered more coppers than the food was worth or more than we had, still no one would even listen.  The underground even has trouble getting food and only the grace of another dark elf saved us.  It shames me even know I no longer remember his name, but he has my eternal thanks.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What will tomorrow bring.  I seem to ponder the future as much as I dwell in the past.  Missing out on the life I am living at this time.  My past has been kept a secret from the others as well as theirs from me, but I shall learn more as I spend time with them.  Even Madrain is somewhat of a mystery to me.  I only know she shares my feelings we have for one another.  Feelings of love.  It seems strange writing it.  I can't even write it in my own language, such a word does not exist.  I have to write it in common.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometimes I do not think we are the only ones who feel this way.  I see the way Ryaana looks upon Aayren and I see something beyond the fiery lust for death that she charges into the battlefield with.  And Aaryen, he is not the hate monger that the clerics are.  He seems more subtle, but it could be a front, I must be wary of that one.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are all here together, for some reason.  We do not slaughter humans or the lesser elves, like so many of my people, but are they trying to trap Madrain and I.  Weed out the weaker dark elves as my people would see ones who turn against the dark elves ways.  It matters not.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I grow weary, sleep has not come often enough of late.  I must rest if my sword arm is to keep the others safe.<br>
<br>
Izzaric damned with a conscience.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So here I am again, pondering my thoughts, feeling the need to write them down.  Why?  I do not know.  What does writing my thoughts achieve for me.  Nothing more than filling idle time.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My heart still pounds and I stopped running nearly thirty minutes ago.  It is not the physical activity that drives my heart like a war drum.  No not at all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The forest of Nekolus, home, brings back memories. Childhood memories.  It was often I came in the wilderness with others of my age.  We would capture spiderlings and pull their legs off, watching the beasts eyes roll as they furiously flapped the stumps of their legs trying to move screaming only as a spiderlingling half the size of a boy can.  Then we would leave, the ultimate price the beast would pay, a slow death.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cardazza was the oldest and she was already a initiate priestess of Innouruk.  There was the time she healed the spiderling.  Her powers were feeble but it kept the creature alive.  It still haunts my thoughts what that creature felt, if it could feel.  No legs, no way to move or to defend it self, its jaws snapping at the enemies that surrounded it.  It must have been horrible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yet a digress.  This is not why a pulled paper and charcoal stick out, this is not the story I wanted to tell, yet I am reluctant to.  As if writing about will change it, make it different.  Why do I think like this?  Why can’t I let the hate fill me, as it does in battle, focusing on the task at hand, why must I ponder on what does not matter.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I should go, we separated yesterday, the four of us.  Madrian is alone with them, I shouldn’t have done it, but what choice did I have.  The merchants in Freeport have nothing to do with us.  Most turn their backs or go into the back room when we enter.  It angers me, I want to cut them down, but the guards tolerate us, even though the watch us wearily.  If a merchant complained there would be no question we would be dead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I came back home for food and scrolls.  Scrolls I can not find in the underground.  Wizard scrolls.  They make no sense to me, symbols and lettering that looks like cryptic drawings on them.  It makes no sense, why do they need them, what does a scroll do for them.  They have the gift, the connection to mana, the energy of life as they call it.  I don’t understand it never will.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What was it that Rayaana had said.  She is smart, and very attractive, a deadly combination in a dark elf woman.  I would not want to be her mate, she has the fire to break a male.  Ha, not a bad way to be broken.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh yes, these were her words or as best as I remember.  “Izzaric it is not really that difficult to understand.  We, enchanters, as well as other spell casters as we are called can connect to mana, life’s energy.  It is the life force in all things living and once living.  It is in you, the earth the sky, everything.  As we learn to control it, pull more into ourselves we become able to channel it into other forms, but we must channel it into a controlled form.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Think of it as lightning.  If you put a metal rod in the ground during a thunderstorm and tie Regis the halfling to it, when the lightning hits it, we would have charcoaled Regis.” I remember the grin that crossed her face as she spoke those words.  I was certain it matched mine.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But if you put the pole in a small pond and put Regis’s family in for a swim, you will have a family roast and kill the fish they eat as well.  So channeling mana is much the same.  If I released all the power I had at once I would burn up, but by diluting it into spells I can allow the energy to pass through me without harm.  I am as all casters, just a medium through which the energy can travel.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It had left me more confused then before, but she had not finshed.  I remember the others watching, Aaryen looking on with a proud smile and I saw the look in Madrian eyes, it made it hard to concentrate on what she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now for the spells.  We can not take the mana and just decide that we want to make a bolt of fire or we want to turn into a cactus.  Like if you wanted to hammer in a nail with your sword.  When you put energy into the sword swing it will strike the nail as a sword, even of you wanted it to strike like a hammer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mana we take into us is like the energy you put into your strikes.  It is energy and only powers the tool, which is the spell.  You seem confused, I will tell you about spells another time. Think on that for a while warrior.” <br>
Know that I write what I remember she said it seems to make more sense.  Yet still there are many mysteries to me about it and I think her patience is too short for me.<br>
I suppose I should head back now.  My packs are full and I miss Madrian.  Yet do I tell her, can I tell her.  She knows but still I seem unable to put this to paper.<br>
Nurra.  There I wrote it.  I saw her in the city.  I remember too well.  It was that sixth sense that has kept me alive many times before.  Knowing something dangerous was near.  I stopped not far from the Neriak underground and I saw her.  She was stunning as always, a beam of sunlight in a room of candles.  My words could never describe her beauty, her physical perfection, nor the blackness of her heart.  Even now my heart races at her thought.  The perfection of her beauty and the danger that she is.<br>
I had froze for a moment and if it was not for her scoffing nose in the air way of walking around, I would surely be strung up my innards hanging out of me and the clerics keeping me alive.  I would be the spiderling, maybe a deserving fate, but not one I willing go to.<br>
I slipped into the shadows and hide as all elves can, but only the dark elves have perfected.  Aaryen tells me it is like touching mana, wielding the energy, but I am not sure I understand.  Yet it is something that, can not be explained any other way.  In the time that seems to be minutes, it happens instantaneously.  Crouched in the shadows, the light is suddenly absorbed by me, the darkness around me growing thicker, reflections of light swallowed by the darkness.  I here the lesser elves can pull images of their surroundings into them, they can look like part of a tree they stand near, but I am sure it is feeble compared to what the master race can do.<br>
I looked her in the eyes and I was certain I was dead.  She stared a moment, her eyes penetrating the death of my soul, nearly forcing me from the shadows, but she looked away her eyes blank, lifeless looking, it had to me coincidence she gazed my way, or I would not be here writing this.<br>
Damn it it’s getting late and I waste time with this foolishness.  The dark elf warrior, writer.  Ha the pen will never be mightier than my sword.  I will burn this when I return to my love.<br>
