As to BoTB being a test of PvP skill, it isnt.  If it were meant to test PvP skill, they would re-equip all the entrants (each person getting the same gear as others of their class) before turning em loose on eachother.<br>
<br>
BoTB is a measure of whose combination of gear and PvP skill is best.  Gear quality is a measure of who is better at farming, and also at high end PvE raiding.  The red server rules make both of these activities more difficult, i think, so red servers arent as good at them, and hence, dont have as good of gear.<br>
<br>
Imagine now, if BoTB wasnt even PvP.  They haul in the 3 teams and see who is best at PvE.  Tests would include &quot;kill one big mob with minimum casualties&quot;, &quot;kill a continuous stream of smaller mobs with either minimum casualties OR kill as many as you can before you go down&quot;, and, of course, &quot;sit on your ass for as many hours as possible without going crazy&quot; (the epic simulation)... though this would require on site monitoring of the player to make sure they werent taking shifts with their friends (bannable) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustytchyapgud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stytch Yapgud</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/12/02 4:24:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=63>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Before comming to the Zek's please read.</span><hr size=1> Can I change what I said earlier?<br>
<br>
My current response to it is...<br>
Bollocks.<br>
<br>
Well to be honest I cant remeber the whole thing and I only re-read the first chapter.<br>
<br>
But in responce to the first chapter....Bollocks.<br>
<br>
Im now a regular on Tallon...and I enjoy pk situations...I enjoy having to fight for a spawn...I enjoy deing and having to scoot then come back after an hour and catch the @#%$ by surprise and win the spawn back.<br>
<br>
But i don not PK indiscriminately...I did not play on this server purely to pk.<br>
<br>
My character is not a murderer and a &quot;world&quot; made up of solely murderers is ...well Rallos or Sullon in my oppinion.<br>
<br>
i came to pve....but with an added hardship. With the worry of having to fight other players as well as mobs...but only when the situation demands it.<br>
<br>
My character is not a murderer...but he is a pker.<br>
<br>
Ill fight anyone in range to me.if there is a reason for it.<br>
<br>
But in relation to those that come to the server and cry at being pk'd...feck off bluebie its not the right server for ya.<br>

if you are not a Rogue you are tolerated for your inteligent input and helpfull discussions. and laughed at otherwise.<br>

But it is a Rogue board and the majority of input is Rogue based.<br>

I agree, most of the PKers that think they're big and tough ARE the ones that're cowards. I don't understand, though, why you would want to keep running to your corpse and getting killed, though. Why not just log off for an hour or two? The guy's eventually going to get bored.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying all PKers are jerks, though. Usually the ones that're laid back are the nice ones. I consider myself to be neutral. I'll /duel someone as long as it'll be a friendly duel. If you use /duel to settle a problem, you're only going to create more.  <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

So hmm ...the 4 pvp servers are what ? mistakes by verant ?<br>
I mean you play how you wanna play and you have the choice to play pvp or non-pvp and both options were given by the creaters of this game  there is no exact way the game was made to be played. <p>------------------------------------------------<br>

They through in PvP, late in the game making process, and Team PvP well after the release. <br>
<br>
If the game was made for both options, why did they change almost everything about PvP as we knew it? Took out fearing players, took out charming players, took out armor looting(team servers), changed Level attack range, changed /con players, changed corpse camping policies, zone control policies, ect.....<br>
<br>
If you think the game was made for both options your sadly mistaken, and haven't been around long enough, or don't have a very good memory. EQ is blue, new games like ShadowBane, Horizons, even DAoC are taking PvP as a core. Though DAoC was still to blue for me.<br>
<br>
-PvP101 is one of the best things I have ever read. I read it about 2 years ago, or so, and I still love reading it.<br>
<br>
-Mellifleur, as per the blubie /dueling god, well dueling is dueling, PvP is a different story. BotB if faught with even gear/levels is when it shows the better player. BotB just shows who is higher level, better gear, and has some skill. Now I don't think anyone can win BotB without having some PvP skill, but even a novice PvP has a good chance at winning if he's 60, best gear there is, and has 12 advanced points. <br>
<br>
If you want to talk PvP thats a different story, Zek players know the tricks, sploits of PvP, have resist gear sets on them at all times, and travel wearing high resist gear, even more so with the PvP Teams servers, and most of all Pumice stones (I have 3-5 stones on me full charged at all times). Biggest factor, we PvP all the time. Team servers even more than RZ. RZ is more harsh at times with ganking, but over all amount of fighting Teams is where it's at. As a dark, if we see another team in range, we attack or get attacked, no questions asked. We don't worry about a bad rep for attacking, you get a bad rep on TZ/VZ/SZ for NOT attacking.<br>
<br>
Nice story too, goes really into the depth of PvP, hell if your on wisps island they must have been what? 10-14 in levels, yup there's your core PvP's.

When we joined we might have had ganking in mind, but it becomes pretty obviouse fairly quickly that it's not all about ganking and looting items. There's honour, respect, friendship, teamwork, etc, and it has created a server far more enjoyable and rounded than any other, far superior to wall to wall ganking or a pvpless server. PvP is a way of dealing with the dishounerable, or settling disagreements more so than to gank items. To do the above actions of ganking and spawn stealing on RZ, with no reason other than 'because you can', would very quickly strip you a decent reputation, and any chance of uberness. It's not all cut-throat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uulynvindix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulyn Vindix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 5:47:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not really</span><hr size=1> PvP is murder on RZ and duty on SZ.

You can love the original post, or you can hate it.  But if you don't see it is a classic, you have no taste whatsoever IMO.<br>

This is the kind of post that can get all anal-retentive townspeople up in arms, and yet it's so true that even the mayor has to turn his head.<br>
