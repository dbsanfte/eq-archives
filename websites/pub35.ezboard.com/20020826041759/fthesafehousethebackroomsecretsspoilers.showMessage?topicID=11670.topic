What would be the minimum requirements for a small raid to go up there just to see how well they do? Im not sure whats really different now to the first floor and if it would make it too hard for us to do.. How do you think 2-3 groups of people 46-53 would fair? Im not talking about a big hate raid and clearing the whole 1st floor, maybe just pulling a few houses just for fun and to gage how well we do, Id hate to have an instant wipeout though which is why I ask. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/29/02 11:21:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11670.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Newbie Hate Raid</span><hr size=1> Just a warning, since the patch hate break in is now much harder, you may have a level 63 mob jump you at the entrance.

<br>
One thing you should be concerned about is that Hate was revamped totally.  All the mobs were made more difficult.  In addition, a trap was placed in SW Corner, so that spot is no longer safe.<br>
<br>
I believe 2 to 3 groups would get owned, unless your chanters are very very good.<br>
<br>
we went patch night and had a 53 chantress and 3 groups, including 60 monk.  We broke in fine and had no problems.  Went back on Saturday with a different group and had a 56 chanter and wiped on port in.  We had 4 groups on Saturday.  The groups on Saturday were higher level.  Invis dropped early and we had some problems in the portup area.<br>
<br>
I think you will have problems with the level range you are taking up there.  If they are excellent players, then you may be okay.  It only takes one screw up to wipe your raid out though.<br>
<br>
were you planning on breaking in at the port up room or the south west camp?<br>

The only definite change I've heard about is the dark elf.  I assumed when people said the difficulty otherwise was raised, they were referring to the revamp that happened a long time back.  I doubt 5 spite golems are routinely parked by the zone in.  I've been on a raid where something weird like that happened to but that was months ago.  There was no one else in teh zone before we ported up.  Our first group ported up and stood right at zone in.  Within 30 seconds, 6-8 mobs including the treasure chests (so it wasn't all wanderers) came charging in and slaughtered us.  I don't know what happened that time, but it's not the norm.  Usually you can port up, take a right out of the gatehouse to the wall and run the wall around until you're just north of the SW corner.  Run maybe 1/2 to 2/3rds of the way up the wall.  Too high and you could aggro the 2nd floor.  Come down off the wall north of the SW corner to avoid the imps.  Anyone who is aggro'ed along the way should stand and die.  That's the biggest problem when taking lower levels up there.  No matter how many times you tell them, someone always brings their train to the camp spot and wipes everyone.  <br>

The DE guy didnt agro onto us at port in, but did when i was pulling the mini-bosses in the large two floor building, i didnt see where it came from, just warped ontop of my pull wiht a bunch of adds, nothing too hard for a group or two of 60s, could be different for people lower than 55.<br>

<br>
<br>
There are as it is now, 3 different places to break it from, with varying popularities and difficulties.<br>
<br>
The 3 spots are:<br>
<br>
&quot;West wall&quot;<br>
&quot;NE corner&quot;<br>
&quot;Zone in&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The difficulty with west wall and ne corner is now cause they added mobs on the second floor, and if you are unlucky and not careful you can aggro the mobs from the second floor if you are sitting on the first floor walls.<br>
<br>
So simply, the easiest, and the best way to break into the plane of hate is the gate in point.<br>
<br>
When you gate in, you turn 180 degrees, take 4 steps forward, and stay at the corner where the door is, on your right hand side, this way the roamers that roam behind the wall straight where you pop in from the GG wont aggro.<br>
<br>
The adds you can get here is 2 spite golems 2 clerics and 4 different roamers, and the only thing that would pose a problem are the golems since they cannot be mezmerized.<br>
<br>
If you think your enchanter is potent enough to be able to mez 4 mobs, then breaking from gatein wont pose a problem at all, and from there, its just a walk in the park <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uisaakmindoppressor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isaak Mindoppressor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 1:14:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11670.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Newbie Hate Raid</span><hr size=1> Ah, thats clarifies something.<br>
Last time we did hate for some guildbank cash flow and armor for 2tis we had a real bad break in. First 2 groups wiped in gate house. I was in 3rd group and after ported up we had a huge amount of mobs agroed. We did it then but our monk just said &quot;wtf i never agroed that much mobs for just pulling the roamer&quot;.<br>
We did Hate with one group before that. But i never saw such a huge amount of mobs in gate house. Countless and luckly we had given out some mana rods before gateup. Otherwise we may totaly wiped.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urefobelite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Refob Elite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 1:20:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11670.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Newbie Hate Raid</span><hr size=1> That really is retarded.
