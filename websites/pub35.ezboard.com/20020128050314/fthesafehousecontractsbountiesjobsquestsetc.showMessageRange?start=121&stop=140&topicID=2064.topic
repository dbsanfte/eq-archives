<br>
With an impending nerf, a rogue must rely on a warriors ablity to taunt a mob.  Hyrbrids will just use spells, wich as you pointed out, does a signicant amount of hate and will effectivly taunt a mob.<br>
<br>
A warrior with no spell casting ability and just using taunt, can not taunt a mob of a rogue in its present state.<br>

<I>>The reason is NOT that "rogues do to much damage, and we wanna nerf em". Unless Kendrick is lying to us rogues now. In which case, g0d save us all.</I><br>
<br>
However much I want to believe you, it does not explain why he wants to stick us "between 2 and 3" (read as move from 1 to 2).<br>
<br>
The only affect his "fix" will have as it currently stands is:<br>
<br>
1) Keep us from backstabbing if we want to stay alive, or<br>
2) We continue to backstab with reckless abandon, and die.<br>
<br>
The net result of either is less damage output from rogues.<br>
<br>
You claim that the primary concern is just that rogues are - supposedly (however I would claim otherwise from real experiences, and have screenshots that show otherwise) - able to drop down below the bottom person, and literally sit out the rest of the fight if they wanted to until they were the last one left (whereupon they get eaten too).<br>
<br>
*IF* that is the the only concern, and nerfing rogue damage has nothing to do with it, then why in the heck would he propose moving us from slot #1 to slot #2 on a successful evade?<br>
<br>
Obviously, a much better solution would be to put us a certain percentage down the list, say drop us 33% down.<br>
<br>
With 30 players vs an uber mob, we'd get knocked down to #10 (and even so, we all know how fast we get back to #1 with a backstab or two).<br>
<br>
With 2 groups we're down to #4.<br>
<br>
With 1 group we're 2 or 3.<br>
<br>
If they didn't care about our damage output, that would be their solution.<br>
<br>
Yet because they are only dropping us from #1 to #2 (and we'll move back to #1 after our next stab) all that tells me is they want to reduce our damage, primarily by forcing us to *not* backstab as often as we can, like we do now.<br>
<br>
Instead of Backstabbing every 5 seconds, we'll have to wait 15 seconds, do some pre-emptive evading to carefully set ourselves up, and only then backstab, watch aggro, do some more evading, and maybe 3 or 4 BS cycles later (that we missed), BS again.<br>
<br>
That's what they want.  They want to stop us from our constant backstabbing.<br>
<br>
And primarily only in uber mob fights.<br>
<br>
In a single group, whatever fix they do will have zero effect.  All you have to do is evade right before each BS to drop down a notch, then BS again.  You'll be a bit more of a sponge, but it won't be a huge effect.<br>
<br>
The uber raids are their concern.<br>
<br>
You won't be able to do what you do in a small group.  Evading in between quad 850s is not possible, and add in more than one rogue and it's a quick and efficient way to remove rogues from the battle.<br>
<br>
They see logs of guilds fighting 75khp mobs in PoG, and the single rogue doing 60% of the damage, and had to find out what the heck was going on.  Research revealed the evade complication with the updated hate list, and thus the evade nerf was born.<br>
<br>
I reapeat, this has everything to do with reducing our damage output.  Anything else is a smokescreen, or they would be listening to our alternative solutions.  Instead of moving us from #1 to #2, they'd be moving us from #1 to #6 like pre-velious, or they'd be moving us a percentage down based on number of combatants, or something similar.<br>
<br>
Furor taught them the secrets of aggro management, and they are scared to death that the general player base will figure it out as well, and the game will become too easy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalqanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malqanar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/saladin/malqanar.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/01 6:03:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/saladin/malqanar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> L0z, to clear up your confusion about the pre-velious hate list length, a quote fron Kendricks first post<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   With the old hate list only holding six people, and rolling the lowest off, a high damage rogue had a good chance of promoting himself right back up the hate list in a hurry, requiring multiple evades during a fight. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Though I still don't understand what the difference is between a 6 long hate list and a 120 long hate list if evade always sticks you at 120 points of hate - the rate at which you add to your hate is the same, so you climb back up to the top of the hate list after the same amount of time, no matters who's ahead of you no?<br>
<br>
Or if you're dropped off the bottom of the 6 long hate list, do you start gaining hate at the same point as whoever number 6 is? That would explain why the 6 long let you climb back faster.. Generate any hate when you're not on the list and you get hate value of [Last person on the lists hate] + [hate value of this action].. That would explain the behaviour kendrink described..<br>
<br>
If thats the case, then I stand by my assertation that the new system really ought to put the evader at number 6-7 on the list, leaving you with pretty much the same situation as you were in pre-velious.. The only difference being, that now you're at 6-7 instead of being off the list you're more in trouble if the first 5 people die suddenly than you were pre-vel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalqanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malqanar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/saladin/malqanar.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 2/8/01 6:25:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urasilsabishi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rasil Sabishi</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/01 6:08:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> Okay thanks for bringing that back Mal.

That's the part I don't understand...<br>
<br>
If the concern is only to keep us from falling off the bottom somewhere, then why not go back to placing us at #6 or so?<br>

The only answer I have is that this has everything to do with a rogue damage reduction nerf, and nothing to do with fixing some evade/hate list aggro glitch of putting us at the very rock bottom.<br>

I can't believe that you would even go there rohaise.  The reason rogues are doing that much more damage is a combination of different things, not just backstab.  Backstab adds in ~30-33% more damage at 60.  But rogues were doing &lt;i&gt;MORE&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;b&gt;twice&lt;/b&gt; the damage in the examples that you're referring to.  Why is that?<br>
<br>
Well, you have to look a little deeper.  Where do rogues always position themselves?  Behind the mob, of course, duh.  Where the hell else would a good rogue stand? Not like you can backstab from the front, eh?  Ok, so now that we've established that, where do tanks stand?  In front of the mob, yes?  I mean, if you're taunting the mob, you want the rogues on the other side of it, so that they get all the chances they can to backstab.  <br>
<br>
What abilities can you NOT use when someone is attacking you from behind?<br>
<br>
OOOOHHHHHH, maybe now you get it?  Or, here, I'll spell it out:<br>
<br>
Mobs do not riposte, dodge, or parry rear attacks.  Turn on mob hits and self misses for a day, even in sebilis, and /log your results.  Spend 2 hours with a warrior tanking, and you backstabbing.  Then grab a cleric, and no other tank, and spend 2 hours with you tanking the mobs.  Or hell, grab a shaman to slow too, whatever.  Just make sure that for 2 hours of your log, you are tanking, and for 2 hours, you are behind the mob backtsabbing.  Then go over the results of your logs.  You'll be quite surprised.<br>
<br>
In fact, we would outdamage any warrior we were fighting with (assuming comparable weapons and equipment) by 1/4th to 1/3rd, simply because of positioning.  When you do your homework, you'll see what I mean. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ul0z.showPublicProfile?language=EN>L0z</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/lozdarogue/Rbsmall.JPG BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/01 6:18:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> <i>With the old hate list only holding six people</i><br>

No rogue with some sense of the high level raid game knows there wont be a single heal for him available because all clerics on the raid have to focus keeping the main warrior(s) alive who tanks so you can deal your damage and after his 3mins the warrior tanks(/discipline defensive) there is no purpose to keep him alive he will die!<br>

After this 3mins the warrior dies, he has done his job the next warrior who needs to tank steps into his shoes the reason rogues stayed alive during this &quot;exchange&quot; of the tanking warriors is evade how it works!<br>

Kendrick, it looks good on paper would you do a test and fight the uber mobs in Velious with the new change, tell me how long you lasted after the first 3mins are over and the main warrior died.<br>

VI is changing the Donal BP, 0.05% ppl effects it and still changes it again. This evade will effect the 0.05% rogues who fight mobs like Yelinak-Sontalak-Tormax-Klandicar-Zlandicar show us that you work for both sides!<br>

P.S.: Everything i wrote here is speculation, i have not tested it yet since the change isnt live but one thing i am sure, VI didnt as well.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustrikanmindslip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Strikan Mindslip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/01 7:38:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> Ok so this is how it's going to be on a raid with 3+ rogues (not uncommon at all).<br>
<br>
All 3 rogues will quickly get to the top of the hate list.<br>
Then the top person evades. Now rogue #2 is back at the top of the list. He evades and is AGAIN put at the top. Once again if it's less than 500 the top person MIGHT be put at #3 at which point the other TWO ROGUES then start dancing with evade.<br>
<br>
Basically this &quot;nerf&quot; is going to make it so that any raid with 3+ rogues will be sure to have the mob always beating on the 3 rogues until 2 of them is dead. Then the final rogue standing can evade it onto a warrior.<br>
<br>
Essentially this is an artificial limit set on the # of rogues that can be at events.<br>

But I am a rogue and I do know that evade has [and hopefull will continue to have] a great effect on my gameplay.  I think I would just like a few questions answered to ease my mind [I'm not directing these questions at any specific person... Just at anyone knowledgable enough to answer them].<br>
<br>
1.  Evade has a profound effect on my gameplay as a rogue [both in dealing damage to prove useful and staying alive].  Does evade also have a profound &quot;negative&quot; effect on Everquest as a whole to warrant such a change?  As I understand, such big changes like this only occur when the gameplay surrounding Everquest is in jeopardy.  I've read Absor's comments, and I don't find much of a reason for a change.  He stated that I could effectively evade mobs onto people who did nothing to the mob and are standing somewhere way across the zone [never seen this happen, but he said it, so it must be true I guess].  Is this why evade is being changed?  If it is, I think I have some very mean things to say about feign death and the many trains it's caused me as I was standing somewhere across the zone [which also has a effect on the &quot;gameplay&quot; of Everquest as a whole].<br>
<br>
2.  What on earth is all this mathematical gobbly gook?  I just want to know how these evade changes will effect my gameplay.  Will I have to evade more/less?  Will I be dying a lot more if I decide to go on raids?  Should I refrain from going on raids if there's a &quot;Rogue1&quot;, &quot;Rogue2&quot;, &quot;Rogue3&quot; as it was termed by Kendrick/Absor?  I don't quite understand, nor do I care to understand these aggro points, or where I am on the list or whatever.  I would like to know if I'm guaranteed to die in certain circumstances.  Sorry to point out... But these posts explaining how evade is going to work just confuse me. I could deal with certain changes in how I play my rogue.  But if I'm &quot;guaranteed&quot; to die in a situation with only a slight possibility where I &quot;might&quot; not be high on the aggro list after a successful evade, I'd like it stated that clearly now.<br>
<br>
3. I would like more information on this &quot;Hate List&quot; that has been so popular recently.  Prior to expanding it to 60, someone stated that only 6-12 could fit on this &quot;list.&quot;  I don't see what's the difference... A list of 60 or a list of 12... The mob is going to attack the one on the TOP of the list right?  So why did you expand it to 60?  It's going to attack the person on the top of the list anyways.  Is it important that the mob must aggro as many people as possible seeing that the mob is just going to be attacking the people on the top of the list?  I guess I'm just not seeing something here... Again, I don't have a firm grasp of the logic here at all.<br>
<br>
I think the question I want answered most out of all of these is number one.  Simply, why is this being done?  Possible &quot;evade trains&quot; to unsuspecting people across the zone [I can't even take this scenerio seriously...] as posted on the gameplay forums?  The new hate list incorporating 60 people?  If it is this list, why only lower us down by only 1.5 spots [as I understand it anyways]?  Which leads us to the final question... Is it the damage being done that must be lowered? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uleafblighter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leafblighter</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/01 1:02:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> You guys can moan about taunt all you want, but Absor specifically stated in one of the &quot;Talk&quot; threads that they are very happy with the way Taunt is right now, and when used properly, it's as effective as they want it to be.  <br>

From what I've read, Absor tends to always leave possibilities open, even if he doesn't think it will happen (just in case it does).  And Vice Versa.  His stance on this issue seemed very adamant, as if it had already been discussed many times.  <br>
<br>
I'm hoping that Evade will not be hurt too badly.

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> However</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, all the griping in the world isn't going to change a thing if Verant has their mind made up, so I'd really recommend that we try to piss them off as little as possible.

I am very happy with some of the improvements we are receiving, particularly the bandaging one.  Still don't know the benefits of having a shorter range for throwing weapons (no one ever bothered to answer my question).<br>
<br>
I know you are most likely skimming this... who wouldn't after 7 pages of the same thing over and over.  But sometimes you just gotta bite the bullet and pray for the best.  I hope this change makes a lot of people angry so they stop playing rogues.. less competition with all those level 50 bastages that camp all the RS.  GRRR.

Therefore the rogue is not responsible at all for the damage he has dealt. <br>
A lot of this is because a person's hate points and postion on the hate list are two different things. Rogues want to move down the list while Verant wants the rogue to keep a large portion of the hate they have generated.<br>
<br>
Currently a rogue moves significantly down the hate list, AND looses all his accumulated hate points.<br>
<br>
Several people have suggested cutting an evading rogue's hate points in half. This would at the very most put the rogue at a level of hate between everyone fighting the MOB and all others in the zone. <br>
<br>
With a 50% hate reduction the rogue makes a significant move down the hate list, but he still has a large amount of his accumulated hate points. Thus, rogues are happy because they move down the list, AND Verant is happy because rogues are more responsible for their generated hate.<br>
<br>
Aside from the evade talk, I am glad to hear about the other positive changes. <p><img src="http://stridar.homestead.com/files/GultSig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustridarstormrider.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stridar Stormrider</A> at: 2/9/01 1:18:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uswyftfingerz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swyft Fingerz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/01 1:54:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/sfingerz/rogspin01.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> I can see it now...<br>

Something along the lines of “the new zones are not providing enough challenge.  We see a tendency to have the hybrids sidelined and too much emphasis placed on so and so classes.  And we think to make all classes contribute to an epic fight, rogue damage output has to decreased by XX% or capped at XX% of a warrior.  In other words, we would like to make the following changes to damage output of the rogue class:  Levels 0 - 45: Nothing Levels 46 - 54: XX% decrease Levels 55 - 60: XX% decrease” or whatever you are trying to achieve with this evade change.<br>
<br>
Thousands read this board.  We might be able to come up with a solution that is in line with your goals and acceptable to the rogue community in general.  Because as it is you – not you as a person but as VI – are accumulating a lot of bad will and that will inevitably shorten the life of the product you are trying to sell.<br>

No, really!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for the whole evade thing, I really think that the way evade works now IS overpowered and needed fixing.  And I totally agree with the whole 33% loss of hate method(if not that actual %).<br>
<br>
I also think that idea works BEST for making rogues accountable for their damage as they have to make sure not to exceed the damage of the main tanks by more than 33%.<br>
<br>
However, when that idea was first proposed, it made the rogue comminity speak up with their outrage.<br>
<br>
Now this next idea comes out, and after we think about it, it's found that it's alot WORSE that the first proposed fix and can well and truly be called a nerf.<br>
<br>
So it's my hope that this was just a way of making rogues WANT the 33% method.  And after letting us squirm will 'cave in' and go that route instead.  Really intending to do that all along.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 I see high level 55+ especially rogues being completely ignored in these evade proposals.  500 hate reduction every 10 seconds x 50% (prolly less but I am feeling generous) dosn't even begin to cover the hate that a backstab generates especially considering the haste levels we operate under.  Level 58 the typical backstab is a pair of 198s often much higher (double 515s woo!), thats every 4 seconds.  A 500 point hate reduction in that situation is like a bandaid on sucking chest wound.<br>
<br>
 Again, if we agroed we don't get backstabs, backstab recycle 4 seconds, hide recycle 10 seconds.  What does this mean?  Evade will come in 2 flavors, the not agroed so only lose 500 hate (HA I would bet money a level 55+ rogue would never see this option) , and the your backstab agroed him so you not only have a backstab recycle time of 10 seconds with a 50% chance of backstab refreshing at 10 second interval but you are getting your ass handed to you and draining the healers mana at the same time.  Side note anyone wanna try that trick with a shaman or druid as group healer? Funny how they improve thier healing to reduce reliance on clerics then turn around and make clerics 100% needed again.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Two ideas to help.<br>
  1. Hide MUST be haste dependant<br>
  2. With a hate reduction that small Evade must have 100% success rate.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
If you are 1st on list, you lose 500 or drop to 2nd on list, whichever is more.<br>
<br>
This gives you situations where you evade at number 1 position and lose maybe 1% of your total hate... not good, heh<br>
<br>
Obviously a flat 33% hate reduction was somehow too powerful....<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to also point out that evade has never really been overpowered... I can evade during a fight which supposedly drops me down to 120 flat hate.. I can then taunt the mob back on to me probably within 15 seconds... meaning I'd have to evade continuosly during the fight, not just once and sit back like VI employees seem to imply.<br>
