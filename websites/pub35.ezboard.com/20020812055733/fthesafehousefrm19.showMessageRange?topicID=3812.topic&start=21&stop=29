And you have had a great plus in damage using pierce versus Warriors, Thanes, Skalds, Healers and Shaman from Midgard since release. You have always been able to target and kill these, yet when SB's are now getting the chance to have a plus attack versus scale you are all upset.  I haven't seen you complain about having a plus since release to all those Midgard classes though.<br>
<br>
As Brendel posted it evens out the amount of targets the 3 assassin classes have. Now maybe SB's can enjoy some success against Hib Healers and Tanks, like Inf and NS thrust/pierce have always had vs Mid.<br>
<br>
&quot;A good start I think would be give the nightshades a str/con buff similar to the Thane STR buff. I think that +20 to 30 to both stats would be a nice boosthave always enjoyes vs Mid.&quot;<br>
Does this mean Infiltrators will get a plus 10 Con/Str buff and SB's will get a +30 Dex /Qui buff to even them out?<br>

Lupas tha'ts bonus that in most cases never did anything for us. Sure a thane could be easy but a Skald or warrior? not very likely and i can't recall seeing more than 2 or 3 shamans since i started playing this game. It's also been proven many times that Shade damage output is less than Infil/SB. One reason is higher Dex/Qui...are you sure you SB's wanna lower your damage per swing? You also get more HP per level than we do and infils get more spec points per level.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrendelblackhammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brendel Blackhammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/28/02 9:05:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3812.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply</span><hr size=1> Kreig I dont know where you get your information.<br>

Mercs wear chain not studded. Shaman are very much a part of the Midgard population, I know plenty. Third Skalds and Warriors are very killable, or else why would I hear about nightshades killing these classes from my fellow Mids?<br>
<br>
Dex affects your weapon skill on pierce weapons, not the DPS. Qui improves your attack speed, but does lower your style damage.

<br>
Elaa's Assassin class balance thread where Elaa's shows that NS damage is lower.<br>
<br>
If you really want to get specific on my statement about dex/qui lowering damage then i will clarify for you. I added dex on accident...sorry i made a mistake. DEX/STR effects pierce weaponskill, Dex effects blunt weaponskill, Qui improves your attack speed slightly but lowers your damage.<br>
<br>
The NS that kill warriors and Skalds...how many RP to they have? Take away their realm skills and see how well they fare. Realm Skills were not added for class balance they were added to keep interest in RvR up and give bonus's to those who RvR alot.<br>
