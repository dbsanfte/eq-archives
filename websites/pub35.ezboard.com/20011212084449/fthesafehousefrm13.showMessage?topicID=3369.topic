Well we all know how this quest starts, and is broken at the part when you are supposed to give the letter to Izera, as she doesnt reply. And its been found out too, that she needs 4 items(Priest of innoruuks heart, Arterial blood, Tainted dawnbane venom sack), yes, 4 items, as she doesnt reply when you bring her those 3. The rest of the quest seems to work though, writing here what i have found out. I dont have the exact phrases or anything listed though. <br>
<br>
In FP evilguys guild, underground, is a HEF named Tinys Pledgur(sp?), guarded by 3 yellow to lvl 60 con guildmasters. Guildmasters were kos to me, but i love first hit assasination, so i went and killed Thinys. He drops a letter, that you need to take to Izera. Izera then gives you something that you need to take to Xjari, the mage girl in RM. She then hands you a 2 slot container named solvent of preservation, and you need to find a night ember thing and combine it in container. the night ember thing is dropped by a highpriest in OT evil outpost(one of the goons), and as using the same methods as with Tinys, i killed him, looted ember and ran to SF zone before the rest of the goons got me. Combining the ember thing in container, it was changed to something with really similar name, and when you take it to Izera, she hands you Powdered night ember and an instruction book. The book has instructions to make unique thing, &quot;something fire&quot;, by doing 3 steps. first you need to get crystallized web silk from crystal crawlers in CC, compine it with powdered night ember in eroding solvent, and then get Beholder iris fluid from Beholder <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . i went and got the crystallized web silk, but here is where im stuck, i wasnt able to combine it in solvent of preservation. And seems that the Erosing solvent is received in some earlier part of the quest, so now im asking, if anyone else found a shortcut similar over the broken part, and has been able to receive the eroding solvent.<br>
<br>
There might be some mistakes on the text, if you need more exact info, catch me in game.<br>

I made a lvl 1 rogue to go and find Tinys, but he bit it when one of the NPCs down there took offense. I then tried a lvl 1 SK, and explored the guild rooms in the basement. I couldnt find any NPCs named Tinys Pledgur, but I did find one named Thiryn Dernus, who was a half elf in unusual green armor. He didn't respond to any of my hails, but, while I was mulling over what to say to him next, he took off and ran a circuit, eventually ending up at his starting position. Part of the circuit was above ground, sooo.....If Thiryn is the mob that you are referring to, it would not be nessessary to kill him in the guild hall (which would be tough, due to the kos high levels around him). It would be easy enough waiting outside for him to pass by and then off him. I'm not sure how long it is before he does his circuit, I didnt wait for him to do it again.<br>
<br>
Probably the high priest in OT can be dealt with in a similar manner. There is a reference to a &quot;high priest X'Tir&quot; as a new mob in OT, seen near the ledge. If it is the same one, then he would leave the outpost, and could be killed more easily that way. I haven't checked that out yet though. <br>
<br>
I'll post more info when I've confirmed that these are themobs that you are talking about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustackabowhistlebeat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stackabo Whistlebeat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/28/01 6:19:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> PM</span><hr size=1> You are right about the name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and the OT highpriest often walks away from the outpost, but he travels with the rest of the goons.

 <br>
Dernus indeed does run a big circle-he'll run out and around then back down to the Rage via a secret passage in one of the buildings. I can think of a few ways to nail the bugger while he's above ground...or at least pull him to a corner far enough away that the whole place doesn't jump you.<br>

The easiest method to get PrimordialMalice faction is to participate in killing the dark elf corrupter and reavers for the druid and ranger epics.  This gives very large +faction hits.  I help with this about 3 times, and have maxed faction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaisersoze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CaiserSoze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/29/01 10:15:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Primordial Malice (Izera N'kar)</span><hr size=1> After 4 Dorns, and 3 clearings of the DE camp in LF (Only killed the 2 big guys there once each), I went from indiff up to Ally with PM faction... =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarfabel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arfabel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/30/01 12:49:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Primordial Malice (Izera N'kar)</span><hr size=1> heart of innoruuks priest drops from a dark elf surveyor in nektolous, coming from EC, you pass the bridge, and she was standing by the path for neriak. hope this helps some :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=natal>natal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/01 11:32:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Primordial Malice (Izera N'kar) - Part 1</span><hr size=1> I have done some more research on this quest, trying to get the exact text and confirm what Stackabo had previously discovered about follow on steps in the quest(s). I had thought that my log was turned on, but it was not. I had the good sense to take screenshots of the text though, so I have transcribed most of it for the benefit of the board. This is what Izera has to say about the intact dawnbane venom sack, the priest of innoruks heart and the arterial blood:<br>
<br>
You say, ‘what intact dawnbane venom sack’<br>
Izera N’Kar says ‘When the plague of the Bloodsabers touched the Karanas it was thought that only the crops would suffer. That thought was incorrect to a minor extent. Though few creatures have been affected, there us but one creature we believe to have changed as a result of the plague – the chasm crawler snake. The nocturnal Dawnbane serpents are born from eggs of the tainted chasm crawlers, or so we believe. The most potent difference in this new species of serpent is their enhanced venom, which has evolved to contain a powerful acidic component.’<br>
<br>
The venom sack can be obtained from Dawnbane serpents in EK. They only come out at night, depop at around 6-7AM, and are rather uncommon. It’s best to have a tracker to find. My ranger did a good part of lvl 33 hunting them inbetween daytime trips hunting griffenes and highland lions in NK, but did not get any drops from them. I would guess she killed ~30. The venom sack dropped first kill for my Iksar shaman though (he is doing the quest).<br>
<br>
You say, ‘what priest of innoruks heart’<br>
Izera N’Kar says ‘A mortal priest is a priest of Innoruk who remains upon Norrath – not one of those blasted creatures rumored to dwell upon his plane. I have done some research to find one who would prove sufficient for our needs without having to infiltrate Neriak proper. Fortunately, the Spires of Innoruk have been sending one of their youngest recruits, guarded by two of the Indigo Brotherhood squires, into Nektulos to survey the area. Why they do this I neither know nor care’<br>
<br>
This drops from a Tier’dal surveyor, who can be found next to a tree at just beyond the bridge in Nek forest (near a crossroad, if memory serves me correctly). Sometimes an earth colored golem will spawn there. Neither gives faction hits, and both were green to a lvl 53.<br>
<br>
You say, ‘what arterial blood’<br>
Izera N’Kar says ‘To many of even the most skilled necromancers and bloodthirsty of warriors blood is blood, despite the location of the body from which it bleeds. The arterial blood from a knight of Innoruuk, however, is most important to this task. Assure that you retrieve nothing less. I have noticed a young shadowknight patrolling the swamp on Innothule at night and have found that he would be ideal for our needs.’<br>
<br>
The shadownight in question can be found wandering about Inno swamp near the SRO zone at night. I would suggest bringing a tracker to help out (I hate trying to find mobs in swamps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). I don’t remember what his name was but he was green to a lvl 53. Don’t mistake him for one of the Troll guards (I did once)….they will kick your butt!<br>

The first bit involved killing Thiryn Dernus for his ledger. As I mentioned before, Thiryn spends most of his time in the necro/SK guild in FP. Every so often, though, he runs a circuit, part of which is above ground. I had my shaman wait above ground until he came out (7AM gametime – his morning jog maybe?), rooted and dotted him until he died. He conned green to a lvl 54, and made no real effort to fight back, no spells or anything like that. I would suggest making a lvl 1 human innoruk SK or necro, and just following him to get a feel for where he goes. Of course, if your quest character doesn’t have faction above ground, you may some trouble <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , there is a guard in the vicinity standing outside a building. On another note, I have seen Thiryn at least twice beyond the zone line going to WFP. He can be dotted there, but doesn’t advance on you, and when he dies, cannot be looted (he is to far away and you just zone). I’m not sure what that means. Thiryn doesn’t give faction hits, btw.<br>
<br>
When you return the book to Izera, you get this message: <br>
<br>
Izera N’Kar gives a brief, dark chuckle under her breath as she reads through the ledger. ‘I am most pleased. . . most pleased indeed, Mokara . You have done remarkably well and I am. . . overjoyed to know that Thiryn has fallen to the command of the Primordial Malice. Now, my dear, wonderful outsider, take this note to Xjari, back at the temple. She will guide you further in your tasks.’<br>

She gives you what looks like a ticket stub, which you give to Xjari. Now, unfortunately my screenshots let me down and I missed the first bit of what she says, but here is the rest:<br>
<br>

<br>

Acolyte Xjari V’lyr says “Though you have earned some trust from us, outsider, I will only tell you this: There are three known surfaced quantities of this material and all three are carried by those loyal to Innoruk. The particular specimen we have been seeking is now held in the hands of a high priest, who we know from your efforts and Izeras note, was resold the item by Thiryn in the Tier’Dal and Ogre outpost of the Overthere.

The item you need is something called “imbued night ember sphere” which drops off High Priest X’Tir in the outpost at OT. Actually, according the beastiary on the allahkazam site, there is another new mob there as well named “Vazern Ith’taris” who drops the same item (although I have not personally confirmed that). Btw, he will respond to prompts, so he might be involved in a counter Primordial Malice quest (just a thought – maybe there is one). I found this to be the most challenging of the known steps in the quests. It seems these guys go out with the goons at night doing goonish things. They look like goons, but are lower level (~40 I would guess, blue to lvl 54) and do not run at jboot speed (Incidently, contrary to popular belief, goons do NOT run at sow speed. I agroed them a number of times on this quest, and used to hunt in OT and could always outrun them, even when they had been intially able to hit me – ie had been standing right next to me). As some of you may know, during the day the goons are stationed at particular positions in the outpost. X’Tir is just behind a column near the gap in the south wall, and Vazern in the building closest to that. The closest true goon is T’Vem, who is stationed next to the NE column of the pagoda thing in front of the main gates. This was quite a fair distance from X’Tir. I tried pulling X’Tir from the south gap, but on both occasions T’Vem agroed. Since he is much faster than X’Tir, there is not much hope of doing the little root and run method of splitting them – there is no time and he hits hard. When night falls, the goons go on patrol. They assemble in Vazern’s building (Vazern leaves and stands off a bit – don’t know why) and after a while they head out on patrol. This is your chance. The general and the real goons head off and split into pairs outside the fort. X’tir and Vazern lag a bit and then start killing stuff outside the main gates as they head south. This causes them to fall way behind. They are paired, but gradually drift apart, when they do, jump X’Tir and pull him to the wall where you can dispatch him. He does cast, but didn’t heal, at least when I killed him. He seemed to be doing smite type DDs only. A word to note, quite a few on my original spells were resisted, the initial slow as a pull, followed by a lot of roots. He also tended to break root pretty quickly. He didn’t do too much damage to my shaman, but I was fully buffed with resists and had regrowth up. Even so, the resists took their toll on my mana, and I was basically oom when he decided to turn and run. He didn’t hit particularly hard, up to about 80 max from what I can remember. Place the imbued night ember sphere in the solvent of preservation and you get preserved night ember. This is taken back to SRO and given to Izera.<br>
<br>
Izera N’Kar says “Excellent, outsider! Now, I trust you have retained the eroding solvent that I have given you. Use the solvent and the powdered Night ember I have given you when following [my instructions], then return the raw materials to Xjari.’<br>

You say, ‘what are your instructions’<br>
Izera N’Kar says “On second thought, I had better give you a written form of the instructions. Take these and follow them closely. Once you have reached the final step of the instructions, you will need to give them to Xjari, who will aid you in the final step. The Night Ember you have is very rare and if you fail in any part of what I have written for you, His Grace will hear of it and he shall not be pleased.’<br>
<br>
She gives you a book which gives detailed instructions on what to do next. I forgot to get a screenshot of those, and can’t atm since I’m compiling this report while the servers are down for the launch of Luclin. I’ll post them when I next get a chance.<br>

The book makes reference to 2 items which have to be collected and combined with powdered night ember in eroding solvent. Izera asked if we still had the eroding solvent which she gave us. That would suggest that eroding solvent is used in the first part of the quest. I’m guessing that it (or a precursor) is what she is supposed to give us when we give her Xjari’s original note (the one she currently eats). Anyhow, since we don’t have that, we cannot complete this part of the quest until it is fixed. The two items required are crystallized web silk and beholder optic fluid. I got the crystallized web silk from a crystal crawler in CC. One clearing of the tunnel was enough, it has the same icon as a crystal web shield or those egg sacks that drop in EC. The beholder optic fluid comes from (surprise!) Beholders gorge. Just kill the 2 lords at the kings spawn area until one drops. I got mine on the 8th kill. A chanter who was there before me said that he got 2 on 30 kills, so it is not a hugh camp. Respawn on those guys is a few minutes, so not a long wait.<br>
<br>
Once you have done those 2 combines, you are supposed to give the instructions to Xjari, who will then give tell you what to do for the last combine. I haven’t tried that yet since I’m afraid something bad might happen if I haven’t  done the first 2 combines <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, that’s the state of my questing atm. I have to say, I've had a blast - these have been pretty fun to do so far <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Are *all* those faction hits from one turnin? If so, that's a HUGE increase... it used to be a max of 5 hits per action (kill/handin). About 2 weeks before Primordial Malice was in game physically, they introduced the PM faction, and some kills had 6 hits associated with em (previously had 5; tacked PM hit onto the end). If there are this many now... wow.<br>
