<br>
"...But this situation is different. The United States was not the aggressor on Sept. 11 when Osama bin Laden and his allies chose to destroy thousands of innocent American lives -- and the lives of people from 68 other nations -- because he disagreed with our foreign policy. Men, women, children, people of all races and nationalities were killed in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington because some terrorists wanted to send us a message."<br>
<br>
Now, I like to study history, and even read history books on my offtime...<br>
<br>
The "government from a long way off" was controlled by King George III, who tyrannically put laws against the Colonists, almost in a racist fashion.  The Colonists were REQUIRED to house British soldiers if they needed a place to stay.  After the rebellious Boston Tea Party began (remember, No Taxation without Representation!!) the Colonists were REQUIRED to house British soldiers and supply them with food whether they needed it or not.  A List of Wrongs Done by King George III was written, I can even get you a link of it if you really want to see how tyrannical he was to the colonists... (Oh and don't start saying crap like "OH I'm sorry I didn't know we were supposed to know that.  You weren't, but now you know, you don't gotta be a sarcastic biotch about it)  So therefor, the colonists had every right to rebel.  In almost every country, what do Citizens do when theres a bad or tyrannical leader?  They rebel.  <br>
<br>
Now, this doesn't relate to Canada, or who's country is better, but I'm proving the point that USA was NOT the aggressor that caused the Sept 11 attacks.  Now if we went over and started attacking them for no reason, then they would obviously have a right to fly a plane into our Tower...<br>

Heh, you made the mistake that I almost made.  Assuming I am correct in my interpretation, I believe that Caralane was not only refering to the plane incident, but other incidents as well.  I could be wrong though, correct me if I am please, for I at first made that assumption as well, but shortly after came to the above stated conclusion.  Anyways, I do indeed agree with you on that, the fact that we have been trying to keep from harming civilians, and in efforts to help them we have been providing them with food etc.. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujurrai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrai</A> at: 7/5/02 9:24:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uverdigrisrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Verdigris Rex</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/5/02 9:28:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just a quick thing to clear up...</span><hr size=1> Purely jovial, Jurrai :)<br>

My government does what it wants when it wants just because it can. The fact that this happens really casts the wrong image out for everyone who lives in the US. I could really care less what other people think about my government, as long as they dont assume EVERY AMERICAN IS THIS WAY. If you think that every American agrees with what our government does, you REALLY need to get a clue (man, thats a really really overused saying).<br>
<br>
People making assumptions that every or the majority of Americans are arrogant morons is what causes terrorists to attack civilian workplaces.

What would happen to the world if america pulled all financal,Millitary and humanitarian support from the rest of the world...?<br>

Yes we are the worlds police force...why?<br>
Because we have the raw power to do it. and no one has the resources like we do...<br>
This is a posistion we had no choice but to assume simply because there is no one else that can do it.<br>

Our economy even at its lowest is still stronger than anyone else in the world..if something were to completely kill our economy the rest of the world would go with us..<br>

<br>
I'm afraid I have to disagree with some of what you have said.<br>
<br>
If the US were to stop dispensing financial, military and humanitarian aid the world would still continue to function.  New relationships would form, some nations might become poorer, perhaps some richer, and most would not change at all.  Economies would adjust over time to compensate for our absence.<br>
<br>
Just because we have the most powerful military in the world does not mean that everyone marches to the beat of our drum.  We do possess more raw power than any other nation...right now.  But so what?  We still strive to build coalitions.  The price of acting unilaterally can be a steep one.  Where would we be right now without the assistance from coalition partners in this war on terrorism?  Not as far.  The intelligence assistance that we are getting from countries such as Morocco, Egypt, France, Jordan, Israel, the Philippines and countless others has proved critical in piecing together some of these terrorist networks that seek to harm us.  <br>
<br>
We don't need to apologize to anyone for being the single most powerful nation on earth.  We are.  But nowadays, nobody can afford to go it alone.  Like it or not, we are all interdependent to a much greater degree than ever before.  <br>
<br>
The kind of statements you are making seem to fly in the face of that.<br>

Really?  i heard it was bad...but ive wanted to go see it...mebbe i will now<br>
<br>
<br>
back to the topic at hand...Verdigris, I believe you are incorrect in your statement about the rest of the world continuing to function.  First, the middle east would go belly up.  Who buys all their oil?  We do.  Well, Russia does as well, but im pretty sure we buy the majority (cause russia gets oil somewere from inside itself...i mean, OPEC wanted russia to join it).  Correct me if im wrong, but when the great depression hit, it screwed over the rest of the world's economies as well...and they didnt form new relationships, some didnt get richer...the only thing that started to dig countries out of it was the begining of WWII....so YES they can function on their own, but not until a war forces them to mass produce arms...hell thats what got the US out of the depression.....<br>
<br>
now correct me if im wrong on that thing about the great depression, but im pretty certain it messed up economies everywhere <p>Xenix - 0x Rogue<br>

No, the U.S doesn't only base its foreign policy on ensuring that its economic interests are kept safe.  But its economic interests are no doubt among the highest priorities taken into consideration for our foreign policy.  Not the only ones, but they are up there.  Why?  Because while the U.S would like to help everyone, it has to take itself into consideration.  I'm sure whatever nation you live in, Pelman, puts itself as the last priority when establishing a foreign policy.  Yeah, sure.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that alot world seems to hate America.  Or fear it.  Or whatever it happens to be they feel towards America.  I cannot say, because I don't know, I am an American.  You, apparently, seem to think quite lowly of us.  Because we &quot;have enormous power and the arrogance not to care who they destroy in their path of perceived justice.&quot;.  Yeah, because we go around to every nation in the world whose opinions are dissented from ours, and force our influence on them, killing anyone who opposes, with a foreign policy that reverberates the &quot;ignorant W.A.S.P attitudes&quot; that the majority of our nation (Of mostly WASP's) seems to bear.<br>

Think before you speak please.  Or maybe research a little bit before you voice your feelings on such a matter.<br>

Then again, it wouldn't matter now would it, seeing as we're not a nation at war, and we weren't firing weapons in the air. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujurrai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrai</A> at: 7/6/02 4:30:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/9/02 12:34:50 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.engtong.com/Valoran/images/60x60/aidon60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just a quick thing to clear up...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No, it ain't broke according to YOUR view of the world.

It doesn't matter in your moral scheme that his &quot;view&quot; includes the targetted mass murder of thousands of innocent civilians?<br>
<br>
His view openly and blatantly calls for the destruction of the United States and her ally Israel with a heafty dose of malfeasance for the rest of the Western World.  Do you honestly believe we have some moral obligation to permit him his &quot;view&quot; without opposition?  This isn't a difference of opinion.  This is destructive hatred.  <br>
<br>
Stalin had a different point of view than the United States, should we have not opposed him?<br>
<br>
Hitler had a different point of view than the United States, should we not have opposed him?<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein has a different point of vew than the United States, should we not oppose him?<br>
<br>
It is easy for you, as a Canadian, to spout such nonsensical moral platitudes.  You are safe in the protective shadow of the &quot;hated&quot;, &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;ignorant&quot; United States. <br>
<br>
Many Western foreigners like to hate the United States, yet were it not for the strength of our economy, military, and character, none of you would be in the posistion of prosperity and peace that Western nations hold.<br>

<br>
We didn't engage in the wholesale slaughter of British civilians.  Bin Laden didn't fly a jet into the USS Eisenhower. That would have been understandable.  <br>
<br>
However, the response would have been the same.  An act of war is an act of war.  A terrorist act of war, however, simply shows us that the man has no moral code worth accounting.  He is evil, in a very literal and real sense.<br>
<br>
That you could even suggest we &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; to his actions boggles the mind.<br>
<br>
We have every right to go over there and prosecute a violent course of action.  No, Sovreign Nation can ignore such an attack on its shores by a foreign entity and hope to maintain its Sovreignty for long.<br>
<br>
Is it a shame that Afghan civilians accidently died? Yes.  Do accidents like that happen in times of armed conflict? Yes.  We don't have to like it, but we do have to accept it. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">Aidon</a>

Bin Laden's people feel oppressed by Americans, resort to violence to start showing their extreme displeasure in a way that will get noticed.<br>
<br>
Both cases, the ones who view themselves as oppressed were seen as nothing more then discontents and rabble-rousers, by the people who were allegedly oppresing them, who they who needed to be taught a lesson/killed in revenge.<br>
<br>
Granted, the Americans didn't kill 5k in one shot, and certainly not in nearly as repulsive a manner. But they did resort to what they knew would draw attention, and nothing draws more attention then death.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There comes a time when a disagreement between two entities can find resolution only in armed conflict.  This is a fact of humanity.  If you cannot see the difference between a revolutionary war and terrorism, you cannot be helped.<br>
<br>
Secondly, please, by all means, explain to me how it is that the United States can possibly be oppressing Arabs in foreign nations halfway across the world not residing in any US territory?  Perhaps we are oppressive in how we permit them to enter our nation, live here and prosper and send finances back to the very terrorist organizations which plague our allies and now ourselves?  <br>
<br>
I can see the oppression.  Its our fault that there isn't a single democratic Arab nation.  Its our fault that the wealth of those Arab nations is held by the ruling .1% while the other 99.9% of the nation lives in poverty.  Its our fault for not flooding these same nations who stood allied with the former Soviet Union, against us, with financial aid to further increase the wealth of their elite class.<br>
<br>
Blame the United States.  Its all our fault.<br>

<br>
Pardon me?  What world are you living on?  The US simply said &quot;We are at war.  If you would like to continue enjoying the benefits of being an ally of the United States, you'd best not stand in our way&quot;.  That seems fairly reasonable to me.<br>
<br>
I think you misunderstand a fundamental truth.  You, nor any other nation, is entitled to US power and prosperity.  If you wish to be our friends, then be our friends.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Entirely true, and damn proud of it. I enjoy living in a country where we don't lick the bootstraps of the US at every turn.

<br>
So much to be proud of.  Your pride in being unappreciative is commendable.  Just so you realize that you only bring up problems you have with the US because of our magnimosity (granted, I'm fairly sure you do realize this, hence your jealous, envious, dislike for the US). <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">Aidon</a>
