====================================== <br>
<br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
<br>
Version 1.52D Test Release Notes <br>
<br>
Tuesday, July 30, 2002 <br>
<br>
====================================== <br>
<br>
<br>
SCHEDULING NOTES <br>
<br>
We're wrapping up the changes for version 1.52, which consists of changes that will affect players will want to respec - i.e. we've made lots of changes to spells, abilities, combat armor tables, as well as lots of other specialization-specific updates. We don't plan on putting any more changes into 1.52 that will change skills, abilities, or specializations, so we currently plan to take 1.52 live on Tuesday, August 6 with the changes that have been included in 1.52 up until this time. Of course if we find that we need to re-address an issue or find problems with the version, we'll take the steps necessary to fix them. <br>
<br>
We're doing this so that we can get the respec out to players as soon as possible - there's no need to wait for respec while we work on Spellcrafting and Alchemy, the next two big items on the plate. <br>
<br>
So, 1.53 will start testing internally next week as soon as 1.52 goes live, and will contain Spellcrafting and Alchemy, as well as any other melee fixes and RvR tweaks that will not require specialization changes. Expect to see these items up on Pendragon for testing soon after that. <br>
<br>
Of course if, in the future, we decide that we need to make changes of such a large magnitude that they will require a specialization change, we'll add in a respec option for those classes/specializations that are affected by the change at that time. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A NOTE ON BOLTS <br>
<br>
A quick note of explanation about bolt spells. As every &quot;robe&quot; caster knows, bolt spells are intended to hit targets that are not in combat. They do much more damage than direct damage spells, but they are usable only in certain situations. A bug was fixed in 1.52C which changes how the game determines if a player or monster is &quot;in combat&quot; - now to be truly flagged as in combat, you must actively be attacking someone (or something) else. Previously, large numbers of players would be flagged as &quot;in combat&quot; when they were in fact not actively engaging someone. So, theoretically, that change made bolts easier to use in RvR, although they still will not be usable in all situations. Please test this on Pendragon. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- The Flurry ability for Blademasters and Mercenaries is no longer resistable. This fixes a Pendragon-only bug. <br>
<br>
- Staves are now repaired by Fletchers instead of Weaponcrafters. There was a bug where Fletchers could make staves, but not repair them. <br>
<br>
- Some spell and ability icons had the wrong &quot;widgets&quot; on them. These have been fixed. These fixes are to Pendragon-only bugs. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ARMOR TABLE REDUX <br>
<br>
Based on player, tester, and Team Lead feedback, we've made some additional changes to armor tables, which specifies how damage from different weapons is assessed against different armors. With these changes, you'll find that there is no one best weapon to specialize in - there is a good one that will work in most situations, but judicious use of another may result in better damage in some situations. <br>
<br>
- First and foremost, you no longer get a double defensive bonus base on your armor's resistance to an attack. You get the standard bonus, but nothing extra. This will even out the damage allotment. <br>
<br>
- Now armors are set to &quot;vulnerable&quot;, &quot;resistant&quot;, or &quot;neutral&quot;. If an armor is neutral to a damage type, it will literally have no bonus or negative. <br>
<br>
- We've added specific armor tables for Norse Chain, Norse Leather, Norse Studded, and Hibernian Leather to spread out the damage options. <br>
<br>
<br>
Here's the table: <br>
<br>
Plate Chain N Chain Scale Rein N Stud Studded Leather N Leat Hib Leat <br>
Thrust Resist Vuln Vuln Neut Neut Resist Vuln Resist Resist Neut <br>
Crush Vuln Resist Neut Resist Vuln Neut Resist Vuln Neut Vuln <br>
Slash Neut Neut Resist Vuln Resist Vuln Neut Neut Vuln Resist <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SPELL NOTES <br>
<br>
- All targeted spells should now properly print their damage type when Delved. <br>
<br>
- Increased radius of Healer &quot;Allay Area&quot; line to 350, which is more consistent with the radii of analogous lines in the other realms. <br>
<br>
- Fixed the Bard and Warden spec healing line's spell characteristics to match the Druid's as originally intended. This affected casting time and power cost. <br>
<br>
- Lowered casting time on the Wizard &quot;Summon Fire&quot; and &quot;Minor Combustion&quot; single target direct damage lines to make them more consistent with the casting time of analogous lines in the other realms. <br>
<br>
- Put the Wizard's Calefaction &quot;Bolt of Lava&quot; line on a separate recast timer from the Pyromancy &quot;Minor Fire Streak&quot; line. <br>
<br>
- Changed the Spiritmaster &quot;Gloom Wave&quot; line to have a casting time of 3 seconds and a range of 1500. This rounds out Midgard's ranged area effect Crowd Control capability. <br>
<br>
- Fixed the Warden pulsing bladeturn line (starting with &quot;Nature's Guard&quot;) to be castable in combat as originally intended. <br>
<br>
- Increased the run speed of Theurgist air and earth summons. <br>
<br>
- Reduced the chance of the stun proc on Theurgist air summons. The high chance of these procs going off, combined with the lack of re-cast timer, was able to chain stun targets with no hope of escaping. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
- The name regions on the cities have been adjusted. <br>
<br>
- A few horse routes have been changed so you are dropped off closer to the stable master. They are: <br>
<br>
Snowdonia Station to Caer Witrin <br>
Gna Faste to Hugginfel <br>
Adribard to Castle Sauvage <br>
Caer Ulfwych to Cornwall <br>
Tir na mBeo to Drum Ligen <br>
<br>
- Paladin trainers will now give a thrusting weapon choice when you join your guild. Armsman trainers will now give a two-handed choice when you join your guild. Infiltrator trainers will now give a thrusting choice when you join your guild. <br>
<br>
<br>
- Realm V. Realm - Battlegrounds: You will no longer take faction hits from monsters that are killed in the Battlegrounds. <br>
<br>
- Albion: The spiritual advisor room in Stonehenge Barrows has been revisited and slightly tweaked again. <br>
<br>
- Midgard: Tomte Runners are no longer set as Scouts in Nisse's Lair. <br>
<br>
- Hibernia: The Koalinth bouncer in Koalinth Caverns that kept walking through the wall after he finished his patrol has been fixed. <br>
<br>
- Hibernia: The rocky golems in Treibh Caillte should now react in a more consistent manner. <br>
<br>
- Midgard: The two windswept wraith camps in Jamtlands have had their spawn rate increased. <br>
<br>
<br>
Items <br>
<br>
- In Hibernia, the Mischievous Greenbriar set of armor should now have an appropriate 25% magical bonus instead of 15%. <br>
<br>
- Nightshades wishing to exchange their weaker Moonlit Leggings for a more useful pair of Leather Moonlit Leggings should speak to Blathnaid's assistant, Nona, in the Chamber of Stealth in Tir Na Nog. You may only exchange the item one time. <br>
<br>
<br>
Mordred Specific Notes <br>
<br>
- There is now an alternate means to complete the Departed Fellowship Quest. Search the druid groves near Keltoi Fogou.<br>
<br>

I'll comment on this later after I&quot;m done analyzing the patch notes <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 7/30/02 3:03:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubaym.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baym</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 3:20:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.52F Pendragon Patch, Armor Changes Included:</span><hr size=1> So let me see if I get this straight. SBs will now be facing leather Nightshades and Infiltrators who are either neutral or resistant to our only form of attack, slashing, but if they spec slash we are vulnerable. Seems completely fair.<br>
<br>
Gee those extra 50 hps sure come in handy now.<br>
<br>
Guess SBs were not beat down enough.<br>
<br>
Course, I could just respec to another line like pierce/thrust. Oops.<br>
<br>

Hib leather resistant to slash?!!?!? Does this mean I have half a chance vs my honorable foes in Midgard and Albion now?

<br>
+: +15% bonus<br>
=: 0% change<br>
-: -15% penalty<br>
<br>
Pierce Nightshades:<br>
<br>
- Albion Plate (2)<br>
+ Albion Chain (3) [2 are instamez]<br>
+ Midgard Chain (5) [2 are instamez]<br>
+ Albion Studded (1)<br>
- Midgard Studded (2)<br>
- Albion Leather (2)<br>
- Midgard Leather (1)<br>
<br>
As far as Pierce Nightshade changes are concerned, their vulnerable targets increased by +1 from the last patch, which is the Scout. All other classes are kept at full resistance, and none of which went to neutral. 4 of the 8 vulnerable chain targets are also instamez classes. There are no neutral armor types other than Cloth, everything about Hibernian Piercing is an extreme, including full resistance by all other Assassins, which other Assassin spec lines will not have it as bad as you will see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blade Nightshades:<br>
<br>
= Albion Plate (2)<br>
= Albion Chain (3) [2 are instamez]<br>
- Midgard Chain (5) [2 are instamez]<br>
= Albion Studded (1)<br>
+ Midgard Studded (2)<br>
= Albion Leather (2)<br>
+ Midgard Leather (1)<br>
<br>
Bladeshades got a general increase in targets, which they were severely lacking before. Most of the Slash targets went from being resistant to neutral, which is a general boon, however their vulnerable targets actually did not increase, as Albion Leather became neutral and Midgard Studded became vulnerable. Bladeshades have the potential of being diverse, and aside from inherent class bonuses of other Assassins, seems to have the best anti-assassin specline potential by having no penalties versus leather.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thrust Infiltrators:<br>
<br>
+ Midgard Chain (5) [2 are isntamez]<br>
= Hibernian Scale (4)<br>
- Midgard Studded (2)<br>
= Hibernian Reinforced (3) [1 is instamez]<br>
- Midgard Leather (1)<br>
= Hibernian Leather (1)<br>
<br>
Thrust Infiltrators have less non-instamez vulnerable targets by 2 than the Pierce Nightshade. The major difference though is that there are many Neutrals by +8, where the rest of the Pierce Nightshade targets are fully resistant. This will restore the flexibility that was lost to Thrust Infiltrators since the last pendragon patch and give them a wider variety of targets to choose from.<br>
<br>
<br>
Slash Infiltrators:<br>
<br>
- Midgard Chain (5) [2 are isntamez]<br>
+ Hibernian Scale (4)<br>
+ Midgard Studded (2)<br>
- Hibernian Reinforced (3) [1 is instamez]<br>
+ Midgard Leather (1)<br>
- Hibernian Leather (1)<br>
<br>
Similar to Pierce Nightshades, Slash Infiltrators are always at an extreme. The major difference is that none of the 8 vulnerable targets are instamez classes. It is no longer a pure Assassin hunting specline as well, since it is 50/50 whether it has a bonus/resist against another Assassin, but the Studded targets added 2 more vulnerable targets since the last patch, a nice addition.<br>
<br>
<br>
All Shadowblades:<br>
<br>
= Albion Plate (2)<br>
= Albion Chain (3) [2 are instamez]<br>
+ Hibernian Scale (4)<br>
= Albion Studded (1)<br>
- Hibernian Reinforced (3) [1 is instamez]<br>
= Albion Leather (2)<br>
- Hibernian Leather (1)<br>
<br>
<br>
Shadowblades over time will see this as a general boon against all classes, despite the pure Assassin hunting aspect does not apply. Previous resistances to Albion Plate, Chain, and Studded just went to Neutral, and Scale retains the bonus. There is only a penalty to 4 classes total. Assassin hunting just went out the door, but 6 more targets just became neutral since last patch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note to Nightshades: From the conclusive nature of this patch as was presented in the opening paragraphs, it is safe to say that this IS what piercing will be, whether we like it or not. I hate to say it, but Bladeshades seem the only way to go, which is not bad for the specline minus the part about our strength, but I hate to see piercing get hosed like this. <br>

Doublefrost is still a ***** .  No, I'm not calling for a nerf.  It used to hit harder than that, at least with 314 that's 3 hits now I can live through and hopefully get an evade off to diamond back their arse.

I was very much excited that we were going to get a wider spread of targets, but now we get a wider spread at a heavy cost. The targets I typically hunt such as infilts, nightshades, &amp; rangers, now get a bonus against me. Does this make sense?<br>

Plate got easier, Sb's still will have no shot at killing armsmen, and will still only kill paladins when there is a whole lot of room to roam.<br>
<br>
= Albion Chain (3) [2 are instamez]<br>
Clerics? please.  Minstrels? Even worse.<br>
This leaves the Merc, which are under played and general spec in slash weapons.<br>
<br>
+ Hibernian Scale (4)<br>
Here we have something at least.  <br>
<br>
We'll destroy druids.<br>
<br>
Hero's, still a big problem, I don't care how much better we hit them. No way.<br>
<br>
Champs and wardens.<br>
<br>
Well, here's our new target list.  By no means easy fights, but we have targets.<br>
<br>
<br>
= Albion Studded (1)<br>
Scouts have shield stun.  Shield stun is bad.<br>
<br>
- Hibernian Reinforced (3) [1 is instamez]<br>
Well, we can't hit bards anymore.  That was a CC class that I would normally go after.  The instamez made it tough.  The negs are going to make it even tougher.<br>
<br>
See hidden.  Yippee.  Rangers will hurt.  Another class we're supposed to hunt is now a iffy fight.<br>
<br>
Blademasters.  Well, there's not many out there anyways, so I guess this isn't a big deal.<br>
<br>
= Albion Leather (2)<br>
OOf, as if we don't have problems enough with infiltrators.  Before they were tough, now they are impossible.  They are truly truly the dominant rogue in all way shapes and forms now.   Slash infs will breath on us and we'll fall over dead.<br>
<br>
Friars.  Well, I'm not sure what to think about friars.<br>
<br>
- Hibernian Leather (1)<br>
Fights with nightshades are now pretty much even.  NS's are weaker con/str/hitpoints wise.  Shadowblades are weaker spec wise (leftaxe requires tons of points, most ns's have lifebanet).  Bladeshades will own us.<br>
<br>
<br>
Targets we lose.<br>
<br>
NS's, INF's, Rangers, Bards.<br>
<br>
<br>
Targets we gain.<br>
<br>
Champs, Druids, Wardens, Merc's.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
No offense elaa, but if you think any shadowblade on earth is going to help shadowblades in any way shape or form, you're fooling yourself.<br>
<br>
Slash, the only choice of  Shadowblades best works on......<br>
MIDGARD targets!!!<br>
<br>
That is just stupid.  Period.<br>
<br>
<br>
If I had to get nailed down, I'd say....<br>

The only classes that assassins have to worry about are other assassins (and on rare occassion TS archers).<br>
<br>
Assassins can pick and choose their targets... except for one, another assassin.  These armor changes put SBs at a huge disadvantage in the encounters which are most important for them to win.<br>

Take heart though SBs, IMO this is an unintentional nerf based upon an ignorance of the fundamental mechanics of the game.  It's likely to be changed if you complain enough, which you have every right to do in this case. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uraggoktp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaggokTP</A> at: 7/30/02 9:57:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 11:17:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.52F Pendragon Patch, Armor Changes Included:</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&quot;While I respect your opinion elaa, i think you're looking at this wrong.

Bile, I don't mean for you to get me wrong, I'm comparing these changes this in relation to patch 1.52d, not in relation to 1.51 live. From 1.52d to 1.52f, general targets increased (even Pierce shades got a boost of 1 target), but Assassin vs Assassin fights took a big hosing, and that is where the majority of Assassin fights occur, and Shadowblades thrive on that playstyle.<br>

I wouldn't cry too much if they changed SBs LA to DW so that I only need to have 12 instead of 42 spec... sure would make our templates a little higher (omg, 825 points that I can spend on something!  I would be able to consider taking one line to natural 50... Inf can take 2 there).<br>
<br>
I'm sorry my brother Infs, but I still honestly feel that you get too many points [if Disguise is not gonna be in the game, that's the reason you got them], but I'm not gonna push it too hard in the hope that common sense will prevail (see, I'm an optimist).<br>
<br>
But like I said, if the Buffbots get address, I think everyone will be alot happier... bigtime!<br>

<br>
Just realize that you're little reports are one thing that Mythic acually reads.  At least they SAID they do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reading your report here, it looks as if SB's are getting a enhancement.  Please keep the tone where it is... we're nerfed... big time, as we, as shadowblades, have been tailored toward stealther killers since inception with our slashing only style.<br>
<br>
This is going to kill the class.<br>
<br>
SB's have weathered the nerfs, but, this is a bit much.  I don't think that Mythic knows how bad this will hurt us.  They need to.... somehow.<br>
<br>

<br>
You want the facts? Fine.  Here they are.<br>
This (Norseman)guy that I went up against WASNT using a buffbot, when he died, he didn't loose anything but my poison effects.  He DID have Ignore Pain.  He WAS a yellow con.  His absense of Dodger was also evident in the way he fought. How quickly you jump on the buffbot bandwagon as the answer to any damage over what you think should be published.  I only post legitament numbers people, if you can't handle that, then you picked the wrong class to play.  The number I posted was also BEFORE Midgard took the 3 STR relics.  The night before actually.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to who got off a stun though, with any fight.  If I get it, I win, if they get it, they win.<br>
<br>
So explain it to me one more time?  No one is now allowed to make comments about shadowblades but shadowblades?<br>
<br>
The Hibernian leather resists are going to hurt your class, how hard, only time will tell.  I do believe if it goes live as is, it will be a significant hit.  Who knows if it will even go live as it stands.  Perhaps Mythic will realize that you all only have one option to spec, Slash.  Why should you be penalized for that?  You shouldn't.  Either give shadowblades the option to spec crush, where you will here nerf's from the entire Albion plate wearing community, or allow them to spec Piercing.  If they give shadowblades the opportunity to spec Piercing or Crushing, would that bring your class up to a point where we no longer have to tip toe around making shadowblade comments then I welcome it.<br>
<br>
Funny, I thought this was a Rogue Board.<br>
<br>
Bile, your right, this is going to hurt shadowblades, but hopefully someone at Mythic will realize that are penalizing the ONLY option your class has.<br>
<br>
Oh and let me clarify one more time for the slow crowd.  YOU CAN TELL IF THEY ARE USING A BUFFBOT WHEN THEY DIE. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A> at: 7/31/02 6:40:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 9:25:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Thank you.<br>

<br>
I appreciate very much the thoughts and support from the nightshade and infiltrator communities.  Shadowblades keep going downward and this is another giant step down.<br>
<br>
I also hope they get their head out of their butt..... i doubt it will happen, but one can hope.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Either way...<br>
<br>
Thanks to those infiltrators and NS's who are seeing through the BS and Morons to rally to the cause.<br>
<br>
Know, that we shadowblades support you as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
NO<br>
MORE<br>
NERFS!<br>
<br>
NONE<br>
TO ANY ROGUE.<br>
PERIOD!<br>
