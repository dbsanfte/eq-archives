Depends on how you consider &quot;farther&quot;. SKs can keep their own hp up considerably better than a monk can, if you take Mend out of the equation, and if they're only taking the occasional blow, better. Lifetaps &gt; Mend.<br>

Dunno about that. Have a bad streak with the RNG, and you're mulch. An SK will probably have a good 1-2k hp on the monk if we're talking endgame type stuff, which is the entire reasoning behind this nerf.<br>

That's the amusing thing. It may well make us better at soloing if our avoidance goes up. <br>
<br>
The reason, though, that there's been so much outcry about this change/nerf/whatever is simply because a vocal minority has, once again, effected a major change in the game. Quite bluntly, Verant should STOP listening to the players, unless the numbers are in the thousands about a given issue. 1% of the game's population is NOT indicative of a &quot;problem&quot; with the other 99%.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udzenmercedmuir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DzenMercedMuir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/13/02 8:51:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=81>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Monk Changes</span><hr size=1> Changes are coming... I have resigned myself to the fact.<br>
<br>
I only ask we be given a reasonable balance with other melee and hybrid classes.<br>
<br>
Maintain our ability to pull.  (discipline changes if the nerf is significant)<br>
<br>
Make sure we are the second/third best melee class by a good margin. Rogue should be the only class ahead it seems to me.  Maybe ranger when archery is involved.  A sk or pally with spells(fury etc) and similar aa expenditure should not outdamage us.<br>
<br>
Make sure we are at worst the fourth best defensive melee class.  Behind Warrior/Paladin and maybe SK.<br>
<br>
I have been feeling for some time that the gap between ranger/pally/sk and pure melee is closing dramatically.  This seems less then best.  There was always some penalty for being a hybrid in the past.   I'm not so sure there is anymore.<br>
<br>
I would prefer you lower the stats on some items.  All/All or monk only as opposed to nerfing the base defense of a monk.  Just dont remove monk from the useable class on an item.  It would be hard to equip a few slots overnight with reasonable gear.<br>
<br>
While I may have passed that point in the game I think it would be a shame to hurt the pre 60 monks with casual gear.<br>
<br>
If this nerf is only targeted at the high end monk then institute a cap and tell us what it is.  We will complain less.  <br>
<br>
My rogue dinged 37 today... preparing for the nerf to be so bad I dont want to be a monk anymore.   I'm not sure I have the energy to level another class to 60+.  Please don't weaken or change the role of the one I love to a degree that I would consider finding an alternative.<br>

I'm level 58, have 2603hp and 1101ac unbuffed.  I can tank decently in exp groups (not in high level dungeons since I don't do that sort of thing) and I can solo dark blues with ease as long as they aren't tearing my tail off and beating me with it.  The only thing I'm worried about is that when this whole change takes place, what is the casual gamer, such as myself, going to do?  I understand the change was 'needed' in a way, but to drop our softcap to 1050 sounds kind of harsh.  I take hits pretty hard as it is, if I take hits for full I doubt I'll be of any use nor will I be able to efficiently solo (which I don't do too often anyways). <br>
<br>
I know I don't know what the high end game is about, nor will I ever.  It doesn't interest me, to say the least.  I prefer having fun with friends and, if needed, tank a mob that needs to be tanked while the group finishes off the main target.  If these changes do make that much of a difference, my personal use in groups will be flushed down the crapper and I'll be basically at square one again.  Maybe I should go back to the necro and just do my thing like I normally do, heh.<br>

As far as uber goes...<br>

I'm unguilded, and definitely not uber.  At 59 I'm running around with 2252hp, 1148ac unbuffed (1170 with epic/wf effects going), with fairly easily obtainable/purchasable gear by a group of 6ish (with exception of CoM, anyway).<br>

<br>
Let me begin with stating my goal of my message as I posted as some people are thinking wrongly of me:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Unmistakable Voice of Reason:<br>
&quot;Note how Absor jumps into a thread started by a non-monk, basically agreeing with the change to a class fundamental and using logic which is completely fallacious. &quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My goal was to try to calm down monks that read the Verant message wrong. As maybe any guild we also were discussing the monk changes on our guild forum and I saw monks panicking. I reread Verants message to try to understand what was being said going ONLY with that message and my own experience (3 years of playing EQ). My messages goal was to try being objective in analysing what Verant said. <br>
<br>
If you want my opinion (as an EQ player, Shaman, Warrior, SK, Bard, Rogue, Wizard, Magician) about the monk change then I would say considering all that is talked about (yes I didn't form an opinion yet on the monk changes before I made the post) that the change of reducing the mitigation factor of the monks is not the solution to have monks tank less. Except from that my opinion is that monks didn't need a nerf and I'm not jealous when I see monks solo. I also don't mind monks abilities to tank a bit at raids as every melee class should be more or less able to protect other classes such as magicians/wizards etc.<br>
<br>
That Absor did reply to my message could well have been because it was stickied, and yes I also was flabbergasted it became stickied, but I thank the mod for it as this thread became a nice constructive debate about the monk changes. I just hope it wasn't only because my name &quot;Myka&quot; was familiar heehee. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Junu Peeth<br>
&quot;In the second paragraph they don't make that distinction: &quot;they will get a decreased benefit to their <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> overall ability to take damage</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;. Personally I read this as being that a monk post patch will take more damage overall (after avoidance and mitigation are factored) than the monk does now.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I read it like it was missing the 'and avoid damage' section. If it would have read &quot;they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage and avoid damage&quot; then I would also have read that both avoidance and mitigation was to be altered. Understand that I'm not English speaking from birth and I don't easily read information between lines when it's not in my own language (Dutch).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Zikoz:<br>
Fortunately for Absor (verant), the stickied thread was one written by a warrior which defends their decision. It's the strategy that Zadkiel referenced earlier in this thread.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See above, I just made an analyse of the message made by Verant. As the thread grows we see first test results, we see others making good constructive replies about the items and average ac of monks. I refrained from my opinion if or not the nerf was justified, I did discuss/defend though the possibility of the Verant message being read wrong. So I didn't defend (and don't do) their decision. (PS: I hope this section is usefull as defending yourself due to possible flames isn't really constructive to the monk debate.)<br>

West Wing respawns on a 72 minute timer.  A full set of plate armor should take only a few hours to gather; it won't all go to the same person, but neither will drops from North.<br>
<br>
Long ago we did HoT (East ToV) as a guild for a week (one or two rounds every night and a couple of rounds in the weekend), and got over 15 BP's/tunics/robes -- not to mention the other armor.  We did this to up the baseline of our guild abit, you can't really it that easily in North.  Armor drops are even more common in West Wing from recent experiences.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You say that the Warrior drops can be farmed easier? I agree.

Don't expect any sympathy from me.  Have you ever looked at the monk Velious armor, the Kunark armor (crescent armor I think), the Fear armor?  Most of those armors are inferior in every way, not just ac, but also on resists.<br>
<br>
It's like whining that the hard mobs in North don't drop anything for you, when you already got decent armor that can be done with a random pick up raid.  It takes quite a bit longer to be able to get into North as a guild (primal is almost a requirement, which requires quite a few ST keys).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Which means that Monks (also Rangers and Rogues, but thats a different issue) are being outfitted in armor that is equal to Warlords. Doesn't that strike you as messed up?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, the armor is messed up (even casters can wear).  Is that a reason to nerf monks?  No, they're just trying to get something more than the pathetic 6 ac on their Skyshrine quested legs.<br>
<br>
We didn't ask to get armor with similair ac as a warrior; but if its handed to you, wouldn't you wear it?<br>

Fungi tunic is 21 ac, and it's not even monk only.  It's defaulted to monks often though, not just because of the regen, but also because it is the highest AC tunic Kunark had to offer for monks.<br>

<br>
You are being drawn into his trap.<br>
<br>
In North ToV, every single slot offers FAR superior items for either all plate classes or warriors than the all/all stuff unless you add in the Vulak Aerr pieces.  Halfing the AC on all Vulak loots would, in effect, fix the entire problem.<br>
<br>
But a warrior suited in North ToV drops has a greatly superior AC than any monk suited in North ToV drops.  A comparison of 1400 for the monk and 1800 for the warrior.  Many warriors haven't tried to accumulate this AC as it doesn't work correctly in game.  Once more, however, this points to the need to fix the game mechanic and not touch monks.<br>
