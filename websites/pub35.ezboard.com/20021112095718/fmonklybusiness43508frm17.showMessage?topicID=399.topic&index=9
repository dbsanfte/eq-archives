As a Human Monk we REALLY got shafted as I think VI believes there aren't too many of us left.<br>
<br>
In my experience last might (in CT) I was taking 30% more damage on pulls, and being smacked around like a paper doll.  I personally think I have above average gear for my Monk (AC 1100 - 1112 with Epic effect, ATK 1080 - 1133 with Epic effect HPs 2500 unbuffed (approx. 3700 with Ageo).<br>
<br>
Pulling?  Ha, on one split pull I came back with 1/2 bubble and the Cleric just managed to get a heal off.  They feel we need to be dropped below Plate mitigation, fine, I can see that, BUT, I felt like a meleeing Druid, and USELESS on pulling.  The mitigation change is too great atm (imo).<br>
<br>
My Monk's been the one and only character (and Main) since Nov. 1999.  I worked HARD to attain or get the PP for evry piece of equipment on me.  I was one who HATED the change to being a more equipment dependant class post-Kunark; but adjusted because then Abashi was saying it was 'good for the game, and no one's complaining'.<br>
<br>
My question is: Monks were only NON equipment dependant for about 12 months (Kunark appeared in April 2000).  Now, 2 and 1/2 years later, VI spouts about how they were wrong and 'made a mistake regarding Monks'; (even though Alan said (in response to other Classes concerns just before SoL went live a year ago): 'We think Monks are right where they should be.'<br>
<br>
Again, this begs the question: 'Do ANY of the programmmers on the Dev Team TRUELY bother to actually play thge game the way we do anymore?'<br>
<br>
Also, I agree that SOME more definite statement needs to be made about the actual level of the mitigation nerf (some actual NUMBERS VI, such as the Wizards and Mages received regarding their Nerfs, and the Warriors, SK, etc. received on their enhacements.<br>
<br>
I think it just goes to show that NO ONE at VI has ever played a Monk recently; OR that they now wish they could just remove the Class from the game.<br>
<br>
2.5 years to notice what they NOW perceive as a GLARING imbalance (and even despite comments in the last year to the contrary?).  <br>
<br>
Yep, sounds to me like the Dev Team really does understand it's own game, the concept of Customer Service, and REALLY earns their paycheck.<br>
<br>
I think in addition to e-mailing Alan, people should also e-mail Smed if his address is still availabe.  He also should be made aware how people feel at the Dev Team's level of customer interaction.<br>
<br>
A further comment from VI needs to be made to the Monk playerbase (imo). <p><center><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30466" TARGET="_blank"><image src = "http://www.catplex.org/chilau/chilau_fk5.jpg"></a>

I've been bringing up a Shaman on my other comp to replace my BL, so this is the first week that I've hunted with him in SolB so I can't really compare pre/post patch because his level is changing as well.  Many of the Monks I talked to L48-53 were just about ready to quit, and most had /feedbacked.<br>
<br>
54 Monk here, Epic Fists, no Fungi/T-Staff.  Epic/SoS buffed 1101 AC, 2200 HP.  With the Shammy buffs around 1150 ATK, and add another hundred HP or so.<br>
<br>
Got bored in SolB so I decided to try some Imps.  For some screwy reason earlier this week Kobolds were whacking me, LDC's were just about smooshing me (and remember this isn't solo, this is with a Shammie backup, albeit a low 40's one), and the one time I tried to get an Imp, eh.   So post patch how did I do against Imps?  Much better then I had expected.  In fact I would almost say I was taking less damage then I used to against them, but the last time I fought them I only had 30% slow BUT had a BL pet adding damage.<br>
<br>
So I won't say that this is a good patch in any ways, too many people saying that they are getting slaughtered.  What I am saying is that some Monks in some situations might not be noticing any difference.  Others do.  That might be why some Monks are saying this is killing us, and others saying to quit whining. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubenzai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Benzai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 9:28:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=399.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> My experiences are somewhat similar to Chilau's...you can see my magelo in the sig, but basically, I'm level 60 and have similar stats to Chilau (AC ~ 1100, hp's mid-2000's, etc.).<br>
<br>
I've spent the last week in Droga, farming faction for Chardok.  I've killed hundreds and hundreds of green-con goblins and I know what I can kill, how many, etc. and usually have a good idea on how I'll do.  The only real variable is if I'm pulling lots of mosstroopers or depradators (SK's with Harm touch) in which case I'll take quite a bit more damage than normal.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I noticed two things.  One was that these little greenies were hurting me worse than before.  I didn't parse anything, before or after, partly because I don't know how to, but I've spent so many hours down there, doing the same damn thing over and over and over, that I have a pretty good idea that I was indeed affected by this patch.  Negatively so.<br>
<br>
The other thing I noticed was agro.  I'm drawing a helluva lot more of it now.  I could run through some gobbies without drawing agro at times.  Last night I couldn't.  I was getting agro from a lot more goblins from a lot farther away.  I admit that I'm a little surprised that I haven't seen any other comments on altered agro.  I suppose it could be possible that I had a bad string of higher level gobbies throughout the dungeon that were agroing on me, but I did catch, at the end of the night, some snippets in guildchat about a failed Hate raid that the rest of my guildmates went through.  They said that the agro up in Hate was totally bizarre and made their attempt just at breaking the zone hell.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing some parsed data and hearing feedback.  I didn't like what I saw, personally, and I'm still trying to understand VI's line of thinking for how they 'fix' these perceived problems.  I believe they went about it all the wrong way and the nerfs (all of them) aren't solutions for the overall health of the game but simply quick, lazy fixes that don't address the root of the problems.  I'm not writing letters or threatening anyone, but if they've gimped me hard enough, I'll quit, no questions asked.  I pay them money and I expect my money to buy some fun not this kind of nonsense (oh yeah, btw, my 2nd toon is a 56 mage, my first character ever, whom I quit long ago because they gimped that class hard enough - now they're taking shots at my monk /sigh)... <p>Benzai Hongkongfooey<BR>

Remember the old world critters in some examples are based on uber acs being around 800.  If you have 1100 ac and mid 50s of course you not going to notice a difference. Not to mention the ungodly damage output you have against these old world critters.  When bronze was the main stay armor and a yak was totally uber. And monks went at it with their fist no weapons and surely no epics. The best haste they had was a fbss. And the rare monk with a cof or rbb.<br>

Please try something in ME or Akheva. See if these critter that are based on 1200 being the soft cap for ac and up to lvl 60 pcs beating on them.  How does your defense stack up against those critters that are made for you much higher acs and damage output.  If there still no difference then I would say that the nerf is nothing to complain about.

Seems to me if monster A is a lot harder for me then monster B, and both are dark blue to me, then I'll be fighting monster B k thx.<br>
<br>
I dunno why people go fight some version of a &quot;giant&quot; with lots of hp, or a caster, or something else and then complain they cant solo it. Suprise, I cant solo a dark blue giant, but I can solo other dark blues. Think I'm gonna keep trying the giant?<br>
<br>
So the lesson learned is, a monster he can get exp from that &quot;anyone can solo&quot;. good! I see nothing wrong there. A test of soloability is the smarts to know where to go solo, not just the color of the mob's con. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarayalebon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Araya LeBon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1188<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 11:30:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=399.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thepalecourt.com/brent4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hehe</span><hr size=1> &quot;A test of soloability is the smarts to know where to go solo, not just the color of the mob's con&quot;<br>
<br>
Yea...it takes a great feat of logic to realize that VL is 1 of 3 zones in the game where you aren't getting the crap kicked out of you regularly.<br>
<br>
Sorry, before the nerf I was saying the same thing about the VL/FG people while I was tearing up mobs in Chardok/HS/DN/SG for way better XP...nice how the role is suddenly reversed due to the swing of the bat.   Those that had the balls to stay out of the gimp circuit are now forced back into it.<br>

Pre-patch could tank ssra mobs pretty well, after patch, i noticed i got hit alot harder.. much more 200+ hits, whereas before i would get hit for a lotta 150's.. still no prob tanking ssra mobs tho.. i really think this hurt the lower lvl and non-uber monks more than well geared monks..<br>
