Don't forget the melee-range bug however when weighing the melees.<br><br>Enchanters are kings of Time Control. First thing they do is remove their defensive/survival power greatly (Pillage Enchantment), next is another hit to their defensive ability (Tishania), next removes their ability to attack/defend totally (Enthrall), next is the removal of their escape (Root, STRLose), then apply the clock (Discordant), follow again with removal of their ability to attack/defend (remez), continue with clock/time control.<br><br>You cant get more time control with that. You could always control them even more with shiftless or sieves etc. To remove more of their offense/defense.<br><br>Having said that I prefer Time control to both pure offense and pure defense. I generally break up the classes like this:<br>Offense:<br>Warrior, Rogue, Wizard, Necromancer, Magician, Druid, Monk, Shadowknight.<br><br>Defense:<br>Cleric, Paladin, Bard.<br><br>Time Control:<br>Shaman, Enchanter, Ranger.<br><br>At high levels the Rogue can be changed over to Time control with a little preparation consisting of root poisons and the duelist discipline which puts a huge damage clock on them and removes their ability to get themselves out of the situation by muscle lock which drops STR by like 80 super snaring them till one of the 2 of you is stopped, plus them having high resists to hamper your ability to kill them and dual wielding quick weapons to remove your offensive abilities as well as defensive.<br><br>Assuming correct preparation, The triangle usually goes like this:<br>Time control beats Defense.<br>Offense beats Time control.<br>Defense beats Offense.<br><br>Time control can usually eliminate the defense ability of the Defense classes and outlast them, while they lose to very quick offense. Very staunch defense will usually be able to escape somehow using the time given to them by their large amount of immunity to attack, a warrior dual wielding 40's on an enchanter hurts more than a Aegolism'd cleric who can last over twice as long in the face of the same offense assuming he doesnt get off a lot of remedies or something. Wizards have an insanely hard time killing fully buffed full mana clerics especially remedy capable ones. They can remedy as fast as the wizard can lure through their 40 resist buffs for each resist. The clerics can usually gate from this fight NP.<br><br>Also within each category there are matchups which usually end up in favor of the one with the best offense. A Ranger will usually win out against an Enchanter because his offense is faster and his clock starts earlier than the enchanters. By asserting its clock early as well as its hindering your ability to attack/defend (dual wield) it accomplishes its mission faster and wins. If the Enchanter can get off a dazzle it has all the time in the world to: remove your ability to offend (Rerune), remove your ability to retreat (STRLose), Remove youre ability to defend (Sieve so no dispells to allow yourself movement), etc. And the Enchanter has a technically won game.<br><br>Same for the defense category, Paladins will win against clerics ALL DAY LONG. They have better offense than clerics and thats what wins out in the end.<br><br>In agressive category its a little different, usually its the one that gets the attack. If a Necro attacks a wizard the wizard will most likely lose. If a wizard attacks a necro they better hope they have a lot of deflux mana handy and the WIZ doesnt have rune up(removes the HP gain from deflux and removes their offensive power from deflux totally). If a Warrior attacks a mage the mage better hope they can outrun the warrior because the warrior will be able to cut them to ribbons before the pet kills 2k and some odd amount of HP with all the AC.<br><br>Having said that: Try to create a balanced team across all the categories. One of each is a good start. If you pick the right mix you can go with say Ranger, Ranger, Druid and their time clocks can come into play very fast and make up for your inability to weather long fights (with a Defensive comrade such as a BRD or CLR).<br><br>Either go with one of each or 2 time controls and one offense or 2 offense and 1 time control. Those are the big winners overall.<br><br>DONT go for 3 Defensive, DONT go for 3 offensive (you will get wiped out a lot), 3 Time Control can get away with it if their offense is fast enough(2 RNG 1 SHM, etc).<br><br>Note there are exceptions to every rule and the previously mentioned WIZ/ENC/BRD is one particular one. None of those can work together to amplify their offense or defense. One Ranger on a caster and they will get a spell off sometimes if the ranger gets a few misses, put 2 Rangers on someone and they damn sure wont cast anything offensive or defensive(Unless its a spell that shouldnt exist like shadowstep).<br><br>Im sure we can all see how the two rangers cover each other very well and also fully double the damage the other is dealing.<br><br>Also note that 3 Offense should defeat 3 defense and probably would in an even fight but see what happens when 3 rangers go after 3 necromancers all of them starting off with pet snares. The necros wont last long AT ALL. The rangers time clocks will be ticking on the opponent at the same time they realize they need to attack/defend and the rangers have already removed a good portion of their offense and have started asserting their own by dual wielding on the sittin casters  Unless the necros can pull out a miracle out of somewhere they will lose because they werent allowed to be agressive.<br><br>Axiom: When thrown into another role that class will generally not perform well. If you try to tell a wizard to be defensive or time control (Root?) they wont be effective at all. If you tell a CLR to be offensive they wont have near the power they need. If you try to tell a bard to go offensive versus a warrior it will take forever for them to win.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unimmbull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimmbull</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/01 12:53:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SullonZek-Class-Advantages:</span><hr size=1> I have not been killed yet.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>But I hold no illusions, the longer I hang out near Qeynos the more likely it is.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushikakuthegorotsuki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shikaku the Gorotsuki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/01 2:07:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SullonZek-Class-Advantages:</span><hr size=1> I'm a Bard...and I argue what you say about them totally...<br><br>Bards are NOT a purely defense class...you ever fought an angry bard?

A bard in my group with full lambent at level 18 was fighting a Combine monk twinked with Tboots.  There was no way he could kill the monk with Bellows or his AE song.  No way.  The damage a bard can do is very low.  All he could do is run around, but whenever the monk got hits in with his Adamantine bo stick, 80 damage chunks.  Bellows and AE would not cut it, not up against high magic resists.  Bards are excellent at defense, no one can run as fast as them, but if you want to kill someone, you take a very long time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umazeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mazeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/01 4:29:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SullonZek-Class-Advantages:</span><hr size=1> Shikaku.

That warrior can be taken down with a spine break and a blind. If he has high poison resist you can joust him to death with front stabs and good timing. If he is using a two handed weapon you can act like you will do a full joust but back up before you get to him and they usually will hit attack thus wasting their high damage high delay attack. Rogues are far from helpless. They are pretty helpless against casters though until they get resist gear and poisons. A spine break and blind can really mess up just about any caster.

There are maybe 5 rogues on SZ that are Lvl enough to make poison***<br><br> If he has high poison resist you can joust him to death with front stabs and good timing. If he is using a two handed weapon you can act like you will do a full joust but back up before you get to him and they usually will hit attack thus wasting their high damage high delay attack.<br><br>***The warriors aren't the large problem. It's the hybreds. And considering weapons for warriors seem to be better then the weapons that are available to rogues at the moment on SZ they have an edge.***<br><br> Rogues are far from helpless. They are pretty helpless against casters though until they get resist gear and poisons.<br><br>***Yes good luck getting resist gear and poisons any time soon on SZ. Have fun getting pummled by casters untill you have hit the EQ lotto to pay the insain fees people are going to be charging for resist gear.***<br><br> A spine break and blind can really mess up just about any caster. With the new hide feature you can mess up a melee without see invis. <br><br>***Once agen refur to above about the poisons. Also the new hide feature I have yet to see. I attacked a halfling rogue that was running through EC and he got away by hiding but he was still on my target. If this so called new feature was saposed to come in next patch well surprise surprise the patch was called off. So now even without see invis, one cast will rectify the invis problem and heavily damage the enemy.*** <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uremmi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remmi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://home.earthlink.net/~paulsoares/pub/images/dagger.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grandfather of the Safehouse</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/01 8:10:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://guildboss.stratics.com/images/sakar60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SullonZek-Class-Advantages:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Hello Everyone.

My entire guild consisting of 50+ members is all level 15+ right now. Today we are raiding runneye and in about 1 month my guild will all have grotesque masks (ac6 5 magic resist and other stuff) and BAlloy crowns (ac8 +6 to all resist) as well as full black alloy armor. In a months time my entire guild will be at LEAST 25+ if not 30+. Money is not as hard to come by as you like to think. By the time you are 18+ things regularly start dropping 5+ gold and once you get 23+ plat. I guess it might be a problem for others but for me all those things wont be problems. Also if you want to avoid that stuff hunt in groups and travel high on zone walls when going through zones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukordesh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kordesh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/01 4:37:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ............................................................</span><hr size=1> When I was lvl40 on a blue server as a rogue I could barely make 100pp and 100pp coulden't buy you anything on that server so don't say money isen't hard to come by.
