Please do the same for me with monks and warriors, I have yet to see a parse PROVING this. (People say FoH parsed this, and showed it, but their site has been unreachable for some time).<br>
<br>
As far as actual parses showing a warrior and monk in the same level gear? I will be starting a new thread with some numbers posted. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=696"target="_new">Dainin</a>

<br>
im sure on the surface alot of monks think well it would serve them right, but im sure we all have friends of every class that we dont want to see being smacked by the nerf bat<br>
<br>
finally my overall view of monks is they sit in the middle, they put out more dmg then wars but less then rogues, they tank better then rogues but worse then wars. whilst this hasnt changed in my opinion. if u looked at it on a slideing scale we where far closer to wars then rogues on the dmg dealing side. on the damage takeing side we have just been moved far closer to rogues, so solution to me would be take an avarage monk in average equipment and likewise rogues and wars and make it so monks fit bang in the middle for dmg taking and giving. to hell with how well uber monks tank, they r not the norm!<br>

Absor, you out there?</span><hr size=1> Let me give you my take on the recent change to us monks, my point of view being one from a monk with 110 aa, VT and Ssra equipped and obviously in an end game type guild. <br>
<br>
Here are 2 major changes i realized yesterday : <br>
-One, i used to be able to solo mobs in Ssra at the Entrance with an Aego, and i decided i'd give it a shot after this patch. So i went and aggroed one of the Entrance mobs and began meleeing it...about 1 min into the fight, after being hit for numbers i had NEVER seen before, i was at half health. I also noticed my damage avoidance wasnt significantly better either, like many said would be raised to make up for our new ABSOLUTELY CRAPPY damage mitigation table. <br>
-Second, i was pulling Kelun in VT lastnite, i had tagged him, got back into camp and was a second late with FD because i got a huge lag spike, Kelun smoked me, just tore me a new one in like a round and a half, when prior to this patch i most likely would of taken a few partial hits from him, but now, all i got was a bunch of max hits, and there you have one very owned monk. I also ended up on rampage against Kelun later, and the cleric in my group was dumping a sick amount of mana on me, and i had to FD with less than a quarter bub of health numerous times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
This change is sick, and personally i think they went a little overboard. Oh well, I'll adapt if I have to, just wanted to toss my 2cp on the table<br>
<br>
Oh yah, and i got a good laugh reading about the melee classes people thought did the most damage. The best equipped rogue on my server, and someone who knows what he's talking about(he leads the majority of my guilds raids) said himself that in a lot of cases monks outdamage rogues, this being in the high end game of course. Guess what group was getting XP for almost every single trash mob when we clear trash in VT? eh, you guessed it, the monks do, and that was without a bard, when there were 3 rogues and a bard in the &quot;xp&quot; group. True, on boss mobs, the rogue group gets the majority of the xp, but in most situations, monks ARE the top damage dealers.<br>
<br>
I know there are other monks who read these boards that agree with that.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> pre lvl 13 monks get dual wield.....a warrior can use a 2 hander and outdamage a monk because of a little thing called DAMAGE CAP........<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Is the warrior using a twinked out 2hander that they couldn't normally afford pre-level 13? OR are they using the RUSTY TWO HANDED SWORD that they could loot?<br>
<br>
If it's twinked weapons, then I say again, you're blatantly wrong. A PAIR of Jade Maces at level 10 can outdamage a Nathsar Greatsword by a WIDE margin.<br>
<br>
A PAIR of monk NAKED FISTS can outdamage a RUSTY TWO HANDER by hefty margin. Monk fists are damn good weapons in all aspects of the game. At level 60, their ratio is almost as good as one of the the warrior epic swords.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> next argument.......compare monk weapon skills to war wep skills...pre-50? um, they are the same, with regard to HTH being higher, yet, if any monk uses fists (like they should), they are out of the competition on SUCKING anyway<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Nope. Monks dual wield skill is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than a warrior's starting out. And pre-50 will cap FAR IN ADVANCE to a warrior. A monk will hard cap dual wield in his mid 40s. HARD CAP. That's 252 dual wield. Since most warriors in their 40s like to dual wield (the 2hander damage bonuses aren't taking effect as much so dual wielding is still a very effective means of doing damage) ... monk damage remains superior. From 13 to 50. Always has, always will. In whatever incarnation of the game you're playing ... pre-kunark, post-kunark, Luclin, post-this-recent-nerf. Whatever.<br>
<br>
The ONLY time a warrior outdamages a monk is when the warrior has TWINK weapons and the monk does not.<br>
<br>
Also, pre-50, monk hands still have better ratios than a lot of weapons I see NON-TWINKED warriors using.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> .......what it in fact is, is that warriors slow down in leveling their wep skills at level 40, yet monks continue to get the 5 per lvl all the way on up, with bonus caps removed here and there...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
This makes a HUGE difference in damage for a monk. Their skills keep going up. Warriors do not.<br>

It's a VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE though. Skill caps being higher is significant in DPS.<br>

<br>
Fighting Batons sell for 100 to 200 plat on my server. Any monk with half a brain can farm pelts starting at level SEVEN and afford a fighting baton.<br>
<br>
Essence of Dol. Polished Steel Ulak. Bear Fanged Glove. Fighting Baton. Blackjack. Fireclaw Talons. Cane of the Tranquil (a warrior usable weapon, actually) are all weapons EASILY OBTAINABLE to a monk who goes out and takes the time to MAKE SOME MONEY. All of them tend to be better than the options available to warriors with the SAME LEVEL OF CASH.<br>
<br>
If you're going to start pointing out warriors using Lamentations and Centi Longswords, then you have to take into account MONK WEAPONS of the same caliber. Which would be Jade Mace (always superior to Lamentation) and Goranga Spiked Club and Stave of Shielding.<br>
<br>
UN-twinked monks have better weapons than UN-twinked warriors.<br>
<br>
TWINKED monks have better weapons than TWINKED warriors.<br>
<br>

<br>
There's your second biggest mistake then. WELCOME TO LUCLIN. It's almost a year old. You can deny the availability of these weapons all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that they are superior weapons that are available to a LARGE portion of the gaming population.<br>
<br>
The mudflation has made things that USED to be amazingly twinked out weapons like a Jade Mace or a Lamentation about as affordable as your next level 40s armor upgrade.<br>

<br>
The effects of the higher damage table are well documented at this web site. There have been copious amounts of parsing made available here over the past year or so. And all of it points to monk damage being very healthy with the new table. And being well beyond the 1 to 1.1 ratio you seem to think monks have over warriors.<br>

<br>
Are we talking DROPPABLE monk weapons?<br>
<br>
The best droppable monk weapon in the game is either Kahsek's Katar or Tranquil Staff.<br>
<br>
The best DROPPABLE warrior weapon in the game is the Blade of Carnage.<br>
<br>
BUT, by the time you can get BLADE OF CARNAGE, odds are your monks are sporting some NO-DROP weapons better than BoC.<br>
<br>
Either your TWINKING out your warrior and NOT twinking out your monk, which would explain the disparity in DPS ... or you're just not thinking straight.<br>

<br>
What in the world are you talking about? Flying kick OUTDAMAGES anything a warrior has. Plain and simple. More damage. You said warriors have almost as much damage as monks. Flying kick is one of the variables in the DPS equation. Monks do more damage. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ......such as dodge block etc (the war can still miss of course)......this works on NPCs, dunno if it works in duels, used to all across the board (as dueling was considered targetting an NPC, but PvP servers needed that to be changed or every wizard/necro would just own joo).....however, i still agree that monks over time do more damage with FK then a warrior can even hope to do with slam or kick (even though war will do considerably more dmg after a successful slam)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Do you perchance play on a red server? Warriors do NOT do more damage after a successful slam. Warriors continue to pump out the SAME DPS whether the mob is slammed or NOT. The mobs AC doesn't change. The warrior's weapons do NOT change their damage.<br>
<br>
Monks outdamage warriors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> one thing you neglect is that wars all throughout the game will have more str then a monk.....good wars will also have more dex......<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope. Not all throughout the game. Monks hit 255 str just as easily as warriors do. And even WITH the higher str, monks still have higher ATK ratings for all of their careers. Meaning they hit more. <br>
<br>
STR parses have shown the increase in damage to be minimal.<br>
<br>
Dex doesn't affect anything in combat other than procs. Monks ALSO, traditionally have VERY high dexterity as much of the gear they wear has it, and they start out with higher dex than a warrior class base (unless you're a wood elf warrior or a halfling?).<br>
<br>

If monks were the best melee dmg output everytime what would rogues then have? There can only be one class as the best at something. I'm sorry but that is just the way it is. Warriors are the best tanks. Rogues are the best damage dealers. Rangers are the best with a bow. Monks are the best with their fists. Paladins have the ability to be the best against undead. Each class has it's own unique things they are the best at. <br>

Er, do you even realize how pathetic fists are? With epic, it's 9/16 for each fist. There's Kunark-era weapons that are better than that. Not to mention, monks aren't asking for the best melee damage output either.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
You can't be the best at everything. Damage stacks. You can have 3 damage dealers hitting a mob and all are bring something useful to the group. If you have two tanks in a group then you have one tank too many. How many people can a mob hit at any one time? Just one person. Defense doesn't stack like offense does. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Quite correct. But what advantage does a monk have over a rogue in a group? Or a warrior for that matter? Just think about the pre-NToV monk, which is what this patch has hit hardest: 1100AC, 2500hp, wielding a 29/30 Kunark-era weapon, tanks like Kleenex. Think about the pre-NToV warrior: 1200AC, 3500hp, wielding a 44/44 Luclin-era weapon, tanks like a tank. Where's the comparison?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Monks still have a very large role to play. They can do alot of damage from any side of a mob. They can pull better then anyone. Yes, sk's can pull but fd can't be interupted.. sk's spell version can. Both have a chance of failing. Monks are also on a seperate dmg table then the plate classes. This means you put out more damage. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Keep in mind, pulling has nothing to do with damage. Monks are on a separate &quot;damage table&quot; than the plate classes in terms of taking damage as well. So the SK will survive to pull two mobs back to camp, and the monk won't make it back. Where's the monk role? Again, keep in mind, we are not talking about monks with 1300+ AC and 3000+ HP. We're talking about the pre-NToV monk.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
The monk role is one of damage dealer. That is what you do. There are alot of ways you can do this role. A secondary role is as puller. As a primary damage dealer you should not be tanking any hits. Your job is to put out damage not absorb it. The disc's you have allow you to live thru the times you might get agro, and FD helps in those times too. The whole point of all your defensive skills is to allow you to live in case your dmg output gives you unwanted agro. The reason you have unwanted agro is because you are doing more damage then most people. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Pre-NToV monks don't get unwanted aggro. Hell they don't get wanted aggro, even. Until recently, both myself and the other 55+ monk in my guild were using tranquil staves on raids and not getting any aggro. Point is, pre-NToV there just isn't that much monk damage. You're talking about a 29/30 two-hander, or 9/16 + 13/21 one-handers, in most cases, or something pretty darn close. Pre-NToV Luclin-era warriors have 13/20 and 12/20 weapons, and 44/44 two-handers.<br>
<br>
The reason we need mitigation ability is to pull. Frankly, if Verant just tossed out our mitigation and gave us 90% of rogue damage I'd see a point to being a monk. However, that's not what they did. They tossed out the mitigation of the pre-NToV monk while leaving the damage unchanged. The difference between 9/16+13/21 and 15/20+14/18 is HUGE, and the difference between 1100AC and 1300+ AC is HUGE now, bigger than the difference for any other class. Basically, the role of pre-NToV monks is very unclear, and Vex Thal monks can still do a heck of a lot but it's unclear what they're supposed to do. Monks aren't hybrids, their role should be crystal-clear.<br>
<br>

How hard is it to see?  Monks still have a well defined role as damage dealer and puller.  Before the change was made ya'll also had a overpowered defense in comparison to your offense skills.  <br>
<br>
Heck, the way ya'll are talking about defence and the need to be a tank you should have had your dps yanked down instead of your defence.  Maybe you would feel better then.  <br>
<br>
I'm truly sorry you feel that because you can't be a tank anymore your class is broken.  Seems to me monks are still dishing out as much damage as before and their role has always been damage dealer.  Oh well, I'm done with this.  The few monks that are trying to bring hard info are being drowned out the people that only see things the way they want to see them.   <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94313>Chavr Wyrmbane</a><br>

Actually if you look at it warriors are just under monks in meless damage (far closer to monks than monks are to rogues).<br>
<br>
Bizarrely monks are now far closer to rogues in tanking than to warriors.<br>
<br>
So monks now get shafted at both ends, offence and defence.<br>
<br>
Even rangers in tanking and pure melee damage are now raised up to the level of monks, and they have spells and bow damage on top.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I don't think any class should be nerfed, but I DO think monk melee damage should be raises slightly in light of the defence nerf to bring it back into line with warriors and rogues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=taylr>Taylr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 2:24:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Monk Defense/Offense</span><hr size=1> Either raise Offense a bit or roll back the nerfage part of the patch.  <br>

Not a big deal except that 20% heal once used cant be used again for another 6 mins.<br>
     Now I am looking at continuing the pull without my self heal available.  No biggie, I can use Stonestance.  Damage reduced to 1/3 for about 12 secs.  Now that is gone for the next 6 mins.  And I am only halfway back to the safe little camping spot the guild has chosen for the ambush.<br>
     No biggie, I can FD  if it looks bad.  Yep need to FD.  Tiket has fallen to the ground.  Quick need to stand back up, Loading Please Wait.....  And this scenario doesn't even take into account the number of times you can get stunned from being hit from behind which increases the severity of the max hit.<br>

I see a need to get RS3 asap.  I have RS1 but followed the level&gt;aa approach.  Need to rethink that.  Even then with some of the crappy mob pathing I have seen, not sure that will help reduce adds or save my behind on a pull.  I hope someone out there can definitely tell me what my role is since pulling doesn't look as possible.  Probably will need to look at balancing my recent drop in AC to get more HP as well.

Which Monk? And which Warrior?... Simply plucking the stats for the highest weapons off the shelf doesn't reflect the actuality for most players.<br>
<br>
At 57th, I'm a pretty average player, using the IFS (38/40) I have since 52nd, and saving up for a T-Staff (well was until this nerf)... If I shell out on a T-Staff (50k+ on Xev, if you can find one), a Warrior can compete with that in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
If I were to continue playing my Monk, it would be quite some considerable time until my guild can raid in places were I can make the jump ahead of Warriors again in weapons.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing that Monks don't do more damage than Warriors, what some here are trying to illustrate is the gap is narrowing. Ordinarily this wouldn't be that big an issue, but in light of recent events many Monks aren't willing to shrug off circumstance they normally would have ignored. <p><hr />

Warriors and other non-monk .. .. melee classes really don't approach monk DPS until primal or better are in the hands of those classes. Primal (or better) is a giant upgrade for non-monks. It's a relatively small upgrade for monks. The net effect is that the gap closes significantly for DPS in the high end game. Rogue BS scales geometically, so they maintain their DPS lead with just a small change in weapon maximum damage.<br>

<br>
Actually the DPS gap closed a lot in the last two expansions, if you consider the pre-NToV monk. The average monk still uses a Kunark-era weapon, either IFS (38/40) or tstaff (29/30+120dd). The average warrior uses Dismay  (44/44) or better, which is a Luclin-era weapon. I can say from personal experience, over many parsed fights, that a shaman-hasted warrior (my spouse) with ornate sword of the general/bone handled scimitar with RBG will do approximately 85% of the damage as a shaman-hasted monk with IFS/SSHS. However, my spouse had ~1200ac/3500hp, and I had ~1100ac/2500hp - a very big difference.<br>
<br>
Aside:<br>
Primal seems like a giant upgrade to me, actually: I'd personally go from a 12/20+75hp lifetap weapon to 15/20. But until I get a key and get in there, it may as well be 17/19 because I'm not gonna see either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uemiliaeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EmiliaEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 5:49:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monk role?

The only exeptions might be some monstrous weapons from CT (like that 44/44 axe).<br>
<br>
Monk have :<br>
Better damage table (from lvl1)<br>
More ATK (from lvl 1)<br>
More Haste (epic from lvl50)<br>
<br>
When you can enter ToV (Telko/Gozz) a monk will just own a warrior.<br>
(Go look at Shovel of the Harvest).<br>
<br>
Before ToV i think monks still do better.<br>
(Epic + 38/40 will beat   44/44 )<br>
<br>
Before Epic ? Well .... who knows <br>
<br>
This patch was designed to nerf uber monks.<br>
Well it didnt affect them much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
But it affected non uber and that is a shame. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uemiliaeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EmiliaEQ</A> at: 10/17/02 5:55:04 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=221&stop=238>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=336.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=336.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.emailToFriend?topicID=336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.threadControl?topicID=336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=336.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=336.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17>Monk Change</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
