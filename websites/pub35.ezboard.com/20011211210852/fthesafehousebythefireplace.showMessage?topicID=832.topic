Having been to this region of Kunark only a couple of days before, I was still unfamiliar with most of the Outpost area. However, I was made aware that I would need to disguise myself as a dark elf to avoid persecution by the residents of the Outpost. <br>
<br>
Just as I was strapping my boots back on, being careful to avoid matting my freshly groomed foothair, a guildmate came up to me out of breath. I didn't see him at first, until he stepped out of his camouflage. It was then I noticed he was badly bruised and missing all of his gear. <br>
<br>
I asked, &quot;What happened to you? You look horrible!&quot;<br>
<br>
He replied, &quot; I was out hunting with some friends, and saw this merchant out in the middle of the fields. I decided to check out what he had for sale, but while I did, a storm rolled in off the water. The accompanying fog made it difficult to see. To keep from being ambushed, I ran with the Spirit of the Wolf. However, I got twisted around trying to get back to my friends. Visibility was bad, and I didn't see the drop-off. I crashed to the bottom of the chasm and a part of me died when I was smashed to a pulp on the rocks below.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What a horror!&quot; I responded. &quot;Have you tried to recover your gear?&quot;<br>
<br>
He sighed and sadly responded, &quot;I have made several failed attempts, each time leaving another part of me.&quot; He sighed deeply. &quot;Even more disturbing is that I have been doing this for so long now, I fear I'll even get my gear back.&quot; He sat down with his hands tucked under his chin. <br>
<br>
&quot;How did you try to recover your gear?&quot; I inquired. <br>
<br>
&quot;I levitated myself and floated down while camouflaged. I found my gear with some difficulty, but couldn't find a safe place to strap it back on. And as I was looking for a safe place, my camouflage faded. I don't even know where my corpse is at now!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I hear that rogues are supposed to be good at getting into places they shouldn't be. Want me to take a shot at it?&quot;<br>
<br>
He pondered the offer. &quot;I don't want you to die down there. There's nasty critters down there...like a bizarre cross between a man and a scorpion. And I believe they are dreaded shadow knights as well...for as soon as I appeared, their foul touch sapped away my very life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What are the alternatives?&quot;<br>
<br>
He sighed deeply. &quot;You're right...if my gear is even still there, this might be my last chance to get it back.&quot;<br>
<br>
I searched my backpack to see if I had a map of the area...even a crude map. I bit back a moan as I realized I had none.<br>
<br>
He escorted me to the edge of the chasm. Looking across it, and down into it, I realized that this was a huge place to be searching for his stuff. In addition, it seemed the floor was moving. He allowed me to run with the Spirit of the Wolf, and I carefully picked my way through the shadows looking for a safe way down. I figured that getting his gear wouldn't matter if I couldn't find my way out afterwards. <br>
<br>
After about 15 minutes of searching, I found a passable slope down. What I saw down there shocked me! There weren't one or two of those man/scorpions down here...there was a whole <br>
swarm of them! They were going in and out of ruined buildings, up and down ramps, patrolling the chasm floor. I panicked for a second, maybe three. <br>
<br>
I kept the feelings of terror in check however. My friend needed me. I carefully picked my way around the chasm floor. After about 20 minutes of searching, I spotted something on one of the ramps. It was a couple of pieces of his gear! While it wasn't all of his adventuring gear, it looked like a weapon and some foraged food he must have been using to aid him in getting his main gear back. I carefully dragged it back out of the chasm up the slope to where he was waiting. Even though it wasn't the bulk of his gear, our moods lifted tremendously. I had gone into the belly of the beast and had come back out again with something to show for it. <br>
<br>
I went back in to where I found his gear and resumed my search there. I figured the main body of stuff must be nearby. Instead I found a second of his recovery outfittings. I returned that to him as well. He informed me that there should only be the main goal of my crawl left: his main gear. After searching around there for about 30 minutes, sweat starting to pour from my forehead, I decided to sit down on a rock and ponder what to do. His gear, if not totally gone already, would probably not last much longer in this foul place.  I looked up at the sky to see how high he must have fallen from.<br>
<br>
What did I see when I looked up, but a gauntlet sticking out of a crevice! Upon closer examination, I recognized my friend's gear! However, try as I might, I couldn't drag it free! Dejected at my ultimate failure, I slinked back out of the chasm to inform my friend of my failure.<br>
<br>
<br>
(OOC) My ranger friend, and guildmate, had this happen to him. He died twice more trying to get his corpse. He told me he only had about 2-3 hours left before his corpses would start decaying. So I took the chance. We got two corpses but his main corpse was stuck in the geography. He petitioned, but given the urgency, he sent a tell to a guide. The guide immediately came and checked out the corpse, verifying it was stuck. He then summoned the corpse to a safe spot where my friend could loot it. During the whole time, only one guildmate made a brief appearance on server, and offered encouragement.<br>
<br>
That night at work, I printed out the map of all the zones I could so I'd be more prepared for the next time.<br>

<br>
Please allow me to share a tale which happened to … a friend of mine some time back, shortly after the Chalice of Rain from the Temple of Thunder in Qeynos went missing (not that I… not that my <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> friend</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> had anything to do with that, of course).<br>
<br>
At that time my friend was partnered with an Othmir rogue named Otto – quick of wit and quicker of fingers, but unfortunately not so quite so quick of foot.  We… They had stopped in a small village in the Karanas to reprovision and my friend, being better able to move about the town, left Otto hidden outside town while she went shopping.<br>
<br>
My friend was enjoying herself quite a bit.  Open market shopping is hard to be beat, the League of Antonican Bards had a rollicking orchestra, and it was the time of year for the annual elephant drive.  There were plenty of strangers around and the merchants were easily convinced to give her Bristlebane’s discount (or at least if they noticed, there were plenty of others at hand to blame it on).  She was listening to one of the drive-masters explain how he used an ivory whistle to call his elephants to him when they had wandered off, when the first sign of trouble presented itself.  <br>
<br>
The drive-master’s whistle demonstration petered out mid-puff as a parade of paladins clanged by.  Amongst their cheers and shield beating, it was quickly apparent that they had taken Otto captive and were blaming him for the theft in Qeynos (which of course he had had nothing to do with, and even if he had, he hadn’t left any evidence).  <br>
<br>
As I’m sure you know, one doesn’t want to fall into the hands of the Knights of Thunder.  They don’t understand anybody not wanting to follow their ascetic ways, and they burn with a Hatred for anybody different that would do Innoruuk proud.  And Otto was very different from what the Paladins were used to.<br>
<br>
The smart thing at this point would have been for my friend to cut her losses and leave, abandoning Otto to his fate.  Those who say there is no honor amongst thieves (not, of course, that my friend was a thief), would have expected it.  But for whatever reason – whether it was honor, or friendship, or that Otto was the only one who knew where the missing Chalice was now located (not, of course that he and my friend had anything to do with its disappearance) – she couldn’t leave him to the Paladins.<br>
<br>
Pulling her hood around her, my friend slipped into the crowd and sought out where her partner was being held.  <br>
<br>
Hidden with all of the subtlety of a Paladin, he was easy to find.<br>
<br>
A gallows had been set up on the far side of the fair, near where the bards were boisterously oom-pahing along.  Her partner was locked in a building not far away, guarded by several armored knights.  There was no way to spring him from his cell itself before Otto was hanged, but perhaps there was a chance he was carried from his cell to the gallows.<br>
<br>
Haste makes waste, but sometimes one doesn’t have a choice.  A cart and disguises could serve for the getaway, and nobody would notice if one were moved closer to where she planned the rescue.  All that remained was to surprise the guards, rescue her partner, and be off in the confusion.<br>
<br>
Easy, right?<br>
<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
With three people, she could do it, but there were too many guards for her to beat them all herself.  She didn’t know anybody whose aid she could depend on, and there wasn’t nearly enough time to approach the local ring for aid (not, of course, that such a thing existed, nor that she’d know about it if they did).  <br>
<br>
The tidings looked grim for Otto, but without another two it was hopeless.<br>
<br>
My friend surveyed the area one last time before giving up.  The Bards oom-pahed along.  The elephants trumpeted in the background.  The mob rumbled.  The Paladins opened the cell door and began carrying her partner to his doom.<br>
<br>
Dejectedly, she thrust her hands in her pockets, despairing of any rescue; but it was only almost too late.  She carefully pulled the answer to her dilemma from her pocket and scanned the crowd.  The timing would be just right.  <br>
<br>
Putting the drive-master’s whistle to her lips she let loose a high, shrill note.  Thundering hooves trampled the Bardic orchestra and captured the Paladins’ attention while she grabbed her friend and disappeared in the chaos.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” she mused to herself, “a herd in the band is worth two in ambush.”<br>
