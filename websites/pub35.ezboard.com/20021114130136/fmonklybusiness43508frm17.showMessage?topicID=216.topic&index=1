<br>
The fictional nerf I posted is more in line with your list of proposed nerfs on other classes.  Those nerfs you list take away half the playstyle options of those classes, however our impending nerf only weakens our defense rating a bit.  It doesn't take away our special kicks, it doesn't take away FD, it doesn't take away our triple attacks or our 1HB/2HB.  You're blowing it out of proportion.  At least scale it evenly if you're going to do it at all.  Say increasing mana costs by 5-10% for casters, would be along the lines of what we're getting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzikoz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zikoz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 633<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/11/02 9:29:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who exactly is laughing?</span><hr size=1> That post you linked to at Graffe's by Razamataz was awesome.

This patch isnt going to kill you, Verant has Nerfed MANY other classes before this and what happend? Those who can adapt and truely love their class will continue to play it and those who cant shuffle off and complain.<br>
<br>
SKs, Necros, Bards and a few other classes have been nerfed to all hell in the past 3 years. Thats right for the past three years. Due to something being over powered, other class complaints, and/or just a hatred for the class.<br>
<br>
Warriors didnt call for a nerf, they merely used a monk as an example to show how broken the WARRIOR class is. So instead of VI fixing the Warrior class and thats all they decided to dillute the monk class. What got fixed? Well a little of jack and shit.<br>
<br>
Lets wait to see if this nerf DOES happen befiore jumping to conclusions. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Yes...and have you read the monk posts? Wait, better question, have you read anything on the War message board or FoH board when this discussion first cropped up a couple months ago? I dont think so..<br>
<br>
If you had you would have seen that they were using Monk tanking as a template to show how inneffective warrior tanks are, only the Hp gap made the diff in a warrior being a better MT.. Like I said they didnt call for a nerf, at least the intelligent ones didnt, they merely asked to be fixed. <br>
<br>
What did verant do? Screw shit up like always. When they realize that they may fix it or they may not. But like i said those who love their class will continue to play it and adapt and those who dont will leave.<br>

Before anyone blasts me for being a ranger posting here, I want to let you know off the top that I am not here to rub salt in the wounds.<br>
<br>
On the topic of Daesun's posts:<br>
All of his/her posts I have read that had anything at all to do with class issues since the announced changes have had comments laced with taunts directed at monks. To me, this is inexcusable. People like Daesun and the other jealous people that make comments of &quot;good,&quot; &quot;about time,&quot; &quot;they deserve it,&quot; etc. are what give every class a bad name. <br>
<br>
I cannot directly apologize for the comments of these people since they are not my comments, but I do apologize if you feel that all rangers are cheering the changes. We are not. The majority seem to be adopting the &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude like me. Personally, I don't know what to make of them yet. The change affects me as well since I'm bringing up a monk, and I just don't know yet.<br>
<br>
Why am I posting this? To try to show that the stupidity spewing forth from a few people who want to taunt you guys and gals into a frenzy doesn't speak for all rangers. None of the comments were warranted, and they do not reflect the opinions of the majority of rangers. I hope everything works out for the best overall. We will just have to wait and see.  <p>Kelliani Aspenwall<BR>

<br>
I’m a Shadow Knight and I started on the day EQ became live.  Few classes have been hit by the Nerf bat more then SKs.  I feel your pain.  I know what it’s like to expect to be able to do something and have the rules of how you play changed out from under you.  Getting hit by something like this is never fun.<br>
<br>
I also know what it’s like to be passed over for groups.  They are looking for a puller and feel they need a monk to do it.  The truth is that both SKs and monks can pull.  ANY class can pull if they know what they are doing.  Some classes are better at pulling in some situations.  That’s not going to change by this.  I like to group with monks and let them pull, and I will hold argo.<br>
<br>
You’re also still a good damage dealer. And how much this will affect the average monk remains to be seen.  I think it’s aimed at the 1% of uber monks and hope the effect on the others is minimal.  Focus on your strengths<br>
<br>
No, the world isn’t agenst you.  No, we aren’t all happy at your pain.  Some of us have been there.<br>

On a side note, I love pulling with my necro. Ive pulled the Tormax area in Kael quite a few times using Darkness splitting and regualr FD with a cast time &gt; 1 sec. and with 1800hps roughly. Got my blood pumping and was really fun.<br>
<br>
I'd be glad to do it for fun again, because its just that, fun. Pulling a red con mob to your guild with 3 even con mobs charging at you, and hoping FD gets channeld or finishes before getting hit is great  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I hope some of us do remember that it isn't all about Gear, Plat, Nerfs, and parses. It's about fun. <br>
<br>
And to those who say nerfing takes fun away from it all then all I can say is, whats more fun than learning a totally new aspect to your character? Or discovering how good you can be without something? Or Problem solving a pull that you knew before would end in certain death even pre-nerf.<br>

Looking at some of the preliminary results from the test server, I don't think it's gonna be a huge deal, and we are monk anyways. We adapt. That's why monks are the best class in EQ in my opinion.<br>
<br>
And lets say this &quot;nerf&quot; is gonna makes monks really really weak. Why are other laughing at that? In the end game, we are your main pullers, and pretty darn good damage dealers. The more monks get hit and/or die, the more mana you use, the more downtime (medding, rezzing, buffing the rezzed) there is (esp with this whole mage mod rod thing), and the less exp you get and the less loot you get. <br>
<br>
My guild is a small but good bunch of people, just starting on HoT. We have primarily two monks pulling (me and some dirty iksar <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). If monks were to be nerfed to hell, like some would like you to believe, imagine the downtime because we aren't as uber as some guilds. Rezzing us, buffing us back, then medding again. This means less pulling, less mobs, less loot for everyone in the little time that people have to play.<br>

As I posted day 1 of the nerf news, I'm not happy about the monk nerf.  It just makes the game harder for everyone.  However, the complaints about archery are unwarranted.  Archery is no better for rangers than for warriors or rogues until level 51.  At 51 we get double damage on non-moving, non-rooted mobs.  Damage is still insignificant compared to melee damage.  At 55 we get trueshot discipline, which increases damage and crit frequency for 2 minutes out of 72.  At this point, archery becomes slightly more viable.  Real archery damage (the massive crits you talk about) doesn't happen until level 59 with 45 AA and using trueshot discipline.  Archery is also one of the most encounter specific attacks in the game due to game design issues.  For every 1600 crits you see, remember there were 100 arrows that just disappeared due to line of sight issues and 50 crits less than 200.  Taking away archery would hurt every bow class, not just rangers.<br>

Hmmm.  A monk trains all his life for one on one battle.  A warrior's life is training on the battle field.  If you know anything about heavy armor and mobility, you would know that a body trained to defend against blows via avoiding them is better armor than heavy plate any day.  The heavy armor was made for those instances in the heat of combat of 1000+ vs 1000+ that you just couldn't see every blow coming and having that armor was just the thing that could make a hasty poorly timed blow turn into a dent in the armor instead of a chunk out of your backside.<br>
<br>
<br>
Monks are fine as they are.  We should be better face to face tanks than a warrior in many situations.  But... the defensive discipline, avoidance discipline are what set warriors up to have the best job of all.  Even if it's only for 3 minutes, they are the center of attention.  They are the focus of the raid.  And then to complain about someone else doing something you think you should ONLY do well?  Get a grip baby warriors.  Once they give monks weapons with slow procs or all the cool effects then you can complain.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh wait, it's too late the damage has been done.<br>
<br>
<br>
/fu VI and your very sad idea of combat.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, maybe they'll increase the monk avoidance rate?<br>
<br>
Yeah fat chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since monks can't carry much armor or lootz, how bout you make warriors have to pay to get their heavy armor repaired from time to time?<br>
<br>
Seems only fair.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The monk will survive.  Just sucks people running this game still don't understand the idea of not taking away what you give.  <br>

See that link? Oh, well according to that they DID increase avoidance. Preliminary testing, but testing none the less. May have to adapt around that now.<br>

Ok So not getting hit is better right? So according to the link at the top youre getting more misses in exchange for getting hit for max more often? There we go. Settled. Done. But Id like to say YET AGAIN, that this ISNT live nor has it been announced that it WILL go live as of yet.<br>

It is a shame.  I am no a monk because I feel monkly IRL.  I am a monk because it fitted well with how I wanted to play the game.  Now that is being taken away and it is very sad.  Monks were tanks for years, now they won't be (if Verant ever actually get to grips with their code which they are NOT doing at the moment). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udaesun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daesun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/11/02 8:16:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who exactly is laughing?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  On the topic of Daesun's posts:<br>

That's not a taunt, in my book.  It's acknowledging the fact that the game is broken at the high end, and I expect the change to only affect people at the high end, or the nerf is unjustified.<br>

As for abilities, I could post a crippling blow of 1600+, but you know what? It's something that is a fluke of luck and does not happen every single day I play, much like the sig'd crits of various skills - save a fully crit aa'd caster. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=216.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=216.topic&start=41&stop=41>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=216.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=216.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.emailToFriend?topicID=216.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.threadControl?topicID=216.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=216.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=216.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17>Monk Change</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
