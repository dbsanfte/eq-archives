I would like to ask if I was doing this right, the members of my group said I was doing &quot;great&quot; but not sure if that was a heartfelt great or a &quot;poor guy, lets pat his FD arse on the back so he dosen't quit EQ, Great&quot;<br><br>My tactics were this.. our group was sitting at the end of the bridge near zonline. I would run up after the initial 3 mobs at other side of bridge were clear, aggro 3-4 mobs, run to the end of the bridge away from my group, wait for the mobs to get close, then Feign. All of the mobs would start to move away, and usualy leave one mob. I would have someone else in the group (usualy my wife sitting next to me playing her druid) cast or attack that mob, and pull it back to group, we always got just ONE mob this way, (except when somone in the group got trigger happy and blasted/shot too early.<br><br>With this tactic, I could not really stand up and fight, because i had to wait for the mobs to get back to thier spawn point to clear aggro. Or, if our groups killd the mob quickly, I would stand, let them reaggro on me, and repeat.<br><br>We could manage to clear the Courtyard, and the side AWAY from the temple, temple I was scared to try to pull.. ton of mobs in small area.<br><br>Anyway, I would appreciate any tips, advice, etc.<br><br>Btw, I did manage to snag a Wu's stick last night from a guild member that looted one =)<br><br>so, I retired one of my batons, and now have wu/baton (WU in primary)<br><br>My wife Got a Wrathbone warhammer, also =) I also managed to get 2 bubbles of exp from a pretty slow pulling night. ;/<br><br>It picked up at the end, I hope to do better tonight, faster exp, and HOPEFULLY another wu's before we end our tour of CoM. =)<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Level 33 Iksar monkey now <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ustouthbound.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stouthbound</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/6/00 8:01:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pulling CoM</span><hr size=1> How Phaedreus Ashenfist eats a Reeses peanut butter cup:<br>Er...Pulls city of mist:<br><br>The easiest way to pull this place, without using the "stack them at the lamp" exploit (which GMs on Bertox always seem to be popping in to check), is to chain pull everything to the gate.  You can aggro basically the entire zone, and go to in front of that statue right inside the gate, and FD when some of the mobs are standing on you.<br><br>They'll start to walk away, and when they get as far away from the statue as to the entrance of the balconies, have someone run in and grab the one mob that's still standing on you.  This can be done usually just by running up and smacking it, as the mobs usually space themselves out pretty nicely.<br><br>Larger mobs spawn at the temple area than in the courtyard and gate area, so you may want to hold off on pulling that section until you have a larger group.  Other than that, the gate, courtyard, and stables are a good pull.<br><br>Depending on your swimming skill, and if you can get sow or not in your group, you may want to be ballsy and try and pull the big goo from the arena.  You could of course throw a shuriken at it and just run, but that's no fun :)  Best way I always do this is jump right on the island with it, kick it, and jump into the water.  Swim your way out to the lantern and hop up onto the land, the goo will either join you or run back through the zone, taking a (hopefully) cleared path to your group.  The big goo is around level 45-47, and is a fun kill for a fair bit of exp on an exciting pull. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/matttnusss/phaedreus.jpg">Phaedreus Ashenfist</a><br>Monk of the Lost Circle<br>Bertoxxulous</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufaang243.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faang243</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/6/00 8:52:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ahhh</span><hr size=1> Thanks Stouthbound, I was wondering how to pull the big goo, the higher level members of the other group in our guild wanted me to pull that guy, but I couldn't figure out how to get his attention, and I was scared to just throw something at him =)<br><br>Will have to try him tonight..<br><br>Again, I was thinking about setting up camp right outside of the goo temple, but I was scared to move away from a zoneline being my first time =)<br><br>Thanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ustouthbound.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stouthbound</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/6/00 8:56:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ahhh</span><hr size=1> If you guys are camping right outside the goo temple (the arena place), you can stand on the ledge that runs around the stone pillar that the big too stands on and throw a shuriken at him.

Lots of static spawns.<br><br>If I'm near the zone I'll pull to just past the gates, FD and wait for 2 mobs to hit their spawn points.  As soon as they do, I stand up and (if I time it right) I get a single every time.<br><br>But my favorite spot in CoM is the area just north of the arena where the big goo is.  Sit the group in the middle of that area, pull goos from the arena room, FD at the door and wait until most are at their spawn points, stand up, if 2 come FD again, rinse &amp; repeat until you have 1.<br><br>Once the goos are clear, pull the house to the west of your group through it's south end door.  Open the door and 2 mobs will come out.  FD, wait a few seconds, stand (one will usually be back at it's spawn point by then) and pull the single.  Then pull the other spawn from that end, then the two from the other end (feigning in the middle of the house).<br><br>I then move to the house south/west of the arena room and pull the 3 lumpies there.  I drag them out of the house and FD outside the north door.  Same tactics as the first spawns in the north house.  Wait a few seconds, then stand up.<br><br>By the time I pull from there the lumpies in the arena room are normally ready to go again.<br><br>The hardest thing I find about CoM is pulling the captain area clear to get your group to the arena area.  You need a good group (or crowd control) to take the mobs down quickly enough to clear the way. <p><table width="275"><tr><td bgcolor="#000000" align="center" cellpadding="3"><font size="3" color="#CC9900"><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=32202">Catharz Doshu</a> (Level 41 Human Monk)<br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=12223">Ssleazy Sslizard</a> (Level 20 Iksar Shaman)</font><br><a href="http://www.shadowstar-alliance.com" target="_top"><img src="http://shadowstar-alliance.com/images/SSA2.jpg" width="250" height="75" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzinj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zinj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 816<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(2/15/01 11:22:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pulling CoM</span><hr size=1> *Moved from a reply to a question posted in this section*<br><br>Dulcineia 01  <br>Monk<br>posts: 43<br> (2/15/01 8:46:19 am)<br>Reply | Edit | Del<br><br>Re: City of Mist<br><br>Just a quick story:<br><br>I led a guild raid to CoM just a couple of days ago.

Me believing in good killing and loot, over the thrill of almost dying (at least when I lead I like it!), I took them all. <br>Had 4 groups of 45-55 peeps, cakewalk all the way to castle. <br>Once we headed up the ramps to second floor, I came to a room that I couldn't pull. MOBS lost aggro soon as I left the room. I should have known something was up, but it had all been sooooo easy up till then! I decided to have the raid rush the room. (btw this is the room at top of ramp after you turn right through door in castle). There were 3-4 mobs in room when we charged in. When the last raid member fell, there were over 20 dead mobs in the room, and at least 3 more still alive. Apparently, this room will auto pull the entire second floor AT LEAST! Wasn't posted in leonardos guide, so I thought I would bring it up. Not sure yet how ill get the raid past them next time, prolly not too hard if I had known! Luckily the rogue managed to jump to first floor before he died, so could get to his lockpicks and start the loooong CR. <br><br>Dulcineia Delamancha <br>51st Lvl Disciple of the Lost Adventurers <br>Call on me, and I will come<br>Ask for aid, and I will help<br>Play with me, and we will have a good time! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uxorshaik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xorshaik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(2/15/01 11:35:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tha door?</span><hr size=1> Wonder if what you're referring to (I'm not sufficiently familiar to know for sure) is the door that every time I've been on a raid the leader says DON'T GO THROUGH THE DOOR. hehe.

The first area you come<br>                      too is the moat area. Across the moat spans a broken bridge, which leads to a<br>                      rather daunting Gate.<br>                      This Gate can easily be opened by clicking on it.<br>                      To either side of the moat area are the balconies. These can be accessed by<br>                      passing through the gate.<br><br>                      From the Gate, a left or a right will take you to the Court Yard area. To the Right of<br>                      the gate you can access the Court yard, the right balcony or the Temple.<br>                      To the left of the gate you can access the Courtyard, the left balcony, or the stable<br>                      area.<br><br>                      Past the Curt yard is the Arena.<br>                      If you are looking at the map its the section with the B on it. The Arena building<br>                      actually has a functional Arena inside of it. Be careful though as this area is usually<br>                      guarded by high level Goo's.<br><br>                      On either side of the arena is a set of houses. These houses are home to a number<br>                      of creatures. It should be noted that caution is recommended when going past these<br>                      areas.<br><br>                      Now we are almost to the castle area. This is were the guide will try to focus in on.<br><br>                      The Castle area.<br><br>                      Past the Arena and the Houses lies two &quot;roads&quot; to the castle. Most guilds that I<br>                      have seen stage raids here will try to setup on the south side of the zone. The area<br>                      from the houses to the first corner is usually clear of spawns.<br>                      The Corner areas on both the north and the south side have a 3 or 4 spawn pattern.<br>                      Once these are cleared you can move to the areas labeled Camp Spot.<br>                      The South area isn't labeled but can be used just the same.<br>                      The Octagonal areas past the camp spot hold 3 spawns each. Once these are<br>                      cleared its time that your puller and a rogue make their way to the castle door.<br>                      It should be noted that the Captain of the Guard is reported to have a key to this<br>                      door, but as of yet I haven't seen this to be the case.<br><br>                      Within the Castle there are 4 spawns on each side of the wall. Toward the back of<br>                      the first room is a broken Throne. This is where the first reaver is to be found.<br>                      With a good puller its possible to pull everything out before you engage the Reaver.<br>                      If the puller is too low, it is common to expect the entire room. Eight Spawns plus<br>                      the Reaver.<br><br>                      For those that have never encountered a reaver let me explain just a bit about<br>                      them.<br>                      Reavers look like the Golem from Cazic-Thule zone. They are big ugly black things.<br>                      They are 100% magic resistant, meaning they can't be charmed or slowed. They<br>                      average around level 51, in most cases. They hit really fast and hard, and on top of<br>                      that they blind. When killed they either have a chance to spawn another reaver, a<br>                      ghost type mob common to CoM, or One of the 3 Lords. I have heard of a rare case<br>                      of up to 12 reavers spawning before the Lord did. /nasty<br><br>                      Once the first room is clear and you are ready to take on your first reaver, make<br>                      sure your primary healers and wizards are at full mana. The first reaver most<br>                      commonly spawns Lord Gorik. For the most part this Lord will spawn after 1 to 3<br>                      reavers have been killed. <br>                      Lord Gorik him self is fairly easy.<br>                      Again he's 100% magic resident and only Lure type spells will effect him.<br><br>                      Lord Gorik drops include he mace of the shadowed souls and the books for the<br>                      shaman quests.<br><br>                      I shall cover Neh'Ashiir next, commonly considered the second reaver in line to die.<br><br>                      To get to the Queen of CoM, the raid party should, after the First reaver has been<br>                      killed, move into the Castle area.<br>                      You will notice two doors on the back side of the first room. You'll want to lead your<br>                      raid thru the right door. Once the raid has come to the corner you'll want to stop<br>                      and clear the way before you.<br>                      Once you are at the right hand corner you will see a ramp leading upwards. You are<br>                      now inside the wall along the North camp site. This area commonly has goo's roming<br>                      the area.<br>                      Once the hall way is clear up too, the Section labeled A, lead your guild up to<br>                      around -200. This is a tight hall way for a large raid like this, so make due.<br><br>                      At this point your necro's should start handing out Dead Man Floating to EVERYONE<br>                      at the raid.<br>                      You are about to enter a section that one slip will mean your death.<br><br>                      Please refer to this map now.<br><br>                      Click here to see a map of sky area within City of Mist.<br><br>                      The Area Marked with an A is actually right before a door. This door leads further<br>                      into the castle with common mobs found through out City of Mist. This can be<br>                      ignored.<br>                      To the Right of this door is a fake wall.<br>                      Steping through this wall is a clear cat walk, leading up to the first Sky house. This<br>                      is were your guild will thank your necros for DMF. It is important to make sure<br>                      everyone is aware of this. These Catwalks are confusing and every raid I've seen go<br>                      up it, someone always drops.<br><br>                      Our Pullers always pulled the first house to the raid waiting within the hallway before<br>                      going up the ramp.<br><br>                      The first house in the sky area has 3 rooms in it. I believe there are a total of 8 or<br>                      so mobs within these rooms. If you've gotten to this point this shouldn't be an issue.<br>                      Work your way through the first house and on to the bridge beyond.<br>                      Unfortunately this map has no detail of the inside of these houses.<br><br>                      Once you have made it past the first house you'll want to take your guild to the first<br>                      corner. Your Puller and rogue will now head to the second house. This is the second<br>                      door that requires a rogue. It was customary that the rogue would stay at the door<br>                      opening as needed for the puller, until the raid was through.<br><br>                      The Second House has several more spawns. I believe around 6. These are of course<br>                      pulled to the corner where the raid is waiting.<br><br>                      Once the House is cleared the raid is moved into the house and the pullers will now<br>                      start pulling the romers between House2 and House3.<br>                      Once the Romers are cleared, its time to move the raid up to the corner between<br>                      house2 and house3.<br>                      At this point you will want to buff you raid party. Neh'Ashiir doesn't dispel. So this is<br>                      just a standard max buff session.<br>                      As you can see from the map the bridge before House3 is broken. With DMF this can<br>                      easily be passed over, if you are quick about it.<br><br>                      House3 also requires a rogue to open.<br>                      So not only do you have a locked door, but you also have a broken bridge in front of<br>                      it to deal with as well.<br>                      Once the Raid party is set and ready for this finial encounter, its a simple matter of<br>                      rushing the reaver.<br>                      House3 is pretty small space. On either side there is a set of steps leading up to a<br>                      plat form where the reaver spawns.<br>                      The floor under this platform is fake.<br><br>                      I'll repeat that for everyone, cause I'm sure you missed it.<br>                      The floor under the platform is fake!<br>                      Make sure EVERYONE is aware of this.<br><br>                      Its most important to fight the reaver and Neh'Ashiir with your backs to the fake<br>                      floor. I have seen Neh'Ashiir fall through this hole and start summoning people.<br>                      Luckily when she did this, she summoned me and they warped back up top. I knew<br>                      for sure we were all going to die.<br><br>                      Once Neh'Ashiir has spawned the raid can take a few second to clean up any deaths<br>                      that happened from the reaver. As she spawns Non agro now for the Shaman<br>                      quests.<br><br><br>                      Before the fight begins your Raid shaman should turn in his/her epic quest piece.<br><br>                      Once Neh'Ashiir is dead. The raid should jump down, with DMF on and try to float<br>                      toward the camp spot, Marked on the first map.<br><br>                      Lord Rak'Ashiir.<br><br>                      Lord Rak'Ashiir is the finial spawn in the shaman epic Quest. I'm sure everyone will at<br>                      sometime get to meet this wonderful lord.<br>                      Getting to him isn't as painful as Neh'Ashiir, his queen. But in most cases it's more<br>                      challenging.<br><br>                      Lord Rak'Ashiir Occupies a loft just about the first room in the castle.<br>                      By looking at the map you will notice a triangle behind the back wall of the first<br>                      room.<br>                      This lift will take you into a room just before lord Rak.<br>                      This room is occupied by no less than 4 reavers.<br>                      It is of the UP most importance that you have your best/highest level pullers pull this<br>                      room.<br><br>                      These guardian reavers are commonly pulled to the Camp area marked on the map. <br><br>                      These reavers usually spawn a common undead mob after dieing, but they again can<br>                      spawn another reaver, caution is the key here.<br><br>                      The anti chamber has a set of steps leading up to lord Rak's room.<br>                      Within Lord Rak's room is another set of reavers. 4 again I believe.<br>                      These area again pulled out side.<br>                      Once the finial reaver has been killed and Lord Rak spawns. Every one in your raid<br>                      should back off... This is a job that requires some pop corn and a coke.<br>                      To Combat Lord Rak, the raid needs to have at least two 49 level mages.<br><br>                      Since Lord Rak doesn't spawn agro the raid will have a few minutes to buff and make<br>                      ready.<br><br>                      At this time the mages should summon fire pets.<br>                      Once Summoned the mages should instruct the clerics and shaman to throw every<br>                      HP and AC buff they have at the pets.<br><br>                      Once the buff process for the pets is finished, its time to start the fight.<br><br>                      Lord Rak Ashiir.<br>                      Level 60 has 15K in HPS and as an AE fire proc that does around 1.5K in damage.<br>                      Now you can respect the fire pets for saving you.<br><br>                      If the Raid has a Shaman this shaman should turn in his epic Quest item and hope<br>                      that he/she doesn't die from the first AE proc.

Also just cause<br>                      he's so MR doesn't mean don't bring the casters, they're invaluable in dealing with<br>                      extra pull trash while the mellees work on reaver(s)<br><br>                      also DO NOT sit near a wall, anytime!!! make sure all the casters know this, you<br>                      don't want the train that will ensue.<br><br>                      It's also possible to pull him without opeing castle door if you're only there for<br>                      shammy books. The puller can sit at door and he will most likey aggro, with freinds,<br>                      tho I heard that if the 'sitter' is lvl 56, he will come out solo.<br><br>                      First time we did em, it took 11 reavers for lord to spawn, second time, he spawned<br>                      after one.

Pulls one<br><br>Go back to the left balcony stairs.. looking into the courtyard there is a mob next to the statue.  Toss a star.. This results in 1-3 mobs.<br><br>Go back and grab whatever remains in the courtyard. NOTE: DO NOT hug this wall.<br><br>Now go back to the left balcony and run up the path of the courtyard and HUG the wall.

You just need sow and then ANY CLASS can pull.  You can train everything to the bridge. go past the bridge and there is a wall in front of the zone.  This is the place where all the mobs wait for you.   If you run to the zone (but don't zone) all the MOBs will wait outside for you.  Now have everyone back up and you run out slowly until several aggro you. Imediately back up.  If you did it right only 1 will forllow you to the zone.  This makes for nonstop pulling. <p>MONK ZARGONOF THE 47th SHACKLE-"You like dis Trance stick?"
