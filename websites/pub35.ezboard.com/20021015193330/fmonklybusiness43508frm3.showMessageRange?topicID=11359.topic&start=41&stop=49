Yes a fungi is a nice item to have and are great during battle but they are not as uber as people make u think. A fungi is truly worth maybe 20 30k. I myself had my warrior own over 8 different fungi's and the reason I never kept one was because they weren't THAT uber. They only cost so much because they no longer drop. But if u were to see a true uber monk you would notice he isnt wearing a fungi. I would have to tell you that for the price a fungi costs not to get one unless u are rich enough to buy fungi and then some. The other uber gear you could get for 85k out matches a fungi. Only buy one if you are rich enough to own more than one otherwise invest elsewhere. Unless of course you have the best items money can buy, except a fungi, and dont need that 85k for something else then go right ahead. <p>Lvl 43 <BR>

fungi &gt; all<br>
<br>
no, im not gonna just say that and not support it.  Heres why its better than anything else.<br>
<br>
Whatever server you are on, take the amount of money that a fungi costs, and spend that into the rest of your kit.  Then try and solo as well as having a fungi.  It wont happen<br>
<br>
Even on servers where fungi is up to 80k, fungi &gt; 80k worth of gear<br>
<br>
There may be something, im sure.  But the reason fungi is so good, is because there is nothing that beats it for efficiency of money spent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustoneglacier.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stoneglacier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 939<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/23/02 8:25:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11359.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fungi's not as uber as you think</span><hr size=1> Anyone know the approximate drop rate on a fungi tunic?<br>

I bought it not that long ago (pre last patch or two) on CT for 32K.  Do it think it's worth 32? yup, i do.  Makes soloin a bit more fun and easy as it does in some groups where you don't have a great healer.  Added bonus is that i'm an iksar so you can really see the difference with my natural regen, once i hit 60 that'll show even more, but my point is this, 80K for a fungi is nuts.  For that kind of money you could pretty much a lot of REALLY good gear for your monk, incuding a kick asss BP.  For me, if i had to spend 80k on something, i'd much rather fork that over for a COF rather than a fungi <p><IMG SRC=http://members.cox.net/a.dyl/webmonk.gif align=left></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uungerarghangreal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ungerargh Angreal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/23/02 11:21:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11359.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Fungi</span><hr size=1> I bought my fungi in the bazaar for 55k after about a month or so of saving up money from sales of anything from uber LGuk loot (I've sold around 10 white gold necklaces at 250 pp a pop, 3 runed mithril tunics at 750 a pop, 4 crowns of the froglok kings for 700-800 pp each, 2 platinum tiaras at 700ish each, the list goes on...), to Velketor's lab loot (erm...*cough* 4 SCHWs, 1 SCWB, numerous gem drops) to shite 200 pp drops I've gotten while just running around.  I also save platinum from every kill.  The *only* plat pharming I did was a measly 4600 pp worth with my shaman on HGs (about 10 hours, in nice bite-sized Form of the Great Bear-length chunks).<br>
<br>
It is NOT that hard to save for a fungi.  You just have to set fungi as your goal, and not waver.  Hmmm...bracelet of fortitude for sale?  NO, you're saving for fungi.  Wow, Gold Inlaid Ulak for only 10kpp....NO, you're saving for fungi.  Upgrade from FBSS to SotDB, SotDB to SSHS, etc.?  Repeat the mantra to yourself...'Fungi &gt; all.'<br>
<br>
And it IS.  I went and tried out my fungi at velk's, soloing, once I got it.  I made nearly double the amount of experience soloing w/ fungi as I did grouping in a *good* f/f or tents group.  If you only group, fungi is not important.  If you prefer to group, but occasionally solo, fungi is nice.  If you mostly solo, or only solo, fungi is *necessary.*  You haven't seen good solo xp in the mid-late 50s as a monk until you have a fungi.<br>
<br>
Many people get overwhelmed by how much the fungi costs...DON'T.  If you don't spend money, it accumulates, simple fact.  You will eventually get there.<br>
<br>
I got my fungi at 56 and I don't see myself ever looking back.  My weapons are ghetto (epic / WF), but at least now I can solo with some reasonable efficiency...which was my goal all along.  I had a tough enough time pre-fungi as an iksar; I couldn't fathom it as a human. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=249499">Slithers Sa`angreal</A>, 56 Iksar Monk of Prexus<br>Proud Member of <A HREF="http://azuresky.droz.net">Azure Sky</A><br>

How can I ever afford that?</span><hr size=1> I saved up 10,000pp to purchase an Imbued Fighter Staff at level 48.  It was tough, but I could probably do it again five times over and buy a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic.<br>
<br>
Only problem is that I want other things too (read: Tranquil Staff, Celestial Fists, Cloak of Flames) and can work on some of those while gaining exp (Currently doing Karnor's Castle for the staff and the pipe).  My account has been suspended for a month (family issue) and my friends (Both also 51 monks now) have almost caught up to me in exp.  I always used to be the &quot;most uber&quot; of the trio, always being about 4 levels ahead of either.  Alas, as many would say, &quot;shit happens.&quot;<br>
<br>
The inevitable question arises:  Are you willing to put exp on hold to buy a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic?  It takes quite a bit of time to raise 50,000 platinum (maybe more depending on your server), and &quot;buy low, sell high&quot; has not worked well for me.  I must resort to farming Gems or Velium in Crystal Caverns (my preferred cash camp) while earning little (Geonids) or no exp.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I could earn &quot;somewhat decent&quot; (according to one of my 51 monk friends) exp while camping Raster of Guk.  This, in my opinion, is actively persuing a different goal.  Instead of inanely killing hundreds of orcs for velium to sell in bazaar to lazy people who like Thurgadin Gate potions, or killing Geonid after Geonid (if not camped), I can sit in a peaceful, usually relatively quiet camp doing what hundreds of monks before me did in a ritual that will eventually net me an item better than a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic.<br>
<br>
I apologize for rambling.<br>
<br>
On the subject of twinking, as long as the player develops a decent array of skills (both as a player and as a character .. Nothing makes me cringe like 'Faztfyztz has fallen to the ground') I allow it with little grumbling (mostly envious).<br>
<br>
A note to young monks:  Make friends with those whose equipment outshine yours.  If they are a kind person, they may toss a treat your way sooner or later.  As a level 14 monk grouping in Kurn's Tower, I had a blast with another level 14 monk by the name of Swiftfall.  He was so decked out, the mind boggles  (At least my level 14 mind did .. he had 2 Canes of the Tranquil!)  We both played nearly constantly, and he inevitably outleveled me.  I never asked for anything, but once he needed to do a transfer, and I gladly did it for him ... It was for 500 Platinum and a weapon.  I faithfully did the transfer, and he awarded me with my very own Cane of the Tranquil.  Of course, by this time he had a Jade Mace, but I wasn't concerned.  Feling uber, I went and soloed my way through the levels.  I never saw Swiftfall again, though I will never forget receiving my first &quot;uber item&quot; from him.  I used Cane/Fist until about level 35, when I bought a Jade Mace of my own, which I used my low 40's when I bought a Light Velium Brawl Stick.  Later I raised cash all day for my Imbued Fighter Staff, which I use now.<br>
<br>
That being said, I envied the monks who started with excellent equipment, but I certainly condone the more fortunate making their alts' life easier. <p>-Korph
