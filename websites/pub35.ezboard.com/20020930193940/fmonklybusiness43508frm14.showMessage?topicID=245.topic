Funniest part of the 80's.  <br><br>Anyway.  Well the scantily clad chick in the red underwear finally got to me and I downloaded the client for Anarchy Online.  Kinda getting into it.  Its like a cross between Omnikron and System Shock 2.  Also the babes in bikinis dont hurt.  <br><br>The Good.  <br><br>The Chicks! (gotta admit, I havent logged on my half elf paladin to look at her ass since!)  <br><br>Your own apartment, decortable.  Yeah, doesn't seem like much but.  A place to call your own.  That goes so far to immersing yourself into the world.  <br><br>Social Clothes.  Tired of fighting? Want to take a break?    Get the hell out of that armor, put the gun away. and go hang out in some nice clothes.  Only thing that could be better would be jukeboxes or bands in the Clubs.  Yeah get on that table and dance Baby!  <br><br>Guns.  Nottin Wrong with that!<br><br>Graphics.  I dont know how it is for the low end systems but on my 2 gig mhz, 1 gig ram, Geo3, cable modem it runs pretty sweet, little laggy in the high population areas but thats network and not system related.<br><br>Missions.  Granted Ive only been playing for 2 days but Heck, I played daggerfall, non stop for 2 years (well, off and on).  I like the way you just walk up to a terminal and can get something to do.<br><br>The Chicks! (What can I say?  If I have a choice between looking at an Atrox or a Homo Solstus Female in a rubber cat suit...........Call me whacky (no pun intended) but Im going with Kitty!) <br><br>Agent.  This is my first characters chosen profession.  From reading all the class descriptions It was the most appealing.  From the message boards, its also the most broke and underused.  From the guides, I also failed to pick the best race for the class (oplifex?sp? was the best but they were'nt as uhm endowed).  I think this will fit me well since it means not that many other people will be playing them and hopefully they will get boosted up to inspire more people to pick them.<br><br>Some nice people.  People have buffed me, I try to be polite and say thank you but its usually wasted since I just came out of a mission and am going back to sell or wander around or something and they wear off by the time Im back to fighting.  There are people who I guess wanted to help me but Im more of a Ill do it myself and my way type person (I could almost hear the gasps of shock and surprise)<br><br>The World.  This opinion will probly change the first time I step into either a omni vs clan zone or a full on pvp zone and get slapped down like a little bitch; but I like the way they set it up.  Each side has their zones with the contested and no man lands zone.  Second thought, Ill just get my statue of Buffy, stay in my apartment and Jiggle!  <br><br>The Bad.<br><br>Nano's.  Sorry, Just cant get into them.  <br><br>Guides.  Kinda skimpy on the documentation.  Took me a while to learn how to do simple things like lock pick (actually have to use item on object rather then press hotkey for toolbar.  Other info like how to use some skills is really lacking.<br><br>Concealment and Aimed shot.  From what the boards say these are massivly broke or nerfed.  I would liken them to our Thunder kick.  Sure, it has the potential for massive damage but I keep hitting for bare minimum  most of the time (keep in mind Im level 7, probly need to be 20+ to even see improvment)<br><br>Economy.  Damn glad I dont have to pay for food, Id starve.  Items sell for pennies but shops sell for grands.  Course on the bright side, moneys not that hard to get if your persistant.  <br><br>The Ugly.<br><br>The damn chat channels.  I still cant find a way to shut them off.  Even if I hide the chat window I still get the text.<br><br>Right clicking to use.  Hard as hell to get used to.  Like driving on the other side of the road.<br><br>All in all.  I can see some things that will appeal to me.  How long it will; I dont know.  Got another 4-5 days before I start paying.   Not giving up EQ, just taking a little holiday.  Now All I need are sunglasses!     <br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/useaghankai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seaghan Kai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(2/12/02 7:31:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=245.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.comixtreme.com/Marvel/Ultimate%20Marvel/headshots/jackrussell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have sinned against you Oh Lord!</span><hr size=1> I've heard many horror stories about the bugs they've had with that game.

I was loving it, but a few things kept me from sticking with it:<br><br><br>1)  I knew no one.  It's hard to get into an MMORPG after leaving friends behind in EQ and DAoC and going on to one with no friends.<br><br>2) I was just needed a break from the MMORPG thing.  I was addicted hardcore to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and I just found that more entertaining after 4 years of playing MMORPGs.  AO is fun, but nothing like a OLTL Server in RtCW. (One life to live)<br><br>3)  The game absolutely HATES my video card.  (3D Prophet 4500, 64 mb, Kryo II chip set).  Great video card and all, but it doesn't let me use the Speedread program without crashing every 5 - 30 seconds when entering a town.  Without Speedread, it runs fine, except it's awfully choppy.  (I'll admit, I'm a stubborn bitch:  I had the res on 1024 x 768 and wasn't very willing to lower it.  Which probably played a big part in it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br>Other than that, I'd say the game is 200x better than what it was.  I'll admit, the first day I played, I couldn't exit the newbie area because the zone outside was down, BUT I never encountered that problem again.  (I think EQ had zones going down more often than AO does now).<br><br>But it is insanly complicated if you don't like dealing with the small details.  Get a high level trader to casts buffs on you and then you can upgrade yourself with implants twice your level, and even use weapons twice your level.  It's cool and all, but just not my style.  I prefer to kill and level, not have to worry about that stuff.  But that's me.<br><br><br>I'd definently say it beats DAOC hands down, though.  DAoC had slightly more content with the addition of epic zones and keep / relic taking.  But it was just duuuuuull.  It was the perfect cure to insomnia.  If you couldn't sleep, DAOC would fix it.  Sure, the game was a blast and all at lower levels, but get higher, and most people leave due to boredem.  Most..not all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Midgard on my server lost about 20 - 30 level 45+ people due to boredem.  And at off hours (5 - 6 am), it only had a total of 80 people.  It's early, but how often do you see a server so sparsly populated?<br><br><br>Sorry, I am done with my rambling now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ualexyi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alexyi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1362<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/7/02 12:39:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=245.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Its all about me Baby!!!</span><hr size=1> Fun Part I find is that for the most part I do the missions.
