That's for VI to decide I suppose, but I imagine they'll never share that decision with us.  They won't share it probably because the nerf didn't hit the target, and admitting that would mean they'd have to fix it. And well, with PooP just coming out, who's got the time to fix things?<br>
<br>
Anyhow: After nerf, I take about 30 % more damage all the time. Doesn't matter if the mob is slowed or any of that other horseshit people like to talk about. In a group, solo, duoing or whatever I take about 30 % more damage. It's more obvious the closer I get to a tanking role. In a group, it's no big deal. Healer just heals me 30 % more. Soloing sorta blows but I can still do it, but it means my exp per hour is about 30 % less than it was before the patch. Am I broke? I really can't know unless VI says, Zarsiss we needed to slow you down by about 30 %. Then I can say, &quot;Yay, I'm not broke!&quot;  <br>
<br>
I feel broke though. I feel less motivated to grind. I feel less motivated to play. <p><CENTER>

    But for myself the monk is much more than pulling . Its a class move I went to because they always soloed well (as well as a melee could) I've got a cleric if I want to be group dependant.<br>
   Real life doesn't leave me much time to group I get an hour or so after work during the week and Friday nights I normally group/raid and at that time often I play my cleric.<br>
   But I prefer the monk over all  and I've invested a lot of time and money if you count monthly fees into him . and the nerf either intended or not has struck a massive blow to one of the major aspects I liked about the monk ...truth be known I WILL NEVER see the gear some of you have our guild is mostly people like my self very casual players with odd times to play.<br>
    I've seen some posts say big deal you have to group now !<br>
To those I say have you tried to travel from point A to point B &quot;FIND&quot; a group get set up make a little progress then exit to a safe spot to camp in an hour or so ? ill bet not very often will you get much done .Or worse yet add a corpse run in there somewhere.(another reason I like the monk with short play time)<br>
<br>
  I guess on some lvl I can see quitting if you feel even more passionatly about this ...or have been hit much harder than me ..(gear seems to be playing a huge roll in this)<br>
<br>
  maybe this sheds some light on things for you ..if not oh well i tried =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=catterly>catterly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 687<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 10:08:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is wrong with monks today?</span><hr size=1> verent has stated from day one until now mobs were never meant to be pulled.

VI admitted there was a problem with Slay Undead 3, and they tried to correct it so everyone was equal.  So the Paladin community raised arms and lots threatened to quit, and a great number posted they were not going to buy PoP becuase if it. *personally I had no problems with the call off of the Slay Undead issue.  I thought it was a senseless thing.  But this is the premise you are using for monks to quitely accept their hit.  So we need to make the compairson. <br>

<br>
I find this on the whole a rather insulting statement.  I can easly say you are finding even less 60+ monks(now) that are not twinks becuase it takes more skill to play them proprely.  Go read Monkly-Business to find out for yourselves.  That statement does not make it true. I know quite a few monks that could play Paladins just fine, and quite a few paladins that could play Monks just find thank you.  Specisus and does not go to the arguement at hand. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And Hybrids are meant to deal high damage...They are a tank class, but you also have to remember best weapon in the game used to be monk only...Ton Po's bo stick of understanding...and Fists of Acrylia kick any paladin weapon's ass...especially primal.../priceless... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
2 problems with this statment.  1 Hybrids are not meant to deal High Damage.  I will roll out some highly respected Paladins to prove that point.  In truly situational damage ie. Paladin vs Undead, Ranger with AM 3. Yes I will agree with you.  But as a rule Hybrids are suppsed to deal high damage.  It is against the Vision.  Damage deal is as follows (this is from VI and their Melee balancing statement) Rogue 1.4./Monk 1.2/Warrior 1.0/Knights .80/Ranger .80/Bard .75. This agues against Hybrids dealing high damage amounts. <br>
<br>
2nd you take 2 of the rarest weapons in the game and compair them to 2 of the more trivial weapons a Paladin can get.  Assuming that the Paladin and the Monk belong to the same guild.  If they do the Paladin can get access to weapons that are far superior than primal also. <br>

<br>
I never understood how we have it better than most classes.  I am sorry I just don't get it. Since taking 37% more damage is a good thing.  Lets let SU3 nerf happen.  VI admited that they made a mistake with it.  Its only a little damage mitigation change 15% instead of 37%.  Oh yea, we would get the ton of posts saying that they are not going to buy PoP, or quit the paladin class, or quit the game if that happens. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, mind you...most of the &quot;i quits&quot; on the forumns happened prior to the patch<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So did yours.  Also you had your nerf changed inside of 24 hours of it being announced.  By the time a lot of people got the message it was changed back.  We had a week to stew in it before it happened, and ours happened. <br>

So, yes, originally mobs weren't meant for pulling, but unless a person was in an early phase of beta, they haven't ever played EQ without pulling being an integral and intended part of the design.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shidoshayasnaki>Shidosha Yasnaki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 10:22:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...my point</span><hr size=1> &quot;And btw...Paladins are becoming more and more rare because contrary to popular belief...it does take more skill to play a hybrid than any class in the game...read on Paladins of Norrath...to find out for yourselves...&quot;<br>

umm...maybe you should try playing a bard or an enchanter before you starrt trying to label paladins, Sks, and Beastlords as the hardest classes in the game to play... (and no, bards are NOT hybrids, despite often being grouped with them for no discernable reason)<br>

Also, the plethera of anti-monk sentiment has only furthered my unwillingness to group with anyone.  Soloing is much more fun to me than grouping with strangers.  Anything that decreases my ability to solo, decreases my enjoyment of the game.  I also do not enjoy playing hybrid classes or casters so the obvious choice for me was to play a monk.  A melee class that could solo effectively.  Your classification of a monk as a &quot;pulling class&quot; may be accurate for some but does not fit me and I would guess many monks.  I am not as of yet quitting because I have been working on questing and not xp grinding.  When I do return to grinding, if I can no longer solo like I previously could then I will have to consider leaving the game. <p>&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=321311&quot;&gt;Gramone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>

Bullshit.<br>
<br>
My first character was a Ranger, and I still use him as an alt. My other alt is a Beastlord. Both are so much easier than my Monk it's untrue.<br>
<br>
Paladin for the most part sits in camp and wait for the Monk to bring him a mob. On raids he sits there and waits for the Monks to bring him a mob.<br>
<br>
The most complicated thing a Paladin has to do is root park.... and most Paladins can't do that in xp groups. The rest of the time you just have to like whack stuff.<br>
<br>
Tell me what a Paladin does that requires more skill or work than pulling? Because I swear if there's a class being played by a tribe of village idiots, it's the Paladin. <p><hr />

On a monk, you deciesively push a button, from that button extends a plan of battle through melee actions.<br>
A paladin my bullshit friend, is much more than that...more than pressing a button...it takes time to learn to play a good paladin...a monk is regarded as one of the easiest for a reason, it truely takes VERY LITTLE skill...<br>

paladin epic is about the 3rd hardest in the game...you try going to 33 nagafens...THEN try killing a 63 lich, followed by a 55 paladin, then in case you didnt get books you get to compete with the 3 most contested dragons in the game...lemme say yipee! bro, my monk is 51 and has his epic...my paladin...33 nagafens and still not a book...so go bullshit yourself <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kokueiakujin>Kokuei Akujin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 11:22:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bullshit, wtf are you on?</span><hr size=1> Though Hybrid's were 75% Melee 25% caster now they have evolved into their own special classes though they do share many spells with their &quot;parent class&quot;. Monk's have de-evolved the mitigation change hit's the worse equiped monks the hardest. While for the most part the uber monks retain most of their abilities and in some area's are uneffected. Example: Highend Monks against low dark blue mobs just own as the did before but when pulling highend mobs they get hit hard. Lowend Monks though suffer in both departments. So it seems that if I wish to continue to solo low dark blue mobs or pull for my guild raids I need to get around 1500ac.<br>
<br>
The general opinion is monks have taken about a 200ac hit. If you calculate this using the defensive skill 1 point equals about 2.5 AC monks have taken a 80 point drop in defense. Putting them at about 172 defense from their previous cap of 252. Now the monk change is not visible in this way so this is just a example but using this as a example this puts us below shamans and druids in defensive skill which both cap at 200. Our only redeeming factor then is our avoidance skills which we have over shaman and druids but I purpose a test. <br>
<br>
1. Find a druid or shaman with similar AC as you.<br>
<br>
2. Pull a mob and turn your back to it. (this will negate any avoidance skills and any missed or mitigated attacks would be purely based off AC and mitigation.)<br>
<br>
This if I'm correct should give a good idea of how we mitigate and avoid damage based on AC. I am willing to bet we mitigate right around equal to a druid or shaman with like AC when compared this way. I feel that not only should we mitigate well above shamans and druids but with our avoidance skills we would avoid more attacks also (and we do). Now however I feel we mitigate right around the same as those classes with our avoidance helping a bit.<br>

His statement about how simple the monk class is to play.  Geee..  last time I check.  Pulling in places like NToV and up are not so simple.  You can not mess up at all.  If you do, you are dead or your raid is dead.  Sounds simple to me. :P<br>

In truth none of the classes are that hard to play.  Crowd control and healing are probably the most nerve wracking, and probably in the long run most annoying, cause in that role you find every other PC to be an idiot. <p><hr>

All this situational damage about rogues is bullshit.  When is it ever the rogues &quot;situaton&quot; to not be at the ass of a mob.  If you can maintain your &quot;situational damage&quot; 100% of the time then it IS NOT A SITUATION. it is the way it is.  Have you ever heard of a rogue not wanting to BS the hell out of a mob.  I havent.<br>
<br>
So basically the ballincing argument about rogues damage being only situational is all crap.<br>

Forums like this are great to read to see who have the will to practice whatever VI gives/nerfs to overcome our pros and cons.  It is those monks that make this forum what it is today:  The premier source of knowledge for us others (aka as the monk twinkers).<br>
<br>
I only play for one reason:  FUN  <br>
<br>
If it takes a few months before the monks are fun again I have the choice to elect to play a High-Priest with a mondo hammer, WR and turned into a Werewolf for max proccage.<br>
<br>
I do appreciate the read, as well as all the insights gained from this board while YOU the hardcore monks explore and divulge the secrests (allowing me to look less like a N00b).<br>

You will overcome any setback, it is in your nature.
