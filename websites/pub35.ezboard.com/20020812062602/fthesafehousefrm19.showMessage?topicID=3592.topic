 <br>
 I just finished some testing on pendragon with a Level 50 infiltrator (Lihp) and my 50 Shadowblade (Kobola).<br>
 <br>
 Out of about 65 PA attempts, about 10 missed, and all others landed.<br>
 <br>
 For the record, the set up was the same, and no reason for the misses. Nothing was done to increase miss rate &quot;at the time&quot; that they happened. It was a set up, I just step up and PA as normal.<br>
 <br>
 If there was a shield specialization scout or a high parry tank then it could be tested to see if those two defense ablities effect PA. But the only defense ability Lihp had was evade.<br>
 <br>
 The complete log without edit, is located in the &quot;PA block/parry/evaded&quot; miss rate thread on this board.<br>
  <br>
<br>
 Summary..<br>
  PA miss rate has had it's &quot;random&quot; miss formula increased. Even on a perfect set up that you spend a lot of time finding, you can still miss even if you do everything right.<br>
 <br>
 Take Care! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

He evaded and didn't move after. <br>
I hit him with G/AH before he ever started fighting. I won the fight. But, only because I got in those two hits before he started retaliating. <br>
Also, had PA flat out fail against a standing lurikeen caster. He was casting when I struck. So, I know it wasn't due to movement on his part. <br>
Tonight, and I'm not making this up; I had 6 PA's in a row fail in PvE. And, a warrior was tanking the mobs before I would even attempt. <br>
Another strange thing happened tonight. I hit with crits on 4 successive strikes in a row. G/AH/G/AH all hit with crits.  That's never happened to me before, either...err...not that I'm complaining about it. :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/21/02 8:24:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3592.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Summary on PA miss rate..Tested</span><hr size=1> And people think I'm crazy when I tell them Critical Strikes is a waste of spec points.

Respec day will be the day I become a blademaster with stealth and poison. Critical Strikes is more dangerous to me, than to my intended victims--defense penalties, lag-sensitive, buggy misses, lousy damage.<br>
<br>
The day a Critical Strikes style does more damage than a boow Critical Shot will be the day it is worth the points. Not sooner, especially not with melee stuns about to be nerfed.<br>

<br>
If they have changed their lag compensation or anything along those lines, then yes, PA miss rates will go up, but it isnt due to the skill being changed, its due to your client not updating with the server often enough.  also, when folks are in combat mode, sometimes their stance makes a pa look as if its straight on, even though it isnt.  the best way to line a PA up is by using the shoulders if possible, even if you are left or right by a foot or 2, if your shoulders are square with theirs, the PA will still go off properly.<br>
<br>
lurikeens are one of the hardest races to PA because they are so small, and getting the proper front on them is difficult in the heat of battle. <p><a href="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=38056&raceid=10&classid=44">Dither Disgustipated</a><BR>

Additionally, I have been on the receiving end of plenty of PA's myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  - I have never evaded.  <br>
<br>
I have however had plenty of PA's &quot;fail.&quot;  I blamed lag of course, never myself (and I know all of you do too!).  But even when lag ruins my otherwise perfect execution &lt;grin&gt;, I still hit my target every time (albiet for a pathetic amount).  <br>
<br>
P.S. At least a failed PA still pierces blade turn! <br>

Here is a small section from that log.. <br>
<br>
[ 20:37:38 ] You are now hidden!<br>
[ 20:37:39 ] You auto-stick Briton.<br>
[ 20:37:41 ] You enter combat mode and target [Lihp]<br>
[ 20:37:41 ] You prepare to perform a Perforate Artery!<br>
[ 20:37:41 ] You miss!<br>
[ 20:37:41 ] You are no longer hidden!<br>
[ 20:37:43 ] You are no longer auto-following your target.<br>
 <br>
[ 20:38:25 ] You are now hidden!<br>
[ 20:38:27 ] You auto-stick Briton.<br>
[ 20:38:30 ] You enter combat mode and target [Lihp]<br>
[ 20:38:30 ] You prepare to perform a Perforate Artery!<br>
[ 20:38:30 ] You perform your Perforate Artery perfectly. (+24) <br>
[ 20:38:30 ] You attack Lihp with your dagger and hit for 249 (-5) damage!<br>
[ 20:38:30 ] You critical hit for an additional 27 damage!<br>
[ 20:38:30 ] Lihp is bleeding!<br>
[ 20:38:30 ] You hit Lihp for 6 damage!<br>
[ 20:38:30 ] You are no longer hidden!<br>
[ 20:38:31 ] You are no longer auto-following your target.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Not that it is going to matter a lot to most of you, but out of 65 PAs, 10 of them flat out missing is a bit higher than I ever experienced before this test.<br>
 <br>
 I agree with what you are saying, except the test &quot;involved me&quot; and I still have a hard time accepting that miss rate.<br>
 <br>
 Enjoy! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
Does not look like this bug is fixed on pendragon from the tests so CS and CD are both nerfed....  thats pretty bad.<br>

<br>
I was camping the gorge gates and saw a sitting Brition, now he was sitting infront of a tree so I walked over him and then /stick and tried to PA, and missed and died when his buddy came over during the long fight so I thought maybe I hit the PA key too fast or something.<br>
<br>
I came back to find my friends still there (I think they were the same) and I see a Minstral facing the gorge gates, so I walked up behind him /stick wait a full sec then hit my Backstab key and MISS WTF now I've missed a few others since so I know there has to be some random miss key.  MYTHIC WITH ALL OFTHE SETUP AND RISK WE TAKE IF WE LINE UP A PA/BS (correctly) IN RVR WE SHOULDN'T MISS.
