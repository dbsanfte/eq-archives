It took 40 days played to level my first char. to 50 and was lots of fun.  I got board with him around level 55 and started a cleric that is 54 with 13 days played and then took a warrior to 45 in 7 days played.  From what I have read in PC gamer and from what I have seen in the changes to the venom axe Verent seems set on killing twinking.  The fact of the matter is I would have quit EQ about 18 months ago had it not been for twinking.  I can tell you I would not have leveled another char. to 50++ if I had to invest another 40 days to do it.  Do the folks at Verent understand that if they kill twinking they will be shorting the amount of time that people will pay and play this and future games?<br>

I started a char, new to this server, had only 2k (from a friend), and sat in EC for a few days, and got around 45k worth of items.  Is it fair I can't use these items, even though I earned them all on my own? (except the 2k.  If verant wants the 2k, they can have it).  Now powerleveling, I like it too, but I think it gives more of a disadvantage to others than twinking.  Powerleveling can only get you to 50, or low 50s max.  By that time even a big twink would almost be even with items with someone who leveled slower (since that person most likely has been on many raids).<br>
<br>
So before verant gets rid of twinking, they should think about powerleveling (mainly dshields). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 2:01:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23524.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: twinking</span><hr size=1> &quot;They're doing anything to make more money, and they see this: Player_001 plays a character for a long time, gets bored, and decides he still wants to play, so he creates another character and it takes him just as long to get tha tchar up to the other char's status.&quot;<br>
<br>
If that's their plan, they can count me out.  I'd be damned if I would invest the time/effort to lvl a character the way I did my first one.  What is the point of doing that.  It is not fun to spend months getting to lvl 50 any more than ONE TIME.<br>
<br>
Anyone who talks about &quot;Twinking/PLing is an unfair advantage,&quot; I ask you this:  An unfair advantage against whom?  Unless you are in PvP (and I'm not positive it makes sense there either), this attitude makes no sense whatsoever, and only makes you look like a jealous fool who isn't really enjoying his/her own game.<br>
<br>
Anyways, Verant, if you think making me lvl all my characters like a newbie is the way to go, you can absolutely, 100%, count me out.  You're games aren't cocain, as much as people joke about getting &quot;hooked.&quot;  I've dropped ya before like a hot potato over less, and I would leave again No Prob.  You lost my money for 1 year because you screwed the goose.  No EQ?  no bother me.<br>

on PvP twinking is hard to come by (unless u have some high lvl AND generous friends).  and if ur not twinked then ur right up there with the rest of em.  saves are the only thing that counts - and the hardest to come by on zek servers imo.<br>

<br>
First off, I agree with the &quot;it's fun to twink&quot; attitude. I love twinking and it allows me to try different classes at more levels. I leveled my first to 60 and sure in heck don't want to do it again the long way, plus the first 60 was different because there was a lot of exploration and learning that came with it which is the main reason for EQ, at least IMO. But after you know the whole game, or close to it, it would be too boring to level up the long way again, because there is no sense of adventure and exploration. Won't hold my interest.<br>
<br>
Now reasons Verant would gain from the &quot;nerf&quot;: and if they don't make a lot of sense, it's possible they aren't good reasons, but best I could come up with.<br>
<br>
1. People may stick with their main character for far longer...thus decreasing server population because of less twinks, but still keeping the money comming from the one account.<br>
<br>
2. Stabelize economy. I assume this post is also relating to EQ2 which I am also considering in this post. Would be nice to have a &quot;balanced&quot; economy when EQ2 comes out.<br>

3. Forces more people to learn their class better...thus creating a better more experienced high end game. Nothing like seeing a 55+ cleric cast CH on an umbuffed caster at start of fight and getting beat down because of it getting whole group killed, or having a 55+ Rogue twink jump in and start beating the crap out of the mob with no aggro control...thus causing rogue to die quickly and then have the group's damage output cut in half etc.<br>
<br>
There are more, but I&quot;m at work...all I could come up with at top of my head though.<br>

There was a time when i thought it was lame.  But the game has changed alot.  Theres really not a influx of new people to the game.  Just about every level 5 you see is on the same account with a 55+.  <br>
<br>
The 60 Crowd is the fastest growing group of kids on all servers.  8 Months ago you could &quot;/w ro all 60&quot; and get like 6.  Now at peek hours Too Numorus to count.  For Lots of Level 60 (Even the casual 60 players) there is NOTHING purchaseable thats a worthy upgrade (Its all NO Drop). . .But none the less even without effort they accumulate huge coin.<br>

On one hand, they say they are against twinking (presumably so we can play the game longer) and on the other, they make it a lot easier to get to 50.<br>
<br>
-No more hell levels &lt;54<br>
-No more looting corpses until level 10 or so<br>
-No losing xp until 11 or so<br>
-Clerics get xp res starting at 19 (and at that level, even &quot;revive&quot; helps you get back to fighting/xp faster)<br>
-Druids and Wizards can now succor before they can even port themselves.<br>
<br>
It seems to me they want everyone to have smoother sailing to 50. So how is this making people &quot;play longer&quot;? It benefits alt chars tremendously, because most already have  some idea of how the game is played. Economies and mudflation means you can buy weapons for coppers on the plat of what they used to cost.<br>
<br>
I can see that they want to scale down the damage for lower levels by using the sliding damage scale on weapons. I'm not for or against this. But I don't think they are doing it to slow down level advancement, or why would they change all of the above things?<br>
<br>
All I see them doing is making buttloads of 50+ all competing for the same (epic) mobs.<br>

If you play a character to level 60 and aren't in a guild with constant raids, what do you do with the loot you invariably pick up?  If you play the game regularly then loot will come your way, particularly if you play in dungeons.<br>
<br>
Now there are some options.  You could sell all the stuff in your local market.  Of course if you're selling it for plat to someone who didn't actually earn the item, aren't you twinking them?  The only difference between twinking a level 40 stranger who gives you 4k plat and a level 5 toon of you own is the level.  And then you end up with a bunch of money in your bank account.  Whoopie.  What do you do with it?  You can save it for the super splurge on an item for 100k that you will never see otherwise.  Well, if thats your thing, good for you.<br>
<br>
Option two.  You could give it away to a friend, a guild mate, a stranger who crosses your path.  All of which are reasonable options.  I imagine being the server Santa Claus might have some positive karma attachted.  But aren't you twinking yet again?<br>
<br>
Option three.  You can destroy the item on the spot.  You won't use it.  No one in your group will use it.  Twinking is bad.  Let's just destroy it and move on....<br>
<br>
Option four.  You can twink a toon of your own.  You can actually get some enjoyment out that item that you and your group worked for.  You can get some pleasure from seeing your time having a return on it, albeit on a different toon from the orginal.  But hey, isn't the game big enough for people to enjoy it the way they enjoy it?<br>
<br>
Removing the concept of twinking means that once you have aquired everything you reasonably can for your high level toon, and assuming you're not in a raid oriented guild, you might as well put that toon on the shelf because few if any further rewards will be forthcoming.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ureztarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reztarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 8:36:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23524.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: twinking</span><hr size=1> Low level game isn't fun? <br>
realistically what is the difference beside the fact that you've got all that ubber loot?<br>

</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
<br>
Difference is the loot your get...but then the loot you got off the mobs in North Ro was ok 3 years ago...it is the ecconimy that suck.<br>
<br>
Why should you spend so much time leveling up your character?  I thought rogues would know this.  Would you want a player in your group that just bought his/her level 60 character?  Not much diference between someone doing that and leveling up that character in 5 days.  Either way they don't know how to play that character.<br>
<br>
Honestly if you thing the journey is a chore then it doesn't sound like you enjoy the game and are more interested in having people go &quot;Oh ah!  look at him&quot;<br>
<br>
As far as twinking goes....I like the idea that Sony is doing with EQII.  Anything to make the game more realistic that and I've left groups because someone wanted to join and the group didn't think they where ubber enough.  I'd rather play slowly with that person that is really trying then a bunch of ph4t l00t mongers that thing they are better than everyone else.  Just because that level 17 rogue doesn't have a track tooth and CSS doesn't mean he/she should miss out in groups because everyone else is twinked to the max but that is what happens.  These people end up getting frustrated and leave the game which I think is sad.  So I think ubber twinking should go.  Do I do it?  Yes but then I play when no one is on and finding groups is hard...most people are paired up with their level 60 friend PLing.  So I solo as PL doesn't appeal to me...its the journey that is important not the end of the road.<br>

<br>
Low level you are restricted to a smaller number of zones.  50+ you can explore almost any zone, excluding some dungeons.  Can port around, more enjoyable being able to do more things.<br>
<br>
Low level you kill nothing that drops loot you would need/use.<br>
High level theres a chance you kill something and it drops a nice upgrade.<br>
<br>
Low level now, for me anyway, you don't meet hardly anyone.  Either they zoom past you in levels or you cruise past them.  High level you group with same people numerous times and make friends.<br>
<br>
Lotta other differences I'm sure.<br>

Well, and the 4k.<br>
<br>
It's strange, most games you play them once in easy mode, then if you really like them, you play them again at a higher difficulty level. <br>
<br>
EQ starts out pretty difficult, and people who really like it play it again at an easier difficulty level, through a twink.<br>
<br>
Perhaps instead of twinking, when you create a second character, you should be offerred the choice of a trebled exp gain rate, at the cost of a doubled death penalty and the inabilty to equip any gear you didn't loot yourself?<br>
<br>
How many people would play the game in that 'hardcore' mode?<br>
