While in a group on the Sullon Zek test server, I found myself getting rather frustrated with the ranting of a number of different players after we had taken part in what I found to be an exhilirating PvP encounter. These players were very upset with the fact that the enemy group had attacked us while we were engaged with some bandits and the fact that they were attacking members of our group as they returned to loot there corpse. Even after I reminded them that there were no play nice rules on Sullon, and that we couldn't suffer any more experience loss being killed by mobs than by players, they continued to complain, shout, and generally carry on. I wrote it off as an unfortunate group and moved on. Imagine my suprise when a similar situation arose again with another group. And then with another. This got me to thinking that maybe we need to take a long look at what the changes in PvP means to us as players. I chose to approach this as a &quot;tactics vs exploits&quot; as I feel this is the real issue. Fair and unfair is, in my mind, a matter for roleplaying, but exploiting hurts us all (especially in PvP).<br>
<br>
Every experienced EQ player is familiar with the concept of exploits. Basically, an exploit is using a bug in the software code or a situation that does not fit with the &quot;intended world reality&quot; to gain advantage. Some examples of exploits we are currently wrestling with in PvP include, in no particular order:<br>
<br>
1) Zone line camping – attacking a character after their avatar has zoned through, but before the player has regained control of the avatar.<br>
<br>
2) Training – intentionally pulling large numbers of mobs onto another player or group with the intent of killing said player. <br>
<br>
3) NPC Guard agro range – standing outside of the guards agro radius and attacking players next to the guard with spells, missile weapons, and pets without agroing the guard. Not only does the guard not defend the victim, but they will agro on the victim if they attempt to defend themselves.<br>
<br>
4) Corpse Camping – after killing a player, waiting at the corpse for the player to return and then killing them again before they have been given a chance to recover their equipment and leave.<br>
<br>
5) Bind rushing – after being killed by another player, rushing back and immediately attacking the killer. Usually repeatedly. <br>
<br>
6) Attacking while the enemy is engaged in PvE – carry over from other PVP servers. This is considered an exploit on other servers due to the fact that the enemy will lose experience if they are killed by the mob.<br>
<br>
7) And others beyond counting…..<br>
<br>
Now on to tactics. In each of the above examples, justification within the bounds of &quot;intended world reality&quot; can be made in some situations. Or a minor variation of the &quot;exploit&quot; can gain the &quot;world reality&quot; advantage without abusing the game mechanics. Lets take them one at a time:<br>
<br>
1) Zone line camping – the delay between zone in and the player resuming control is a completely game-mechanic phenomena. There is no &quot;world reality&quot; justification for abusing this unfortunate side effect of the way the world code works. HOWEVER, many zone in points make ideal ambush points within the context of the &quot;intended world reality&quot; and should be used as such (a perfect example is the mountain pass connecting the Qeynos Hills to West Karana). The key to avoiding the zone through exploit is to NEVER do anything to affect anyone until they have taken some action after zone in (ie started running forward, began casting a spell, etc). While this is doable right at the zone line, moving off a bit tends to avoid nasty accusations.<br>
<br>
2) Training – The only &quot;world reality&quot; justification I can think of for this one is in defense of a player character city. The lack of communication between the NPC defenders of a city lead to very unrealistic situations of major invasions going on within clear view of totally unconcerned &quot;city guards&quot;.  The use of this exploit to clear a desired camp or zone lines of PCs is, however, seriously unbalancing, especially amoung those who experience virtually no risk in its use (ie characters much higher level than the zone or those employing fiegn death abilities).<br>
<br>
3) NPC Guard Agro range – simple one here, don't attack someone under the protection of a guard unless you attack the guard at the same time. Any other situation is sheer exploit of bad AI programming, no way around it. <br>
<br>
4) Corpse camping – personally I don't see this as an exploit. If I get killed by a group of bandits in West Karana, do I run up and try to loot my corpse while they stand there? If I do and they kill me again, will anyone take me seriously when I scream about being corpse camped by the bandits? Will a GM come and make them stop? The proper response to the situation would be to wait until the bandits move on or are killed by someone else, or to gather up a group of people to help me kill them so I can recover my stuff. Why should it be any different if a group of players kill me? If we can accept that the gods have removed the threat of permanent involuntary death from the world of Norrath, we must also accept that we must pay the price of our temporary deaths. That price being the loss of a little exp, any loose coin we had in our pockets at the time, and the risk of further deaths if we are not careful in planning our gear recovery. On Sullon Zek at least, this price is the same if we are foolish enough to get killed by other players or by mobs.<br>
<br>
5) Bind rushing – This becomes a tactic rather than an exploit if the person who killed you refuses your request to loot and scoot. At that point the encounter becomes exactly like a corpse recovery against mobs (see #4 above). The player or group being bind rushed is facing the same threat they would if they were trying to hold a camp in an area with rapid respawns and/or large numbers of wandering mobs. The potential for self-deleveling should reduce the use of this as a griefer exploit. <br>
<br>
6) Attacking while the enemy is engaged in PvE – lets go back to our example in number 4 above. I am fighting bandits in West Karana when a rabid grizzly wanders by. Does the grizzly continue on his way because I am busy with the bandits? Does he wait patiently for me to med up and heal before taking a chunk out of my hide? No, he dives in and makes a meal out of my scrawny corpse. It does not fit with the &quot;world reality&quot; to expect any player (except maybe a paladin) to do any differently.  As in number 5 above, the player or group trying the group must accept the risk of &quot;wandering players&quot; in the same way they accept the risk of respawns and wandering mobs. The risk of experience loss is no longer a valid argument against this perfecting logical tactic, as EVERY method of dying causes experience loss, even falling down ladders :-P<br>
<br>
7) And others beyond counting….. In my mind, a tactic becomes an exploit if the answer to either of two questions is yes: <br>
     1) Am I doing this just to piss off the other player? (ie griefing. note: I said other player, not the other character. The later is roleplaying) <br>
     2) Is what I am doing out of character with the &quot;intended world reality&quot;? (ie gaining advantage through game code quirks or bugs)<br>
<br>
In closing, the changes made to PvP on the Sullon Zek server give us the oppurtunity to re-evaluate the current PvP definitions of what is an exploit or griefing, and what is a valid &quot;intended world reality&quot; tactic. I feel we as players will miss a huge oppurtunity to improve PvP in Everquest if we simply transplant the existing rules we try to enforce on ourselves to make PvP fun as well as challenging. Verant is not the only one responsible for improving PvP, we too share that responsibility.<br>

I was, of course labelled a pk and I was indeed, but there was a difference in my eyes.  Most of the Rallos pk's were indeed griefers who are killing you to ebay your items or just kill you in whichever fashion was easiest (zone camping, bank-killing, guard-exploiting, whichever), but there were some few who took on the role of villain and tried to get others to play along.  I remember one time I came upon a ranger slaying a drakkel dire wolf.  As a necromancer, I would have had a ridiculously easy time slaying him as he fought with the wolf, but I never attacked someone already in combat (on Rallos the xp death could really be brutal if you missed that killshot).  Instead I sent him a tell telling him that after he finished the dire wolf he would face a much tougher adversary then I waited till he was finished and as he turned to face me I began to cast my opening magics.   He actually escaped me, but put up a short battle and afterward barraged me with tells thanking me for rp'ing and waiting till he was finished, etc.  Unfortunately, those encounters were the exception to the rule. Most of the time, I would tell someone before I attacked them and I'd slay them and they'd respond with nothing but profanity; usually in shouts to the zone.  Oftentimes, because of my guildtag (Malificus Sect) I would be trained or zone camped or corpse camped since most people lump any pvp guild in with pk guilds like Darkenbane and House Invisus.  I always found it amusing that we had a charter that forbade bagging while hunting the light and prohibited  zoneplugging while the 'anti' guilds would resort to the lowest of tactics (exploits) to kill us.  <br>
   I think it comes down to personal ethics.  You know what you are doing when you kill someone before they can move or use any of the other lower tactics or exploits.   I find that the anonymity of the game really lowers inhibitions and tests the moral fiber of your fellow gamer.   <br>
   So there will always be cool people and bastards.  I treat the bastards as I feel they deserve to be treated (when I'm empowered to) and I try to game with the cool people I meet.  It doesn't really matter if it's honourable for someone to corpsecamp me or zone camp me but it's a fact of life on Sullon and if it's something that is really going to bother you, then the Zeks will be a rough place to live.  I just think it makes it more of a challenge.<br>

My friends and I are making a 3 member group of rogues with the express purpose of being an assasination squad, supported after the attack by a neutral shaman.  We will sneak hide looking for singles and small groups and poison/backstab for opening moves.  We are halflings and all have nearly the same name to add to the confusion in our quick strikes.  Vs. casters we will be using landscape features and our small size to avoid being spotted too soon.<br>
<br>
Long intro to a quick question:<br>
Even though we're on SV with moderately hardcore PvP rules, will our viscious PvP actions be frowned upon by the server comminty, or just make our targets mad? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulegnavalsharess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Legna ValSharess</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/01 11:34:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Granney Granney Granney.</span><hr size=1> GRANNEY!!<br>

WOW..<br>

I SOOO remember you from when I was younger. Sowing people for bat wings at the newbie log.<br>
<br>
You were one of my favorite people, and had a great way of talking to the newbies. Even the twinkies, or hidden twinkies. <br>
<br>
Well, I am on Sullen now. Legna will be sleeping unless I feel like hoping on to Rallos for some reason. <br>

<br>
more grief than happiness...a single person spoiling an entire raid with trains<br>
cheap victory...see above<br>
poorer players getting ahead...again see above<br>
<br>
Regardless of how you define grief play I think most can tell the difference between a decent player and a piece of @#%$.  Someone may seek you out because you killed them but they and all their friends will remember your name if you treated them like @#%$.  The more people you disrespect, train, laugh as you corpse camp for no good reason the greater chance you will die in any given second on norath. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dreeblek>DreebleK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/29/01 11:22:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Do Unto Others ;)</span><hr size=1> Heya:<br>
<br>
 I suspect that the vast _minority_ of &quot;honest, upstanding, nice&quot; players of EQ subscribe to &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;  I'm naive enough to think that an even smaller minority believes &quot;Do unto others.  First.&quot;  What I think the majority adhere to is &quot;Do unto others as they have done unto you.&quot;  So, what am I talking about here?  If someone griefplays you (bindcamps, trains your raid), then you (generic you, not _you_ specifically) are very likely to do the exact same thing back to them.  They deserved it, after all, right?  And then a friend of theirs does the same thing to you or your friends.  And so on.  Virtually nobody is going to turn the other cheek.  Whenever someone accuses somebody else of cheesy tactics, they'll respond by saying that the same thing was done to their friend five weeks ago by your guildmate.  Or whatever.<br>
<br>
 Honestly, those of you who think you'll never corpse camp somebody, except...  What are the exceptions?  Will people outside the situation causing that exception be aware of it or just think you believe corpse camping is okay?<br>
<br>
 Of course, I'm unlikely to spend more than 5% of my time on SZ so what do I care? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Was actually hoping the Shanks would of come over to make a presence known on Sullon, but did not see anything on the web site.<br>

Hope some of you all come over. Very fun fighting with you all when I was on Vallon for the brief amount of time I was there.<br>

I am on the neutral team, although I am doing what I can not to let who I am get out. I don't see any reason in starting over if I am bringing my old identity with me. <br>
<br>
I am horrible tho. A friend told me his intent to kill a DE cleric that was on the boat to fay. That is something I would have a hard time doing, because I know how horrible boat rides can be, and to get jumped after wasting 30 minutes on a boat is just.. well it is mean. <br>

Granted we are at war, but I have this strange code of ethics I sort of stick to.. or at least that I try to stick to.<br>

<br>
What would be even worse is a dual zoneline camp.  camp both sides and then the ambushee will just get ambushed again if he tries to zone away.  The campers on either side can also warn the other if a group is coming through.  Bad to ambush the first palyer who shows up only to have the other 5 wait 10 seconds and come in after him.<br>
<br>
Yes, passes are good places to ambush someone, but they are also places that (other than in EQ) kingdoms like to build fortresses and place gaurds/custom officers.<br>
Maybe they should have guards randomly spawn and wander in limited areas in Bottleneck zones.  Qeynos guards in the WK/QH pass, Freeport guards in the tunnel in EC, etc...<br>
