A friend of mine got together with his trade skill buddies and they decided they wanted to make a catapult. We loaded up all the stuff and headed to the frontier. When we arrived we found a pitched battle at our fort. I dumped all the supplies on my friend and started resing people with my cleric friend.<br>
<br>
When I ran out of power and got bored of just resing I saw a yellow elf off to the side of their lines a bit. I knew it was a trap but I decided to teach the elf a lesson so I went to the end of our line and ran at him from the side. I started getting pelted with weak arrows about ½ way there and got next to the guy and wacked him for about ½ of his HP in one shot. He started running and the arrows we’re hitting for over 100 HP now so I ran back towards my line. I made it most of the way back and was in res range so my cleric friend resed me.<br>
<br>
I sat down and recovered from this and then go back up and started resing people again. I would inch out and try to get people who died on their side of the battle. Some little orange Lukrien archer decided I was doing something wrong so started following me and pelting me with arrows every time I tried to res from to far out. Well, I was trying to res a guy and the battle shifted and left this little archer all alone. I rushed across the line, took a good shot on the way, but got there and whacked her for about 1/3 of her HP in one shot. She realized she was alone and started to run. I was then being pelted with arrows again so I ran back and made it a bit further across the field before I ate some more dirt.<br>
<br>
I recovered from that res and the battle turned in our favor. We broke their lines and it was general melee. I rushed in and found a half dead orange Firbog that had a round wood shield and proceeded to make him all dead. I guess he was confused. I ran up and he turned to fight. I smacked him and he just stood there then ran after my second hit. I guess I don’t look like a fighter that can take ½ his HP in 3 hits.<br>

I guess they forgot some part. They made it later that evening when Hibernia attacked and I was told they killed about 5 people and wounded many others with one shot.<br>
<br>
I'm just a couple of skill points away from being siege engine part ready with my tailoring. I'm going to put several pieces in the bank which will be accessable at the castles guarding the frontier. Hopefully other people will do that also so siege engines will be readily avaliable to repel attacks and for offensives. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/usnikwah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snikwah</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/6/01 8:06:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My first RvR experiance.</span><hr size=1> Any idea on the cost (assuming 100% sucess) and time that it takes to build one??<br>

<br>
1. The guy firing the catcpult was 20 and he killed a purple con guy in one shot with it. That was the person he was amining at so he knew he dropped him. he saw other bodies there too and clicked on some hurt people around.<br>
<br>
2. Making one engine takes a minimum of 3 different trade skills over 500. I got my tailoring over 500 last night so I can now make the tailoring portions. Stupid first consignment after that was for a new material I have to run to west downs to get.<br>
<br>
3. I was told that a catapult costs around 30 gold to make. You have to be very careful with them to. If you leave them cocked to long they will break.<br>
<br>
4. The person firing the catapult gets the Realm points for all killing blows it does.<br>
<br>
5. The range is longer than bow range. He was able to hit people standing in a group across the field out of our archers bow range. No idea what the max range is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=181.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showNextMessage?topicID=181.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.emailToFriend?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.threadControl?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14>Other Games</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
