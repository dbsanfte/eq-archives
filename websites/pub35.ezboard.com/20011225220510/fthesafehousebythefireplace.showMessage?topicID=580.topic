Her quest has been a long one. For five seasons now, she has sought redemption and her journey was finally coming to an end. Touching the pouch at her side, making sure the gems were still there, she smiled. Not a smile that would chill a hardened mans blood cold, but a smile that was truly enlightened, one that was more in tune with her Wood Elf heritage.<br>
<br>
 'Of course they are, no rogue has tried my pocket in a while.’ She giggled and thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Reflecting upon how she got to this point in her life, she was amused at what Lon the Redeemed had told her. He simply stated that the path to redemption would be found before its end. He had given her, what she thought was a simple task at the time, a quest that has taken her around the world.<br>
<br>
'You were right, Lon, I do not feel the need to finish the quest, but I am honor bound and it will be done.' Honor, interesting, not a thought Cat had entertained before.<br>
<br>
Much like rapids winding down a mountain side, Cats' life was fast paced and turbulent at times. She had made some bad choices in her youth. Choices that got her exiled from the Scouts of Tunare and her home of Kelethin. Tylfon had called her a selfish, spoiled little brat, comparing her to a human and stating she was not worthy of the Elven blood within her.<br>
<br>
It was true, her intentions at the start of the quest were selfish. She had heard of the legendary Burning Rapier and knew she had to have it. Thinking that Lon was weak minded and blinded by his faith in the Temple of Solusek Ro, she thought bluffing her intentions for redemption would be a simple matter. But the trails and tribulations of the quest had an impact on Cats’ life. She was transformed along the way.<br>
<br>
With a renewed spring in her step and a smile on her face, she made her way into the Southern Desert of Ro. Here she would find Ortallius, the one she must deliver the gems to.<br>
<br>
'Welcome, Katiana. Please have a seat', Ortallius gestured at a wooden stool by the campfire.<br>
<br>
'How is it you know who I am?', she replied, not having been called by her real name in quite some time. The locals of Freeport always referred to her as Cat the stray Elf.<br>
<br>
'I know all about you Katiana or do you prefer Cat?’ He chuckled.<br>
<br>
Blushing and with tears in her eyes, she replied, 'I've not been called Katiana in quite some time. But it is sweet to my ears.'<br>
<br>
‘Well done, Katiana. Let me see the gems, then.’ Ortallius was not one for small talk it seems.<br>
<br>
Cat reached into her pouch and handed over the gems. Not even looking at them, he proceeded to his tent and came back out with an elongated wooden box. ‘I was instructed to give this to you upon completion of your quest.’<br>
<br>
It was one of those moments in life that just seemed unreal. Opening the box she found inside a weapon which she knew was the Burning Rapier. Its metal scabbard was tinted with rainbow colors, as if it had been heated over a hot fire. Drawing the rapier from its scabbard, it fit perfectly in her hand. It was well balanced and light weight, as if it had been made just for her.<br>
<br>
‘It is a fine blade’, Ortallius noted.<br>
<br>
‘I’ve never seen its equal’, she replied. ‘But I can not accept it.’<br>
<br>
Smiling at her he said, ‘It is not a weapon, Katiana, but a symbol to wear proudly. It marks the turning point in your life. You know it as well as I, you are not the same person, for you have found redemption. Your journey now takes you on a road for the greater good. Practice your arts and prepare yourself for evil approaches our realm.’<br>
<br>
Still not convinced, Cat closed the box and kneeled before Ortallius, ‘Please give it to someone who is worthy and can champion the cause for good.’<br>
<br>
‘Gromaldi saw goodness in your heart and helped you defeat Lynada the Exiled. Flicx, Ereana and Zeila, did they not take a moment in their lives to help you with the Hemo Enologist in Mistmoore castle? Do you believe Stasis would have invited you to join the Knights of Eternity, if your intentions were not good? And Muladar, always at your side and willing to help you, is he not standing over there now, smiling proudly at your accomplishment?’<br>
<br>
‘Those folks saw in you, the potential to do what was right and good. They do not reflect upon your past, only the future that you now have. Why should you?’ Stated Ortallius.<br>
<br>
Katiana knew in her heart that Ortallius spoke the truth. Taking the rapier from its box and attaching it to her belt, she bowed before him and turned to walk away.<br>
<br>
‘Return home, Katiana the Redeemed. Your home . . . of Kelethin’<br>
<br>
&lt;ooc&gt; Well, I’m not a writer, so please don’t laugh, but I just wanted to announce the completion of my Redemption Quest in a different way. Hope you enjoyed it, and please excuse my grammatical errors.<br>
