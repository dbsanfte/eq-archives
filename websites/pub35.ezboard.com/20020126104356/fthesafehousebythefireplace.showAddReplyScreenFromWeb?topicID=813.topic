<br>
<br>
::  relaxing in the slowing cooling heat of the dreadlands Tenlar muses over a letter he recieved.  Tucking it into his pack he stands and stretches his tight muscles, rubbing his neck to work a kink out of it.  Starting to yawn he almost chokes and doubles over as the words <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   “WAR in the Great Divide” </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are forced into his brain from one of his oldest friends.  Quickly the rogue starts looking for a Traslocate to the dwarven city.  Sending the words back <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   “I’m on my way abbil.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Upon finding a translocate the rogue pays the wizard for the services and is sent hurtling through space and time to the coldness of the underground city of ice.   Retrieving his bow and some hastily made arrows he runs for the city gates into the Great Divide to search for his friend.  Skidding to a halt the rogue freezes in his tracks as a wave of fear encases him.  The sight he beholds is something he has not seen in quite some time.  The bodies laying sprawled over the snow covered ground, the masses of giants in the distance as they form up to attack.   He hears behind him a dwarf shouting and then a punch into the small of his back::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     “Well inkie you going in or you a coward like these others standing here? “<br>
“I’m heading in dwarf don’t get yer armor in kinks I just needed some bearings and to hear the orders from my friends.”<br>
“Well then get yer arse in the fight and don’t waste anymore time them big guys aren’t gonna be standing in the distance for much longer.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
:: turning the dwarf begins shouting orders out over the battlefield to his troops::<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     “For the DAIN, All those able gather to me.  Slaughter the enemies none shall pass into our great city”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
:: quickly the rogue heads out in search of his friends in the battle.  Stoping to take aim with his bow and letting a couple arrows loose into the on coming giants.  Finding Shazanti he quickly embraces her and turns out looking at the dwarfs and his friends of other families regrouping for the next wave of giants.  The corpses littering the snow turning it a deep crimson as the blood flows from the fallen.  Involuntarily the rogue shudders remembering once a war between and old family and another.  The ground of the East Commonlands dyed crimson from the blood of the slain.::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Abbil? Ten you okay?”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ::the necromancer asks::<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”I’m fine just remembering the battle between Pandie and KoHS.  What should I do to help here, now, in this war?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ::turning to face the necromancer his face now set his jaw firm his eyes brimming with the fire at the thought of looting and killing::<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Don’t run away if they are chasing you.  Fall in the throws of death, and a cleric will rezz ye if ye do die.  Be Careful Ten.  Hide and sneak if you can it might be best so you don’t get into trouble.”<br>
“Thanks abbil I’ll be okay”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ::with a evil grin the rogue runs into the fray skidding to a stop as he almost runs over a mentor of his.  Bowing swiftly::<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Cryus me mentor, tis yer family aiding in this war?”<br>
“Aye,  now keep yer head down, and assist Rummik is ye came to help otherwise stay in the shadows and keep silent.  I must get back in, take care”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::with a proud look on his face the Assassin ducks into the combat his Ragebringer slicing deep into the giants.  Tenlar quickly joins his mentor’s side the Jagged Ice Shard in his own hand landing a deadly Baskstab.  His pride growing fast in him he lets his family know.::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Talth there’s a war in the Great Divide come watch or help if ye wish.  This is cool.”<br>
“War? I’m there” </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> :: came the reply of the erudite Carsaidian, as he quickly teleported himself over and finding a nice vantage point to watch the battle and throwing in a couple of spells from time to time::<br>
<br>
:: As the rogues rapier strikes a blow into the calf of the might giant time seems to slow down.  The giant turns slowly as Ten looks up a loud Roar is heard over the deafening blows of the battle as the great sword begins a downward arc aimed for the rogue.  Only able to stand in awe the rogue watches as the sword cleaves into his shoulder almost splitting him in twain.  Rolling backwards and standing the best he can he watches as the giant returns to fight those around him.  Limping slowly toward the safety of Thurgadin and hopefully a cleric to heal his mortal wound before it is to late.  In what seemed like an hour he reaches the gate and attempts to bandage what is left of his body.  When he hears another roar and the words “You will NOT ESCAPE ME ROGUE.”  In a blink of an eye Ten is summoned to the giant that all but killed him, only this time the blow lands true and the he is slain and falls to the crimson snow.::<br>
<br>
:: Watching as the world spins up to him he begins to close his eyes knowing he will be going to the afterlife and home to the side Bristlebane.  Bristlebane has other plans for Ten at the moment.  Smiling down on the dark elf, he waves his hand and sends the rogue back into Thurgadin with the words <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”It’s not yer time.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  With renewed life and vigor Tenlar appears at the gates to Thurgadin.  Shaking his head to regain his bearings he makes his way to his corpse, and with great speed dons his armor and other gear so that he can return to the fray of battle.  Taking a more careful fight he sets himself down onto one of the guard towers and launches arrows into the fray.  A dwarf archer looks over at the rogue and smiles glad to have another on the tower to lend aide.  Suddenly Ten realizes the horror of what’s happening.  The plan to defend has gone wrong.  A mighty giant the leader of the army appears.  His giant lance probably 6 times as long as Ten is tall.  The battle becomes a route, as those defending the city fall one by one, almost as quickly as they can return to the battle they are slain.  The snow becomes even darker as the layer of bodies grows deeper and the blood seeps farther down the snowy incline before the gates, the river now blood instead of water flows away from the gates.::<br>
<br>
:: A shout is heard and the rogue slips into the shadows knowing his life would be better spared to help the wounded later then to become wounded himself.  He watches silently as the giant’s breach the gates bowing his head silently and praying to Bristlebane to lend his aide to the dwarves.  A laugh is heard echoing through the valley as the giant leader shouts orders to his men::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ” Slaughter all those that fight, heard up those that don’t fight. March them to our home so they will become our slaves. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
:: Holding his breath in silence and keeping every muscle in his body locked and tight to avoid detection, he watches in grim horror as the dwarvern city is overran and then marched off to become slaves.  After an hour or so he moves into the ice city to survey the destruction and hopefully to find survivors.  As he walks the now silent halls the clicking of his boot heels echo eerily through the halls.  The once splended halls of shining ice now covered in gore and blood.  The corpse’s of the fallen lay in pieces around the city.  Following the path around the city he enters Ice Wall, the home of the Dain.  What befalls his eyes as he enters the courtyard will haunt him for the rest of his life.  Bodies displayed on the walls of the palace.  Pinned to the stone by their own weapons.  The Dain slaughtered and lain broken at the base of his throne.  The battle outside and the deaths of his comrades had shown nothing of the ferocity of the giant’s hatred towards the dwarves, but this display sends chills down the hardened rogue’s spine.  Finding a corner the rogue’s knees buckle under him and he wretches his senses shutting down.  Standing and wiping his mouth on a piece of cloth he returns to the gates of the once grand city and sets down hard his ebon skin paled from the battle and the scene of horror in the city.::<br>
<br>
:: shaking his head to clear his mind he realizes what luck has befallen him.  The thought of loot enters his brain, the rogue side of him taking control.  Quickly he stands and runs back into the horror of Thurgadin.  With deft fingers he loots the corpse’s only to find broken weapons and useless shields.  He keeps one shield as a momento to the night.  What bad luck he realizes now, no coin to find and nothing else of use to be found on the slaughtered.  Sighing heavily he returns to the gates and settles in for the night to sleep.  Finding a clean area he sets up his camp and sleeps.  The world around him is silent.:: <br>
