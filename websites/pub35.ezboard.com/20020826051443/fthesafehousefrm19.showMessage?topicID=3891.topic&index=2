<br>
I don't normally respond to posts like yours.  However, this time I had to thank you for taking the time to write such an insightful post regarding my name.  However, there is the off chance that despite your apparent intelligence you assumed that I didn't mean what I was saying.  I get the feeling that you thought I was upset about camo.  <br>
<br>
To be clear on my first note, it was made in response to the letter written to Elaa.  I am sure given the depth of your response, that you have read that letter.  Mythic very clearly stated that they felt all of the assassin classes were perceived by the public to be overpowered.  In the past, mythic has shown itself to be a slave to public opinion and in fact nerfed classes based on public opinion.  This to me states, lookout there might be more nerfs in the near future.   If we continue to be nerfed, I could see us end up light tanks that can scout some.  I hope that doesn't happen.  I like playing an assassin.<br>
<br>
I would love it if droves of archers come back.  I am going to guess that you didn?t play when archers were the uber class, because I don't see nearly the number of archers I saw then.  I don't see them on my who list and I don't fight them in rvr.<br>
<br>
I would also like archers to be extremely successful in rvr.  I think it would be a great boon for the assassin class if the public has someone else to complain about.  The public does complain..constantly.  I happened on eq so much that they had to change the way they did boards.  I don't even bother trolling the vn boards outside my server board and I don't read these boards as often as I used to.  <br>
<br>
The problem is that mythic responds to these complaints.  This is evident based on the nerfs to sbs.  It is now apparently according to Elaa and several other posters that the perceived power of sbs was due in fact to buffbots.<br>
<br>
I think as it stands assassins are very viable and I have stated that in the past.  I have fought and won against quite a few classes.  I have also fought and lost against quite a few classes.  This does not mean that we are all on equal footing.  It does mean that we, as a whole, are at this time probably the most powerful &quot;class&quot; in rvr.  I think we could use some competition.  It is not at all odd for the assassins to be the only people who live through a total group wipeout.  People see that and they can't be happy.  Mythic is very aware of that fact.  This could simply lead to more nerfs for us.<br>
<br>
In like kind, I wanted to add that I also really enjoyed your post on the statues of pvp on the Mordred server.  I can't recall the exact words, but it was something like, &quot;Hey everyone, Mordred really is pvp.  Kthx.&quot;  I think the Safehouse community really benefited from this insightful post.  I suspect that there were many people who post and lurk here who had no idea that Mordred was pvp.  In fact, I bet they even got to level 10.2 without being ganked and were surprised when someone killed them.  Thanks to you, that won't happen anymore!<br>
<br>
I can tell that we have a similar level of respect for each other.  I have to say that I have read some of your posts before and found them informative and even intelligent.  Do you by chance share this account?<br>
<br>
M.<br>

It has upped their survivability but it hs not in any way &quot;nerfed See Hidden&quot;.  You still have to drop it for a set amount of time b4 you can attack and it still is on a 10 min timer after.  All this has realy done is give them a better chance to survive.<br>
<br>
 I agree fully with the Caster comment;  Air spec Theurgists can now compitently defend keeps solo.  They have stunning pets, mezz/stun, can nuke rapid chain cast for 800+.<br>
<br>
 With the advent of patch 1.52 a-where ever it ends, DAoC has gone and done the exact opposite of what  was done in AC.  Wherein AC made melee way overpowered, Caster (espscially Albion caster) are now capable of taking out multiple targets in very brief amounts of time without getting anywhere near being in harms way.<br>
<br>
 Camo is imo a welcome addition, the armour respecs will make things alot different (for smaller group RvR) but try to imagine the fact that soon after patch goes live, you can be getting nuked at max range for 800+ every second and add pets that stun+mezz and or stun.<br>
<br>
 What Mythic has done above all else is insure that Albion has the best class in the game for RvR/PvE and that soon anyone who is unhappy with class they are playing but still plays the game will all switch to A-Spec Theurg's which can now solo red con in PvE solo with little down time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravnnevermoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravn Nevermoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 12:18:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3891.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nope</span><hr size=1> Hey, I'm dropping see hidden and getting dodger 5 instead. <p>Ravn Nevermoor<Br>50 infiltrator<Br>Aeonian Prophecy<BR>NERF PBAE AND BUFFBOTS!!!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubisqit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bisq it</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 1:00:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3891.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nope</span><hr size=1> Dont drop SH.<br>

I am sure you are right.  I think it was a misunderstanding.  However where he could have asked he decided to flame.  I just returned the favor.<br>

I probably could have written the first post a bit better.  However it was late and I had just read that note and I really am a bit worried about it.  I hear a lot of complaining by people about us.  I suspect we are in for another round with the nerf bat.<br>

Keep it cos not many archers are going to be smart enough to attack once then retreat for 10 mins till the camo timer is refreshed.<br>
Keep it cos there are still alot of archers in the game and those numbers may grow.<br>
Keep it cos it makes your job alot easier and you're gimping yourself by dropping it.<br>
Its 8 measely points.Keep it or regret it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukooch2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kooch2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/6/02 7:14:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3891.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nope</span><hr size=1> Or ditch it and be earn your rps like in the old days, I personally enjoy hunting down rangers/hunters with only detect hidden.<br>
<br>
It keeps you sharp, while running around stealthed.  Youre ever vigilant for that glimpse of a shadowed figure that passes you in the night.  I cant tellya how many cat and mouse hunts Ive been on cause a archer and I have crossed paths in the shadows and went on a scamper to find eachother. Actually they were running and I was hunting but it was much more fun then running up to them and popping them without them having any sota chance.<br>
<br>
The archers out there now I can respect because they know next to everyone has see hidden, but they still come out and play.  Its out of respect for those archers,that didnt buy into the im gimped beyond belief by see hidden, that I dont get this skill that removes all skill from the hunter and the hunted.<br>
<br>
But this is my personal reasoning and dont expect everyone to value the samethings that I do.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3891.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3891.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3891.topic&index=11><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3891.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3891.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3891.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3891.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
