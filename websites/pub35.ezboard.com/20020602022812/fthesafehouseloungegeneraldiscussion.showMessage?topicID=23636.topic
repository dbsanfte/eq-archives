Another guildmate of him was in the group, too. Suddenly he said, he will leave (I thought he as to log or sth), then he said no, he will stay and after a while he left, leaving his guildmate behind. His guildmate is a very close friend of me and we had quite some fun in the group. <br><br>After I did a /who in the zone, I recognized the rogue was still in the zone, but he went to ledge group. Ugh... I felt a bit bad now.... like friends that do not come to your party, though they promised to come, but they have found a better party now. <br><br>I talked to my friend in the group and found out, that he would leave the group, too, ledge was too good for exp, but he would stay if his leaving would cripple the group. <br><br>After a while a warrior left our group for ledge group.<br><br>I would not leave my group, but for one reason... if there are no friends in the group and my friends are in Velks, too, and have a spot free. I would even leave ledge behind for a sad exp spot if my friends were there...<br><br>What do you think... when would you leave your group... please be honest to yourself and me. I really want to know if my thought on this are too idealistic. Is it normal that peeps leave guildmates behind just for better exp or or loot?<br><br>I mean... this is a game... when some pixels are more important than the humans behind their chars.... is humanity doomed?

Of course he didn't stay to help fight up to zone in.<br> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163097">Hagin Netherblade</a><br>&lt;<a href="http://www.thunder.at">Thunder</a>&gt;<br>58th level Barbarian Blackguard<br>Innoruuk Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shourt>Shourt </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/02 9:48:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23636.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Leave the group for better exp?</span><hr size=1>  i generally wont leave a group, ( excluding when guild raids happenor when good rl friends log on). i wont leave a group because i have such trouble finding groups that any exp=good exp in my book. im told in the upper 50s rogues can find groups preatty easy but since im not there yet i wouldnt know *crosses fingers* <p>Shourt Cutt53 Rogue- Berttoxxolous </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uazradenz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azraden Z</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/02 10:08:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23636.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> Floor group in velks is nothing but a waiting list for a better group imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uandrewbb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AndrewBB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/02 11:58:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23636.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~dnorris/impman.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Sometimes I feel like a broken record...<br><br>&quot;The problem is, you were in Velk's.&quot;<br><br>Now I haven't been to Velk's in a while, but when I did go, it exactly captured the feeling of being in a newbie group with an alt (people in/out all the time, etc.) It's just one of those things. You go into Velk's, typically you're just about grinding out some experience. And since it's safe as houses to run from one part of the zone to another, there's no need to keep the group together.<br><br>Admittedly, I don't leave groups once I'm in them, unless I'm done hunting for the night (my main is an enchanter, and I know you can hunt a lot of places without an enchanter, but I stay away from those places). I play to be with my friends/acquaintances, though, so if I was in a pickup group in a 'grind spot' where I was easily replaceable, and friends logged in wanting to hunt, I'd give notice. I'd never go the other way, though. <br><br>To the original poster, if your play style is such that you want to keep a group together and cohesive, you're better off in any dungeon situation where you need to bring your own group (Sebilis, Chardok, Howling Stones, etc.) Velks isn't a very dangerous zone, so people often don't take it seriously.<br> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81313">Andrewe the Imp</a> -Lvl 57 Enchanter, Bristlebane [Cry of War]</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustripebl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>stripe bl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/02 1:01:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23636.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Shouldn't people do what is fun for them and enjoy the GAME?<br><br>Since it seems we are basically talking about pick-up groups, people should not have unrealistic expectations of people coming and going.

But honestly, we should not feel bad.  There is nothing wrong with it.<br><br>I don't think we should limit our own enjoyment of the game by projecting that are leaving a group may create a minor inconvience for someone else.

(If it were a guild raid, I'd expect to know in advance anyways.)<br>I'll leave if the people are annoying/incompetant.  To be honest, you need to be pretty damn incompetant before I'll actually go but I'm unlikely to group with you again in any hurry.<br>I'll arrange to leave if friends are hunting somewhere and have a spot for me.  That means I'll stay until then and it also doesn't come up all that often.  We can communicate in /tells pretty well anyways =)<br>I'll once-in-a-blue-moon need to leave *now* for some emergency in real life.  I can't say it comes up exactly often but that's why I carry gate potions.  I hate, hate, hate this one but life is like that at times.<br><br>As to the floor/uppers migration in Velk's... well, I've done it often.  I am always extremely clear on what is going on though.  A floor group is only slightly better than soloing or sitting at the camp that you are interested in anyways.  And on that note, I haven't been back to Velk's in a while.  Heck, I'm starting to think that OS is better than that place =p <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Assassin of The Nameless<br></font></b><font color=CYAN size=2><i>"The reverse side also has a reverse side." - Japanese Proverb</i> </font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublazingsword.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blazingsword</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/02 3:00:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23636.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Leave the group for better exp?</span><hr size=1> Ok first off there is no honor in EQ.

I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> hate</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> this zone and will never look for a pickup group here.  Village is fine.  Killing spiders on the ramps or floor blows however.  If the zone gets remotely crowded you end up in stupid disputes with other groups about which group owns which spider spawns /sigh.<br><br>And I hate KC almost as much as Velks.<br><br>&quot;...where you need to bring your own group (Sebilis, Chardok, Howling Stones, etc.) &quot;<br><br>I don't know about your server but on mine Sebilis is one of the Big Three pickup zones (Velks and KC being the other two).  I like Seb and it is (imho) the premier pickup zone in the game.  I've hunted in Chardok a few times and quite like it but its much harder to get a pickup group there.  I love HS.  Definitely BYO group though.<br><br>When I group I have an intended minimum commitment of 2 hours to the group.  If I have less than 2 hours I generally won't play.  Between looking for a group, getting in one, hunting for a bit and then leaving its generally not worth my time.  What pisses me off is when people leave after half to one hour in a group when they had no intention of staying any longer.  Some of these know in advance thats how long they've got and they won't tell you because they know it'll reduce the chances of an invite (rightly so).  Like people who hunt for 45 minutes on a lunch break.  Argh, go away.

There is virtually nothing I could possibly get in a pickup group that I can claim NBG on and I dont care....  If a group member is sitting there in a Crystalline Robe and a FBCR drops in Disco, I'm not going to watch some druid random on it for sale in EC or to put on a twink.
