I find that fair and also a good solution where alternatives have time to &quot;mature&quot; a bit should it be necessary to relocate the board.. The original quote ezboard wanted for 6 months was not resembling fair or even sane though, with 20gig/month and some cpu/disk load I find last years price ($1500 for 12 months was it ?) plenty. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

<br>
Being in the web hosting and IT field, it seems that the whole thread on the forum needing to be changed from EZBoard to a new home is being taken to intensely.<br>
<br>
While, I understand that MB's forum and site is a heavy hitting website, and is quit comparable to an mediocre e-comm site. But, the 20GB bandwidth, or few thousand hits its getting a day, from a hosting standpoint really isn't anything. I do all sorts of hosting, from small sites that don't even take 1GB a month of b/w to over 600GB a month adult sites. I thought I would give my suggestions to the community as an old monk.<br>
<br>
A very good server/hosting provider that I used is Rackshack, I'm sure some of you are familiar with them. 99$ a month servers with 400GB a month bandwidth, around 60GB storage, 256mb RAM I believe and a ton of software bundled with the Control Panel (Ensim/Plesk - Ensim recomended) Runs on Redhat 7.3 now I believe. The servers are unmanaged though, so someone with Linux experience, or someone good with instructions and fast at learning would be a must have. VBulletin license is highly recomended. They provide a secure service, great tech support, and patches, mods all sorts of stuff to their cleints. I believe thats about 160$ But this right here is all you would need for this site. AND You would be able to cover not only overhead, but probably some profit through name-based hosting off the Rackshack server.<br>
<br>
It doesn't take duel 2100 CPU's and a scsi array and 1GB of ram to host a website, even a heavy hitting website. The big issues with running a site are bandwidth and disk access speed. Ram is only a consideration for heavy hits on RDBMS's that reserve memory, and I don't believe MySQL does.<br>
<br>
You could offer hosting to the community, for personal sites, for guild websites, for whatever else for a small fee, and this would help cover that monthly charge. And it wouldn't be like taking a donation because people would be paying for a service. Also you could give supporters yournick@monkly-business.com email addresses, their own monkly-business.com/~username/ websites through ensim is really easy. Theres alot of incintives that could not only keep MB alive, but make it prosper and grow beyond what it is now.<br>
<br>
Zad I know doesn't want to run this place anymore, but with the right setup, and the the mods doing their great job, there wouldnt be much that needed to be done from him.<br>
<br>
IF ... you ARE worried about system performace ... then I would NOT suggest Linux hosting. And theres a reason ... the database. While MySQL is by far growing to be one of the best RDBMS's out there, MSSQL 7/2k still has many advantages performance wise over MySQL. Clustering indexes, views and stored procedures over direct table handling, cascading updates/deletes (2k), referencial data integrity, the list really goes on for a long while. From using Windows 2k AS hosting and Redhat 7.3 hosting personally, I can atest to the diferences in them of course, but stability and performance are in opinion at least, matched.<br>
<br>
So all in all ... my suggestion to the community. Get a server from Rackshack, get a license from VBulletin, start taking orders from the community for hosting or whatever other services you wanted to offer (it would take a whole 10 members paying 10$ a month for say 200mb of storage and 15GB transfer a month to cover overhead) and get MB in a secure spot where you dont have to deal with these EZBoard *insert wonderful thing about EZBoard Employee reading this post here* <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also in response to Zad's response on the other topic. I don't know why you think Debian is any more secure than Redhat ... They all run about the same software as it is, and Redhat is by far MUCH more supported in terms of technical issues and support. RPM's are the fastest and easiest way to update software also. Redhat has really become the standard for the majority of web hosting. In my professional opinion, I would go with Redhat over Debian or Suse or OpenBSD or anything else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uizzoe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izzoe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 906<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/21/02 12:54:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32147.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/fatbastarddance.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monkly Business and ezboard.</span><hr size=1> He mentioned the safehouse in another post, so EZBoard obviously realizes the correlation of EQ and these boards.

<br>
I have noticed it very recently and i do not remember changing my details or my IE settings or anything in the last 6 months.<br>
<br>
I turn my PC on and I turn my PC off, thats about all I ever do.<br>
<br>
And I am still logged in on other boards, doesn't seem to matter how often I log into EZboard I always find I am logged out again when I come back.  Seems to happen only at monkly too, on my server easy board I am logged in...but to be honest I generally come here before I go there, and I don't log out within a session.<br>
<br>
Now is this some sly attempt to up the total number of hits a board gets?<br>
<br>
I mean, I come here I read a couple of posts, I see one that I can add something to so I post, then I realise as I hit reply that its no good I am not logged in, you may have seen odd posts around the place where my sig is missing where I didn't bother to log in, but sometimes I do.<br>
<br>
This involves going to the main page, and hitting a link 1 extra hit, login, come back to main page, another extra hit, get to the thread you just visited, another hit, and make your post...not sure but I expect this probably counts as another hit.<br>
<br>
Thats 4 extra hits everytime I come here each day, now if this is happening to even a few more people, thats an awful lot of extra hits a site will be taking.<br>
<br>
Course it could just be me, which would be an entirely different matter. <p><center>Fong Sai'Yuk --
