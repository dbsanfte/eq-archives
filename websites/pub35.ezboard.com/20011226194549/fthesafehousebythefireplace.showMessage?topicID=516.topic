I acknowledge that.  That said, I have a story to tell and there is a lesson within, so listen well.<br>
My guild and I decided that Mistmoor Castle was a nice enough spot for a gathering, but there was the pesky matter of the local inhabitants to deal with.  Well, some of the paladins needed gargoyle granite and I figured if I saw the Avenging Catiff that I'd look for a new hat.  I take five companions and stake out the graveyard, seeing as how we could handle what resided there in combat and little that we couldn't handle wouldn't come to disturb us.  We made a good impact on the initiates and such that showed up, but the two paladins in the group were the ones who needed the granite.  Since the gargoyles weren't IN the graveyard, we had others keep an eye out for when they found some granite.  The stuff, apparently, is undroppable, so you had to take what you'd use and leave what you couldn't.<br>
After a while the call came down that indeed some granite was found.  So one of my trusty dwarf friends has me show him the way to the castle gates where the rock was.  I had to lead him, because I was about the only guildmember who knew his way around the Castle grounds (seeing as how I had cased the place out before when I stole my blood spirits).  We get him his granite and trudge back down the hill to the graveyard.<br>
A length of time later the call came again, more granite.  So I lead my OTHER holy dwarf pal up the hill again in hopes of getting his prize.  Again, he plucked the stone from the gargoyle's rocky corpse.  Then, everything went wrong.  A guildmate had badly pulled something in the vicinity of the gypsy dance hall and had quite the collection of vampires and dark elves following him out the front door of the castle.  He led them away from me and my dwarf companion and towards the entrance to the castle grounds.<br>
At this point I knew we were in trouble.  On our way up, we had passed deathly ushers who could kill us more quickly than I care to think on, but we were invisible (thanks to our friend the enchanter).  Now however, he was visible, and while I could hide, he could not.  We rapidly debated if he could make it back to the group in the graveyard safely.  We decided that that was too risky (especially considering that they were screaming for help as some of the vampires had started chasing THEM.   Well, options became fewer as time was ticking away.  I finally presented him with the best of our bad choices... a rogue evac.<br>
Now, he had never heard of this, and while time was short, I quickly explained it to him.  A rogue evac works like this.  Step one, the rogue (me) kills his companion in a duel to the death.  While this is painful, and more than a bit humiliating, it is MUCh better than being killed by a vampire or some such.  Step two, I (the rogue) get permission to drag his corpse.  I then proceed to sneak and hide, and drag his corpse to a suitably safe location.  At this point, he come to that safe location and loots his belongings.  By doing this, I save not only his gear, but his experience and reputation.<br>
Now, at first he didn't think much of this idea, but time was growing far too short to make any other plan.  He agreed to my idea and proceeded to turn his back.  To make the process as short as possible (and hopefully as painless as possible) I asked him to sit down, and to continue to sit after each hit.  This may sound like a strange request, but in truth, one does much more damage to a resting target than a standing one.<br>
Well, my friend died to my blades and I hid.  Within 5-10 seconds following this, what should walk up the path but a few deathly ushers, a will sapper and a few gypsies.  We had completed that part of the operation JUST in time.  When I recieved permisson to move his body, I took it all the way to the border between Mistmoor and the Lesser Faydark.  While most of the party who died fleeing that group of unmentionables were upset, my friend was the only one who was actually glad he died, and thankful to the one that killed him.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

(edit: in case you're wondering, yes this did indeed happen, and yes, I'm OBVIOUSLY not a bard as I can't tell a story to save my neck) <p></FONT><P><img src=http://www.aug.edu/~stu08957/afton.jpg><p>
