One for SBs, one for Infs.<br>
<br>
SB<br>
36 Stealth<br>
39 Axe<br>
34 Crit<br>
44 LA<br>
20 Env<br>
<br>
Inf<br>
36 Stealth<br>
50 Thrust<br>
34 Crit<br>
28 DW<br>
38 Env<br>
<br>
Although markedly different at points, these specs are actually very similar.  The SB will get Doublefrost (34)--his best non CS style--and his LA skill is high enough to be &quot;satisfacory.&quot;  The Infil gets his best non-CS style with Dragonfang (50), and his DW spec is good.  The difference between these two assassins is the poison ability, which is much higher in the Inf, thus allowing him access to Lifebane.  The Shadowblade, although he has a lower envenom  spec, will still have access to decent poisons, easily accessing Lesser Lethal Venom, attaining Major Lethal Venom at about realm rank 5 or 6 (lot of hard work for that), and theoretically eventually having access to Greater Lethal Venom (unlikely at best for most Shadowblades).<br>
<br>
Additionally, the Inf will probably have a slightly higher Weaponskill due to the ability to use str/dex based weapons.  The SB will have slightly higher hitpoints (again, admittedly, ~1 HP/Level is not enough).<br>
<br>
In this scenario, we will call the ability to choose between slash and thrust, and the inherent ability to use a 2h weapon &quot;balanced&quot;--neither of the above assassins has really specialized to exercise these options.  Note, however, that if the above Inf decides to use slash even though he has not trained it, and the SB uses a 2h weapon, the SB will be far more effective in combat.<br>
<br>
One of the points I wanted to make was that some SBs constantly mention how wonderful Dragonfang is and how powerful 2.5x and its resulting 453 spec points is.  What doesn't seem to be considered very often is that to raise the thrust spec from a solid (yet style-starved) 39 to 50 eats up 495 spec points.<br>
<br>
Just some more to chew on. <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubaym.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baym</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 12:23:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Assassin Balance Revisted:</span><hr size=1> Please explain why an infiltrator would train DW to 28.<br>
<br>
If you trained DW to 10, you would have roughly 350 spec pts to put into other places. There was several tests done by Elaa and someone else whose name I forgot (I think Drunkenkay maybe) showed that 10 DW/CD was better than 34 LA as far as base damage goes. Of course, LA style damage is better but then again that probably evens out the style damage and benefits of 50 Thrust (versus 34 or 39 slash for the SB). Those 350 spec pts turn into quicker access to higher level poisons, more stealth, allowing more items that boost CS or more CS.<br>
<br>
Please explain to me how this does not show that infiltrators are not only more flexible, but also more powerful. In your analysis, you even point out that the SB will get those poisons at realm rank 5, 6 or 7. Are you saying that a Realm rank 7 SB is = Realm Rank 1 Infiltrator? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lakeb>Lakeb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 12:41:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> balance vs. quality</span><hr size=1> I don't really think the classes will ever be balanced.  I do think they are all viable and I presume they are all fun to play.  I would like the NS spell to do 2x the damage it does now, but that might make us pass both of the other assassins.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if the shout just did 2x damage, since it is on a 10 second timer and is fairly short range, it would not be unbalancing.  One problem is that I have to break stealth to use the spell so it will only be useful if my enemy is running away from me.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I am not unhappy with the Nightshade class.  I don't feel gimped at all, just slightly lacking in pizzaz.  We are the white bread assassin class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ukraq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KraQ</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 2:11:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: balance vs. quality</span><hr size=1> Personly I think that Nightshades should have a more magical feel to them.  giving them a spec line with a few tricks that are weak compaired to its equivelents in othere spec lines would go a long way.<br>
<br>
Shadowblades should have a more mellee feel to them.  Maybee giving them a shield spec line or the ability to spec hammers.<br>
<br>
Now of corse that leaves infintrators.  I say give them a traps spec line much like envenom thats basicly a true false check to see if they could use a given trap.<br>
<br>
but thats just my crazy idea for the moment.  and if you dont like it .. then wait a few minutes. <p>----------<BR>
