He had met Jezeran here to further her training. She, however, seemed more intent on seeking out those in need of help rather than concentrating on honing her skills. Truth be told, she was a fearsome fighter, and skilled healer as well. Her mentors must be proud.<br>
<br>
Yet she seems so driven. Never happy with her performance, always critical of herself. Ohhh she had never said so. But it showed. Jezeran was skilled at many things, but hiding her emotions was not one of them. Though the range seemed narrow: pride, scorn, satisfaction, or dissatisfaction, occasionally a happy smile, they were as apparent as if she spoke them out loud. Writ large upon her knitted brow or lips.<br>
<br>
The large lizard fell under her sword. Her brow relaxing, lips turning up just a bit, eyes keen, yet distant. She was relatively happy with her fighting today it seemed. Grim satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Minz gazed into her face, as he had done so often lately. A pang of something in his chest. Just as always though, she seemed elsewhere. Her mind so focused that he could stare at her all day, and she might not see him.<br>
<br>
Windam was coming to join them. The younger sister of Windamaii was growing so fast. Her skill, seemed to be stronger each time he saw her.<br>
<br>
As if hearing his thoughts, she arrived over the dune. Giggling at something. Their hunt was fruitful. Minz would find the larger crocodiles and gators, getting them angry enough to chase him, back to Jez and Wind. He would let the young ladies finish the beast off, occasionally reminding the beast that he should leave the girls alone and focus his biting and clawing on the rogue.<br>
<br>
Of course, his lack of pants was a draw back. Good thing he was nimble!!<br>
<br>
Another fell under a burst of fire Wind some how summoned. Singeing the hair on his legs. The sat a moment.<br>
<br>
"I need to run to the Inn," Wind said. "I'll be back in a bit." Dashing off.<br>
<br>
Jez sat staring out at the ocean, distant eyes. He wanted to tell her. Having grown very fond of the young paladin over the past few weeks. But it didn't seem that she shared his feelings.<br>
<br>
Improve battle skills...Serve Erollisi. These things seemed all she was concerned about.<br>
<br>
She turned to him as he sat down next to her. Her eyes really focusing on him for the first time.<br>
<br>
Sighing softly, he murmured a bit too loudly "Alone at last..."<br>
<br>
"Sir?" she replied with a start. Almost alarmed by his statement. Minz instantly kicked himself inwardly. 'WHAT AN ASS I AM,' he thought. Her cheeks instantly rosy. A girlish self conscious aspect of her that he'd never seen before.<br>
<br>
"Just a... a joke." He said snickering a bit, falling back onto his humor, to relieve an awkward situation. Belittling himself inwardly for his lack of courage and tact and about a dozen other things.<br>
<br>
"HI!! I'm back." Wind's chipper voice interrupted his ponderings. Jez's gaze was lost at sea again. The sun was setting, casting long shadows over the beach.<br>
<br>
Standing, brushing the sand from his sunburned and gnawed on legs. "Come one. Lets whack a few more. Minz needs a new gator skin wallet." This brought a giggle from Wind and slight smirk from Jezeran.<br>
<br>
He ran off, poking a big croc and running back. Gazing up at Jez as she brought her heavy sword down upon the beast. The pain of the gator's jaws snapping in a viselike grip on his legs overshadowing the pang in his chest.<br>
<br>
But not by much. <p>Minz Elandril<BR>

With all the heat during the day, one would think that the sands would retain some warmth through the night.  But it never did.<br>
<br>
Ohhh it wasn?t Everfrost cold. <shudder>  He KNEW first hand how cold it got there.   But come unprepared, and you?ll wake up in the morning cold, stiff and prolly sick<br>
<br>
Minz wondered how long he had been here.  It seemed forever.  Days blending into night and into day again.<br>
<br>
The crocs fell in a stream of constant scaled gore now.  He had enough gator hides to make a full matched set of luggage.   He felt like he was lost in a malaise.  Unable to move forward or back.  Like the sands beneath him were slowly, almost imperceptibly pulling him under.<br>
<br>
The one constant, through all this was Jezeran.  Though she often seemed distant, the few smiles and her healing touch sustained him.  ?GODS!?? he thought.  ?Do I??? Has it become?.  He looked across the fire at her sleeping form.  Soft auburn hair, with just a bit of a waviness to it.  Long eyelashes, high cheeks, the rose tint was still visible even in the flicker firelight.  Full lips.  Wondrously warm smile, lifting one?s spirit when she shows it.  Her soft touch, delicate fingers?. <br>
<br>
<br>
Minz?s eyes snapped open?.?when did I close them?I know her face so well?? His eyes focused back on the sleeping paladin, she had turned over, her back to him now.  Neck tilted just so, an pointed ear poised in the air, the wind rustling the fine hair at the nape of her neck.<br>
<br>
Sighing again. Echoes of feelings reverberating through his heart.  Pangs of loss.  Yet when he looked at Jez, they weren?t echoes he heard.  No, not the peels of love either?but?maybe?<br>
