A slight drizzle had kept steady the whole day and showed no signs of ending soon. A light mist wafted off the ground and waved silently through the forest, while a howling wind could be heard going over the treetops. The stench of giants loomed near. <br>
<br>
A small figure stood unwavering at the edge of a clearing in the forest, staring deep into the woods and watching for any signs of life. The small figure was a dwarf of smaller stature then was accepted in most true dwarven warrior guilds, but he didn’t need the extra bulk to do what he loved in life. The dwarven rogue had slain his fair share of the creatures that lived on the continent of Kunark and was setting out to do the same today. A good majority of his life in Kunark had been spent around the giants who thrived there, virtually making their attempts at day to day life as miserable as possible. There was just something about killing an evil creature who lacked so much in intellect that always appealed to the prankster dwarf. Yet, there was an uneasy feeling in his stomach today. The feeling that something wasn't right and that nothing could change it from being so.  <br>
<br>
His two human friends stood huddled nearby a small campfire that had been made during the day. It had struggled to stay alive throughout the wet weather, and had succeeded, up until now. The fire sputtered out and left a pile of smoking, half charred logs. One of the humans, a wiry man who had a dark black bear skin draped around him, kicked at the red embers in an attempt to get the fire going again. He achieved nothing other then to put the red embers out and leave no trace of fire anywhere. The man’s scarred face looked up from what had once been a good source of warmth and light, but now only reminded the others around it of the false sense of security it had once given them. The man turned to check on the dwarf that stood behind him.<br>
“Is there something out there, Blik?”, the man strained to see if the dwarf was staring at any movement in the trees.<br>
“Aye, there is always something out there, Markas, that is for sure.” Blik turned his attention from the darkness of the forest and stared into Markas’s eyes, “If it be alive, and if it seeks to end me own life and the life of me friends, by the powers that be Bristlebane and Brell I can guarantee that it’s motives will be shattered when and if it does find me.”<br>
<br>
Blik turned back to the forest and continued to scan the area for any threats. The other human, a tall, slender woman, left the remains of the fire and walked toward Blik. She was arrayed in the normal attire of a monk of Norrath and held the same foreboding presence that any person who killed within the blink of an eye could have, and that with no weapons even.<br>
“You seem unsteady, dwarf. Is something bothering you?”, asked the woman as she sat down on the ground next to Blik.<br>
“Nay!”, declared the dwarf proudly as he turned to walk to his equipment which lay near a tree, “Julannar, you know that I’m as steady as I’ll ever be! These old dwarven bones hold much more life in them then they appear!” The dwarf reached into one of the two backpacks that he constantly lugged around. Pulling an apple out of the pack, he began to munch on it.<br>
“You can’t lie to yourself, Blik. The days that you walk this land are numbered, just as are mine. There will be a day when we will be no more,” Julannar stood back up in one graceful and fluid motion and turned to stare at the dwarf. “Whether that be death by sword or by age, the day will come.”<br>
<br>
Markas had been standing off to the side while the other two were conversing, a concerned look had come across his face. He sensed something nearby that had not been there previously. The whole land reeked of giants, but there was always a distinct difference to the odors. A normal day-to-day giant always seemed to have a certain smell about it that could not be mistaken. While the smell of an overexcited, hungry, sweating giant never failed to give it's own position away. <br>
<br>
The other two accomplices of Markas soon began to take notice of his concern. Blik was the second one to notice that a giant was near. Being sure to keep his friends within sight, Blik used his exceptional sense of direction and determined that the intruder lay to the south. Through preplanned hand signals Blik told his friends of his intention. <br>
<br>
Slipping into the dark shadows on the east side of the forest, Blik silently made his way through the thick bed of leaves that had fallen to the ground until he had arced around to the rear flank of the giant. Up ahead he saw that the giant was lying partially covered underneath a pile of leaves and sticks. The giant’s attention was still centered on the remaining two humans who now stood in the clearing. It had obviously not taken much notice of the dwarf when he had slipped into the woods, which was well expected of such a mentally challenged creature. Now all Blik had to do was wait for the giant to seal it's own fate, and it was not long before the giant made it's first move.<br>
<br>
Markas stood a few yards behind Julannar as she attempted to make out what lingered in the shadows. She was caught completely off guard when the giant suddenly leaped out into the clearing at her. The giant slashed at the air violently with his axe as he landed where Julannar had been standing, but became extremely disgusted when his axe didn’t connect with anything. Instead, a man with a furry, bear coat now stood in front of him. The man did not appear afraid, but the giant intended to change that. Scowling at the man, the giant lunged forward with his axe, but his axe was suddenly caught by a gust of wind and was blown off to the side of the clearing. Still, the giant continued his forward momentum and barreled into the man, knocking him onto his back. The giant smiled as he reared back his arm and prepared to crush the man’s head, but was suddenly interrupted when a powerful kick was planted onto the side of his jaw. Howling in pain the giant threw an arm in the direction that the kick had come from, the giant watched in pleasure as his fist connected with the woman’s stomach, knocking the wind out of her and throwing her into the remains of the campfire nearby. Smoke billowed into the air as the logs were crushed under the monk’s weight. The giant returned his attention to the man beneath him and this time grabbed at the man’s throat and began to squeeze as hard as he could.<br>
<br>
A piercing pain suddenly stabbed into the back of the giant and washed over his entire body. Releasing the man from his mighty grip, the giant stood up and turned to see what had dared to spoil the great fun that he was having. He saw nothing, but the pain continued, getting even worse as the time went by. The giant soon realized that something was stuck in his back. Flailing about wildly, the giant attempted to remove the foreign object, but was not succeeding. His vision blurring and his legs weakening, he continued to try to remove the object, but it was no use. Kneeling to the ground, the giant took his last breath as something stabbed into his back and through his heart. The giant fell limp, hitting the ground face first.<br>
<br>
Blik removed his spear and his poison tipped throwing dagger from the giant’s back. Another day’s work was done, and there was one less giant in the world for everyone to worry about. Julannar had already recovered from being hit by the powerful giant and now stood unscathed near the now dead giant. Markas also was to his feet, but his neck bore a deep, red mark around it.<br>
“Well, that was a hungry giant if I ever saw one,” declared Markas as he rubbed his neck with his hand, “I’m lucky I got his weapon away from him before he ran into me.”<br>
“I figured that was you, not that much wind in these forests,” joked Julannar as she walked around the dead giant, “Good aim Blik, hit him just where you needed to.”<br>
“Aye, he didn’t last too long did ‘e now,” Blik examined where the poisoned dagger had hit, and even in the darkness that was beginning to take over the forest he could see that a dark colored hue had gathered around the wound. <br>
“I’m glad to see my new concoction has some potential.” Blik gathered in the scene before him, “There was something wrong though.” <br>
Markas and Julannar threw questioning glances at eachother and at Blik, “Something wrong?”, asked Markas, “But it went off without a hitch. There were no serious injuries or anything, 'cept for that giant.” <br>
Blik didn’t even flinch at the intended joke, instead he stared at nothing in particular. “Nay,” the dwarf paused for a moment and then looked at his friends. Tears had formed in his eyes. <br>
“There is something wrong with me.”<br>

Oh yeah, I fouled up the first edition (and the second, and the third, etc.). So, if you read it one time before and thought it was miserable, it might be better this time.<br>
<br>
Thank you, and have a nice day.<br>
