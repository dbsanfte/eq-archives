That is a listing of what is needed for the weapon.  As a beastlord, you need to create the beastlord portion, and depend upon the other classes to complete their part as well.  My recommendation, unless you have characters for these classes and you're willing to do their portions of the quest, is to create a few beastlord components and auction for trades. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utoshizo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toshizo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/14/02 2:44:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3462.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beastlord - Claws Quest</span><hr size=1> He is triggered but not like you would think and its very unique to SoL.

I am on Bristlebane and as soon as I get the rest of my claw made (need the rogue, shaman, war, and bard parts) I will spill this part with text as I complete it and move on.

<br>
Oneis far fetched but possible - I worked on the Iksar Monk Shackle Quests from the day Kunark came out and they ran ino a similar problemn on many steps of the quest leading people to belive it was broken.  One very similar instance is of an NPC saying that the guy you are looking for was last seen roaming the Overthere studying lightning.  People searched and posted for weeks looking for this npc all over the Overthere.  Reported him as a bug, was he broken, etc. etc.  Finally someone went to Timorous Deep and searched and lo and behold found the Master Iksar Monk that was needed.  SO the original NPC's statements can be a bit misleading at times.  The NPC for this quest says that our NPC can be found "ALMOST ALWAYS" in the moor.  So it is possible that this guy spawns in another zone studying Sonic Wolves.  Other zones I know of with Sonic Wolves are Grimling Forest, Tenebrous Mtns. any others?<br>
<br>
Second Issue here is lets says guy posting above me is telling the truth, I know he has level this high as I have seen his char so not exaggerating about that.  There are many unique things that go on in the Moor.  All the Named Critters that spawn for one thing.  Also there is a statement that happens every once in a while about someone feeding eggs to the Seargant/Guard and when he finds person respsonsible theres gonna be hell to pay.  As Verant has stated that things can be done for quests that were previously impossible, so maybe has something to do with us Yelling Across the zone looking for this gug to get him to help??  Or yelling for help when being attacked by the Named Sonic Wolf??  I will be testing as many of these theories as possible when I return my Beeastlord from East Karana.  Just trivialed cured silk at 82, starting on greyhopper hide and reinforced leather next, then will make attempts at the stack of sonic wolf tendons, owlbear tendons, fish oil soaked rags, and sea salt crystals I have saved up.   If I find the method I will post it here as soon as I find it.  No reason to keep it to myself,  more people get this step solved, more people will be working on getting the enxt step solved.  Only need a bards item to join in making the Sonic Wolfbane Weapon, rest of the classes I know are farther along than me.<br>

<br>
I small circle of light, similar to a lightstone effect, seems to move from spot to spot during the night...mostly from behind rocks, or trees....which ends up at the river under the first bridge.  At one point, after exhausting all the /say options I could think of, I decided to sit and med.  While watching the glowing spot, something popped and depopped immediately.  I could have sworn it was a sitting cat, but I can't be sure.  Either way, the glowing area remained there until the morning, at which point it faded completely.<br>
<br>
My theory, if he is a triggered spawn, is that this glowing area has something to do with a hiding cat, namely Ahom Guhzin.  I haven't been able to get him to respond, nor have I seen him warp in and out like the last time...but I'll keep at it hoping to spark something.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.  =/  3 weeks and counting, and I still can't figure this guy out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utoshizo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toshizo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/02 2:01:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3462.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beastlord - Claws Quest</span><hr size=1> Obmar I know what is needed.... <br>

Hollowshade Moore is having problems and it seems a lot of the special coding was taken out to keep it from rebooting on its own every few minutes / hours. Anyone who spent any time in this zone during December knows how it sucked to go LD and come back with your char reset to last server save - losing exp, loot, etc.<br>
<br>
I spent 5-7 hours in the zone tonight and noticed some major missing #%$@%<br>
<br>
What's this mean for Ahom? Well currently you cannot spawn him and unless they can resolve the zone issues with reboots they will have to redo this quest from this point one.<br>
<br>
Will keep you updated as I learn more.... sending emails to some dev guys tonight about this.<br>

No, I said Hollowshade Moore is having problems and it seems a lot of the special coding was taken out to keep it from rebooting on its own every few minutes / hours.<br>
<br>
I also said I spent 5-7 hours in the zone lastnight and noticed some major missing #%$@%... this means either they retuned the zone and the events I am looking for happen less often or are turned off like I think they ALL might be.<br>
<br>

<br>
Speculation after 5 hours in the zone for the first time in weeks. Yes, he could be bugged or the events I was looking for could be happening way less so the zone does not reboot every few minutes / hours.<br>
<br>
So, now I can either wait on the dev guys to get back to me or continue gettings my bard, shaman, rogue, and warrior da'parts for the last claws before Ahom. This will put me in the zone long enough for me to say if ALL events are down in the zone which it seems or if they have just been respaced.<br>

I cannot tell you in (spoiler fashion) what I learned in beta for thats against the rules... but, having a 53 BST who is doing the quests I can tell you what I do now.... if something is changed or buggy then I will know UNLESS there have been changes to the quest... I work and only have limited time to play and on top of that I also wish to get my BST back to lvl 60, so sitting in Hollowshade all day long is not something I am going to do often. <br>
<br>
Rather than bitch because I do not spoil the quest for you why not spend time in Hollowshade and see what you can come up with. Seems to me you would rather someone else do the work while you play then once its known go and do what you need to without wasting your time. This is not fair to the rest of the BST out there and flaming me is a sad way to say your upset because you cannot figure it out on your own.<br>
<br>
I will help as much as possible or stop helping if people flame me. Those who log on to BB with newbs to ask questions I will answer what I can but stop asking me to spoil the quest because I cannot.<br>
<br>
If your on BB and have the bard, shaman, warrior, rogue parts to the last claw then give me a tell and we will move forward faster...

However one time when the &quot;Owlbear defenders&quot; spawned me and my freind killed them off, shortly thereafter a &quot;Grimling Invader&quot; ran up to &quot;Attack&quot; the owlbears, there was no-one to kill him off so he started to run inside, me being the curious type I am, I followed him inside, what happened then is that all the owlbear spawns in the cave were replaced by Grimlings!  Apparently the grimlings had taken over the cave due to our interference.  I later tried the same thing at the grimling village but got wiped out instead of killing the grimling guards, kept getting summoned in the middle of 4 of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway my theory is/was that each of the 3 types in the moor try to take over the camp of the other, perhaps if all 3 places belong to 1 type something special happens.  And maybe one of the 3 possible outcomes (probably the sonic wolves everywhere one) is that Ahom Guhzin spawns.<br>
<br>
Anyway that is my theory and also what I believe Toshizo was thinking of.  However as he said (and I have noticed) as of 1/14/01 they still have not reverted the zone back to being dynamic.  On the bright side though I have read an article fairly recently on eq.castersrealm I believe it was about them getting to see some of the &quot;new&quot; dynamic content in eq, and one of the zones he talked about was hollowshade.  So heres hoping its fixed soon.<br>

But Most liklely what he's trying to hide, is that back in the day there used to be the ability in this zone to set up the &quot;War&quot;.  Its even listed on Eq.castersrealm.com in the archives, from an interview with some press folks;  Verant was showing off the new engine, and they showed the people the war... during which you can kill off any 2/3 groups (owl, wolf, grim) and the remaining one takes over the zone (even the kitty fort).<br>
I'm thinking thats what his special secret was, only thing that fits it all.  Anyway, sorry I can't help more as to how to start the war, atm you can't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utoshizo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toshizo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/02 12:27:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3462.topic&index=136>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beastlord - Claws Quest</span><hr size=1> Now we are going in the right direction to new ideas and understandings about this zone.
