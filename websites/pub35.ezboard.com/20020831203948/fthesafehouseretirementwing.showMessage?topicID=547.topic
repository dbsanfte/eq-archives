Doesn't really matter, though.  Just want to say my piece on my way out.<br>
<br>
The moderation on this board has gotten, a little out of hand for my taste.<br>
<br>
I remember a time when, messages would be either e-mailed or posted to inform posters of behavior or actions that were not condoned by the moderators, before editing/locking occurred.  Only in extreme circumstances were threads/posts violated by the moderators.<br>
<br>
You notice I used the word "violated".  You may think that it does not apply but, I think it does.  <br>
<br>
Each post that is made is a creation of the individual posting.  It is their contribution to the content of the board.  And as thier creation there will be some level of emotional attachment to it.  They may be particularly pleased with a point they made, the eloquence of their statement, or a graphic they've created or used.  Whatever the reason for or depth of the emotional attachment, it is there to some extent.<br>
<br>
Disagree or not, it is my feeling that the frequent, arbitrary, locking and editing of the posts on this board are ignoring the fact that it is the content that is created by the board users that give it any substance.  Abusing the users, by ignoring, refuting, or showing indifference to the sanctity of their contributions is intolerable, to me.<br>
<br>
I have no issue with the Kezzek.  He has always treated me and my contributions with respect.  Even when I tended to get a little hostile towards the other members.  Remmi and Kezzek did a great job in allowing the users to create an environment that I enjoyed visiting for a long time.<br>
<br>
Some of the more recent moderators however, remind me of low level bureaucrats, who have lost sight of fact that the it is they who serve the community ant not the reverse, feeding their egos on the little domain over which the have power.  Disrespectful comments (especially when locking the thread so as to give them the last public word on the subject), editing without warning for trivial infractions, and general arbitrary attitude of some of this new crew of moderators have made this a place which I no longer enjoy visiting.<br>
<br>
For those that will respond with the argument that moderating is difficult, I am not being fair, and the moderators are doing the best they can in a difficult job, I say this:<br>
<br>
No one is forcing them to do the job.  And everyone should occasionally reflect on thier actions critically, lest they lose sight of what consequences may arise from them.<br>
<br>
To quote a moderator's response in a recently locked post that critiqued this boards recent moderation:<br>
<br>
"Oh, and if you don't like the place. Nobody is making you stay... "<br>
<br>
So, I'm going.  I'll not view or post to this board again.  Anyone who feels the need to reply to me can address their comments to dbeloat@att.net.  I'll not see anything posted here.<br>

<br>
Just my 2copper, but it should be moved from a topic of nipples to what it was meant to be. <p><center>

We do the best we can.  I guaranteee you that none of us wake up and say &quot;Hm.. I think I'll go beat some people up on the board today, just because I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
We have had to get stricter though, I'll give you that.  But  we've had to start enforcing the rules more tightly because of the ever growing  population of the boards.  Back when it was just a couple thousand registered users we didn't have as many thread locks because there were fewer personalities here, and less chances for them to clash.  <br>
<br>
But we're a lot bigger now, and I'm sure if you've ever managed a large group of people that you know you can't start making exceptions.  Because where would it stop?<br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line, we do what we can.  You can't please everybody though.  We're people too (cept for the Fiae character, who knows what he is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and prone to make mistakes just like anyone else.  But I promise you, we will ALWAYS try to fix those mistakes as quickly as possible when they happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
