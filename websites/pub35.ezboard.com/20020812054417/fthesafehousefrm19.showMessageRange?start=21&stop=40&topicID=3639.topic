<br>
We NEED the three classes to be different.  Flavor is good.<br>
<br>
Infiltrators - 2.5 spec points, thats their specialty<br>
Nightshades - Fix the spells to be more useful (variance, etc) plus give them an extra ~200 spec points.. whatever that works out to be (2.35?)<br>
Shadowblades - 2.35 spec points (or whatever an additonal 200 spec points is =), hitpoint increase of an additonal 100-150 (something noticeable) and increase 2h damage from 15% to 25%<br>
<br>
Part of the reasoning is that to return Doublefrost to its pre nerfed status you would have to train double frost to 42 - yes, the extra 200 or so spec points would fall shy of that, but could help bring it closer.  The additonal damage from the 2hander may lessen its liability.<br>
<br>
My numbers arent exact, they are just off the top of my head, would have to run some calculations...<br>
<br>
In that sort of scenario, all three would still be very different, but closer in equality.. and no one gets nerfed =)<br>

<br>
I think that if you want to take away 2 handed weapons then you have to take away the choice for infs (and ns) to choose thrust or slash.  I see those as ballancing out each other personally.  We get 2 handed weapons but are stuck with slash, while other realms have a choice.<br>
<br>
Now I have heard sbs argue that 2 handed weapons should not count, but I think they should (however I don't use them) It's a choice.  Just like infs say the choice between thrust and slash should not be counted.  Thats a choice and should be counted.  <br>
<br>
However, if those cancel out (and in my mind they do) then sbs still come up short when it comes to spec points.  We are spread really really thin.  If you look at dual wield and the fact that infs can spec this low, you could take a LOT of spec points away from an inf and that inf would STILL have higher specs than I do now as an sb.   It's not just the spec points it's the fact that you have to spread them among 5 specs as an sb.  <br>
<br>
When you compare the two it just doesn't seem fair imo.  If they don't want to give sbs the spec points that's fine with me but then they really do need to make the 34 and 39 style in left axe hard hitters, because that's all sbs can afford to spec and maintain an assassin style spec.<br>

As to the 2.5 spec points all assassins should get it, OR they should whipe all assassin spec points and drop infs back to 2.2 and give them 40 extra hp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/unage42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nage42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 12:51:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3639.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Please don't give SBs and NSs 2.5....</span><hr size=1> Funny to go through this thread... how one's opinion changes with experience.<br>
<br>
I play multiple SBs on multiple shards.<br>
<br>
Some important factors:<br>
<br>
2.5 spec points for Infs doesn't become a factor until say 40+ lvl (this is pretty basic math, so it should be self evident).  So all you people out there who are less than level say 40-something, I'm sorry, but you don't have the real picture.  Points make a big difference near end-game where multipliers of level make BIG points difference.<br>
<br>
2-Handed weapons are very nice in low levels, but harder to use in higher levels.  When you got more sneaky/experienced enemies running through you to blow your CD (enemy not in view), then that's a show stopper when you need that dmg &amp; stun to finish them off.  I'm sure that there are skilled/experienced 2H users out there, but they are the exception and I suspect that they are not fighting very skilled Infs/NS...<br>
<br>
Lower level Infs and NS on MLF are of such poor skill it's silly.  I rolled an SB on MLF cause it's busy during my timezone and the BGs are just a joke (ya, I know BGs are for n00bs, but it is just sad how useless these people were).<br>
<br>
Anyways, I know it'll be unpopular, but I'm of the oppinion that if there's gonna be no disguise skills/spells, then:<br>
<br>
Leave SBs with 2H (even though we don't use it), leave LA dmg where it is but change moves that require &quot;you parry&quot; to &quot;you evade&quot; (except lvl 50 move, make it back-facing or something... evade happens too often). Give them 2*lvl HitPoints. Leave Medium stun on second chain from LA move<br>
<br>
Let Infs spec slash or thrust, back up a bit in skill points to say 2.3 (it makes a difference in end-game cause that's were all the points are and they don't need DW up very high to be good).  For the Love of God replace the Long Stun of DragonFang for something else -- bad enough that it's an evade-based move (which high-level Infs do 50% of the time), that can be stacked, and is on reaction-damage-table-level-50 move... but Long Stun too?!?  Fukn Crack Smokers in the styles team... HELLLOOOOO?!?<br>
<br>
Let NS spec slash or pierce, Give them 1*lvl HitPoints (they are just too fragile those elves and luri), give them a natural +1 to Envenom (means say +37 points in end-game cause they need to spend one less point).  Change Diamondback move so that second move in chain stuns (or replace stun with bleed)... not sure if they need more, I've never played one, but there are some pretty successful ones out there, so can't be all bad.<br>
<br>
Anything wrong with the above?  I know a bunch of level 50 chain-wearing tanks getting their arse handed to them (after having been kicked around the countryside for a while) in toe-to-toe fights (no crit, no poison) with Infs... as an SB I wouldn't dream of attacking a tank unless I had Crit, Poison, AND he's SITTING!<br>

<br>
We are now on the same hitpoint table as skalds, a tank class. There is no way that Mythic will raise us higher than that.<br>
<br>
This makes the HP problem one of Con. Personally I think the +3 Dex, +2 Qui, +1 Str every 3 levels needs to be changed for SBs to +2 Str, +2 Dex, +1 Qui, +1 Con, but this wont happen because no class gets points over 4 stats, despite it still being 6 points every 3 levels.<br>
<br>
My next alternative is: Str +3, Dex +2, Con +1, but this wont happen either, so lets ask for:<br>
<br>
Dex +3, Str +2, Con +1.<br>
<br>
(Hmm, + Dex, how totally unuseful to a 2H CritBlade, &quot;you evede&quot;, &quot;you ignore the evade style as you wont hit in time anyway&quot;).<br>

<br>
period. You could play the crapiest realm/class out there, if you spend the time RvR'ing you own rps. Big deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Crit blade cannot even come close to the pure melee capability of a shadowwzerker, which isnt saying much. CS can kill a tank, but you will do it by poison kiting, not toe to toe.<br>
<br>
They work, but are more lethal against a smaller amount of targets, and less lethal in general melee. They own casters hard though.<br>
<br>
<br>
Compared to other realms though, LA is a really crappy skill. It used to be worth the sacrifice, now it is just junk.<br>
<br>
And yes, I did quit, so Mythic lost two accounts, I can only be a fool so long.<br>
<br>
infiltrators saying please dont give SB 2.5 points, god thats funny. What a jerk off attitude<br>

IMO, that dual wield cancels out 2handers that Midgard gets. In other words, each one is a unique realm ability. Infiltrators needed 2.5 spec pts because they had more spec lines to train in to be effective. Well, that was an error on Mythic's part. So the real justification for 2.5 spec pts is no longer applicable, and all assassins should now get 2.5 spec pts. As for giving Inf's an extra 50 hps to make up for SBs or taking away 50 hps of SBs, well doesn't matter to me, either is fine. <br>
<br>
Change SBs and NSs to 2.5 specs, make vanish/shadow run/viper available to each realm, give Inf's an extra 50 hps. That will make us equivalent, assuming they stop nerfing LA every patch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uharanavei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haranavei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 8:57:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3639.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Please don't give SBs 2.5....</span><hr size=1> &quot;...any assassin can use 2 handers.

<br>
Ok, let me explain the difference between using a stave, or playing Midgard. Say you're a Shadowblade and you full spec Axe. Your damage variance with both a 1 hand AND the 2 hand axe is based upon your skill level in Axe. With full spec, it's pretty damn good. Pick up a sword. With no points in sword, check out your damage cap/variance. Let's see, numbers all over the place? Can't count on it to hit near your cap? No styles? Congratulations! Now you know what it's like to wield a stave.<br>
<br>
Personally, I wouldn't want to use a 2 hander. But you can't compare the ability to wield a 2h weapon with your general 'weapon type' spec to wielding an unspecced stave that you don't receive styles for-*you* get nice, specced damage, the staff wielder gets damage all over the place, yeah that's a GREAT comparison there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

For damage they do 60 pts (and this is AFTER the supposed fix in the recent patch oh and the base damage is 62 FYI) on average which at 50 is nothing. Maybe if it was every 5 seconds it might be useful but 60pts every 20 seconds is worthless. The castable spell is a little better but is only useful on keep assaults when I and 4 other shades have to blow a bar of mana to kill one archer. Our spells are merely a novelty with extremely narrow usefulness. <br>
<br>
Celtic Dual: CRAP 99% of all shades only put the last little bit of spec points into it, the styles are absolutely awful and I have a Blademaster who is full spec in it so they don't get any better with points, So SB's you are not the only ones with a crap spec line. I really feel for the BM's since that's supposed to be the main thing for them.<br>
<br>
Will I say that Shades suck? No, we do ok. I think the spells need some love still and that CD needs mucho work but on the lines that do work they work pretty good. As to the &quot;High&quot; evades. All the other assasins get the same evade that I do. <br>
<br>
Here is the end result, I can't chime to the damage that SB's do, I can say that I have been one shot by Jagar (sp?) on my server, Have I one shot anyone? Yeah, a wounded person or a lower then me sitting caster. Have I ever one shot another assasin of equal level, nope never come close.<br>
<br>
Are Inf's good, yup I fight them all the time. Are they vastly supperior not that I see but I lose and they lose. Would I like to see 2.5? Yeah I would cause if my &quot;strong spellcaster&quot; spells don't get some love I want to get it somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Do I think that Inf's are in the lead as far as assasins go? Yeah, not by a ton but about 450 spec points or so. Should SB's and NS's get the same spec? Yeah, or near to it. My spells don't make a huge difference, not as much as say a 2h weapon does.<br>
<br>
The spec as I see it:<br>
<br>
Infiltrator: 2.5 or +450<br>
Shadowblade: 2.35 or + about 300 or so<br>
Nightshade: 2.35 or +300 or so<br>
<br>
The reason?<br>
<br>
SB's have 2h and xtra hp's<br>
NS's have a shout<br>
<br>
That's how I see it, those extra hp's/2h weapon and shout are worth about 150 points in spec. <p>-Jorahs <BR>

Brandyn, actually I believe you have left a couple things out.  Balancing issues should look more like this:<br>

Are you even hearing what I'm saying?  I just want things to be even on the battlefield.  If it takes 2.5x to be given to SB and NS, then so be it.  I just don't think that's the way to fix the problem.<br>
<br>
What I keep hearing is that they should fix all the stuff that's broken with SBs AND give them more spec points.  I think that would be overkill, and I think the one that SHOULD happen is fixing the stuff that's broken.<br>
<br>
I DON'T WANT INFILTRATORS TO BE THE BEST ASSASSINS!!!!  Is that clear enough?  What I want is for us to all stand as equals, though we are different.<br>
<br>
So why is wanting things to be level selfish?  Change the 50 axe or sword style to = Dragonfang.  Style changes are likely coming in 1.52 so maybe they will do that or get rid of Dragonfang.  I don't have a problem with either.  /shrug<br>

Brandyn,<br>
<br>
Why not allow Assassins to use all weapon types and spec in them?  It makes no sense to me at all that Assassins currently have among the most limited spec choices in weapons.<br>
<br>
Do you think the masters in Assassin school have some kind of philosophical aversion to using whatever weapon is at hand to accomplish the job?<br>
<br>
Clerics and healer types in general are limited to blunt weapons, however this is due to D&amp;D's proscriptions against Clerics using edged or pointed weapons of war.  This IS a philosophical divide.<br>
<br>
And I'll bet more people have been killed by Rogues wielding a blunt weapon (blackjack, sap, club) than either a slasher or pointy thing.

Short answer, you cannot. A SZ comes as close as they can and even they fall short because of the shortage of spec pts (2..2 vs 2.5). You just don't realize how powerful it is to not have to spend pts in CD/DW and get the benefits of dual wielding. IMO, that is far more powerful than 2handers and additional hps.<br>
