The rules system is on the whole, very good; I needn't go into details, other people have done that.  There are some things that bug me though.<br><br>The system, while being more open and giving more realms for character customisation, ends up with high level characters generally being far more powerful than they were in 1E or 2E.  Also, <b>if</b> you take the default schemas, level advancement is significantly faster in 3E and magical items are far more readily available.<br><br>In the end, it's also about the "feel" of the game, and while 3E D&D is a good fantasy RPG in its own right - and I'm really enjoying a 3E pen and paper campaign at the moment, it doesn't have quite the same "feel" that original D&D and 1E AD&D had for me.  Of course, this could just be a case of "old-fogey RPGer" syndrome, but 3E is so radically different in so many ways to earlier editions that I think some of the "soul" has been lost.<br><br>In the end, though, the rules you use are the least important thing of any good gaming group.  The company, the tales you weave and retell again after, the atmosphere - all of these things are more important than a few tables and dice rolls. <p><center><img height="180" width="320" src="http://www.top-hat.demon.co.uk/Images/TibisSigUGA.jpg" usemap="#TibisSigUGAa095ee" border="0" alt="Tibis Heartseeker"><map name="TibisSigUGAa095ee"><area href="http://www.top-hat.demon.co.uk/Images" target="_blank" coords="135,52,135,52,134,45,133,32,123,23,123,11,130,4,131,16,137,18,144,4,150,4,165,16,177,14,180,8,178,0,186,6,184,24,171,33,170,48" shape="polygon" alt="My sig gallery"><area href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10573" target="_blank" coords="154,129,314,150" shape="rect" alt="My Magelo"><area href="http://www.thesafehouse.org" target="_blank" coords="182,151,315,166" shape="rect" alt="The Safehouse"></map><br><font size="1"><i>&quot;The Internet is a write-only medium&quot; - unknown</i></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=44.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showNextMessage?topicID=44.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=17><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.emailToFriend?topicID=44.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.threadControl?topicID=44.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=44.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=44.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25>Pen & Paper Rogues</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
