Granted he now again has all the epic quest items leading up to that point, but he is out a days worth of xp and the 40-50 hours he spent camping this unbelievably poorly-placed spawn.<br><br>Here's a rundown of the events leading up to this.<br><br>My guild and another guild had been camping Ragefire for several days leading up to the eventual pop.  That's no surprise; he's a highly desirable spawn in an outdoor zone with several safe spots, which is a perfect recipe for this type of camping.<br><br>When Ragefire did eventually pop, our guild's monk (FD at the spawn point) stood up and got aggro, but before he took damage one of the people in the other guild stole aggro with a ranged attack, and proceeded to kite Ragefire around the zone.  At this point there were a total of 4 people in Skyfire, 2 from each guild.<br><br>Both guilds started massing people for the kill.  During this time the other guild's bard was keeping Ragefire charmed to prevent anyone from attacking him.<br><br>Around 10 minutes later my guild had 30 people in the zone, and the other guild had 10.  They were making no attempt to kill the human Ragefire (he was at full health), just keeping him unkillable to us while they got more people.<br><br>We dispelled the charm on Ragefire, killed the human form, then killed the dragon form.  My group got credit for the kill, despite the fact that the other guild's enchanter was constantly mem-blurring trying to grab the kill from us.<br><br>Our cleric looted the heart, turned in the pieces, and got his epic.  For 24 hours.  The other guild petitioned that we'd stolen the kill, and after talking to our cleric for all of 5 minutes, the GM decided that he did.  At that point the server GM summoned him to Qeynos Catacombs and forced him to take a restore to a save pre-epic.<br><br>The GM's rationale for this (to me) unbelievably bad move was that since our monk had not actually taken damage from Ragefire, he couldn't tell for sure whether we or they had aggro first, and so nobody gets the Ragefire heart, and we all get to sit there for another 5-7 days, and go through all this again with the next pop.<br><br>Keep in mind that this wasn't a case of might makes right.  Our guild had been camping this spawn just as long as theirs, and had the initial aggro.  Once we got it, despite their shennannigans, we massed the necessary forces faster, and killed him.  How can anyone justify stripping a cleric of his epic under these circumstances?  How can the GM's strip somebody of an epic on what even they admit is incomplete knowledge, that basically amounts to hearsay?<br><br>I know some servers have a Ragefire rotation that they adhere to; kudos to them.  Mithaniel Marr doesn't have anything like that.  In the absence of something like that I don't see any way for situations like this to be resolved except by letting the players handle it.  The GMs can't police this spawn; they can't be everywhere at all times, and they don't have the tools to see what really happens, other than which person actually took damage first.<br><br>Here's what I'd like to see happen, in order of acceptability:<br>1) Our cleric gets his epic restored<br>2) Our cleric gets his epic restored and the other guild's cleric gets his heart too.  I don't think he deserves it, but I don't care if he gets it.<br>3) Nobody gets any epic but Verant at least lays down very strict guidelines to the players and the GMs about how these spawns will be handled so at least in the future we know what rules we're playing under.<br><br>This is an issue that affects every guild on every server in the game.  Now that Ragefire is a Lodizal-type encounter where people will be in these kind of contests for it, there needs to be some strict, enforcable guidelines set down that apply across ALL servers, and are enforcable with the tools the GMs have, and aren't subject to hearsay.<br><br><I>Edit: Sig not appropriate, please read the sig rules. -Glip</i> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uglipthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glip the Gnome</A> at: 4/17/02 11:44:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upereginfalcon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peregin Falcon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.san.rr.com/kyckyersden/ezart/new_message.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 11:21:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23352.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok this isn't rogue related, but it affects all EQ playe</span><hr size=1> Your guild may want to start a collection to buy your cleric a monitor to replace the one he probably smashed to itty bitty pieces <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit: Please read our sig/personal pic rules. - ShadowCross</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/18/02 6:50:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udarkomen42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOmen42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 11:25:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23352.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok this isn't rogue related, but it affects all EQ playe</span><hr size=1> While I feel for ya, this will probably get locked.<br><br>Ragefire sucks. <p>[54 Rake] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96718" title="Magelo profile">Harabakc Taintedblade</a> (Dwarf)<a href="http://www.oboo.org" title="www.OBOO.org" >Bears of Oboo</a><br>[52 Wanderer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96724" title="Magelo profile">Harabec Woodwalker</a> (Wood Elf)<a href="http://www.oboo.org" title="www.OBOO.org" >Bears of Oboo</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uportly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Portly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 11:31:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23352.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/miw/portly-small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok this isn't rogue related, but it affects all EQ playe</span><hr size=1> Not sure why this one would get locked.<br><br>Like I said it's not entirely on-topic, but this stuff does affect any EQ player in any raid-capable guild, which is a lot of people.
