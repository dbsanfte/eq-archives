<br>
Now, Many people on the boards talk about the power of Dragonfang, which is obvious enough on paper. My question is this....<br>
<br>
Do you ( and perhaps Mythic) feel this style is balanced since it requires 50 skill to use, or do you think it will someday be beaten with the nerf bat like Doublefrost?<br>
<br>
I would wager many Infiltrators are building a template around this style, which our Shadowblade cousins will tell you can be very dangerous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uthebumble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheBumble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 5:42:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3528.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> I think the stun effects of the style are appropriate for the level of the style.

Basically one evade means it's game over no matter who you're fighting.  dragonfang gets the stun on, then you can kick into 5-6 consecutive hits from the CS evade chain which is the most damaging styes a thrust infiltrator has available to them.<br>
<br>
When one evade gets you a string of dragonfang, hamstring, leaper, hamstring, leaper, rib separator, and ripper you are talking some serious damage.  The first 4 of those will do around 6-700 damage during the duration of the stun.  the full chain will dish out well over 1000 damage followed off 1 evade.<br>
<br>
It is situational, and you have to spend a ton of points to get it, but this style is the one thing which allows an infiltrator to stand in and take down pretty much any class in the game if things go their way.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what sort of change could be made to the style though.  Without dragonfang you would see no thrust infiltrators in the game.  Slash is by far the better option because of the damage vs. other assassins and the high damage and bonus to hit on amethyst slash make up for the penalty agaisnt chain targets. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ueldarsheimhun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldar Sheim Hun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 4:37:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3528.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I too agree that its good to have a long duration stun off a 50 style, although im a SB and dragonfang hurts hehe<br>
However, like one of the above posters said,  what makes it &quot;overpowered&quot; is that the class that gets it has 2.5x level, so its REALLY easy to get to 50 thrust without sacrifising other skills, since you can spec high in them as well..<br>
<br>
To Landril77:<br>
I see more than dragonfang as a reason to spec thrust, the fact that half your enemies gonna be chain wearing classes, which gives thrust a substancial edge, very nice bonus <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If they were to give other realms access to the same)or a similar) style at 50, and even out the difficulty of obtaining it(even out spec points between the Assassins) then I think it would be good.  <br>
   As it is now, as far as I know, Albions speccing Thrust are the only people able to get a 9 second stun off of a first reactionary style.  Every other realm has Stuns in an Evade chain, but they're 2nd or 3rd in a chain, if they spec appropriately.  Excluding Shield Slams of course, which is not in the province of Rogues, except for the Albion Scout.<br>
<br>
   So as it is now, it's overpowered solely because only one realm has access to it, and other realms don't have a comparable style to be used under similar circumstances.  One again, if I'm wrong here, or missing something, please point it out to me, I'm always eager to learn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

That would give me a reason to go to 50 in CS instead of forcing me to spread my points out and compete with the Infils on their terms with less spec points.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 8:58:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3528.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Damnit.<br>

Overpowered? I don't think so.  But this thread just screams &quot;nerf me&quot;.<br>

We don't want that!!! We want BALANCE!!!!!<br>
<br>
Nothing that nerfs a rogue is a good thing.<br>
<br>
Giving level 50 styles that don't suck to EVERY spec line would probably help.  Making leftaxe more level based and giving rogues all 2.5x spec points would help as well.<br>

The mercs would probably use the DW stun combo off parry instead anyways, since they tend to parry about 10 times as often as they evade. Thrust really sucks that bad. You may see a few thrust polearm users, but noone besides infiltrators and few mercs makes use of this style. No minstrel is going to take thrust to 50, since they almost never evade and don't have the points. No scout has the points to spend on this, since it is much better to get 42 shield and concentrate on other things. So, really, infiltrators are the only class that has benefit from this style. No, its not overpowered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=biabia>Bia Bia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 10:27:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3528.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> the style isnt overpowered.   the fact that any inf that specs thrust is going to have it because they have 2.5 spec points.<br>

With the exception of dragonfang thrust styles absolutely suck.  The slash styles do enough higher damage to make up almost all of the 30% bonus/penalty against chain.<br>
<br>
Most thrust infiltrators use garrote as their anytime attack because there is nothing in the thrust line to use.  This gives you a defensive penalty and no bonus to hit.  Slash infiltrators use amethyst slash which does a little more damage than garrote with no defensive penalty and a high bonus to hit.<br>
<br>
Using garrote would not be so bad if not for the defense penalty, but it is bad enough that as a thrust infiltrator myself I use a no damage detaunt style myself because it is more efficient and improves my survival rate dramatically.<br>
<br>
Another factor is that in order to improve your weaponskill you must have twice the bonus's from items with thrust than with slash.  In order to get the same gain as a slash infiltrator who increses their strength 10 points a thrust infiltrator must increase both their strength and dex by 10 points.  this makes it difficult for a thrust inf to maintain the same weaponskill as a slash inf and as we all know weaponskill is all important when it comes to damage output.<br>
<br>
I have been playing both a thrust and a slash inf for a while now, and my slash inf does very similar damage to chain wearing opponents as my thruster.  He hits for a litte less damage per hit, but hits more often and consistantly thanks to the better styles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uoldmill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Old Mill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 10:46:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3528.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sover.net/~danmad/images/bigbeer.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragonfang</span><hr size=1> I chose a horrible dexterity class, norseman with no dex in start up.<br>

<br>
1. nerf a class because its to overpowerd: archers,healers,archers again,rogues/infils/shades,clerics,minstrels to name a few.<br>
<br>
people whine,mythic listens. rather then make it an even field,by fixing sup par skills,and sup par classes,mythic fixes it by reducing classes that are powerful in there minds.<br>
<br>
so eventually at some point,dragonfang will get nerfed. samewith the armsman style that makes them uber.<br>
<br>
why? because thats easier then revamping styles,making sure classes are semi balanced accross the realms,and making sure realms are balanced.<br>
<br>
what i find funny,is the same complaints can be used for any class,someone posted on the cleric thread in this board,how it was unfair for mythic to change a class 8 months after the games out. im sure that same idea was ignored when it didnt effect them. casters/clerics jumped up and down with joy when 1 shot stealth was nerfed. now they use the same arguments,rather ironic isnt it.<br>

DF-HS-Leaper-HS-Leaper-DF-HS-Leaper-Rib Sep-Ripper... lol. The second DF lasts for 4.5 seconds, so, considering the amount of time before the end of the first stun that the second DF stun kicks in, it'll last you about 12-13 seconds of stun time, which, in all normal situations, is the majority of the battle.<br>

Here's the thing... yeah it's powerful, but how many level 50 infiltrators are on your server? These guys had to bust ass to get to where they are.
