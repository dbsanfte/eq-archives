From where my guild and our raiding stands, if you are there you are there for 2 reasons<br>
<br>
1) To get your character an upgrade<br>
<br>
2) To provide your help in getting others upgrades<br>
<br>
That is why I like raiding as it stands right now. It divides people who are willing to be part of something for the greater good from people who are mainly concerned with their own personal advancement. I have been on more raids than I can count where I have died more than 3 times and not even walked away with PP loot. But I was there because I wanted to help, not because I wanted something.<br>
<br>
Add the ability to share xp to raids and people will come for the xp and loot, not to help others.<br>

<br>
We all have our opinions about Raids based on our past experiences.<br>
<br>
The game has MADE it so that &quot;Raid&quot; becomes synonymous with &quot;Item Gathering&quot;.<br>
<br>
We all understand it that way because that's how EQ has been coded/developed/implemented.<br>
<br>
Our understanding is based on our experiences with the game and how it works.<br>
<br>
Because exp isn't shared and HASN'T been shared since March 1999 (well...you COULD have a 7th person in a group for a while...might have been other exploits to get large groups sharing), we've grown accustomed to that, and our expectations reflect that.<br>
<br>
We generally don't go to a raid expecting EXP because we know it's probably not worth the raid-leader's time to carefully balance groups for EXP, while keeping in mind the ultimate goal of efficiently dispatching the mob.  Balanced EXP groups are usually NOT the most efficient method for killing something.<br>
<br>
We have come to understand this and we've conceded that on a &quot;Raid&quot; we will focus on items, and if you want EXP, you should set up a group killing somewhere.  Again, we think this way BECAUSE of the limitations that are in place now.<br>
<br>
If you can CHANGE the basic way things work, then we can change our understanding.<br>
<br>
If they MAKE raid encounters give EXP that is significant when shared amongst everyone, then we LOSE our justification of &quot;That's how raids work, get over it&quot;...the fundamental basis of EXP gathering will have been changed, and our understanding will have to change as well.<br>
<br>
It's similar to raid messages zone-wide.<br>
<br>
People USED /ooc, /shout, and /auction to call out &quot;CH on MA in 10 seconds!&quot;, etc. BECAUSE there wasn't a better way (barring an all GUILD raid using /gu).  The LIMITATIONS of the system created a basic understanding that those channels, in certain zones and with certain-sized raids, would be &quot;OK&quot; to use for raid commands.<br>
<br>
NOW, the &quot;rules&quot; have changed...Verant has implemented Chat Channels, and a &quot;KaelArena&quot; channel can be set up to get those crap commands OUT of the open channels.<br>
<br>
Our understanding and expectations have, then, shifted.  We now use, and enjoy, these channels BECAUSE they are available, and the expectation is that THEY be used rather than the open channels.<br>
<br>
As the game, its mechanics, and it's features change, so must our expectations and practices.<br>
<br>
To say &quot;Raid EXP is BAD because Raids are for ITEMS only&quot; is basically saying &quot;Verant coded it this way, so it SHOULD stay this way, even if they change the mechanics to make it possible to share exp...just because it's always been that way!&quot;<br>
<br>
That makes no sense.  Use what they make available, and change your expectations.<br>

Nenjin:<br>
&quot;Add the ability to share xp to raids and people will come for the xp and loot, not to help others&quot;<br>
<br>
Great point! <br>
<br>
I never really saw it in that light, but I think it's a very valid point. My view of a guild is a group of close knit people enjoying each others company and at the high end raiding is what the game is about.  <br>
<br>
I do however feel that many come for just the loot anyway and contribute very little to guild closeness. They typically leave after gaining all the items they can. There is very little that game mechanics can do about this. <br>
<br>
I would also argue that there are many support classes necessary for a raid to go well, but instead of raiding they play twinks, xp during raid time or generally won't show up due to the perceived reward. If they get xp for their efforts I think raid attendance will go way up. This is something that changed game mechanics could help.<br>

<br>
Whether or not it is those &quot;someones&quot; who say &quot;Raids are not about exp&quot; is immaterial. There's nothing wrong with wanting to share it.<br>
<br>
As far as exp being negligible - I beg to differ. I am sick and tired of sitting LFG for hours on my character to make some exp. Getting a few kills here and there on raids (which is all my main does now, she's sick of the exp grind) really brightens peoples' outlook. My exp bar moves visibly with every kill my groups get. Granted, I've gained 3 yellows of exp since luclin came out, and one AA point, and *maybe* 2 yellows total between the two was real exp grinding. The rest was all earned on raids. 4 months of raids.<br>
<br>
I would GLADLY accept 1/40 of a mob's experience yield instead of 1/6 of it, so that my entire raid force would benefit even in this slight way. How many mobs are killed during a 3-day Hate or Fear raid? Enough where people WOULD see their exp bars move, overall.<br>
<br>
I also realize that this could cause massive AE group problems, so it will probably never happen. I agree with AE groups; I don't agree with AE groups monopolizing zones. (Just like I agree with the Druid's quad-kiting ability, but disagree with using such a skill when a zone is overpopulated and people are scraping for mobs..for cripes sake, share!)<br>
<br>
I guess all that really ticks me off about raiding is when one group is specifically designed to KS. I was swapped into such a group in the Planes once when they wanted a tracker. When that group failed to KS, they freaked out, like someone violated their &quot;rights&quot;. Another peeve is when a main tank &quot;soloes&quot; a mob (i.e. holds off on the assist call) &quot;just because he can&quot;. Raids are not a place for ego. They're a place for teamwork.<br>
<br>
In my experience, raids seem to try to shift exp toward the people who die a lot to try and make the exp loss. I am all for this - swap the guy out of pull team and put him in the KS group for a while, he's worked his tuckus off for the raid already. A wise raid would have a backup to take his place in pull. Many first-time raiders have no clue how much a pull team can die during a multi-day raid, and these people are often the ones who complain about &quot;so-and-so's group getting all the exp&quot;. Before you complain, take a look at the scenario. It may be designed like that.<br>
<br>
Also, unless a raid is very wizard-heavy or rogue-heavy and can spread out the damage, the sole wizard or rogue along is pretty likely to get the experience, period, based on damage. If they're in the same group, good luck trying to steal a kill. After you go on a raid or two you learn this really quick, and then you start to really appreciate the raid leader when they move the wizzy to your group and you score a few kills. I've seen more wizards than any other class ding in the Planes.<br>
<br>
Exp will always be an issue on raids, no matter how many people say &quot;raids are not about exp&quot;....because someone's getting the exp. It's just a matter of how you deal with it personally. Yeah, I'd love for an entire raid force to be able to share experience. That gives everyone a reward for helping out. However, I realize that it could pose problems (such as massive AE groups) and probably won't happen. I am perfectly content to score an occasional KS while raiding, but my prime focus always has been to help my friends score great stuff. Exp is purely bonus, plain and simple.<br>

Raid wide exp....love the idea...never gonna happen, it's gonna require seperate coding most likely, and can't be relegated strictly to raids, groups can now have a 7th member follow getting exp, using a legal 7th man in group basically. <br>
<br>
But don't for a moment think that getting rid of exp from raid mobs will help the matter, especially if this raid goes through a zone that typically has people exping in it.  This means people now have to be determined which ones are on the raids so they don't get exp for their kills, add in the raid wide exp that people want and use it in the situation of people using a 7 man group who need to use the raid coding, and now can't get exp cause of it.  I just think that would be too much of a mess.  Honestly just leave it how it is, I save my exping for when I have time to do it, I know I stand a chance at starting a raid with less exp then I started with, changing things now is gonna just make it worse. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/useiffel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seiffel</A> at: 3/23/02 4:59:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umihos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mihos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 8:23:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22950.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Xp</span><hr size=1> Its going to happen, give it a little while longer.

It is as a lot of you have outlined, to simply to make it easier on the groupleaders, to make it so that a few individuals who dont care about their guildmates can`t monopolize their characters by grouping with other characters and essentially &quot;ensuring&quot; they get most of the exp.<br>
<br>
I am a monk, I get a lot of the exp when I go, but if i could choose between getting 2 orange for myself on a range or 1 orange for me and 1 oranage for a guildmate I would choose the latter. <br>
<br>
If they did away with raid exp so be it.  But as long as its here, there will always be those who do as mentioned above, and those who don`t get in those ks groups who get a bit upset, not necessarily at not getting the exp, but at those who don`t care about them.  So the &quot;raids arn`t for exp&quot; argument positioned here really doesn`t matter cuz thats not what its about. Sure they arn`t about exp, hell for a lot of people who arn`t going to take home an item they arn`t about anything other than being their for your guild.<br>
<br>
What is wrong with sharing that time with the people you are raiding with if everyone is participating ? Is it more important for 3 rogues to always get the raid app than a shaman a cleric and a ranger ? <br>
<br>
Oh, raids arn`t for exp I forgot.
