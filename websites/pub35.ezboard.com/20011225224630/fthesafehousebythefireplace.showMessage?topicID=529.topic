<br>
Hekzin G'Zule was firmly ensconced at his table in The Maiden's Fancy, surrounded by ample booze, his peers in the Roguish Profession (he kept a list of anyone who dared call it the &quot;Rougish&quot; Profession), a rather solicitous pair of &quot;dancers&quot; from downstairs, and a very angry lady who could tear him in half.<br>
<br>
Less stealthy inhabitants of Neriak populated the common room of the tavern: A bard (obviously not a native Teir'Dal, despite his appearance, but everyone was too drunk to turn the singer in) sang a spirited drinking song, trying to drown out a trio of plate-clad warriors who were just drunk enough to think they were bards, too;  a pair of shadowknights sat at the bar, obviously trying to get the young initiate priest of Innoruuk between them intoxicated. A single mage sat in the corner, drowning his sorrows in cheap summoned ale and muttering at an earth elemental.<br>
<br>
Draining his mug of Crow's Special, Hekzin turned to face the cold fury of the lady beside him, and spoke quietly:<br>
<br>
&quot;As I was saying, my lady, the armor is still being developed. Research takes time, and surely you've heard that our Hall hardly has enough recruits to go out and gather the --&quot; he broke off and froze as the telltale prick of a dirk made itself known against his lightly mailed side.<br>
<br>
&quot;--His Majesty cares not one whit for your tired excuses, G'Zule!&quot; Seloxia Punox snarled. &quot;You will have the armor ready for King Naythox within two weeks, or I will deliver to him your worthless hide!&quot;  She dug the point of her dirk into his side, grinning savagely.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Now, now, sister dear,&quot; oozed a deep voice from the shadows behind her, &quot;Surely His Highness will not appreciate his toy soldier interfering with the delicate work of his favorite armourer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fading into view, the silver haired rogue smiled arrogantly at his plate-clad sibling, and extended to the lady her own dirk. &quot;Particularly if his favorite armourer is flayed. Warriors,&quot; he announced smoothly, seating himself and draping an arm about one of the dancers, &quot;No skill, no subtlety, all bluster and brawn. Why don't you go join the drunkards yonder, Seloxia, and leave us men to discuss important business?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seloxia hissed at Pazin, showed him a clenched fist, and stormed off.<br>
<br>
Offering a lecherous smile to the dancing girl tucked under his arm, Pazin Punox turned to Hekzin, who exhaled a sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
&quot;I really ought to head back to the Hall, Pazin. Seloxia is right. I need to finish the armor for the King.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pazin extended an indigo hand and shoved a full mug of Crow's Special toward Hekzin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have another few rounds first, eh? Then we can head downstairs with a few lovelies and - what in the name of Hate is THAT?&quot;<br>
<br>
The rogues both stared, and the raucous din in the tavern fell silent, save for a barely audible thrumming, a low vibration that set the glasses and bottles rattling on the shelves and tables.  In the center of the common room, where none had been, was the telltale gleam of a dimensional portal, and before the sparkling portal stood the figure of a male high elf, clothed in green robes and bearing a bundle of black cloth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Assassin!&quot; spat the figure in High Elven as it turned to face Pazin with a venemous glare, &quot;Bear witness, all ye murderous beings present, that to thy Hateful brother is returned the accursed fruit of his forced union with one of the Feir'Dal, who shall serve the remainder of her life in penance to Tunare's Children.  Spawn of your kind shall never be suffered to grace Faydwer's shores!&quot;<br>
<br>
The high elf, his features twisted in a mask of disdain and disgust, thrust the bundle of cloth at Pazin, who reflexively accepted it.  Mouthing something arcane, the  high elf stepped backwards and vanished into the portal with a peal of thunder.<br>
<br>
Wearing an expression of alarm as the bundle of cloth, which revealed a pale-skinned Feir'Dal infant, began to squirm and wail, Pazin cursed fluently.  He damned the low buzz of jeering gossip which now filled the tavern; he damned the suspicious and icy glares now cast at him by the dancers seated at his table; he damned his misbegotten apprentices for botching the job he'd sent them on, for not completing it before THIS happened; and he damned Hekzin, for choosing that very moment to exit The Maiden's Fancy.<br>
<br>
Damning everything and everyone around him, Pazin Punox covered the squalling infant's mouth with a dark hand, and stepped into the silence of the shadows.<br>
<br>

<br>
Hezkin G'Zule bent over his worktable, frowning in the dim light as he painstakingly stiched the snakeskins together.  A gentle cough sounded before him, and he looked up slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pazin! By Hate, man, you've been gone a week, where in Innoruuk's name have you been?! And don't you ever knock?&quot;<br>
<br>
The cloaked figure before him chuckled softly:<br>
<br>
&quot;There was something that needed doing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pushing the snakeskins aside, Hezkin leaned forward, examining his fellow rogue.<br>
<br>
&quot;The child, then -- you offered the brat to Lord Zexus as a sacrifice for Innoruuk?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Pazin admitted.<br>
<br>
&quot;You fool, Pazin! Rumor abound that Priests of Innoruuk are going to investigate our hall and dispose of us for being &quot;unworthy sons of Hate&quot; -- all because of your past &quot;indiscretions&quot;!  Gods, man! The wood elf girl I can understand, but the halfling? A halfling! That's vile!&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence answered the armorer, who then sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right. What, then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My apprentices disposed of the girl, and I supervised the event.  Her head and bloody heart should prove a proper sacrifice to appease the Priests.  Perrir should be sufficiently ... satisfied.  Indeed, this feat was managed within the very walls of Tunare's sacred stronghold.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pazin's dark face split into a gleaming white smile, and he dumped the gory prizes onto the worktable before turning away and vanishing.<br>
