I simply gave a valid example of one possible situation a woman can find herself in...and suddenly I'm &quot;painting men as evil.&quot;  It's hilarious how common it is for people to categorize a woman who points out certain social inequities between the sexes as a &quot;man-hater.&quot;  Not once did I say men are &quot;evil.&quot;  What IS evil, however, is how there are people who condemn the woman, and the woman alone for an unwanted pregnancy.<br>
<br>
Do I think a woman should recognize what's at stake with sex, and recognize that nobody will look after her the way she should be looking out for herself?  Of course I do.  Do I think a woman made a mistake by letting herself get pregnant if she wasn't using precautions?  I sure do.  Do I know that people make mistakes even under the best of conditions?  DUH, yeah they do...all the time.<br>
<br>
I just DO NOT believe that women should be the only ones to shoulder the &quot;blame&quot; for what happened.  Sorry.  And Nimm, you DID basically insinuate that you put full blame on the woman for an unwanted pregnancy...you certainly made no mention of what the guy did wrong or HIS responsibility...it was all about what you feel the &quot;woman has coming to her for having unprotected sex.&quot;  If you like, I can pull up the quote in my next post, but right now I'm too tired to go back and look for it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Firstly, Jhani, I'm a biochem major...so I think I have a pretty decent understanding of the mechanics involved with human procreation.  I can even throw in a few flow charts on meiosis/mitosis/cell division, along with the reproductive processes for miscellaneous other animals, bacteria, flowering plants, coniferous plants, liverworts, ferns and slime molds if you like.  (Alternation of generations just looks complex...but once you understand the difference between a haploid speciman and a diploid, it's all cream cheese.)  <br>
<br>
So please Jhani, don't talk down to people like they're morons on my account.  I'm pretty sure most people above the age of 12 understand the birds and the bees, as do I.<br>
<br>
Secondly, you talk about not &quot;going easy&quot; on a woman who's become unexpectedly pregnant...<br>
<br>
I would like you to explain what that comment is supposed to mean.  Without hearing anything further from you...one might interpret the statement to mean that a woman should keep an unwanted baby as &quot;punishment&quot; for her &quot;crime.&quot;  Whoa, really humanitarian statement there.  Just what everybody wants to hear...that they were brought into this world to punish their mother for a mistake.  That's right...possibly ruin the mother's life, and bring a child into a world where it will have 2 strikes against it from the moment it's born...just so you can have the sanctimonious satisfaction of seeing a woman pay for some imagined &quot;crime&quot; (i.e. unprotected sex), while her male counterpart gets what kind of &quot;punishment&quot; for doing the same thing?    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ever hear the expression, Judge not, lest thee be judged?  I think it applies here.<br>
<br>
As for using a woman's ability to get pregnant as an excuse to put the blame completely on her...that's the same as saying someone who leaves their wallet on a restaurant table deserves to get it swiped.  Just because somebody is dumb enough to leave a wallet out in the open...does that mean whoever picks it up is exempt from the responsibility for his actions?  I'm curious as to how the, &quot;I'm not guilty of hurting this person because he was stupid enough to let me&quot; defense would stand up in court. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujhanivandolay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jhani Vandolay</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.half-asleep.com/pooh/nav/bee02.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 9:31:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8763.topic&index=84>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://spookachu.homestead.com/files/pumpkin1mini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I'm pretty sure most people above the age of 12 understand the birds and the bees, as do I.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Understanding and acceptance are not one and the same. I'm sure everyone here knows all about the stork, but that doesn't stop them from acting like it's somehow the males' fault that they don't go through labor, etc. Facts of life and all.. accept that part and move on to arguing what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> can</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be changed.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Whoa, really humanitarian statement there.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Thanks for attempting to attribute it to me! Let me explain something about the whole question and answer process.. it's generally considered good form to wait for the questionee to speak for themselves before you start making up whole paragraphs to argue against, claiming they believe it.<br>
<br>
I never said there is anything wrong with getting pregnant, having abortions, not having abortions, that babies are Mommie's Little Punishments, or any of that other crap you chose to spew in my name. However, unless a pregnancy is the result of real rape, the woman <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the last line of defense, so to speak. She shouldn't be considered a &quot;victim&quot; unless she was actually victimized. There's nothing wrong with going on with your life and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> accepting</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the fact that you made a bad choice, instead of trying to throw blame on anyone else. But many of you seem to be writing under the point of view that people shouldn't feel responsible for their own actions. Taking responsibility for yourself is not synonymous with any of the negative attributes you keep implying.<br>
<br>

If you like, I can pull up the quote in my next post, but right now I'm too tired to go back and look for it. </I><br>
<br>
I wish you'd not put quotes around things you're saying I said.  I never said that.  And I'll pull my own quotes up for you that plainly show I NEVER SAID THE FULL BLAME SHOULD BE ON THE WOMAN (repeat that in your head a couple times for me before you misquote me).  Here ya go:<br>
<br>
<B><I>I never said the men weren't completely irresponsible as well. They are. <br>
<br>
Again, there are guys like the example you gave- and they bear as much of the burden (or should) of the blame as the girl. <br>
<br>
Oh, and as far as I'm concerned if a guy irresponsibly impregnates a girl then he damn well should do whatever he can to take care of her needs while she goes through the pregnancy.<br>
<br>
That being said- any man who puts pressure on a girl to have unprotected sex with him is a jackass. Any man who assumes it's solely the woman's responsibility to worry about birth control is a jackass. <br>
<br>
There is a huge lack of responsibility of these mothers getting pregnant as well as guys ditching out on the mom and the kid<br>
<br>
</B></I><br>
<br>
Is it clear yet?  The entire point I am trying to make to you is that BOTH are incredibly irresponsible and BOTH should face the consequences and help that baby to full term as best as they can.  Furthermore, it IS the woman's final decision to have unprotected sex with the guy- otherwise it's called rape.  Don't dance around what I'm trying to say- it's really not that difficult to understand.<br>

That early in the pregnancy, there really isn't much to the fetus.  They're just over three inches long, they are barely recognizable as human, their faces aren't formed, it doesnt even have a formed neck and head yet.  Its not thinking on its own, it has no concious thought.<br>

I  think I got that already.  I'm not debating over the fact that women have the physical responsibility of giving birth.  I would even venture to say that most people understand the reality, which is that men expect women to take care of birth control on their own, because it is females who have the most at stake.  However, it STILL doesn't mean the male who participates in unprotected sex WITH a woman is any LESS ACCOUNTABLE than she is for an unwanted pregnancy.  That was the apparent mentality I saw being thrown around, and THAT is where my objection lies.<br>
<br>
As for putting some statements into quotations...it's called paraphrasing.  I was merely paraphrasing how I interpreted what you were saying.  You had a chance to counter, which you did, and tell me that my interpretation was not correct.  Then you were able clarify what you had intended to say, since your original words didn't quite get the message across.  <br>
<br>
When I want to make a direct quote, I will do so like the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  EVERY SINGLE BIT of that [in reference to an unwanted pregnancy] was HER CHOICE by not using birth control.  Shrugging off responsibility for your action is wrong, especially so when it revolves around another life that you've created.  7 uncomfortable months of a WOMAN'S LIFE so that she can give up that baby for a family dying to have one doesn't seem all that bad to me.  That's the least SHE could do to accept responsibility.<br>
<br>
             ---Nimmbull<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is another good example of how somebody's words can be interpreted to mean something other than what the poster intended.  In his most recent post, Nimmbull explains that he doesn't feel it's all the woman's fault, or that the guy shouldn't take responsibily.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I'm not a mindreader...I can only go by what I see people write here.  Therefore, when I see something like the above post...which is very explicit about saying EVERY LITTLE BIT was HER choice and how 7 months of the WOMAN'S life is the least SHE can do to accept responsibility...well, I get a tad upset.  <br>
<br>
What's so hard about saying, &quot;Well the two PARENTS who got THEMSELVES into this mess should opt for adoption instead of abortion.  Keeping the fetus to term, and giving the resulting baby up for adoption is the least THEY can do to accept THEIR responsibility.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Please tell me...if that's what you meant to say Nimmbull...then why didn't you say it in the first place?  Why was the focal point of your first post so focused on the woman and HER responsibility?  <br>
<br>
Like I said, I'm no mindreader...I go by what I see on this thread.  If there's information missing from your post, or you phrase something in a manner that's not exactly right...then don't get offended when people interpret your words differently than you intended.  This whole thing is about responsibility right?  Well, take responsibility for the fact that 90% of communication is based on how other people perceive you and interpret what you say. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uforceofmotion1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Forceofmotion1</A> at: 7/30/02 7:43:21 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujhanivandolay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jhani Vandolay</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.half-asleep.com/pooh/nav/bee02.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 8:02:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8763.topic&index=93>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://spookachu.homestead.com/files/pumpkin1mini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;so your whole post was just saying, &quot;Yes, women have the physical responsibility for bearing children.&quot;&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

In that last quote you grabbed from me I will admit- the every single bit part was too much.  But it is her final decision on whether or not birth control is used, and that was my point even though it was a bit overstated.

My whole opinion on being pro-choice is not based on whether or not a fetus is a person.  It is based on the fact that the mother is.  People make mistakes, and while people should be responsible for their mistakes not everyone is.  Out lawing abortion will not make it go away.  Out lawing abortion will not make the world a better place.  <br>
<br>
Out lawing abortion will only drive it underground and make the practice unsafe.  More unwanted, and unloved children is not a good thing.  Making a woman who is in no way ready to be a mother bring a child in to the world and rasie it is not a good thing.  Keeping abortion legal IMO is the lesser of two evils, I prefer to have invasive surgical procedures regulated by the government.

Well, that would be the whole crux of the matter wouldn't it? Kind of like defending slavery, by saying that it doesn't matter whether the slave is a person, only whether they are owned by someone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uswipey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 7:21:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8763.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a</span><hr size=1> When I start my own religion, we're gonna be super-conservative.  None of this &quot;life starts at birth&quot;, &quot;Life starts at viability&quot; or even &quot;Life starts at conception&quot;.  Thats for those mamby-pamby bleeding hearts out there.<br>
<br>
Life starts at ovulation!  Any woman who ovulates without getting pregnant is guilty of murder!!<br>
<br>
What of the sperm, you ask?  If an egg is a life, isnt a sperm a life as well, given that they contain complementary genetic information?  NO!  Quite obviously, the spermatozoa are meant to compete with eachother by the designer, or else so many would not be released at once.  Eggs, on the other hand, face no comparable competition, and obviously each and every one is meant to be fertilized...<br>
<br>
Obviously it follows from this line of reasoning that, given that people randomly paired have serious problems conceiving (up to 25%, I hear) it follows that, in order to prevent the sin of murduring the unfertilized egg, women should be allowed as many husbands as it takes to keep them pregnant.  Given that men and women are born in roughtly equal numbers, men will need to be able to have as many wives as they can keep pregnant as well. (50 men, 50 women.  Say each woman requires 4 men on average, to stay pregnant.  Thats 200 men, where only 50 are available.  EAch of those 50 will have to do quadruple duty...)<br>
<br>
Yes...  yes!  Another tenet of my religion!  There can be no virtue without temptation!  Is a man virtuous if he doesnt commit sin, or is he virtuous because he freely resists the temptation to commit sin?  For example, Is a man admirable for not murduring anyone for the last 10 years if he has spent those 10 years stranded alone on a desert isle?  NO! And the logic carries to other sins as well!!  No man should have his opportunity to be virtuous curtailed by a lack of opportunity to sin.  Blue laws should all be repealed.  Drug laws as well.  Any law that makes a sin illegal, thus promoting virtue through the threat of temporal force, should be repealed.  The virtuous in our religion will be just fine....<br>

<br>
Just think of it as a late, late, late term abortion.<br>
<br>
You think that is why the National Organization of Women and other feminist groups were defending Susan Smith and Andrea Yates? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showMessageRange?topicID=8763.topic&start=201&stop=207>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showPrevMessage?topicID=8763.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showNextMessage?topicID=8763.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8763.topic&index=100><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.emailToFriend?topicID=8763.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.threadControl?topicID=8763.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8763.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8763.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath>Logged Out</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
