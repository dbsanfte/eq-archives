Many other games manage to deal with calculating player positions MUCH better...<br>
<br>
As far as people running out of range for that 6.0 nuke why do you even care the nuke never sticks to melees anyway /snicker.  Even if the dd did stick you would need to mez or stick str debuffs in order to hold the melee still or you would die anyway.  Honestly I don't think an enc wins any fight with a melee by playing wizard ANYWAY. I see an enc as a fantastic addition to a group pvp fight NOT a solo killer or  wanna be wizard personally.<br>
<br>
On the nuking through walls thing.  Have you ever thought of following the melee around the corner? If your gonna say but but he'll hit me! I suggest you don't stop right after the corner and instead get some space between the 2 of you before nuking. I honestly see the idea of a melee running back and forth to get a few hits as utterly ridiculous.  As a caster I think I would just back up AS I SAID and nuke them as they come around to me in fact you might consider starting your cast when you hear them come running.<br>
<br>
 Casters run around corners to get away from melees all the time.  Then start nuking from out of sight.  In fact a typical strategy involves making the melee lose track of you then nuking through a wall.  What I'm asking for is to require both parties, caster and melee to have an awareness of their targets position in order to attack and to give both parties a way to respond to that attack.  In other words a level playing field.  You complain about the idea of melees using walls and branching coridors to get out of line of sight and avoid being nuked when casters use the same strategy as it is.  The only differnce is that melees can't attack you from around that corner or behind that wall if he manages to escape behind it.  I would expect both parties to be able to deal with not being able to hit the other until they come within just fine and the pvp experience to be more interesting for it.  In fact a good pvper allready knows he has a much better chance of a kill if he keeps his quary in sight.<br>
<br>
Next as far as blatant exaggeration.  I think correct me if I'm wrong here but I'm under the impression that a 55 mage would have something like 1.2 or 1.4k hp (counting 250hp self buff and assuming pog or similar quality gear) and as to a 55 rogue having close to 3k hp don't make me laugh as a 55 rogue in good gear I have 1650hp in resist gear and only a bit higher in hp ac gear. Good gear being pog armor, dwarf quest armor, epic that sort of thing.  No tov stuff here. <br>
<br>
Btw double 400s are pretty uncommon hell I almost never hit sitting people for more than a total of 600.  Not only that but backstabs can be avoided by not turning your back. In addition our dmg output is compensation for having low hp and ac so get over it. Btw FYI as far as doubles you have to figure that only like 1/2 of backstabs are doubles and often enough either the 1st or the 2nd misses (unless your sitting).  Double backstab is great but melee hits follow different rules than spells and you can't act like a rogue backstabs for double 400s every 7 seconds.  If we could our unbuffed dps would be 114 just from backstabs at 55!  In fact I think it goes something like...<br>
<br>
20% no hits landed<br>
60% 1 hit landed<br>
20% 2 hits landed<br>
<br>
And giving the max dmg as the average is so completely false its ridiculous.  Saying a rogue can double for 400 is nothing like saying a caster can nuke for 800.  A double 400 is actually more like getting a nice crit.<br>
<br>
<br>
You present yourself as the disadvaged party and claim a need for cheap strategies in order to survive but I as someone who has been through a lot of pvp say this is BS.  As a rogue lvl 55 is actually feeling a lot more balanced to me but nothing like being overpowered.<br>
<br>
It occurs to me that people who do badly at pvp are often those who don't start the fight.  The person who starts the fight no matter if its with a sitting double bs or a nice nuke and an attack from a pet has quite an advantage. Might wanna try it some time.<br>

I'm a lvl 54 chanter and I have less than 1.1k hp fully self buffed. I know a few rogues who have way over double that at 59 which is *in range* to me (keep in mind this is *not* RZ and everyone has the best gear they can on 'cause there's no fear of losing it). <br>
<br>
Now if you had to be in line of sight to cast on someone, I would *always* have to be getting too close to melees. Usually I don't even try to kill melees, well I can't if my life depended on it. But I CAN mez them to keep them out of the way while I kill a caster or something. If I had to get in line of sight just to mez, I'd already be spoted by the whole group and prolly eat a few nukes with melees slashing away at me while I try to channel a mez. <br>
<br>
Most wizzies can't even kill an even con warrior because of their hp and resists. They could sit there casting through walls at the afk melee and run oom before he's dead. <br>
<br>
I can tell you've never played a caster 50+ pvp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh yeah and about the levi thing. If you don't want to waste golem wands to dispell the levi'ing caster what about buying levi potions? My rogue always had a backpack full of potions, cure disease, sow, levi, EB, cure poison.<br>
<br>
So basicly you are saying that chanters should not have the ability to PK solo but you're upset because melee's should? If melees grouped up with a caster you would not be having problems with levi, melee range bug (casters can root, snare or cripple), DS's, and los exploiting (since casters can root them). <br>
<br>
One of the best PK's I know is a solo rogue btw. I guess he learned how to work around all these &quot;bugs&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/25/01 5:22:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> The design defects are not so extreme that its impossible to get kills...doesn't mean its good design though. <br>
<br>
Requiring los would mean you really couldn't fight in very tight coridors but the solution to that is...don't fight in very tight coridors in fact as a caster I'm sure you allready know this isn't the best place for you to fight (in fact Id go so far as to say the only way you could fight in this situation is to cheat and cast through a wall where you couldn't be seen or attacked back) and as a pvper Id expect you to know that choosing where and when to fight means a lot.  <br>
<br>
Original statement -rogues have almost 3k <br>
Next statement     -rogues 5 lvls higher than me have 2.2k<br>
<br>
Still trying to exagerate matters to prove your point <br>
<br>
As far as hp totals compare the same lvl chars please...<br>
<br>
54 rogue 1600hp<br>
54 enc 1100hp +640 rune = 1740 dmg absorption <br>
<br>
You might try rune 5 + dmg shield potion (27dmg at your lvl) + feedback (11ds) +fire elemental form (14ds at your lvl) for a total of a 52 dmg shield.  Hell if this doesn't allready hurt them enough you could mez them and recast rune.<br>
<br>
You could also try levitating overhead with a pet on them.  A point about lev, even if I'm leved as a rogue I have a hell of a time actually hitting someone who is flying and if they happen to have lev well you could always dispell em.<br>
<br>
You could try not turning your back on a rogue.<br>
<br>
You could use a charmed pet (dangerous I know) In some cases you could mez, lower their str to nil THEN charm something or use an allready charmed mob to finish them.<br>
<br>
BTW pointing out design flaws or some legitimate pvp strategies as I did above isn't meaning to say rogues suck they don't. As far as your friend there well guess what an awesome pvper is probably going to rock no matter what class he or she plays but that doesn't mean that rogues as a class should have to deal with every gimp caster using what is to me an obviously exploitive strategy.<br>
<br>
I pointed out a few strategies that don't require you to be &quot;too close&quot; to a melee unless too close is anywhere they can see you and attack you back lol which personally is what I think your saying.<br>
<br>
Considering the feedback I would be quite happy if the following changes were made...<br>
<br>
-Line of sight required on all nukes debuffs and dots.<br>
-Charm no longer poofed pets.<br>
-Pumice casting time was lowered somewhat or a new pumice was added that doesn't proc till 50 with a lower casting time.  If you did this you could dispose of golem wands they are kinda unbalancing in some cases.<br>
-The pet attack assist trick was nerfed and /invite playername was a command usable zone wide to make Coth possible.<br>
-Ghosting was adressed in some fashion<br>
-The position of a player you have targeted relative to you should be calculated more precisely and checked more often so that players could hit eachother more easily with melee attacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Requests removed for shaman ds and levitate changes.<br>
<br>
I think that all of these requests would lead to more interesting and more balanced gameplay. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/25/01 7:26:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> Forgot to adress this bs here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Explain to me, how is a mage for example, going to kill a rogue - without the ability to kite you with his pet? you can kill him in close to one backstab, or in a few attack rounds, he cant channel spells through dual wield, and all his spells only does 66percent of their damage against you, not counting your ressists.  No thats right, he cant.&quot;<br>
<br>
You can't channel scars of sigil a 2 second spell? /boggle<br>
<br>
A kill with one double backstab doesn't occur till lvl 59 with duelist disc and even so... if you see a rogue go duelist BACKUP for the 9 seconds till it wears off!<br>
<br>
Your pet should play a role in the fight but the run around till your pet beats the rogue down because the melee range bug prevents him from hitting you is just damn lame.  Its a gimp tactic.<br>
<br>
Bet the idea that your pet would do reduced dmg vs a moving target made your blood boil.  You think thats how melees feel?  You wanna suggest a different solution to keep people from using the above gimp tactic than either of the 2 ideas I presented? Go ahead.<br>
<br>
I suppose you could let us evade the pet. Say the pet lose the ability to autofollow for 5 seconds(evade is usable every 10 seconds and doesn't always work)  Make the ability fail if the rogue remains in the same area right after evading.  Meaning if the mage is moving around trying to cast the pet attacks for 100% of the time.  If the mage is just fleeing with the pet attacking the pet wont be able to do near as much dmg. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A> at: 11/25/01 7:47:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urhainy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhainy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/26/01 7:24:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> My main point about the line of sight thing is that if they did change it, it would way to easy to exploit by melees AND casters.

Interesting pvp is where both parties have to think about where and what their opponent is doing.
