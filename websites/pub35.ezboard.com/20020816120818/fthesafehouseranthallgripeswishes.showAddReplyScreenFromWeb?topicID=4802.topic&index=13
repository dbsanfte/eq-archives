<br>
Aidon, you're right in what you said. I hold those who dogged thier way to 60 in high esteem. As well as those who were there when quests were first released and got the old items by going and getting them, be it with a group or solo...better than simply paying off someone who has it to give it to you. <br>
<br>
In reference to my comment about pride in items, I didn't mean that one shouldn't take pride in the items you have. Each item was new and difficult to get at one point or another. I wrote from a standpoint of today though: when the Soulfire is easily outclassed by weapons the average level 20 paladin can afford, and the burning rapier has become a rare sight to see on any rogue. Most skip it because the weapons are not worth the time and money to get them...those that do get them, don't do it because it's practical, but because it's a class defined item. You see a flaming 2HS and you think "Paly" immediately. You see a rogue who marked himself as "Redeemed" under his profile, and you know that the rogue likes to put that extra touch into his character's personality. It's those people I was talking about. We all value our characters: it's the ones who do the things that are absolutely futile nowdays that define the real story behind their character. (Heck, most people don't even bother filling out their profs anymore...)<br>
<br>
Again, I say that I respect those who dogged thier way to their uber level. It's those who haev gotten there, or have a friend who's gotten there, and then twink a new alt with gear that no character of that level should have, and then complain that the other people around them aren't up to standards in an area that the individual could prolly solo with that level gear that piss me off. Each class/race combo was designed to provide it's own unique possibilites to be explored. Yet, at least 1/4- 1/3 of the people I've seen who've started an alt are determined to reach 60 as fast as possible, rather than take thier time, enjoy the lower levels more, and search through the sum total of the possibilities for thier class/race. <br>
<br>
I won't say that I'm superior to anyone, or that my EQ experience has been better than yours. You've gotten a long way, and are still continuing to journey. Likewise, I too have come a good distance, and I have a very long way to go. So my plea is that those of you who seek uberness quickly, be it your alt or your main, don't spoil the game for those of us who like a slow pace with adavancement and like to goof off, just for the sake of goofing off. EverQuest is, after all, a game.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/usantril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santril</A> at: 7/5/02 10:46:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upikawel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pikawel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/27/02 4:32:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4802.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pikawel.com/retard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Absolutely Beautiful.</span><hr size=1> Low levels were a hell of a better time than fighting over spawns in Velks (rallos zek player here...).

Many people just choose to ingnore them. The proudest day of my rogue career was claiming my burning rapier. It wasn't a terribly great weapon, but I wielded it well into my 30's. I just feel sorry for all the new players who get it reasonably easy now. The challenge has been removed from the game at lower levels, because the game has become a high level game now. Getting a full suit of Ravenscale consists of sitting in EC and auctioning for it. I recently went down to the Feerott to help a friend get his Ravenscale Chest Guard back after his account was hacked, only to find the silverflanked guardian that drops it was easily solo'd by me. I remember organising a full group of 40 -45's to get mine, and that wasn't a cake walk either. I don't hold high level gamers in contempt, unless they hold low level gamers in contemp. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaidden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidden</A> at: 6/8/02 7:44:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugreldek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Greldek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/6/02 11:56:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4802.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.newgumbrea.com/images/ico-gruffi.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Absolutely Beautiful.</span><hr size=1> <I>The low 50s after 3 years.</I><br>
