------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
** PvP changes **<br>
<br>
We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of EverQuest:<br>
 <br>
- Consider:  /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character.  The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him.  The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack.  And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.  This will only take effect on PvP servers.<br>
<br>
- Sanctuary Levels:  Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.  This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers.<br>
<br>
- De-Leveling:  Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a character two levels higher.  This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character.  This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise).  So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br>
<br>
These are the first of the things that we plan to.  We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** Quest Changes **<br>
<br>
-  We've made a change to the Velious armor quests.  The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that give out rewards for these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items to.  You will have to be considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to be able to complete these quests.  If you are doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less picky, and they only require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.<br>
<br>
- The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Bug Fixes **<br>
<br>
- Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the attack button as it should.<br>
<br>
- Text that once read: &quot;You cannot remove this affect.&quot; now reads &quot;You cannot remove this effect.&quot;  Changed by popular demand... :)<br>
<br>
- Food Emotes:  Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food will now properly display the appropriate emote to those in the area.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Item Changes **<br>
<br>
- The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot.<br>
<br>
- Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the faster your bow.  We will not be listing the speed increase a quiver will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers by their ability to reduce the weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers have this property).<br>
<br>
- The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that it is out of charges.  You may need to contact your GM to replace the item with a new version if it is still acting strangely.<br>
 <br>
- The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item.  Be aware, once you remove it from your finger, it will not go back onto that finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should.<br>
<br>
- The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the Gathering.<br>
<br>
- The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used up, and should display the correct number of charges.<br>
<br>
- The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of a range of 0.<br>
<br>
- The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and secondary slots.<br>
<br>
- The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic.<br>
<br>
- The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large.  This might cause you a little reorganization in your inventory.<br>
<br>
- Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used to bash.<br>
<br>
- The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spell Changes and Additions **<br>
<br>
- Translocation spells:  Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added (Translocate: Fay, Tox, North, Combine and Group).  Translocate spells send the group to the location, while the Wizard remains behind.  Translocate Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to their own <br>
bind points.  Translocate Group can be found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up easily).  The others are available on an exclusive vendor.  All Translocate spells (even the original Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted before the target will be sent.  And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves.<br>
<br>
- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased.<br>
<br>
- GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from resurrectionGM to Customer Service Resurrection so that players will be able to better tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM staff. GM resurrection will no longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly Ressed with full Hit Points and Mana.<br>
<br>
- Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now prevent the caster from being stunned when hit for their duration.<br>
<br>
- The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep.  This change was made to prevent an exploit.<br>
<br>
 <br>
** Feature Additions and Changes **<br>
<br>
- Looting text has been changed.  You will now see a -- before and after any loot messages.  This has been changed primarily to help prevent any fake looting messages from being thought of as real.<br>
<br>
- When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you what you have just looted.<br>
<br>
- Expanded Friends List:  The Friends List will now hold 30 character names.  And each character has its own friends list.  You can find and edit this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside the game.  You can locate the text files in your EverQuest directory.  The files will look like this:  &lt;character name&gt;_&lt;#&gt;.ini.  The default Friends List for existing and new characters will be your old Friends List.<br>
<br>
- The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you accidentally pick up another item while they are open.  This should prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item.<br>
<br>
- When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by having the container selected and clicking the sell button.  The merchant will tell you that you need to empty the container before the merchant will buy it.  This should prevent folks from accidentally selling items that they did not know were in those containers.<br>
<br>
- You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.<br>
<br>
- There is a new /consider message: &quot;regards you as an ally&quot;.  This is the highest level of friendliness that an NPC will register using the /consider command.  The faction required to reach this rating is significantly higher than 'warmly'.<br>
<br>

I personally liked the idea of being KoS to those smelly giants and conning them out of their armor using my roguely abilities.  We can only hope its only the class specific armor quests that are affected this way. I don't see how anyone will manage to raise Tormax or the Dain to ally the way faction works now, I've never even managed to get indiff with the Dain after many Kael raids and multiple faction hits from the coldain ring. <p>Finneus Fingers, Karana<BR>

whew. the greatness. to wait 2 years to be able to tidy up stuff intuitively. How much more could be done if EQ were only 'labour of love' of 2.5 creative, willing people, and not of phat prophit lewt.<br>
<br>
---<br>
This reminds me of a concept of "conditioned happiness", i.e. when you feel great happiness after a cause of dissatisfaction has been removed. <br>
The leading old joke (austrian) that illustrates it goes approx like this:<br>
<br>
~<br>
Rudi goes for a week trip and leaves his pet doggy to Bobby, his best, yet not so smart friend. <br>
<br>
"The only thing you have to watch for is that you make doggy a pleasant surprise every day once - he is used to having it!" - says Rudi before departing. Bobby scratches his head.<br>
<br>
A week later on the train station, Bobby comes with the dog to greet his friend that has just returned. He helps him with suitcases, etc., and just before they part Bobby exclaims: "Ouch almost forgotten!" and grabs the doggy by its tail, starting to whoosh it around his head in circular motion.<br>
<br>
"EEEck what are you DOING?!" - cries Rudi.<br>
<br>
"Well, just following your instructions concerning the doggie" - somewhat surprised Bobby asks - "You cannot imagine HOW HAPPY it is once I let it down onto ground again."<br>

Oh well, I mainly went with it for the other quests, and hopefully by the time I'm finished with all them I'll be high enough level to raid ToV and have high enough faction from knocking off all those quests.  Maybe.<br>
<br>
Other than that, though, there are a lot of good, simple, mechanical changes here.  Bank inventory change, merchants, lots of simple things that have been bothering everyone for ages now.

The faction thing I don't like.  Thats a lot of hard work to get to that faction.  But I'm guessing it went in to prevent someone abbusing the faction though I'd guess the people doing it have their sets and are laughing all the way to the bank now.<br>

I just hope buyable jboots went in.  And that the Collar of the Storm quest is fixed. <p><table>

Try giving 4 giant helmets at a time to whatever his name is thats standing to the left of the Dain when your facing the Dain. That raises Dain faction pretty well. Also try killing some of the quest givers (green) in Kael behind Tormax. Between those two things I got warmly with Dain with little effort - not that that did me any good. <p>Mikar Vicarious <BR>

 - When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by having the container selected and clicking the sell button. The merchant will tell you that you need to empty the container before the merchant will buy it. This should prevent folks from accidentally selling items that they did not know were in those containers.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Well... between this and the previous change to trade containers that won't allow you to use them to destroy everything in them, Digging down to the hidden inventory of vendors is becoming almost prohibitively time consuming.<br>
I make a lot of money and get a lot of trade components by mining, so i havent really been in favor of the scrolling inventory, as it would allow everyone to easily buy up the good stuff instead of that good stuff going to me (got a smoldering brand for 133 pp saturday) Having to click every dang container open, then click every individual slot to sell will be maddening.<br>

<br>
Woot! Reputable player! =D<br>
<br>
Anyway, not sure what you are referring to here.  I don't remember posting anything like that...<br>
<br>
However, once I *did* post that I picked Kazon Stormhammer's pocket and got a Coldain Head!  (This was before they were tagged MAGIC.)<br>
<br>
More likely than not, some player just tried handing him a head to see if anything would happen.<br>
<br>
The only thing I know about their relationship comes from the Velious Manual.<br>
<br>
http://www.station.sony.com/velious/ESOV.pdf<br>
<br>
According to the story, the first dwarves in Velious originated in Faydwer, and were stranded there after a storm.  Their mission had originally been to seek out building supples for a dwarf city (Thurgadin?).  Their leader was Colin Dain (hence "Coldain"), who guided them in the early years and sacrificed himself in defense against the Kromrif.<br>
<br>
I don't see anything about problems between the Coldain and the old world dwarves, the only link being that the Coldain are descendents of those ancient shipwrecked dwarves.<br>
