What if an Critblade went straight weapon/cs and everything else into stealth.<br>
You'd have 50 Weapon and 50 CS, and 37 or higher stealth with autotraining, which wouldnt be hard to max at all.<br>
I realize, the class is missing envenom, which is extremely useful, but would the bonus to dmg from maxing a weapon perhaps help to such a degree with perfs that it would outweigh envenom?<br>
Just an idea, feedback please =D <p><hr>

<br>
I remember one guy was very keen on this build but he was level 46 or so and he found it very successful.  His method was to chose a slightly faster wep (4.4 delay 2H sword drop), take Aug Quick 2, and Master of Arms 2, and lots of +Quick items so that he could bring his total delay down to 3.3.  This meant that he could get his CD off before the target could quickcast/mez him.  He found it very successful until he started going up against epic.<br>
<br>
Targets with epic will have insane damage resist and especially Slash resist (which is all an SB can have).  In the fight against an epic, it's not gonna be _just_ raw damage, it's gonna be styles that do high reaction-based dmg and stun/bleed/debuff, and just the CS line is rather poor for this.<br>
<br>
I think it's one of those &quot;nice in theory, difficult to use in practice&quot; kind of things.<br>
<br>
The real truth about a 2H'r is that it seems like &quot;da'bomb&quot; until about level 35 (i.e., quite powerful through the BGs), but after that it's liabilities start showing.  By the time you are in your 40s you never use it... other than as a easy poison-switch, which you are better to have a second axe in Inv for... so that throws out the whole 2H'r as a viable wep.  A 2H'r helps you level, helps you in the low levels, but in all honestly has almost no role in end-game (which is where most of your time is spent) unless you are hyper-specialized and like to wait around for the perfect targets [read people not-wearing epic = lower con = you could kill anyways].<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.<br>

Just giving feedback on what I've encountered so far.  <br>
I find it more useful to have two 2h wpns on me. I use the same poison on them. One is 4.5sec, 99% quality,  player-crafted. I use it when I'm out just running around in a group or soloing. <br>
I use the 5.6sec delay Maligned Avernal Sword from DF when I defend the keep or know I'm about to PA a target. I just equip it from my pack. <br>
I have +quick, +dex and +str items that I alternate out for either sword. i.e...when out soloing or searching and destroying, I have the quickness items on with the faster sword. When about to get a PA off, I slap on the str items and epuip the slower 2h, if it's at all possible. It's not always. But, that's okay with me. <br>
I am a critblade. But, only 35th. So, I have yet to run into the problems the higher-lvls run into. I for one don't think I will raise crit strike over 44, if even that much. I won't use L-A unless I see better results from it for the amount of spec pts it costs to be useful. I think it's better to get a high-wpn and enven spec only from what I've experienced so far. And, I could care less about ever getting lifebane. But, enervating and disease seem to be great for me. I almost never use snare in RvR. But, I do have a very fast 1h that I keep snare poison on just in case. <br>
I also, have found it best for me not to rely on the slower 2h as a main weapon. I think of it as a specialized weapon. I refer to mine as 'The Driver'. Great for tee shots. But, I don't use it running around any more than Tiger Woods would use his driver on the fairways. <br>
I also switch to 1h/shield if I think it's necessary. Most sb's shun shields. But, I've found their bonuses and resists to be quite useful. <br>
When most higher-lvl sb's that I've talked to tell me about the limitations of the critblade template; 9 times out of 10, it seems they're referring to fighting infiltrators. <br>
I don't mean this next part as a flame in any way. So, please no higher-lvl sb's jump down my throat. But, from the posts that I've read here and other places; 5-specs, soulblades, nor sz's are having any more success against inf's than critblades. I consider that to be more of a problem caused by Mythic's bumbling with styles, weapon limitations of sb's, and spec point imbalancing more than anything else. And, Epic Armors seem to have caused more problems than they fixed. <br>
I think I will remain a critblade. I just like the way they work.  If I don't like it after a time of running around at 50th, I'll respec when/if it's ever offered or cancel the account and go on to a better game.  <br>

Perhaps snare will do it.  I think may be perf with a slower sword with snare on it, then switch out weapons to a faster sword with the dot/debuff or disease to taste.<br>
<br>
I know some critblades that are doing okay.<br>

I chose 5 spec because i think it's a bit more rounded.<br>
