I hope that you are enjoying the sanctuary that this beautiful city of ours provides.  We go through great efforts to keep this city not only clean, but extremely safe as well.  Have you ever wondered about the lengths to which we have to work to maintain the safety of a city as fine as this? <br><br>You say, 'what lengths?'<br><br>Examiner Malikin says 'We have to work with great diligence and determination to maintain the security of this sanctum.  There are elements that are set on defiling our work here.  These antagonists seem to prefer attempts at corrupting people from within our ranks.  Weak minds are inevitable, so corruption is unavoidable.  That is why the Eye is necessary.  We are not here to pry or spy on anyone.  We simply maintain the security of our sanctum and weed out any unsavory elements.  If you're interested in learning more about the Eye, I can assign you a simple task or two. <br><br>You say, 'what task?'<br><br>Examiner Malikin says 'Simple tasks go a great distance to establish trust.  I may know of someone who can help you to establish yourself within the ranks of the Eye.  If you are interested in performing a task of that nature I can get you started at this time.  Would you like to begin? <br><br>You say, 'i would like to begin.'<br><br>Examiner Malikin says 'Very well, Moosman.  Please, take this coin to Questioner Ontu.  She will advise you on your next course of action.  There is a decided lack of direction in this matter, for a member of the Eye should always be able to find people.  This will be good practice for you. Take care.  I hope to speak to you again soon. <br><br>-- She is in one of the Pyramid structures and goes by the name Percontorius... not Questioner.<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Percontorius Ontu'<br><br>Percontorius Ontu says 'Greetings, Moosman. <br><br>Percontorius Ontu touches the coin to the back of her hand and then looks up with a smile. 'Please take this back to its source,' she says and nods.  You feel the coin return to your hand.  Your palm tingles slightly and then the sensation fades. <br><br>Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got better.<br>Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Heart of Seru got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Seru got better.<br>Your faction standing with Haven Smugglers got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got worse.<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>Examiner Malikin says 'Good job! I'm glad that you have returned. I'm also very glad that you were able to see this task as what it was, a purpose to be fulfilled.  I'm not sure that you understand, so please allow me to elaborate.  The coin that I handed you has great value.  That value is obvious in the fact that the coin is made of a precious metal and carries with it more weight than a standard coin.  That said, you did not take the coin for your personal gain.  You simply carried out your purpose.  The fact that you can be trusted has earned you that coin. Do you understand the meaning of the task now? <br><br><br>You say, 'i understand the meaning of the task.'<br><br>Examiner Malikin says 'Very good, for I have another task to offer you if you would like to continue.  This one is a bit more complicated. Im sure that you can handle it, but I need you to be sure as well.  I need this to be a surprise.  Do you think that you are prepared to handle an issue that will require both stealth and secrecy? <br><br>You say, 'i am prepared.'<br><br>Examiner Malikin says 'Please take the coin that I have just given you and find my friend, Consis Sinsolus.  He can often be found walking in one of the park areas.  I'm beginning to believe that he has a mild infatuation with trees.  Please take the coin that I have given you and slip it into my friend's left coat pocket.  When you do so, please remove the coin that you will find in his pocket and bring it to me.  Accomplish this task without error and I may have a special task for you.  Take care not to get caught. I would prefer that the swap remain a surprise for him to discover on his own. <br><br>-- I figured this to be a rogue type of quest but turned out just handing in the coin to him worked out fine.<br><br>Consis Sinsolus turns to look at you for a moment, but does not appear to notice that you made the swap. <br><br>Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got better.<br>Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Heart of Seru got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Seru got better.<br>Your faction standing with Hand Legionnaries got better.<br>Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got worse.<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>Examiner Malikin says 'Splendid job, Moosman! You managed that task quite nicely.  Please, keep the coin.  The most important part of that task was the fact that you did not stop to question what was being asked of you.  That sort of trust is commendable.  The Eye is looking for people like you.  We need people who display not only integrity, but trust.  Trust in our purpose here and you will do well.  Our means may seem a bit harsh at times, but we are here to protect our people from an enemy whose methods are without honor.  It is one of those very attacks on our people that I will need your help with at this time. <br><br>--------------------------<br><br>This is as far as i have made it. Cannot seem to get him to fill me in on the details of my next task.  Anyone working on this and found a way to get him to give the next segment?<br><br>Moosius Bloodstane - Xegony <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uziann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ziann</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/20/01 8:36:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3578.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> theres like 4 threads on this <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=myndrall>myndrall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/24/01 6:07:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3578.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> link to other threads?
