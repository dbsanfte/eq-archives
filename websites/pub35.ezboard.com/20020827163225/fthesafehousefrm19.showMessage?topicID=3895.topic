If its not then what is? What else is in place that we can measure to gauge a classes power then Realm Points? In a word, nothing. We dont have a benchmark test, a trade scale or a handbook that says this ablity is worth this much, and that this ablity is worth that much. Others might say realm balance has a large impact on the totals, but is not realm balance a gauge of realm strenght? Realm strength is comprised of class strenght<br><br>As much as I hate to say it RP's is the only tool that will measure the total ablities of a class, how they function together, and how well they are put into application. To quote a phrase &quot;The numbers dont lie.&quot; This is statical data that is uncut, unmanipulated, and therefore has no bias to one class or the other.<br><br>So with this in hand I can see alot of truth to Chris's point. As much as I dont like it he is in fact right. We are in fact one of the most fun and successful classes in DAoC. Like it or not we cant realistical look for improvements to our classes based on this.<br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrendelblackhammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brendel Blackhammer</A> at: 8/5/02 2:58:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usanlaildsnayel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanlail DSnayel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 3:29:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3895.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Information from the &quot;Seer&quot; and how it affects</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;To quote a phrase &quot;The numbers dont lie.&quot; This is statical data that is uncut, unmanipulated, and therefore has no bias to one class or the other.<br><br>If you really believe that you're incredibly naive.  I recommend you read a book titled &quot;How to Lie With Statistics&quot; published by Darrell Huff in 1954.  Nothing has changed in lying with numbers since way back then.<br><br>What you're showing is only part of the data and therefore IS cut, manipulated and has bias.  A key piece of data you're missing is the population count for each class.  The total RPs for each class are useless without it.<br><br>Here's another way to split the same data:<br><br>Last 7 day in top 25:<br>1 - Shadowblade<br>2 - Nightshade<br>3 - Hero<br>4 - Bard<br><br>Does this mean Shadowblades and Nightshades are the most powerful classes on all the servers?  Nope, but I could certainly argue that position given what I show.  Of course since I didn't tell you what the population of each class is on each server this doesn't mean any more than the initial data you posted.  Just because what I show you is true, doesn't mean its the whole truth. <p>Sanlail Swiftpaw<BR>44th Nightshade<BR>Legendary Master Tailor<BR>Cymun Gan Greigiau<BR>Guenivere<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 3:37:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3895.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.camelotherald.com/guilds/nightshade.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Information from the &quot;Seer&quot; and how it affects</span><hr size=1> /sniffs and hugs Sanlail<br><br><br>THANK YOU!

Speaking for myself, I don't solo anymore because there just aren't enough stragglers out in the frontier that I can take.  If I happen to be grouped with an Eldritch or a Ment, I'm likely to be able to make a ton of RPs by simply standing around doing nothing.  So, based on that point of view, those numbers could indicate that Nightshades have been *forced* to group because of their inherent weaknesses.  (I'm not saying that, only stating that one *could* interpret the numbers that way.)<br><br>Nowhere does it say how many hours were put into RvRing during that particular week.  I haven't played at all in the past 2 weeks.  Chances are very good another Shade has made more RPs than I have, no?  Does that mean the other Shade is more uber than I am?  No, it only means he played more.<br><br>People tend to interpret numbers the way they best fit their expectations.<br><br>Tiwi of Tristan<br>lvl 50 Nightshade (on hiatus)<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 6:29:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3895.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Information from the &quot;Seer&quot; and how it affects</span><hr size=1> Hey,<br><br>I agree it's hard to say why Nightshades are rocking in rps, but I will say one thing about nightshades.  They rock.  I am not disagreeing Elaa's testing that talks about one on one, but a group of 6 nightshades wiped out 18 defenders in a keep I was in last night.  <br><br>I kept them off the walls for a short while.  However once that was done they sat on the walls and cast into the keep and killed everyone.  Solo that ranged attack doesn't hurt but get a few together and they woop.  Add the ability to go onto the walls of a keep they are trying to take and cast down inside, they rock.  I am sure that there are ways to counter this..ae mes, ae stun, more sbs to name a few, but they were very effective.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br>Mel<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uraggoktp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaggokTP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 6:55:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3895.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~pmhigg/DAoC/tree.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Information from the &quot;Seer&quot; and how it affects</span><hr size=1> I was at a keep raid with 6 or 7 other Infiltrators once.

The point was to show why Mythic will not be looking to improve our classes anytime soon. As can be seen from the RP totals infiltrators/nightshades/shadowblades are all doing quite nicely in the RP department.<br><br>But given the fact that a few nightshades dont like what this indicates I will address a few issues.<br><br>1) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     &quot;The data does not take into account population effects&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>This is average data. They take the top 25 from each class per server. So its the grand total divided by 500 people. Average data normalized data for uneven sample sizes, and the sample size is more then plenty to remove any outlying data points that might swing the mean. In other words population is very much in effect in this data<br><br>2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     &quot;Nightshades get more RP's because we are all grouped&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>What does this have to do with the price of tea in China? Your assuming that nightshades never go solo and that infiltrators and shadowblades always solo. Thats a pretty far stretch. I group and I go solo with about equal frequency, &amp; I know people that go from one end of the spectrum to the other.  Granted you will get more RP's grouping, but where does it read &quot;Nightshades group more then other assassins&quot;?<br><br>3) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;RP totals are only an indication that of how often you RvR&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>This might be true comparing one person to another. But if you take the top 25 of one class and the top 25 of another, across all servers, I will bet you the total time they put in is about even. It would be like saying &quot;He plays an armsmen and therefore he plays more then a warrior&quot; You shouldnt be able to read anything more into that statement other then its a complete disconnect, and when we are talking about the averages the same applies.<br><br>4) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Nightshades are only on top because they group with overpowered Enchanters&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>This might be part of the problem. But I dont think one class is going to shoot every other class in the realm to the top of the RP's list.
