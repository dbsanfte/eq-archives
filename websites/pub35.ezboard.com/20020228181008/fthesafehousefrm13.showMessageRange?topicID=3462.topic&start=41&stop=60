Curious as to what the trivial rates are for the warrior dagger blade and the beastlord sinew lashings.  We know the lashings are not trivial at 74 tailoring... sigh.  Looks like this is gonna be tough.<br>

Just pullin your tail.  Those were some scary beasts, eh?  I thought so.  I've got a dagger that helps me to deal with them.  It's made in a special way to hurt the wolves more than usual.  If you want one, you're going to need to make your own.  I still got the molds that I used when I was craftin blades for people.  If you run this status report to Bookkeeper Leaha in the Grunt Forest outpost for me, I'll go by my house and get the molds for you.  Sound like a deal?  I thought so.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I was then sent on a fairly simple and mildly humorous errand, running a report to the Vah Shir outpost in Grimling Forest, having it also signed by a guard at the outpost back in Hollowshade Moor, then returning with the signed report to the Khala Dun.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Khala Dun Kuash says 'Thank you very much.  I see you got it all filled out.  I gathered up all of those molds for you while you were gone.  You can even have this old hilt that I found with them.  Make sure you keep them in a safe place.  You're going to need them and the books that the book fellow Qua sells.  He's got a bunch of them and a kit that you'll need.  When you get done with makin your dagger, bring it back by here with your cloak and I'll show you a surprise!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I received two molds--a dagger mold and a claws mold--along with the hilt.  According to the books Qua sells (I believe Volume III), each class will have a specific hilt that they will need to use in the final weapon combine.<br>
<br>
Note that I received both a dagger mold AND a claws mold.  There seems to have been a misperception earlier in this thread that beastlords use their existing claw set in lieu of the porous dagger blade and ceramic dagger sleeve components--this is not the case.  If you are a beastlord, you will have to get a warrior to craft you porous claws and a bard to craft you the ceramic claw sleeve set.<br>
<br>
I imagine early on you will see much trading--i.e. as a warrior I may end up making the blade five times (well, four blades and one set of claws <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), once for myself and the other four in exchange for each class component.<br>
<br>
I will have to get some levelling done so I can less painfully &quot;farm&quot; sonic wolves for the blood and &quot;powered&quot; claws (have they fixed that misspelling yet? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) without resorting to using my main (Chiba) to do the killing for me.  (Full fledged sonic wolves are still very red to Eclair.)  Alas, I had &quot;powered&quot; claws a while back and destroyed them right before I stumbled on the books detailing the construction of the sonic wolf bane weapons.  D'oh!<br>
<br>
I will also need to work on my smithing.  I managed the bolts for the horned shield at skill 42 but I do not believe they were yet trivial, so I imagine the trivial for porous dagger blade/claws will be up there, perhaps at mastery (101+) levels.<br>
<br>
I really hope the sonic wolf bane weapons have stats and utility that transcend what is normally achievable at the level intended (which I guess is in the low 30's, but that's a very rough guess).  And I would like to think the class weapon quests continue past the sonic wolf bane stage.  I would not mind to see something Greenmist-caliber at the end of the warrior quests. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublyghtnihilist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BlyghtNihilist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/16/01 12:47:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3462.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The warrior portion of the sonic bane weapon</span><hr size=1> Still no sign of Black Silt Clay?

That class (and Vah Shir only) is the only class that can make that piece, due to it being triggered by part of your earlier quest.  For example I have a Vah Shir Beastlord, and part of my quest requires me turning in two owl claws *and my quest cloak* (which I get back) for a dowling that I use to make the toughened lashes.  Once I make those lashes I can then trade it with another class (rogue, warrior, bard or shaman) for their piece.  Repeat making toughened lashes till you've given your piece to all the other classes, and they've given their piece to you (warriors make the blade, bards make the container, rogues make the poison, beastlords make the lashes and shaman make a metal strainer).  Combine all the different pieces in the weapon making box, and there you get your bane weapon.  Also all the other classes can do the same and make their weapons also.  I'm sure at a certain point if this weapon turns out to be absolutely great you'll even be able to sell your extra pieces to various up and coming questors etc. if that floats your boat.<br>
<br>
Now this sounds easier then it is (lol).  At a skill of 30ish tailoring making the lashes is *not* trivial at all (failed once already).  Most of the drops are between rare and uncommon.<br>
<br>
Assuming no fails, you'll have to get 5 of each item on your &quot;shopping list&quot; and then find a class of each other that is as far along in the quest as yourself.  I would say minimum level (unless helped by higher level characters) to get to the point in the quest where you can make your piece and acquire the reagants for it is LVL20 (I believe rogues can't even do poison until then anyways).<br>
<br>
I'm kindof in a love/hate relationship with this quest.  While very interesting it is also very time consuming and somewhat frustrating (rare drops, bad xp, undercon mobs etc.).   The fact that it's so symbiotic with the other classes is cool also, but again a hassle (have to find 4 other players at the same point you are and all ready to trade pieces).<br>
<br>
Still plugging away, hopefully I'll have a few more lashes made up in the next week and some warriors/shaman and rogues will be far enough in the quest to do some trading =)<br>

Excellent, you have returned to me with your tail intact!  The foe that you encountered was a young creature.  The pack of wolves that roam the moor prove to be quite a problem for our scouts.  I will assist you in learning a method that will allow you to build and assist others in building a weapon that bites at the very spirit of these beasts.  Take these claw mounts, and use them in conjunction with the tomes Qua sells.<br>

In the end he asks for you to return with your new weapons and cloak.<br>

So if we do the same thing as everyone else, and end up with the generic wolf bane claws... What the hell do we do with the Claw Mount that he gives us (Called Reinforced Claw Mount) and our old claws.<br>

It made sense that we'd replace parts of our needed bits, but if thats not the case then we'll have to make the generic claws, and then throw them in the weapon assembler with the mount, and our quest claws, and hope that does something.<br>

<br>
Just a guess, other then that I'm not really sure what the mounts could be for.  If we just combine the 5 class items then maybe we turn in the mounts back to the old NPC that gave them too us, or maybe the item we get from the combine of the 5 yields us something we can further enhance with the mounts.<br>
<br>
I don't think the mounts are our hilt because both the bard and warrior quests have specific patterns for our claws, hence the note in the book (when you get their class piece make sure it's a claw version).<br>

               The porous claws were trivial at 142 smithing, made first try.<br>
               The Ceramic claw sleeve was not trivial at 102.<br>
               The Sonic Wolf Bane did not seem to do a skill check when combined in the mortar.  It was not trivial at 104 when baked in the oven.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lashings were made successfully at 22 skill, I only tried once, it was obviously not trivial.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Reactive Sealant Soak was trivial at 136, failed the first time.  The Soak gave me nitemares, failed 4 times but I was probably just unlucky.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
              The Beastlord claws were made by combining the 5 class components (using the bard ceramic claw sleeve and war porous claws) with the claw mounts in the Weapons Kit sold by Qua.  It did not appear to do any skill check.  You do not need your original claws.<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The result was 2 claws. Sonic Wolf Bane Claw.  Magic/Lore/NoDrop.  10/32.  Bane Dmg: 2.  the secondary claw has +1 str/dex.  No stats on primary claw.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When turned in to Kaam Rahiir with your cloak:<br>
Kaam Rahiir says 'These claws are very well crafted! Your work is very impressive.  Please take them to Ahom Guzhin. He is an old friend of mine.  The sonic wolf claws were the result of some of his original studies in the moor. He has dedicated his life to studying creatures of the moor and can almost always be found there.  Be careful when you go looking for him.  You've done well here, but don't get careless. Good journeys. <br>
Your faction standing with Khati Sha got better.<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In addition he upgrades your cloak.  Cloak of the Khati Sha Journeyman.  AC 7, Tailoring 3%, str +2, sta +3 wis +1, hp 10.<br>

How did you get a human to be a citizen?  I had several people trying to get that to happen this weekend.<br>
<br>
The Bards get two sketches, depending on whether or not we're making the piece for the BST or for the other classes.  Again, i'm a Bard on Torv up to this point, i'm searching desperately for other class people.  I haven't found a SOUL that is up to the Wolfbane part beyond myself, and i see other servers already have all 5 people going. =/<br>
<br>
Also: Did you combine all the items in the pottery wheel with the sketch, or did you make the clay first using some other container (mixing bowl or wheel)? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublyghtnihilist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BlyghtNihilist</A> at: 12/17/01 10:02:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dapht>Dapht</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/17/01 10:01:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3462.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beastlord - Claws Quest</span><hr size=1> Snish and I are on the same server and are RL friends so I speak for him as well (well, for this topic at least).  Blyght, you can only do a class quest line if you are of that class.  In other words, your human would not be able to do the Sham quest because he is not a Sham.  Well, actually, I dunno if that is entire true, but I know for certain that only those of a particular class have good enough faction with the first quest giver in any given class to continue on.  This holds true for Vah Shirs of other classes as well.<br>
<br>
I play a BL and he plays a Bard Vah Shir and, seeing that we were going to have to do all the other quest ourselves, tried to do the other class specific quests to complete our own.  It turns out that if you are indiff to the guy who starts the first quest, he will eat your stuff.<br>
<br>
So, snish used his lizzy sham and I used my Barb warrior and we were able to complete our respective vah shir quests by Multi Questing the letter you get from turning in the slate and the Tax Collectors note. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3462.topic&start=161&stop=175>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=3462.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=3462.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3462.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3462.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=3462.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3462.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3462.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm24">Realm Quests<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
