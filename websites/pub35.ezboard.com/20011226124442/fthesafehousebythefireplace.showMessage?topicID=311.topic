<font face="arial" size="2">The man is sat in the corner of the Inn, no company, no<br>
distractions, just his thoughts. His fingers are draped around a mug, which he<br>
never drinks from.<br><br>
You cannot make out his face, only his sweeped hair and<br>
slight moustache. He sits with dignity, but not so much so that he stands out.<br>
Although alone, he is content.<br><br>
You walk over to the bar, trying to avoid his gaze so that<br>
you have time to compose yourself and revise your notes. Sitting on the furthest<br>
stool from him, you pull a notebook from your bag and place it on the bar.<br>
Through all the hustle and bustle you are trying to be silent.<br><br>
As you flip through your notes and questions you come<br>
across a mistake. As you pat down your pockets looking for a pen you realize that it is missing. Strange, you remember packing it. You always took it<br>
everywhere. As a journalist it was a necessity.<br><br>
With a jump, you turn around, clutching your chest to see<br>
who tapped you on the shoulder so un-expectedly.<br><br>
The man behind you produces a pen and holds it up for your<br>
inspection.<br><br>
“Yours I believe?” He adds, letting it slide through<br>
his fingertips into your palm.<br><br>
“Uhm, yes.” You stutter in reply.<br><br>
Now that you look at his face, he looks a lot like the man<br>
you have come to see. Same hair, same moustache, same dignified stance.<br><br>
Looking back to the booth you realize it is empty. It is<br>
him behind you.<br><br>
“How did you….” You ask in disbelief.<br><br>
“It was nothing. A simple trick. Any child could have<br>
made his way over here hidden from sight, and picked your pockets, sir, that is<br>
simple. But only a true professional could do what I do.” He replies, stepping<br>
up to the bar.<br><br>
“And what is it you do?” You ask as you regard your<br>
notebook.<br><br>
The man begins to answer but thinks better of it and<br>
re-postures himself, now leaning against the bar.<br><br>
“Sir, I can do whatever you require. I am not a thug, I<br>
am not a pickpocket, I am an….” He stops once more and looks to the door. A<br>
man is walking through. The man takes a seat at the bar. Your interviewee looks<br>
back at you with a gleam in his eye. “… Opportunist.”<br><br>
“Opportunist.” You add, considering the title and<br>
nodding gently.<br><br>
Later that evening you leave the bar amazed, admiring the<br>
man’s professional attitude, flair and obvious talent.<br><br>
Trying to think of his profession, you can only assume he<br>
is a jack-of-all mysterious trades. Although he is obviously as skilled with<br>
mundane war skills as the next man, you get the impression that he could drop<br>
the most bravado ridden man in seconds.<br><br>
Rydall Nevermore is someone you will not forget quickly,<br>
even though most who have seen him won’t even remember him long enough to say<br>
his name.</font><p><br>
