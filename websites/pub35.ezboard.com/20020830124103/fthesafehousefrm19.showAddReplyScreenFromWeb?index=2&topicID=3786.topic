<br>
This is my self-proclaimed Venomaster Template. I go through about 75gold worth of poisons for an 8 hour session.<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay: Typical nightshades, on my server Galahad, go the melee/MG camping template. Medium CS, High Pierce, as low as they can get on Stealth and Env yet still hit 50 with items. Oddly enough, sense the time of one-shots being taken out, I have really only seen one person succeed with this formula, and I think that has alot to do with him solo'ing alot and having purge <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I approach combat differently with the above template. I *always* try and land PA in every fight, and I almost always switch to my 3rd weapon in fights where I'm little more than a glorified blademaster for that extra dot kick. Baring instant heals... I drop my first target.<br>
<br>
But where this template truely shines is in anything related to forts. As I've recently found a very good way to defend forts as a nightshade, I've increased my enjoyment of them significantly (also made my name infamous to a few people, always a warm fuzzy feeling). So lets break down the fort fighting.<br>
<br>
Attacking a fort:<br>
Hib forts are by far the easiest to attack, most every assasin knows this. But, if we stay around we die, if we get stuned, we more than likely die. So its usually 'one hit quick' and get the hell out of there. My template maximises on this strength, high CS with high Env + poison crits. Climb up, PA + LB if I get a sizable crit on a rezzer type, punch viper. If I have haste and no instant stunners are around I might stick around to CD my target. But regardless, while I'm ditching the bowmen agro and climbing back up, my LB is still doing my work for me. And in a fort defense, unless its an Armsman type who I missed my PA on, every defender is *only* thinking about how my LB is effecting their health and survivability. But by this time, my 10sec is up and I'm already over the edge with poisons reloaded. If my target was dumb enough to not seek healing help, he is dead this time around. If he did get healed, I go for the next Target of Opportunity, or I nail him again to prove a point that he needs to get off those ramparts.<br>
<br>
Fort Defense:<br>
Without giving up too many of my secrets (although my tactics are becoming well known to those that have fought me recently), I merely use the Tank Gatekeeper technique with more OOMF. Tanks like to port out, smack some people around and port back in, hopefully not dying, but if they do they die inside. Well.... our damage is front loaded right? Soooo use the gatekeeper to deliver. Stealth out, pick a target, PA+LB (CD if you didn't walk very far) and bingo you are back inside. Again, emphasising CS, Env and Wild Arcana Skills. Unfortunately, this is very defendable: and the attackers have many tools to destealth/kill you as you are trying this. Its self balancing thankfully -- at least if you play against a smart enemy. Combined with other defenders, and some bait to keep the enemy assasins busy on our ramparts instead of coming to end my life in the CY, I typically use this with some success -- its fun regardless.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In these situations, I'd say the Nightshade excells over our assasin breathren - especially if they put some points into Wild Arcana. I went this path merely on a fluke suprisingly... my first Realm spec went horribly wrong, so when they put respec in I decided to buy Viper, cause if I didn't buy it now, I probably never would -- and I always had a respect left if it sucked. I spent the next few realm levels getting generalist skills like MoS1, long wind, etc.<br>
<br>
But then it hit me. I spend 5 points to get WA (1pre-req +3pre-req +1) to be able to crit on all 4 of my poisons where I would NEVER be able to otherwise. Hrm... okay. I figured that 5% over nothing is better than an increased 5% if i went the Mastery of Pain route. Plus I my fighting style favors my envenom use, so it was a natural conclusion for me. I just got WA3 last night, but even with WA2 I would noticable get crits on all 4 of my poisons (highest dot so far is 312/tick -- vipered of course)<br>
<br>
But the problem in shades - and my template points this out - is that when we get into melee combat, we get owned. In any situation when I can't PA, can't repoison, I am a weak blademaster. Its all over. I don't have the str/con to live long and go toe to toe -- I don't have the weapon spec (a template choice), and I don't have any toe to toe Realm Abilities, besides the generic dodger 2 (IP, Purge, MoP, etc)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, most assasins go with melee templates and fight solo around the PK/MGs cause they see big numbers. Woot, solo kill netted me 800 RPs, weee. Yet in the same time he waited for that solo kill, I've gotten 6 150rp kills at a fort.... And some do succeede, but far few do, cause our brother assasins perform MUCH better in this role.<br>
<br>
I am *very* happy with my Nightshade. I also think that the lifetap on our shout would be the minor fix that we need to bring us inline. It won't really have much effect on me at all, but it might help those shades that melee more than I do and address our con problem w/o having to resort to timed buffs or what not.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, I have found a template (self-proclaimed Venomaster) that works for my style of fighting (grouped, and fort) that puts me on par with my assasin counterparts. However, I am acutely aware of our difficiencies in other areas of fighting.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Honestly, I sometimes wish I'd started a Shade.  Not because I think they're better, but because I think it would be a bit more fun than my inf--having spells is cool.<br>
<br>
The most fun class I've tried is a Skald.  I like having a lof of &quot;toys&quot; to play with, and on the Skald you have speed, insta-mez, damage chant, heal chant, DDs, and decent melee.  On the Shade: stealth, envenom, DDs, and some cool RAs (read: Wild Arcana, Viper).  AND you get to play a keen if you want.  Non-humans add to my fun factor. <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
