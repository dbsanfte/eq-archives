<br>
Warriors have pretty much nothing. Defensive and that's it.  When you (monks) get stonestance and void dance with better avoidance and mitigation being moot because of softcaps, warriors are going to feel threatened.<br>
<br>
Especially when they have lower offense than monks and do significantly less damage. <br>
<br>
So monks end up with plate AC (better actually because mitigation is hosed), rogue damage, all the neat toys we commonly associate with martial artists, and the warriors have, well nothing really.  And monks were rubbing their faces in it. Maybe that's not the entire monk community, and maybe it's not representative (I don't read these boards except for LaoTzu's pulling guide), but that's what I saw at a quick glance a few months ago.<br>
<br>
Don't expect a lot of sympathy from anyone.<br>
<br>
P.S. : Boycott pulling after the nerf.

Having even your friends cackle with glee over this was a real eye opener and more than a little discouraging.  <br>
<br>
Having been a person who has played for ages and had a large number of full time &quot;mains&quot; over the years, I have to say I'm surprised by the level of hatred that's coming through.  In my time at all of the various class boards as I've progressed through my personal EQ experience, I never found myself getting excited about other classes getting nerfed. Sure, I wasn't happy in my warrior phase pre-kunark to find out that necro pets beat me down like a step child, but when the nerf bat looked like it was about to start swinging, I opposed it. <br>
<br>
It's just jealousy. Human nature at it's worst. There are many who feel there was a problem, or saw what they perceived as an imbalance but are also normal, reasonable people who in general support other players. Then of course, there are those who judge their own worth by their relative status when compared to the rest of the player base. The former are the ones who either aren't posting, or are posting in a reasonable fashion.  The latter are the ones that are laughing and mocking and ridiculing and generally being jerks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=marduc>Marduc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/02 8:10:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=124.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> I ask a question and all you can do is flame me?

<br>
<br>
The reason for the stated nerf is that monks were tanking too well compared to plate tank classes (in a *MINORITY* of circumstances - and very small one at that).<br>
<br>
<br>
Or rather that they could not fix plate tanks properly in the 1% of situation where monks arguably did out tank them.  So they decided to nerf monks rather than fix warriors etc.<br>
<br>
No where was it stated that 'monks are overpowered therefore you can either have less offenece OR less defence the choice is yours and you must be nerfed'.<br>
<br>
It is simply that VI took the easiest way out to fix a 'problem' they themselves created.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's nothing to do with monks 'needing a nerf'/class envy, no matter what 1 hit posters here to gloat suggest. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fopoodzo>Fopoodzo</A> at: 10/10/02 8:21:00 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufacelessmonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faceless Monk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/02 8:16:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=124.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Like i stated on my 2 posts &quot;Truths&quot; monks have paid for their abilities with group issues and loot issues.

A few things caught my eye as plain wrong...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You are virtually impossible to kill it seems like sometimes<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now for my experience, I have a 60 ranger, 60 rogue, and 52 monk (with epic hopefully tonight).<br>
<br>
First, I can't see how he can justify &quot;virtually impossible to kill&quot;.  I'm guessing he hasn't seen ToV or harder pulls, where HP plummets and you watch the puller blink from full to dead if say an AE mob is in the pull and blows FD a time or two.  Then I thought, well maybe he means PvP, then again last time I tried DD's, Dots, and melee damage still worked to kill monks.<br>
<br>
I really liked this phrase, &quot;only pure melee class that can truly solo(Not everyone can afford the twinkage they need to solo)&quot;  does not the info he provides in the parenthesis negate his original statement?  Ie.  without proper &quot;twinkage&quot; soloing isn't very viable.  Warriors can kill and bandaid up, given enough area rogues can snare with dagger, and instill doubt and bs away.  I see no class specific advantage besides slightly less downtime with mend, and FD to avoid possibly negate the need to zone a fight you won't win.<br>
<br>
This next one really caught my eye... &quot;Rogues get high DPS (Only from behind) and they have virtually no Def&quot;.  Last time I checked my rogue, defense is 252.  That's the same as warrior max, paladin max, sk max, and (till change or whatever) monk max.  Rogue mitigation is probably slightly lower, and avoidance close-ish to monk.  <br>
<br>
Now compare to Ranger, a definate tank class as I am defining one, having a taunt button.  Ranger defense is 220.  So, in my experience with both 60 ranger and rogue in very comperable gear (some of it is the same for both), ranger is obviously below a rogue in defense (mitigation), and I'd say on par in avoidance.  <br>
<br>
Comparing my monk to these two classes, I would say in their current form match up to the mitigation and avoidance already.  But definately not to the level of a plate class, such as warrior, paladin and shadowknight (which I also have a lvl 51 in Thurg quality gear). <br>
<br>
Next he said &quot;Monks should have been the median between rogues and warriors, not given the best of both worlds&quot;, as I've attempted to explain with my past experience and observations of rogue/ranger/shadow knight/monk, that this is already the case for a majority of the &quot;average&quot; monk.  Average monk defined by me as, a monk ToV or pre-ToV compared to a plate class, or chain class in equal level ToV/pre-ToV gear.  If you make any other assumption of gear then results will always and obviously be skewed.<br>
<br>
I'm still of the wait and see mindset to see just how much I'll be effected by it.  I really enjoy the monk class, and will continue to play reguardless, but it does seem a bit strange to hit the monk class with a two by four instead of aiming at the &quot;problem&quot; area.  Problem area, as I understand it, is defined as monks out tanking plate classes in high end encounters.  That would lead me to think you should tweek the high end, I would assume loot, aaxp, or other 60+ factors, and leave the rest as is. <p>
