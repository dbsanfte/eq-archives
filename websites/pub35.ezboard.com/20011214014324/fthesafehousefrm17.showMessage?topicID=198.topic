<br>
Started playing AO tonight, and ended up playing for like 6+ hours. Damn cool game. Very refreshing change from EQ, at least thats my impression so far (lvl 6 fixer)<br>
<br>
However, for the same reason, I have a lot of total noob questions. I'll throw em out here in hopes someone can shed a little light on em for me.<br>
<br>
Is there something comperable to EQ's /who command? Can I see what prof/level a char is? How many people are in a zone? What zone someone is in?<br>
<br>
Can you inspect people?<br>
<br>
Why would someone dual wield pillows?<br>
<br>
In the skill thingy (where you spend your IPs), is it generally recommended to put them into the green skills? I'm assuming green denotes your prof's specialty, blue/green being a lesser inclination, and blue having no special ability in that area.<br>
<br>
Being a fixer, is there anything in particular i should be looking for, in terms of skills, or equip, or implants?<br>
<br>
The whole implant thing has me mostly puzzled, but I'm working on it. I have a right hand implant (bright flashy something), a chest implant and a right arm, so I managed to get them installed, but I have no idea if they're doing me any good.<br>
<br>
Nano-thingers, I have one nano thingy that I cast on myself (took me a while to figure out that it wasnt offensive), but I cant for the life of me figure out what it does. <br>
<br>
Will I be able to make weapons/armour? Is that generally what fixers do, or is there another class (nanotechs?) that are more suited to this kind of thing.<br>
<br>
Lotta questions I know, but if anyone can shed a little light on any of it, I'd be most greatful. The game seems damn cool, and so far I'm really liking it.<br>
<br>
Took me a few levels to realize my name was Roosevelt too.<br>

So see if someone is online, you have to send him a tell. So you have to know the exact spelling of the name, otherwise the tell won't reach him. And unless he/she sent you at least one tell, too, you will never be able to see if he/she is online or not.<br>

Thanks for the answers SX.<br>
<br>
Also about the con system.. I find it rather annoying that it varies from neon-green to yellow to orange and up, as my colour-blind eyes have trouble distinguishing between green and yellow, but I guess Ill learn. And what does a grey con mean? No exp, like a green con in EQ?<br>

What about the AGG/DEF meter thingy? I've pretty much had mine cranked all the way to AGG since level 1, is there a time I'll want to move it over?<br>

<i>"One way to determine the implants and IP distibution you may need in the future is look at your nano formulas / weapons /armour for skill requirements. "</i><br>
<br>
Alrighty.. Umm... what does that mean? :><br>
<br>
I have one nano-thingy that I cast on myself, I think its the newbie one that I started with. Minor Supression or something. Doesnt seem to do anything. I keep hearing about these HoT's and stuff, how/where/when do I get those? Are they higher level stuff?<br>
<br>
And I'm on RK1, thanks though :><br>
<br>
Just did a whole dopey mission to get a flash trenchcoat thingy, only to later find out that its omni only. At least I managed to sell it for 600 creds (Thats a lot to me, with my big 4k in the bank).<br>
<br>
Anyone else on RK! (clan if it matters) who wouldnt mind being bugged by newbie questions?<br>

I'll look you up tonight and see if I can't give you a hand. I don't have any traditional Fixer weapons...AKA Maussers (yuck) to give you. But I think I have some old armor and cash, maybe some nanos.<br>

Oh, and what Logken means is...look at the stats you're going to want/need to figure out what stats you want to raise with implants.<br>

MG/SMG<br>

<br>
-- low downtime.  lots of action<br>
-- merchant vendor economy is not broken.<br>
-- lots of options, flexibility to &quot;bend the rules&quot; of a particular class and still turn out ok.<br>
-- wonderful options for comunication channels, although often a nuisance to set up.<br>
-- appartments, vehicles<br>
-- death and gear-reclamation system is balanced and well-developed to accomodate pvp and solo play.<br>
-- the coolest graphics in the online gameing world. hands down.<br>
<br>
Downsides:<br>
<br>
-- severely anti-social game structure.  pretends to be pvp, but it's not, really.  and with the extremely low degree of specialization inherent in the system--when push comes to shove, you really dont _need_ anything from anyone else in the game.  there's very little social interdependance that would help to generate dialog and social interaction.<br>
-- lack of unique goals or rewards.  nothing is particularly difficult to obtain given enough cash, and cash simply takes time to acumulate if all else fails...  pay-offs anolng the way up are good, but they still get monotonous with nothing in particular to look forward to, just the next level of gear.  there really isn't much risk of failure.  no chance outcomes.  nothing to mark a players unique or challenging game experience.  to be honest, i still find nothing that makes me proud or generates a degree of sentimental attachment to any particular charachter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugnmishgearbinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gnmish Gearbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/29/01 7:56:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AO</span><hr size=1> I'm pretty proud of my twin Desert Reets...and my Sids armor.<br>

So I go there, no luck...get on the net, and find that the Mantis Dungeon isn't even live, it's one of the planned &quot;static&quot; dungeons that haven't made it live....ummm, ok. <br>
<br>
Maybe that's changed by now, but if so, no one knows.<br>
<br>
I don't think I'll cancel yet, cause really, I am still having fun just doing missions...but I think after I pay for my first real month I'll realize that there are better single player games out there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Yup, Sounder is my fixer. I had a helluva time picking a nickname, went through literally about 2 dozen before I found one that was accepted and I could stand to be called.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the tips on the skills Gnmish, I really had no idea which ones i should have been putting points into, and now know that I was throwing a helluva lotta points into useless crap, but ah well, all part of the learning process.<br>
<br>
Those links look great, specially that AO Fixer one, ill definitely be reading that a lot. I've found the <a href="http://ao.stratics.com/content/community/forums/fixer.html">AO Stratics Fixer Forum</a> to be an interesting resource too. It's 90% stuff thats way out of my league, but still really interesting to read.<br>
<br>
I'm using a.. um.. damn I forget what its called now.. some low end machine gun thingy and a shotgun of somesort, and it works out pretty well. Every once in a while I hit for about 71 for som reason, when my usual high hit is about 20, but I'm not complaining.<br>
<br>
I've heard about the whole grid phreaking thing, and it sounds damn cool. Hope I get to the point where I can do it someday.<br>
<br>
I just finally found the place where I can buy programs, but found out that all my IP's are in the wrong places, and I cant use any of em. Aslo still trying to figure out what im looking for in implants, but its damn cool learning. Sometimes its fun being a newbie all over again.<br>
<br>
Still wondering why I see people dual wielding pillows.. They seem to usually be docs too I think.<br>
<br>
Thanks again, lots of good info so far :><br>

<br>
For some reason today, AO won't let me equip both my guns at the same time. I'm using an ill-treated galahad, and a flawed old english trading co sniper. They've been working for me pretty well for the past few levels, with burst, fullauto, and flingshot (fling kinda sucks, but hey, its an extra attack).<br>
<br>
Except today. It wont let me use both of them. I've gotten used to the bug that de-equips your offhand gun when you zone, fine, no biggy, zone, put it back on. But now, if i put the shotgun in secondary, it pulls the galahad out of primary, and sticks it in my inv. If i try to put the galahad back in primary, it shoves the shotgun out of secondary. If I wait until im fighting, then try to stick the shotgun in secondary, it <i>looks</i> like its equipped, except I cant use flingshot, im not attacking with it, and if I try to remove it or anything, it just disappears. I still posess it, somewhere, I just cant do anything with it.<br>
<br>
Bugging the hell out of me. As a result, I do about 40-50% less damage per fight (shotgun is 4-20, galahad is 2-16 or something I think), and generally get my ass kicked by greens and yellows, nevermind oranges.<br>
<br>

It doesn't actually shoot.<br>
<br>
It's a graphics apparition that was 'added' on 'Bloody Friday' aka Patch 12.6.<br>
<br>
The reason it poofs when it zones is because AO realizes it shouldn't be there. If a weapon is 2handed (meaning you need two hands to fire it) it will show you holding it with two hands and it will only say 'RightHand' in the description.<br>
<br>
To actually use and fire two weapons, they must say 'RightHand' and 'Lefthand' and you must have the appropriate level in Multiple Ranged.<br>
<br>
You're not losing out on damage really...it's a graphical bug.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: BTW, weapons that can be 'duel wielded' BOTH must have a Multi-Ranged section and requirment in their description. That's a good way to tell. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugnmishgearbinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gnmish Gearbinder</A> at: 10/1/01 4:38:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uslymmpikkins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slymm Pikkins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/1/01 4:55:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AO</span><hr size=1> Well thats just messed.. <br>
<br>
Both weapons have to be either hand usable? i.e. both weapons must say RightHand and LeftHand on them?<br>
<br>
Because I <i>know</i> I was using my galahad and the old english sniper at the same time, because I could burst, fullauto, and flingshot, all without switching anything. It did look kinda odd, holding the galahad in a 2 hand rifle stance, sort of supporting it with the shotgun.<br>
<br>
Well poo, this means I need to get a new weapon.<br>
<br>
Well good too know, thanks again, that was really starting to bug me.<br>
<br>
Argh I had like 4 more questions 20 mins ago, but I've forgotten them now.. Ah well, I'll remember as soon as I get into AO.<br>

IE, the left hand. Only the right hand weapon.<br>
<br>
For instance...I use Desert Reets religiously. The can Burst and Fling. But just because I'm using two of them, doesn't mean I can burst twice or fling twice.<br>
<br>
The Rifle/Shotgun was a bug again...same bug infact. I feel almost 100% positive you weren't firing both at the same time.<br>
<br>
BTW. I sent you a tell last night...you weren't on. I usually play from about 1am eastern to 6am eastern. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17.showMessageRange?topicID=198.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17.showMessage?topicID=194.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17.showMessage?topicID=204.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17.emailToFriend?topicID=198.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17.threadControl?topicID=198.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=198.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=198.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm17>Anarchy's Grip</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
