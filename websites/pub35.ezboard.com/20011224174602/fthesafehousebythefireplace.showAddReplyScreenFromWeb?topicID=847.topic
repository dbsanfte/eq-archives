Without saying or doing anything. The burly man stumbled on by, glaring over his shoulder at Dharshan as he passed. He was in no condition to even be walking, no less trying to look at someone at the same time. The man continued walking down the road in his drunken stupor, nearly running into the walls of buildings and toppling over carts full of goods that had been put out on the streets for the day’s sales. “Well at least he’s got the brains to keep on going,” Dharshan mumbled to himself. The man, who after going on his daily drinking binge, had met him on the road a few months before and had either taken a disliking to him or unwittingly decided that he was not large enough to defend himself properly, and therefore was fair game. Dharshan had quickly shown the drunken fool his mistake after a perfectly timed jump to the side of the swinging man had sent him hurtling into a trash heap on his own momentum. The drunkard had apparently not learned his lesson completely and had come around again, this time trying instead for a kick to Dharshan’s head. He had no time to stand and marvel at how the man was even athletic enough to get his foot up that high, instead he dropped down to the ground and kicked the drunk’s other leg out from under him. Dharshan had quickly rolled out of the way of the falling man, who fell face first into the dirt. By this time a small crowd of people had gathered around the spectacle, but it had all happened so fast that not much was seen other than the large man lying down in the street.<br>
              <br>
Word of the incident with the drunk had quickly spread around town and finally ended up landing Dharshan an interview with the city council about becoming a city patrolman. He never considered beating up a drunk to be a very difficult thing to do, but decided not to argue the point. Even considering that the position of a patrolman was one notch below the city guard in rank, it was still a very honoring proposal for Dharshan. <br>
              <br>
Though he had wanted to be accepted into the ranks of the city patrolmen, there was one small quirk that only someone such as himself would have been disappointed about, and that was the fact that all the guards, including the patrolmen, were required to wear a suit of iron armor, which in his opinion was rather large, heavy, and clumsy. Dharshan had been determined not to be required to wear the armor and had let the council know that he would not accept the job if he was forced to wear it against his will. The city council debated over the situation and a couple of days or so afterwards decided that, because of his small build, the armor’s weight would probably end up hampering his abilities before it would ever help him out in any way, therefore he would not be required to wear it. The following day he was sworn in as a new city patrolman.  <br>
              <br>
He had been a patrolman ever since and enjoyed the job very much, if indeed it could have even been called a job. The pay was not much, but the flexible hours and often dangerous and exciting encounters with the riff raff of the city were more than enough to make up for it. Plus, he had permission to use deadly force when he deemed it necessary. Which he often did without remorse.<br>
              <br>
For the time being Dharshan was on his way to the local pub, the “Moneysnatcher”. The pub had originally been named the “Dark Brew Tavern”, referring to its signature brew, a very potent, dark colored liquid that almost screamed out that it had come from the sewers. The sickening color couldn’t keep people away from it though, and the barkeep had tagged on a price that was just on the verge of price gouging, but not enough to keep people from buying one after the other. Therefore, the people always referred to the pub as the “Moneysnatcher”. This name being as popular as it was, the barkeep had decided that if the first name wasn’t even used by his visitors that he’d just call it what it should be called, hence the name “Moneysnatcher”.  <br>
              <br>
Dharshan had never bothered to buy the drink, and didn’t really care to buy it any time soon, preferring instead to keep his wits about him. Actually, all he ever did at the pub was to see if he could pick up any information on the latest events that had occurred around the town that particular day. Most of the people that frequented the pub were of the adventurous type and had just returned from their excursions outside of the city gates. Many of them chose to speak quite loudly, probably so that everyone would know of their latest adventures and all the great things they had done. Dharshan considered most of them to be your run of the mill blowhard, exaggerating much of what they said. Yet over the years he had gotten a good idea of who to believe and who not to. <br>
              <br>
Dharshan pushed open the two swinging doors and entered into the building. It was just starting to get dark out and most of the people had returned to the city for refuge over the night. One thing was different today though and immediately jumped out at Dharshan, the pub was not full of shouting drunks like usual. Instead they all looked rather glum and were all hunched over their drinks, not saying much of anything at all. Dharshan glanced around at the few people that were in the room, which had been another thing that appeared out of the ordinary, the building normally being so full that most of the occupants had no place to sit, being forced to stand most of time. Today there was at maximum only a third of the people that routinely packed the building. Dharshan identified one of his fellow dwarven patrolmen by the crossed sword and hammer symbol on the front, and probably the back, of his breastplate. The sword and hammer symbol was used on all patrolmen to help the commoners identify them, and was even sewn onto the vest that Dharshan was wearing. <br>
              <br>
The dwarf was sitting at one of the smaller tables in the room with his head bent over in his hands. A dwarf of slightly larger stature than was normal for his kind, yet small enough to not be able to sit comfortably at the bigger tables in the room. Dharshan walked over to him and with considerable strain on his legs sat down at the other end of the small circular table. Dharshan glanced around the room one more time before turning to face the dwarf. <br>
              <br>
“Hello there, the name’s Dharshan,” he extended his hand to the dwarf, but the little man appeared uninterested in the human’s attempts at conversation, not even raising his head to look at the person who had spoken to him. “I was wondering why this place looks so dead today, do you happen to know why?”, the dwarf still made no movement. Dharshan peered at the dwarf, wondering if he had maybe gone unconscious or had too much to drink and was experiencing the consequences. Then the Dwarf slowly lifted up his head and set his teary eyed gaze on Dharshan. <br>
              <br>
“Dead!?”, the dwarf let out sharply, all the while looking as if he was trying to hold back more tears, “Dead is exactly the right word for what is going on right now. I lost three of my best friends in a battle tonight, and after hearing of all the friends of the others here that were slain, I do not wish to be bothered right now. Please leave me be.”<br>
              <br>
Dharshan continued to sit at the table, stunned by what he had just heard the dwarf say. It was not uncommon to hear of some serious injuries and occasionally deaths in a day’s worth of adventuring, but never of such magnitude as had just been described to him. Suddenly it all started to come together. These people had probably all stumbled across some sort of tribe, probably goblins or orcs, or worse, trolls. The greatly feared Ogres were a possibility also, but many of them did not travel in packs in these areas. Also, much of the adventurers of the city traveled in separate small groups. Their scattered forces would have been no match for a fully assembled group of creatures bent on their destruction. Dharshan decided to try to pull a little more information out of the emotionally unstable dwarf. <br>
              <br>
“How did they die?”, Dharshan asked, trying not to sound too nosy. The dwarf squirmed in his chair and looked as if he was going to suddenly break down into a pool of even more tears, yet he quickly regained control of himself to some extent and looked straight into Dharshan’s eyes. <br>
              <br>
“Goblins,” the dwarf appeared to fill with anger as he mentioned the name, “the wretched things killed me friends and me friend’s friends, but I’ll get me revenge! Only a matter of time before they’re all punished fer’ their wickedness! Vile, wicked beasts! They’ll all die! I’ll kill ‘em all, I will!” the dwarf put his head back in his hands and continued to mumble about killing goblins, while Dharshan quietly slid out from under the tiny table and left the dwarf to himself. <br>
              <br>
“Goblins huh?”, Dharshan said to himself as he slowly made his way toward the doors of the building. He had heard quite enough for tonight, at least enough to keep him busy for a long while.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
              <br>
Dharshan entered into Mintrak’s Forge, the weapons shop he had come to grow so fond of. It was the only place that he knew of that sold the kind of weapon he liked; daggers, lots and lots of daggers. In fact, the store specialized in the making of daggers, not to mention throwing knives, and even a few short swords. Dharshan walked up to a display case which contained a few rather expensive looking gold daggers. A tall wiry barbarian, Mintrak himself, stood behind the case and watched. Dharshan guessed the blacksmith’s height to be very close to seven feet tall. <br>
              <br>
“What can I get for you today, Dharshan?”, the man held a long, shiny dagger that he had probably crafted himself and was wiping the blade down with a dirty towel. <br>
              <br>
“Well, I really need some more replacement throwing knives and probably a pair of daggers that are significantly better than these that I have.” Dharshan reached both his hands behind the vest that he wore and pulled the two aging daggers which he had already possessed out of their hidden sheathes. Dharshan turned the daggers around in his hands ‘til he held their blade side, a common courtesy among people who meant no harm to each other, and then proceeded to set them down on the display case. The man picked one of the daggers up and brought it close to his eyes. Examining it for a short while he then set the dagger back onto the case. <br>
              <br>
“Hmmmm… these aren’t all that bad really, just a little tarnished is all,” Mintrak exclaimed, “but I’ll see what I can find in the back to suit your needs.” The man disappeared into the darkly lit back room. <br>
              <br>
Dharshan had learned by now that most of the expensive daggers in the display cases were mostly just for looking at, nothing more than just decorations for some rich nobleman’s home. The blades were not very sharp at all and they probably would have broken in two if used on anything other than someone’s skin. The blades therefore were almost useless if they were to be used on most any armored creature, and a majority of people, if they were smart that is, always wore some sort of armor. Even Dharshan, who never really liked wearing the stuff, had a very lightweight, sleeveless ringmail tunic concealed underneath his vest.<br>
              <br>
“Significantly better you say?”, asked Mintrak from the back room. Dharshan could hear the clanking sounds of metal coming together. The barbarian was obviously looking for something in particular.<br>
              <br>
“Yes, if you can find anything,” replied Dharshan. The clanking sounds continued on for a moment, then the room went silent. A grave silence, to the point where only the wind outside the shop could be heard. Close by someone’s footsteps were also heard coming from outside, but soon passed on by and subsided. Dharshan expected to see Mintrak any second now, but he never appeared. The silence continued on, Dharshan almost to the point of going back and checking on the barbarian. Then Mintrak suddenly reappeared from the back room holding a couple of very dangerous looking daggers. Both weapons looked identical and like nothing he had seen before. They looked like any other normal dagger, except for the fact that positioned along the side of the tip of each dagger were a couple of long, bent back hooks, one on each side of the blade. The hooks were almost separate daggers in themselves and ran along the side of the middle dagger part, the blades each stopped at about three-fourths of the way down the middle part and left a gap of about an inch between themselves.    <br>
              <br>
“These are a very rare type of dagger,” the weapons sparkled in the candle lit room as the smith twisted them every which way, “they are called shantoobi and are a special design that was begun by my great grandfather, whom they are named after.” The smith handed the two weapons to Dharshan, “As you can see, they sort of work like a fish hook, very deadly indeed.” Dharshan stared wide eyed at the two weapons. He never knew that such a design had existed, but now he was asking himself why he had never thought of the idea before. “I made them myself,” the tall barbarian added, sounding rather proud of his work, “it was a long and hard decision for me to show these to you, as I’m sure you noticed.” <br>
              <br>
“Yes, I see now why it would take you so long to decide,” Dharshan smiled at the smith as he gave the daggers back. He then reached into the pouch that he wore around his waist. It contained most of his survival supplies, including money, food rations, bandages, and other survival related items. In fact, the only thing he did not have in his pouch were his daggers and throwing knives, which were all neatly concealed underneath his specially made vest. He pulled his hand back out, this time with a handful of gold coins which he set on the display case next to his own daggers. <br>
              <br>
The smith chuckled to himself, “Dharshan my friend, I know that I have given you great deals on my weapons before, but these are very special to me and I must at least make some sort of profit on my items,” Mintrak rubbed his chin with his finger as if some grand thought had suddenly appeared in his mind. Dharshan knew what Mintrak was thinking, and he knew what he was going to say next. It was no surprise when he was correct in his expectations. “Perhaps you have maybe a little more than this?”, Mintrak asked as he estimated the weight of the coins in his hand. Dharshan had already thrust his own hand back into the pouch before the smith had even started talking. Again he revealed a handful of gold coins and set them on the case along with the others. <br>
              <br>
“Aaaaaahhh…… now we are getting somewhere, these will most certainly provide the funds I need to make more shantoobi,” the smith then left the display case he was standing behind and made his way over to another one which contained a large selection of throwing knives, it being the only case with anything useful in it. All of them had been categorized by an animal’s name, and each knife went along with the name that it was associated with. Such as a serpent knife, which was small, sleek, and lightweight. Then there was the biggest joke in the shop, being the cumbersome, but cheap, sloth knife. Mintrak had earlier informed Dharshan that these were the results of failed attempts at forging by his younger students. “You say you also wanted throwing knives, how many?”. <br>
              <br>
Dharshan checked his remaining supply, of which there were only two left, “I’d like six of the tigers please”. Dharshan had become quite fond of the tiger design knives, they were very fierce looking, and just as deadly. The smith took the requested throwing knives out of the case and brought them back over to where Dharshan had dumped all of his coins. The smith plopped the knives onto the case along with the shantoobi. <br>
              <br>
“I will let you have these knives and these two daggers in exchange for the money and your two daggers, plus that.” The smith pointed to the diamond ring on Dharshan’s left hand, which was actually quite fake. Dharshan didn’t argue with the barbarian though, the smith had said he wanted the ring. Lucky for Dharshan, the smith didn’t enquire as to the authenticity of the ring, and possibly the smith didn’t even care, perhaps desiring to take advantage of some other fool who knew no better. Dharshan took the knives and daggers he had bought and put them into their respective sheathes under his vest. Saying goodbye to the smith as he walked out of the shop, he strolled down the street feeling quite happy with the deal he had struck.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan now headed toward the barracks that had been assigned to his particular unit. He would end up sleeping this night and probably most of the following day. For he had concluded that he would need to be prepared for the upcoming events that would probably unfold the following night, and that meant plenty of rest. <br>

He had tried to sleep during most of the day, but had found it rather uncomfortable to force himself to get rest. Instead he had occupied himself with some less strenuous activities, such as card games with fellow patrolmen or practicing different techniques with his new shantoobi. He knew that he couldn’t waste too much energy, he would most certainly need it tonight. <br>
              <br>
Munching on an apple as he went, Dharshan left his barracks and began to walk down the empty streets. The streets of the city were almost always barren at this time, but Dharshan knew of the rogues and other outcasts who lurked in the shadows, and he knew that right this instant there was a very good chance that they were eyeing his every move. Dharshan felt safe though. He knew that the veteran thieves and murderers would not desire to get into more than they could handle. Instead, they watched for less fortunate people, or those who were obviously not learned in the survival techniques that were nearly a must have in the potentially dangerous city. That did not stop him from keeping a close eye on his surroundings though, noting every shadow and every sound that was humanly discernible. <br>
              <br>
He headed toward the city gates, being careful not to look overly nervous while clutching the hilt of one of his shantoobi. The sun had set about a half an hour ago and some stars had begun to appear in the increasingly dark sky. It was the perfect time to locate the goblin horde since about this time many of them were probably starting their campfires and settling down for the cold night ahead. <br>
              <br>
Most of the shops had been locked up now, including the blacksmith shop he had been at the night before. The only places open were the pub and a select few that thrived on night time business. The only reason the pub stayed open at night was the twenty-four hour surveillance that was provided by the city guards. Dharshan passed the last shop on the street before he began to see the gates loom up in the darkness. Finishing his apple, he chucked it off into the weeds by the side of the road. Suddenly a hand came around from behind and covered his mouth, while a sharp object was pressed up against his back.<br>
              <br>
“Don’t ya’ be tryin’ nothin’ stupid now ya’ hear,” a raspy voice whispered into his ear, “I promise that I’ll kill ya’ in a heart beat if ya’ do”. The hand left Dharshan’s mouth and began to search around in his pockets. Finding nothing in them, the robber then found the pouch at Dharshan’s side, “Well, well, well… what have we here?”, the robber’s hand tore the pouch from Dharshan’s belt. He could hear the robber behind him as he began to try and get the knot on the pouch undone. The thief fiddled with the knot for about a minute or so with his free hand, obviously becoming impatient as he let out grunts of frustration. <br>
              <br>
Then the robber made the mistake Dharshan had been patiently waiting for. The same mistake that many veteran robbers had learned not to make simply by watching rookie fools like this make it. The robber let the dagger leave Dharshan’s back so he could cut the tight knot that was beginning to get on his nerves. Dharshan had kept his left hand underneath his jacket the whole time, gripping one of the shantoobi as he prepared himself mentally and physically for the maneuver he would undergo. As soon as he felt the pressure of the robber’s blade leave his back he made a quick jump forward, then just as quickly he turned his torso counter-clockwise and brought his shantoobi around with the movement. Dharshan could now see the thief’s head, which was peering into the newly opened pouch and searching for money. With his weapon still in motion from his quick turn he guided the dagger straight into the side of the man’s skull, causing a sharp cracking noise and a final look of surprise from the man. Dharshan held the man up at arm’s length and then quickly pulled the dagger out of the man’s skull. The thief’s eyes popped wide open as he dropped the pouch and his weapon to the street. His legs slowly buckled underneath him as he crumpled to the ground. Blood began to flow from the fresh wound as a puddle of the red liquid formed underneath the man. Dharshan slowly turned his head from one side to the other as he gave a threatening glare to the dark shadows that seemed to be moving about now, almost as if to challenge anybody else who dared come near. They didn’t.<br>
              <br>
“Well now look at what you’ve done,” Dharshan said to the now lifeless corpse, “you’ve bloodied up my new dagger!” Dharshan picked up his pouch from the ground and tied it back onto his waist, then proceeded to drag the limp body to the undertaker’s shop, the Dead Man’s Hand, which coincidentally was the last shop on the street before the gates were reached. The shadows appeared to slide away from Dharshan as he approached the shop. Dharshan left the body on the porch, then using his dagger he etched his signature into the wooden frame of the door to notify the owner of the shop who had left the body on his doorstep. It wasn’t the first time for Dharshan to take matters into his own hands, and it probably would not be the last either.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan stepped off of the building’s porch and started back toward the gate again. He had hoped that he wouldn’t have to be forced to kill another fellow human. Unfortunately though, many of the people that were out at this time of night obviously weren’t shopping for goods or taking leisurely strolls through the dark and menacing alleyways. A majority of the dwellers in the streets, excluding himself, looked to make a profit off of others. They considered it their job, having no desire to actually do real work for a living, instead turning to a life of crime to try and make ends meet. A sad way to go through with life, Dharshan thought, but he had hope for them though. He had seen a steep decline in the scum that littered the streets of the good city ever since he had been set to work the roadways as a patrolman. His presence did not sit good with the bandits and outlaws around the area though. Many of them had placed large bounties on his head. Dharshan knew though that it was simply their way of getting something done that they could not do themselves. They wouldn’t scare him away and they wouldn’t take him down without a fight, he would make sure of that.  <br>
              <br>
He now came upon the gates of the city. Two guards and one dressed in the armor of that of an officer, a blue tinted suit of plate armor, stood at the gate, each one eyeing him with suspicion as he approached. When they saw the crossed sword and hammer on his tunic they appeared to relax a little more though. Dharshan then noted that lying just to the side of the gate, next to the wall, was a pile of burnt bones which were still emanating a stream of smoke into the air. These were oddly shaped though. Definitely not human and definitely not that of any wild animal. These were goblin bones, the remains of those that dared come near the wall’s long line of defense.<br>
              <br>
“State your name and your business, patrolman,” the officer stated. Dharshan took note that he bore the emblem of the commanding officer on his shoulder, he was probably only inspecting the troops since most of the commanding officers did not become involved with simple guard duty. <br>
              <br>
“I am Dharshan, second lieutenant patrolman of the mighty city of Karnador!” Dharshan straightened up and lifted his hand to his forehead. Trying as hard as he could, he gave a salute to the commanding officer, a sad salute, but a salute no less. He had never really taken the time to work on his saluting, considering it to be a waste of time, for he had never heard of any warrior who had won battles with his excellent salutes. “I am on a mission to scout out the territories of our enemies, the goblins,” the officer frowned slightly, either at the mention of the creatures or at Dharshan’s poor saluting capabilities. “They are responsible for the murdering of many people of the city and I intend to find out what they are up to.” <br>
              <br>
The officer inquisitively lifted up an eyebrow at Dharshan, “you, and you alone?”. Dharshan nodded his head in answer to the officer’s question. He had considered the fact that he would be alone on the mission and understood the consequences he would face if he was found, but he desired the stealth that would be achieved with a one man team. <br>
              <br>
“Yes, I will be the only one going,” Dharshan declared as he squared his shoulders, trying to possibly prove to the officer that he was capable. He knew that the commander would not look at his physique though. Every respectable person who was involved in military in one way or another that Dharshan had talked to, had told him that you can always tell a person’s determination through their eyes. Apparently, Dharshan’s eyes had been rather convincing to this particular officer that he was confident of his ability to stay alive. <br>
              <br>
The officer motioned for a guard to open up the gate. Dharshan watched as the large iron gate was slowly lifted up to reveal the path that led through the forest behind it. No guards stood outside the gate, yet there were two rather tall watchtowers on either side of the gate, each one containing an observer. Archers were also positioned along the wall to aid in the observation, but their main task was to fire upon anyone with bad intentions who dared to approach the fortified city. <br>
              <br>
Dharshan peered down the road that winded into the forest. He took pride in the fact that his continuous thriving in darkness had blessed him with an unusual ability to see in the night. Though not as honed as the dwarve’s or the elve’s sight, it was still considerably better than normal. This ability let Dharshan know immediately of the bodies that randomly lay about, the bodies consisted of dwarves, elves, humans, barbarians, and goblins, and all of them lay either directly on the road or just to the side of the road in the tall grass. He looked on in horror, suspecting that the adventurers had run for their lives from the goblins, but a majority of them hadn’t made it from what he could see. He suspected the goblins to still be nearby since there had obviously been no attempt at the retrieval of the fallen warriors.<br>
              <br>
He walked down the road a little ways as he heard the gate behind him creaking shut. He would have to deviate from the path though, because if there was anything he had learned about being stealthy it was that you never take the most obvious route when traveling, and the most obvious route was almost always the most traveled. He had heard stories of what had happened to lone travelers along the road and he did not desire to become one of those stories.<br>
              <br>
A thick fog hung over the swampy ground of the forested area on the left side of the path. The murky ground would make travel very awkward, but awkward travel was needed, for it would be least expected that he come through that area. The fog blanketed the whole section of trees and continued on to an unseen end somewhere in the depths of the forest. It would make his vision even more limited than it already was, but it would also help to mask his approach from any observers. He veered off to left and entered into the foggy forest. <br>
              <br>
As he slowly and soundlessly crept through the tall weeds that preceded the swampy areas, he began to etch marks into the trees so that he would be able to find his way home a little easier if he became disoriented. The plants slowly gave way to a dark and ominous swamp. It proved rather difficult to wade through, even though the muck barely rose above his knees. The stench of many different things that Dharshan didn’t want to know about began to waft up and meet him. Fortunately it was springtime, and the temperature reminded him of that fact. The various types of bloodsucking bugs that were buzzing around him were not all that pleasant though, for they thrived in this type of environment and occasionally landed on him to get their day’s meal or, as he figured, just to tick him off.<br>
              <br>
The smell of a cooking meal began to overtake the stench of the swamp and find its way to Dharshan as he continued to slog through the murky, wet ground. The smell confirmed his suspicions that the goblins were not far away as he attempted to change his course and follow the smell. As he neared the smell he tried to make his approach more silent, lifting his legs over the water and setting them down instead of pushing his legs through the muck. It was possible though, that the smell may have been the making of someone or something else other than the goblins, but Dharshan was not going to take any chances. <br>
              <br>
A light, probably the fire that cooked the meal he smelled, started to become visible in the distance. The swamp slowly became shallower, to the point where Dharshan could dart from tree to tree, quickly but quietly making his way closer to the light. Three large silhouettes of some kind of creature soon began to take shape. Dharshan crept closer until he could correctly identify them. <br>
              <br>
The sight almost made him puke. Three trolls were gathered around a campfire, the larger of the three was standing before the fire holding a large butcher’s knife and the other two sat on a fallen log with their backs to Dharshan while looking on in anticipation for the upcoming feast that they were slowly cooking over the fire. What was over the fire was the most horrific sight Dharshan had seen in quite a few years. A headless dwarf had been impaled with a large stick and was slowly roasting over the hot flames. This was the wonderful smell that had overcome him!? Dharshan attempted to calm himself a bit and looked slightly away as he listened to the trolls’ ongoing conversation.<br>
              <br>
“Me sayed ‘dat me wanted ‘da heart!”, said one of the trolls sitting on the log. He turned and gave the other troll a heavy punch in the arm. The punch probably would have broken the arm of any human but did not seem to faze the troll in the least. <br>
              <br>
“Wibmuk sayed ‘dat he want first!”, the other exclaimed as he returned the favor. The two began exchanging blows as they fell to the ground, each punch being a little harder than the last. <br>
              <br>
“you’s cut ‘dat out or not get nuttin’!”, the larger troll declared as he strolled over and kicked the two fighting trolls, “We not go ‘dis far ouda’ ‘da way just ta’ get us all bashed up over smelly liddle dwarfs, we need stay good an’ strong ta’ fights da’ udders wid’!” Both trolls glared at each other as they stopped punching and slowly got off of the ground and back onto their log. <br>
              <br>
“Why does I stick wid’ you guys when Mimbam easily find own dwarfs?” the other troll on the log asked. <br>
              <br>
“Cause you aint got ‘da brains ta’ know how ta’ cook ‘em right!” said Wibmuk to his accomplice.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan’s anger was too much for him to bear. He stepped out of the clearing and hurled one of his throwing knives straight into the back of the troll named Wibmuk. The troll jumped slightly at the feeling and toppled over the back of the log, landing on his back and driving the knife even farther into himself. Dharshan then unsheathed one of his shantoobi and sprinted up behind the other still sitting troll. Dharshan slit the troll’s throat before it even had time to look at its dead friend. Blood gushed out of the wound as the troll made a futile attempt to stop its quick flow. All to no avail, as he also toppled to the ground. The other troll had witnessed both attacks and now seethed with anger.<br>
              <br>
“Dumb human! You no kill da’ trolls! Now me cut head off to burn in fire!”. Bringing his cleaver up above his head, the troll charged at Dharshan. Dharshan anticipated the assault and dodged to the side as the troll ran past and slashed his cleaver through a tree that had stood behind where Dharshan was previously standing. Turning around to face the troll, Dharshan was overjoyed to see that it still had its back turned to him. A quick stab into the back of the troll’s leg only angered it more. This time it spun the cleaver around in a wide arc, connecting with nothing once again as Dharshan jumped back and avoided the dangerous weapon, but in the process he slammed into a tree behind him. The contact with the tree caught him completely off guard, knocking the wind out of him and causing a sharp pain in his back. Dharshan fell to the ground and lay unmoving. In the meantime, the tree that the troll had sliced through had fallen on top of the troll’s own head, which should have killed the thing, but the troll simply brushed it off. <br>
              <br>
The troll lazily walked over to Dharshan, overconfident that the fight was pretty much over and that the human could do nothing more to harm him. The troll rose the cleaver above his head once again, but winced in pain as he felt something pass through his kneecap. He let the cleaver drop behind him and grabbed for the shantoobi sticking out of his leg, hopping up and down on one foot until Dharshan took his other shantoobi out of its sheath and destroyed the troll’s other good kneecap, making him crumple to the ground with a scream of agony.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan struggled to sit up, searching for air as he watched the troll screaming and thrashing about on the ground. The troll wouldn’t be going anywhere soon, but Dharshan knew that they healed very quickly and was determined to put him out of his misery. As he began to take precious oxygen into his lungs once again he crawled over to the troll and pulled one of the shantoobi out of its legs. Feeling no remorse for the dwarf killing troll, he drove the weapon directly into its brain. The troll no longer moved and all was quiet again.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan took comfort in the fact that he had once again looked death in the eyes and lived to tell about it. He rolled onto his back and took a much deserved rest, listening to the distinct sound of breaking twigs, the crackle of the fire, and … breaking twigs? Dharshan propped himself up onto his elbows and looked around as he listened closer for the sound he thought that he had heard. It had indeed been the sound of breaking twigs and there was definitely something lurking through the fog toward him. <br>
              <br>
Dharshan could now see what he had heard, and it was not encouraging. Dark shadows turned to sickly colored skin, which in turn formed into a group of scowling goblins. Dharshan reached over to the dead troll next to him and pulled both of his shantoobi out, then stood up to meet the oncoming goblins, six of which he had counted in all, but didn’t know of the one which had crept up behind him until it was way too late. Dharshan felt the hammering of a blunt object on the back of his head and dropped to the all too familiar ground.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan laid in wait for the killing blow to come, but it never did. Instead the goblin kicked him in the side, turning him over onto his back. Dharshan looked up, and through slightly blurred vision he saw what he believed to be an evil grin on the goblin’s face. Then he noticed in his dazed state of mind that it wasn’t a goblin at all. The troll that he had slit the neck of was already back up from the ground, his neck was healed and back to normal, and he now stood over him with a club in his hand. Dharshan now wished he had just taken the thing’s whole head right off, but it was too late now. Feeling himself slip into unconsciousness, he closed his eyes to the troll that would take his life. <br>
              <br>
For some reason though, he decided to open them again for what he believed to be the last thing he would ever see. He thought he saw a goblin standing over him now, along with the troll. As his vision continued to blur even more, he saw that they appeared to be glaring at each other, instead of him, probably arguing over who would kill the insignificant human. Dharshan noted in that small span of time that the goblin appeared to tower over the troll that had originally hit him. He had always thought that goblins were smaller than trolls, but figured that his mind was just playing games with him now. Nonetheless, the goblin would probably end up winning the argument if it was actually as big as Dharshan thought it was. He closed his eyes for the last time and let his mind slip away. If he was killed he wouldn’t want to feel it.<br>

His next thoughts were that he hadn’t been slaughtered by the goblins, though if they were still hanging around he probably would be killed soon enough. He now wished that they had taken his life earlier though, his back felt as if he had been lying on a rock the whole time. Probably the results of ramming it into the tree. He could hear birds chirping nearby and the sloshing sound of little animals going about their business in the swamp. This was a good sign for him, since the animals hardly ever came out when predators, such as trolls and goblins, were about. He struggled to open his eyes as he attempted to adjust to what seemed like a very bright light, hopefully the sun, shining directly in his face. Squinting his eyes he saw that the light was indeed the sun, indicating to him that he had been out for a while. It barely peeked in through the dense forest around him, but the clearing that he was positioned in the middle of had left a small gap in the treetops. Just enough for some rays of sun to make their way to him. He attempted to move his arms and legs around to see if anyone had tied him to anything, they moved as freely as ever before. <br>
              <br>
Dharshan lay in the soft ground, pondering for a moment how he could have possibly survived the night before. Maybe this was a dream? Perhaps he was actually being held captive by the goblins, and merely longed in his dreams to be in the swamp once again. There was no possible way that he could have escaped. And if he had, he didn’t remember any of it.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan lifted his hand up and gave himself a swift slap in the face… and it hurt… a lot. “Ouch!”, Dharshan yelped as he realized he had maybe put too much effort into it. He definitely wasn’t dreaming, and this was certainly the same spot where he had been knocked out the night before. How he could have ever escaped from the goblins was beyond his knowledge. Perhaps he had not even done it himself. Maybe some kind soul had come upon him and slain every creature there. Dharshan yearned for answers.<br>
              <br>
“You know, that’s not too good for you,” said a very deep voice from behind him. Dharshan sat up and turned to look at the person who had spoken to him. Then he stood up and grabbed for his weapons quicker than he had ever done so in his entire life. A massive goblin, probably close to eight feet tall, now stood before him, grinning and staring at him with his only eye. His right eye was covered with a black eye patch, but it could not cover the deep scar that came out on each side of the patch. He was also shirtless, which revealed an array of scars on his muscled chest. This confirmed what he had thought he saw the night before, but now that he saw the creature even more clearly, he now wished more than ever that he had been killed the night before. <br>
              <br>
“My weapons!”, Dharshan yelled out, searching in vain for his only way out of this mess. His vest had been removed and therefore he had no weapons to defend against this monstrosity. They were all gone, even his pouch had been taken. All of his hopes were dashed that very instant, but he was determined not to go down without a fight.<br>
              <br>
Dashing up to the goblin and jumping at the last moment he planted a kick directly into the large goblin’s chest, but bounced off and landed on the squishy ground, slightly knocking the wind out of himself. The goblin took a small step backward to keep his balance, but appeared unhurt as he continued standing his ground and watching the human with his one good eye. The big grin was still on his face. <br>
              <br>
“That’s not too good either,” he said, as the smile grew wider, “Methinks that maybe you’re not so smart, hurt yerself twice now you did.” The goblin bent down and offered a hand to Dharshan. <br>
              <br>
What is wrong with this goblin?! Dharshan thought to himself, why didn’t he fight!? Dharshan stood up on his own and lunged at the goblin with his fist, but the goblin caught his hand in mid-flight and held it there. Dharshan struggled for a short while, trying to release his hand from the iron grip of the goblin. It was no use though, the hold of the goblin was unbreakable. Setting his feet wide apart, Dharshan sent another powerful blow toward the goblin’s groin with his free hand. The goblin also caught this attempt by the human, now holding both of his hands in a mighty grip.  <br>
              <br>
“Let me go you foul beast!”, Dharshan spat at the goblin as his hands began to turn rather pale from the awesome pressure that the goblin was able to apply. The goblin kept his hands tightly gripped around Dharshan’s fists as the pain became nearly unbearable. Dharshan knew he was in trouble when he couldn’t even feel the pain any more, or his hands for that matter. He began to wonder if they were even hands any more. He expected blood to come out of the sides of the goblin’s grip sometime soon, as if the goblin had been simply squeezing a couple of grapefruits.  <br>
              <br>
“Very well,” stated the goblin as he finally obliged to the feeble human’s request, releasing the human and sending him reeling back to the ground on his own momentum. Dharshan lay in the spot where he dropped, replaying over and over in his mind what had just occurred. He looked down at his hands. They were still there, and they looked normal, but they hung limp since he could not feel them or move them in any way. The goblin now had his arms crossed over his wide chest and continued to stare at the little man. He appeared to be quite entertained by the person lying in front of him in the muddy ground. <br>
              <br>
Of all the goblins Dharshan had ever met in his lifetime, this one was the most unique. In its size, it loomed over all other goblins he had ever seen in his lifetime. In its vocabulary, it was even more fluent in the common language than some fellow humans Dharshan had met. Yet, the most interesting aspect was its personality. All goblins, in Dharshan’s mind, were the epitome of evil. They desired nothing more than to slaughter and eat everything and anything that got in their way. They did not know good or evil, they only knew and thought about murdering other beings and keeping themselves alive. They were mindless killing machines, desiring only to make life miserable for everyone around them, and they definitely could have cared less if someone was a respectable person. <br>
              <br>
Looking up at the immense bulk of the goblin, he began to view the creature in a different light than he had before. This goblin had no weapons of any kind except for his fists, which Dharshan had learned they could probably do some pretty gruesome things in and of themselves. He probably had Dharshan’s weapons hidden somewhere for his own safety though. He also did not have an evil scowl across his face, which was the norm for every other goblin Dharshan had ever known of. Instead, he had a big friendly smile on his face, but it still couldn’t cover up the goblin’s ugly facial features.<br>
              <br>
“Feeling better now?”, asked the goblin when he realized that the human wasn’t struggling for his life any more. Dharshan looked down at his hands and saw that they were gradually beginning to regain their color. Then the slow impending pain of what felt like pins and needles began to wash over them. Dharshan looked back up at the goblin; who, strangely enough, had a look of concern on his face. Dharshan decided to cut straight to the point.<br>
              <br>
“Why didn’t you kill me?”, he abruptly asked the goblin as he rubbed his hands together, hoping to ease their pain, “What do you intend to do with me now? Torture me for your amusement?” <br>
              <br>
“I’m not like that,” stated the goblin bluntly, as he once again offered to lift Dharshan off of the ground, “only kill when needed.” Dharshan did not accept the invitation of the goblin, but was becoming more comfortable around this strangely different character. “And you are one to understand meself’s motives,” added the goblin as he kept his hand outstretched for the human, “more so than my kin, that is for sure. Though I still think you’re not too smart.”<br>
              <br>
Dharshan ignored the hand of the goblin again and instead considered everything the goblin had said. It was apparent that the goblin meant him no harm, at the moment at least. Yet, Dharshan wondered if there were any other hidden motives behind the goblin’s friendliness. That is until he had a closer look at his surroundings.<br>
              <br>
The bodies of other dead goblins were strewn about in every direction. One of the bodies even hung limp over the high limb of a tree. Many of the carcasses were also missing their arms, while some even had no head. Strangely enough, they did not look like they had been cut off, the severed areas were way too rough for that. Dharshan shuddered at the thought of having his own arms or head torn off. Then he noticed that the dead bodies of the trolls had been thrown into the remains of the fire that they had been using themselves the night before, ending their terrorous lives forevermore. For it was universally known that trolls could not heal themselves when they were burnt to a crisp.<br>
              <br>
“Who did this?”, Dharshan asked as he indicated the dead bodies all around him, though he somehow figured that he already knew the answer to that. The goblin looked around himself and then turned back with a look of pride on his scarred face.<br>
              <br>
“As I said before, they do not understand my motives. They attacked 'til every last one of them’s blood stained the ground. Had it coming, yes they did,” the goblin said matter-of-factly as he strolled over to the armless and headless goblin hanging from the tree. The massive goblin walked as if he hadn’t a care in the world, he probably feared no one. And rightly so. “This one,” he said as he pointed at the dangling goblin, taking a small pause to admire his work, “very feisty he was.” <br>
              <br>
Dharshan now stood up and watched the large goblin as he lumbered around in the midst of the corpses. He made no move to run from the goblin, who now had his back turned to him, considering that the goblin could have probably run him down and slaughtered him in short order. In fact, he was rather intrigued by the huge creature and did not intend to leave. Instead, he wished to learn more of what kept this goblin in such good spirits, and what kept the beast from killing him. <br>
              <br>
The goblin paused at every body, it seemed that he was either looking for something or simply liked to admire his handiwork. Probably both, Dharshan ultimately decided.<br>
              <br>
“Methinks I have found it,” declared the goblin as he reached down toward a body at his feet. It was another goblin of slightly larger stature than was normal, but not as large as the one that stood over it. Dharshan suspected that the goblin had found his weapon. What he brought up in his hand didn’t seem all that impressive though. A simple, dark colored bead necklace, nothing fancy from what he could see. The goblin examined the necklace for a moment then turned back to Dharshan. “Yes, this is it,” the goblin confirmed, more to himself than anyone around him. The goblin wrapped the necklace around his huge neck and then slowly wandered back to where Dharshan stood.<br>
              <br>
“How ‘bout a real handshake now?”, the goblin thrust his big green hand toward Dharshan. Dharshan stood and stared blankly at the hand before him, but even surprised himself when after a short pause he reached out and firmly gripped the goblin’s hand. The goblin beamed a huge smile at Dharshan as he quickly pumped his hand up and down.<br>
              <br>
“Good, very good!”, shouted the goblin as he let go of Dharshan’s hand. “My name’s Kilmituk,” the goblin declared as he motioned for Dharshan to follow him, “and what might yer name be?”.<br>
              <br>
“I am Dharshan, second lieutenant patrolman of the city of Karnador,” he replied as he followed Kilmituk through the mushy ground. Kilmituk looked back at Dharshan with a befuddled look on his face.<br>
              <br>
“You? A patrolman?”, Kilmituk looked Dharshan up and down. “Naw, yer no patrolman,” said the goblin as he chuckled to himself, “too small, I’d break you in half.” Dharshan felt the hints of a smile coming onto his face, but quickly hid his amusement. He was not used to being around a creature that he normally would have slain in a second’s notice, and he didn’t really want to appear too comfortable in front of the humongous goblin.<br>
              <br>
Kilmituk finally stopped and reached his humongous arm deep into a small tree stump. Dharshan expected the goblin’s arm to get stuck, but the stump was just big enough for him to fit it in. <br>
              <br>
“These,” Kilmituk said as he began to bring his hand back out of the stump, “I think, are yours.” Indeed, this Kilmituk fellow was definitely not a normal goblin. He now held every last one of Dharshan’s weapons in his huge hand, including the pouch and his vest, and now he wished to give them back to him. Dharshan had been surprised many times in his life, but nothing prepared him for this. His jaw dropped as he accepted the weapons and the pouch.<br>
              <br>
Of all the people in the world, a goblin had been the one to save his life when he was destined to be a dead man. Even going so far as to stick around and keep the area safe from intruders. Dharshan could no longer hold his emotions in. Dropping to his knees in front of the goblin and bowing his head in humility, he put himself in the most vulnerable position possible before a goblin that could have taken him out of the world in the blink of an eye if he so desired. Not known to Dharshan though, the goblin had also been moved by the events unfolding before him.<br>
              <br>
“Surely, there is no other creature on this whole earth that is an equal to you in the mercy that you have shown to me today,” cried Dharshan as he kept his head bowed. “You have saved me from unspeakable torments by the hands of those evil creatures, and I cannot ever repay you. I am indebted to you. My life is yours and I will do whatever you bid me to do.” Dharshan did not struggle with the words in any way, for he truly meant what he had said. He had known the goblin for only a little while now, and already he had the utmost respect for him. Then he felt the touch of the goblin on the back of his head.<br>
              <br>
“You owe me nothing,” the goblin said as he brought Dharshan’s eyes up to meet his own, “you have already repaid me by accepting me for who I am. Never had I thought that yer kin could be so understanding of meself,” the goblin said as he lifted Dharshan back to his feet, “but I have been proven wrong.” Dharshan believed he saw a dying flame deep in Kilmituk’s sole eye. A flame possibly representing the last tiny remnant of what the goblin had once been before. He truly desired to know more about Kilmituk now.<br>
              <br>
“Why are you the way you are?” Dharshan asked as he believed he saw the flame in the eye of the goblin finally flicker and die out completely, “I mean, why aren’t you like the others of your kind?”               <br>
              <br>
The goblin pondered the thought as he stared into the tops of the trees. His form showed the scars of many battles. Although now unknown to Dharshan, there was far more behind them than simple fights. The goblin slowly lowered himself to the ground and sat facing the stump. <br>
              <br>
“Please sit down, I have much to explain to you.”<br>

The heavy goblin was now sitting in the mucky ground before Dharshan, which gave way to his immense bulk every time he moved, letting him sink a little further in each time. The goblin was in a deep sleep, having his eye closed and being completely oblivious to his surroundings. <br>
              <br>
He appeared to be dreaming, smiling happily as he rocked back and forth, and mumbling some gibberish that Dharshan could not understand while making strange gestures with his hands. Dharshan watched and wondered, not really knowing the significance of it all, but not willing to wake the happy goblin. Before Kilmituk had drifted to sleep he had instructed Dharshan to sit and wait. So that’s what he was going to do. <br>
              <br>
Dharshan looked down at his feet, beginning to grow tired of the goblin’s antics. Kilmituk had been asleep for over an hour now and the strange language he spoke was beginning to grow tiresome, considering that he could not even understand a word of it. All of it seemed pointless, but it was kind of funny that the goblin had a knack for talking in his sleep, if indeed it was sleep. When he looked back up though, the scene had changed drastically. Kilmituk now appeared to be extremely frightened. His whole body flailed about, his face showing a look of deathly fear. Dharshan considered intervening and waking up the frightened goblin, but heeded Kilmituk’s instructions and continued to watch the spectacle unfold before him. Kilmituk looked like he was trying to run from something, his mouth opened wide in terror. Yet, no screams or sounds of any kind came out. <br>
              <br>
Now the goblin stopped, the look of fear erased from his face. He sat on the ground, unmoving as he once again began to utter more phrases that Dharshan could not understand. This time he didn’t look happy though. His face was contorted in rage and the veins in his neck were popping out. The words he spoke were also coming out in a sharper tone of voice. Then his eye opened, and Dharshan believed he saw the flame in it as he had seen earlier. Fearing for his life, he sought to run, but was frozen with terror and not able to move at all. Then Kilmituk yelled something that nearly threw Dharshan off his stump. <br>
              <br>
“Ok mok degon quif!” <br>
              <br>
Kilmituk once again began flailing his arms about, a layer of sweat forming over his dark skin. It seemed this time though that he had a degree of control to his arm, almost as if he was attempting to strike something that was not there. The blows were powerful enough to coax Dharshan off of his stump as he moved away from the blindly swinging goblin. Kilmituk stopped abruptly and reached to the ground, picking up an object Dharshan couldn’t see. Bringing it up he appeared to put the unknown object around his neck. <br>
              <br>
Suddenly the goblin awoke from the dream as he looked around himself, being fully aware of his surroundings. Dharshan saw that the flame was gone from his eye now. It was apparent that the dream had taken a lot out of the tough goblin, his face was covered with sweat and he seemed to be having trouble sitting up. The goblin spotted Dharshan and saw that he was still there, then closed his eye again and fell backward, exhausted.<br>
              <br>
Dharshan stared at the tired goblin, stunned by his strange actions. He was beginning to question his original belief that the goblin was only dreaming, but he knew he would be learning the facts soon enough. He noticed that the sun had once again dipped below the horizon. The fog would soon be rolling in once again. He did not wish to stay in the forest for another night, but actually felt quite safe with the large goblin he had befriended lying on the ground in front of him. He would certainly prove a worthy ally if anything dared approach the clearing that they were in.<br>
              <br>
Kilmituk began to stir once again, opening his eye and glancing around.<br>
              <br>
“How long was I asleep?”, the goblin asked without raising himself from the ground.<br>
              <br>
“Well, actually only a few seconds, maybe a minute,” Dharshan replied, becoming more comfortable now that the goblin was awake once again.<br>
              <br>
“No, how long was I dreaming?”, the goblin still made no move to get up.<br>
              <br>
“Um… I’d say about an hour or so,” Dharshan found his way back to the stump and sat down again.<br>
              <br>
“Only an hour?”, the goblin hoisted himself into a sitting position, a confused look on his face, “then why do I feel so tired? What did I do while I was asleep?”<br>
              <br>
“Well, you were talking in a strange language most of the time. You appeared to be happy. Then you looked scared, and seemed as if you were fleeing from something. After a little while you stopped running, since that is what I assume you were doing. You became angry and started spitting out some really strange phrases, proceeding to yell something that I could not discern the meaning of. Then you started swinging at somethi-”.<br>
              <br>
“What did I yell?”, Kilmituk suddenly asked.<br>
              <br>
“Let’s see… I believe it went something like, ‘Ok mog tegon drif’, but I am no-”.<br>
              <br>
“Ok mok degon quif?”, Kilmituk interrupted again. <br>
              <br>
“Yes, that’s what it was,” said Dharshan.<br>
              <br>
The goblin brought himself back to his feet and paced back and forth on the ground, his hands clasped behind his back. He then turned to face Dharshan. <br>
              <br>
“You are sure this is what I said?”, inquired the goblin.<br>
              <br>
“I am positive,” replied Dharshan, confused about why it was so important to the goblin. The goblin looked into the treetops and closed his eye.<br>
              <br>
“It is as I suspected then,” Kilmituk said reluctantly to no one in particular. Turning his gaze back on Dharshan, he wandered back to the stump and sat back down in front of Dharshan. <br>
              <br>
“As I said before, there is much that must be explained,” Kilmituk opened his mouth wide and yawned, “afterward I must rest again.” The goblin reached up and felt the beads around his neck then dropped his hand back to his side. Drawing a deep breath, he began his story.<br>
              <br>
“My tale begins when I was a young child. Very early in my life I had been taken captive from my tribe, the Loose Tooth Clan which resided in the Garga Valley, in a raid by a neighboring clan of warrior goblins from the mountains, their tribe was known as the Broken Fist. My parents and most of my brethren were slaughtered in the raid, while I was spared. I became a slave to Grimbulkin, the heir to the throne of the Broken Fist. Grimbulkin was one of the most evil goblins I have ever known in my life, I was treated cruelly and often tortured for his amusement. I took it all in stride though, never showing my true emotions. Having few freedoms, I was often forced to work for the majority of the day and into the night, which allowed me very little sleep. I hardly ever got any breaks in that span of time. If I did stop working, I was often whipped or tortured.” <br>
              <br>
“Very rarely was I allowed any free time outside of my master’s hut. When I was allowed free time, I almost never left the hut, for fear of my life. Being a physically impaired goblin, I was unusually small and my spine was twisted from birth. I had no way of defending myself and was often beaten up by other goblins my age.”<br>
              <br>
“As I grew, I was granted more freedoms. The hours of working like a slave became fewer, and the whippings became less often. My master came to admire my stubbornness, nicknaming me ‘Stoneface’ because of all the punishment I was able to endure without breaking down. After a few more years he finally stopped me from household labor altogether, appointing me as his shieldbearer. As his shieldbearer I was given the privilege of riding into battle alongside the best warriors of the tribe. I was watched closely at first, but they became more and more sure of my loyalty, thinking that I had accepted them as friends.”<br>
              <br>
“I had not. In my heart I knew that I hated them, especially my master Grimbulkin. I often tried to think of ways to escape from, or even kill, the evil goblin. Yet I never had the guts to go through with my plans. All of the goblins’ evil desires had left a burning sensation in me, a sense that there was a better way of life than the murdering of innocent people. I often thought of what else was out in the world, what I could accomplish if I could escape from the tribe. My chance would soon come.”<br>
              <br>
“One day Grimbulkin decided set out for a hunting trip with a couple of his comrades, and I was to be his shieldbearer that day. It was the first time that I would be out of the camp for more than a day. I kept my loyalty ploy going and continued to happily obey any order that I was given. The day soon grew old and after a while the tired goblins appointed me to watch the camp as they rested.” <br>
              <br>
“A foolish mistake. I set out in the darkness, taking a spare sword with me. I ran for my life, for I knew that if I was found I would have many unspeakable things awaiting me back at the camp. I was not sure of where I was or what lay before me, but I only wished to put as much distance between meself and my master. Luck was with me that night, for I did not run into any predators of any kind, but as the sun rose into the sky I knew that by now I was probably being followed. The sun was a welcome ally, many of the dangerous beings that lurked in those particular lands were only hunters of the night, but the danger was still there. I pressed on, and seeing a dark forest up ahead motivated my legs to continue to run. It would be near impossible for any pursuers to find me in the thick forest, but I knew not what awaited me deep in the dark growth of mangled trees.”<br>
              <br>
“I entered into the forest, the sunshine disappeared completely as the darkness engulfed me. My eyes, for I had two then, were normally accustomed to the lack of light. Strangely though, I could not see anything in this forest. Feeling my way through at a steady clip, I began to grow weary. I had expected the forest to be smaller than what it actually was, and when I realized that no end to it was in sight, I collapsed to the ground.” <br>
              <br>
“With my hands extended out before me though, I could feel a flat stone surface. Desiring to know what lie before me, I crawled toward the stone surface. The stone structure felt like a wall or possibly the face of a cliff and was oddly cold in the warm temperature of the forest. I felt my way across the structure and came to a wooden door, which proved to me that it actually was a wall, unless someone had installed a door into a cliff side. I found nothing to open the door with though, and shoving on the door also had no effect. The door would not budge one inch. I fell to the ground again, utterly exhausted from running for my life all day.” <br>
              <br>
“As I lay on the ground I heard a strange whooshing sound. I struggled to determine what the noise could have possibly been, for it did not sound familiar to any forest noises I had heard in my lifetime. I reached my hand out again and felt for the door, but it wasn’t there. I became very scared at that moment, but I knew what awaited me if I was found by my master. I got up and stumbled through the opening. A nasty odor met me when I entered. Feeling the inside of the stone wall, I made my way around the interior of the structure. From what I could tell, it was a square room with only one entrance and had no windows of any type. Still tired from running all night, I slumped down against the wall and slept the whole night through.”<br>
              <br>
“I awoke to the sound of something scraping against the stone floor. The sound made my skin crawl, it sounded like nothing I had ever heard before. I kept still, but noticed that it seemed to be making its way toward me. Then it stopped. I could only hear the sound of the ominous breeze blowing through the forest outside. Then it said something.” <br>
              <br>
“ ‘Who has dared enter my home?’ Its voice was the most ghastly thing I had ever heard, trailing off into the darkness and piercing the soul of whoever heard its deathly whispering. My whole body froze to the spot.”<br>
              <br>
“ ‘Who has dared enter my home?’, it asked me again in the same unfeeling tone of voice. I did not answer and I did not move, I only wished I had not entered into the building. The scraping had now started again and began to move closer. I only listened, hoping it did not know where I was or that it would go away. The noise was now very close, taunting me to run, but I could not. Again the scraping stopped, I guessed that whatever it was, it was now right in front of me.” <br>
              <br>
“Suddenly I felt something slash across my face. It hurt more than anything I had ever felt before, even more than the tortures and whippings of my old master. I could feel that my eye had been lost from the attack, but there was no difference in what I saw, because I could not see anything anyway. I winced away the pain and drew my sword, slashing it down in front of me. I hit nothing but the stone floor. Then I heard the thing laugh, a distorted laugh that only something of a purely evil nature could make. Once again I slashed down, hitting nothing but the floor. The laugh rang out again. I was terrified, but drew strength from the mocking of whatever haunted this stone hut in the middle of the forest. Making one last attempt to kill the thing, I got up and dashed across the floor in front of me while swinging my weapon wildly, hoping that I might connect with whatever it was that had attacked me. The laughing stopped abruptly. Then it cried out at me.”<br>
              <br>
“ ‘Come no further! Stop! I command you! No! You can’t do this to m-!’ The cry stopped abruptly when I crashed through a glass object standing in the middle of the room. The glass pierced into my skin as I fell onto the floor. Having dropped my sword when I crashed into the object, I immediately began searching the floor for it, all the while ignoring the glass splinters getting into my hands and knees as I searched. Then I felt something else on the floor. A rolled up scroll. I could not read it though, for it was too dark, so I stuffed it into my pocket and continued searching for my weapon. Then I found something else. A bead necklace. Not being concerned with petty jewelry at the time, I strapped it around my neck and continued searching.”<br>
              <br>
“As I searched and continued to find nothing I began to wonder about the things I had found. Why had the creature stopped talking when I ran into the glass object? Why had there been a scroll and a bead necklace lying on the ground? Were they inside the glass object I had broken? Where was the creature? Why hadn’t I found or heard any signs of it yet? These questions bounced around in my head as I searched for my weapon. The time passed by and I found nothing else, except for the remains of the glass splinters that had not embedded themselves into my hands yet. Having gone over the whole floor countless times, I finally gave up my search and headed back to the doorway, but there was no door. I figured that I had probably miscalculated the direction to the doorway. I turned the other way and walked toward the opposing wall, but when I met that wall, there was no door there either. I became frustrated for a few moments, wondering where the door might be. Suddenly, I had a stroke of genius and came up with a better approach, feeling my way along the inside of the structure.” <br>
              <br>
“No door was to be found. From what I could tell, it had vanished and been replaced by more wall. I was trapped. I tried in vain to somehow knock the wall down. Accomplishing nothing but to bruise myself. I fell to the ground, feeling defeated. Yet, I felt a tingling on my body where I had placed the scroll in my pocket. Curious as to what this artifact was, I hauled it back out of my pocket. Opening up the scroll, I jumped backward suddenly as the letters in the scroll lit up brightly, tracing beams of scorching, bright light into the dark room. I held the scroll out in front of me, looking away from the burning letters. The letters soon began to die down, until they finally glowed just enough to be read. Intrigued by the scroll, I held it up and stared at the words. They were written in a language unknown to me. For some reason though, I was able to fully understand what it said. I slowly read the scroll out loud in the room, each word disappearing from the scroll as I read it:<br>
<br>
                           <br>
                            ‘In my grasp lies powers untold, <br>
                            A healing touch and gifts made of gold, <br>
                            Creating a giant and masking the old, <br>
                            Imparting my vigor to those who behold.  <br>
                            My life has begun, my secrets unfold. <br>
                            Fighting the evils of darkness, and cold,<br>
                            Rewarding the lives of those who are bold.<br>
                            Destroying all those whose hearts are of mold.<br>
                            Straight into evil my brother’s been pulled,<br>
                            I hope that one day I may break evil’s hold. <br>
                            For you have discovered the great Quolijold.’ ”<br>
 <br>
              <br>
“As I uttered that last word the whole scroll flashed brightly in my hand and then turned back to normal. I threw it down, not knowing why though, almost as if something in the back of my mind had told me to. The scroll burst into blue colored flames as it hit the stone floor. Sparks flew in every direction then slowly drifted back to the floor, fading into nothing. Next, I felt the bead necklace around my neck. Another tingling sensation same as the scroll. I reached around and pulled it off, cautiously eyeing the thing. As I held it, it began to emanate a dull light, illuminating the small room so that I could see around it. Everything that I had previously perceived the room to be, turned out to be a total lie.”<br>
              <br>
“The whole room was imbued with magic. The walls and floor of the room were not made of stone, as I had originally thought, but were composed entirely of a substance that glittered like diamonds. I felt the wall, again it felt like rough stone. Even my footsteps made the sound that only the slapping of bare feet against stone could make. The ceiling was entirely nonexistent, the limbs of trees were entwined closely together over the building, which gave protection from the elements just as good, or better, than any ceiling could provide. The door was visible now too, appearing as a shimmering, reddish colored portal of some kind that was set into the wall. I looked to the center of the floor, gasping at the thing that was there.” <br>
              <br>
“The top half of a person’s body lay unmoving on its stomach, wearing the upper part of a suit of plate mail and holding a vicious looking scimitar in one hand. Why I had not found it earlier was beyond me. I crept closer to the body and peered at the finely crafted armor. It was of an exotic design, with curved spikes coming out in places. The armor had many layers, each one overlapping the other and being spaced out slightly to allow for venting, but not spaced out enough to let a weapon through. Wishing to identify the felled warrior, I flipped the body onto its back.”<br>
              <br>
“In the helm was the face of a skeleton, its jaw dislocated in a grisly way. I jumped back at the sight, but remembered that it was dead and returned to examining it. Being the greedy little goblin I was, I attempted to lift the helm off its head and claim it for my own. The head came with it though. Being overly hasty and once again showing my utterly low intelligence, I became overcome with greed and put the illuminating beads into my pocket instead of back around my neck. I figured that sacrificing the light so that I could remove the skeleton’s head would be a small price to pay.” <br>
              <br>
“I dropped the helm to the ground though when I felt something like a hand of steel grip my arm. I could not see what it was though, for I had put the beads into my pocket. I attempted to bring the beads back out with my free hand, but I was stopped when my arm was suddenly slashed violently. The pain was almost like when I had been slashed in the face earlier. I quickly thrust my hand toward my pocket again and this time successfully retrieved the beads. As I pulled them out, the grip loosened slightly. Looking down, I saw that the headless, legless skeleton had brought itself into an upright position and now held my wrist. Its other arm hung limp at its side, still holding the scimitar. I stared in complete horror at the thing as it slipped off my arm and toppled back to the floor.” <br>
              <br>
“The beads had stopped it… twice now. Each time they had been exposed to the room, the skeleton had ceased from doing anything. I knew at that moment that there was something very special about the beads and desired to find out more about them.”<br>
              <br>
“As I put the beads around my neck again, something different from before happened. The room suddenly became very small, the tree limbs nearly touching my head as the room shrunk before my eyes. I decided to pass through the portal on the other side of the room so that I could escape, in case I was crushed. When I started to move though, it seemed like I was walking on stilts. My balance was not as good as it had been before, but I felt revived and strengthened. As I walked outside, I noticed that I was once again seriously mistaken about many things.”<br>
              <br>
“The beads still glowed with light, allowing me to see some of the area around me. Everything appeared three times as small as it used to be. Tree limbs that previously loomed over my head were now nearly eye level. The trees themselves were not as large as I had remembered either, not being any wider than meself. I suddenly noticed how far away the ground appeared to be and became frightened. I cautiously lowered meself to a crawling position. The truth of the moment suddenly came upon me then as I looked down at my arms. To put it truthfully, from what had previously been there, these were practically two tree trunks. I glanced down at the rest of my body and saw that it still showed the whip marks from my old master, but everything else had changed. In place of my hanging belly was a washboard stomach. Instead of mere toothpicks, my legs were now gigantic and muscled. My whole body had changed from a twisted and gnarled frame into a warrior’s dream.”<br>
              <br>
“I also felt as if a load had been taken off my brain. Everything that I had not understood before was beginning to make sense now. Only I still had no idea what had just occurred and why my thoughts were so much easier to conjure up now. These things were meaningless to me though, I still retained my old hatred for my master.”  <br>
              <br>
“That day I took it upon meself to find Grimbulkin and show him what it meant to be tortured. I never did find him, but I learned much from the experience, as I also have learned much about the powers of this necklace. The powers that it bestows upon its wearer are many times beyond my comprehension though, for there is also much that I do not understand about it as of yet, especially what occurred in the magical room that I retrieved the beads from. I may never learn what truly happened there, but I believe with all my heart that I would not have lived if I had not found the magical beads.”<br>
              <br>
Kilmituk stopped then and wiped some sweat from his forehead. Then he took a flask of water from his side and took a long gulp of its contents. Putting it back he returned his gaze to Dharshan. <br>
              <br>
“So is the story of my life, but I must get some rest now,” with that Kilmituk leaned back on the edge of the large crater that had formed around his body in the soft ground and closed his eye. Dharshan was still trying to figure out the mysteries of Kilmituk’s story and was caught off guard when the goblin suddenly decided he wanted to go to sleep again.<br>
              <br>
“Wait! What about the dream?! What is its significance?!”, but it was too late. The goblin was already in a deep sleep once again and didn’t respond to any of his questions. Dharshan slumped back on the stump and took everything in that Kilmituk had told him, then realized that he too was becoming tired. Figuring that it wouldn’t do him any good to stay up, he found a nice spot on the ground and laid down. Once again he would be stuck in the forest for another night. <br>

I'm going to ramble a bit here, so here goes. I've just finished my sixth chapter and I'm about a page into my seventh, but the sixth should be due here when I finish my eighth. Confused? I thought so <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , but I have a good valid reason. Normally right when I finish a chapter, it isn't quite &quot;finished&quot;. So, if I let it sit for a while, I will normally have gone through it a few times and ironed out all the kinks and other filth that I missed when I wrote it the first time. This way, you can be guaranteed a &quot;relatively&quot; error free read (not all the time though, sometimes I miss stuff before it hits the site). I know you could probably care less, but I just had to let you all know (yeah right). Expect the fifth sometime soon.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
