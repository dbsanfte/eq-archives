Legna I played with you on rz btw.<br>
<br>
And the solution presented above is certainly not bad for NS.  They have good resist vs slash and neutral to thrust.<br>
<br>
Thats decent against either realms.  The only way to make it better would be resist vs both slash and thrust.<br>
<br>
No one is against NS getting help but for some inspiration let me say there was a nightshade on my server who felt if u were not getting 20k rp a day you were wasting your time.  (In which case I suck).<br>
<br>
He was hardcore but I struggle in killing him or a few other of the good nightshades.  <br>
<br>
I think you guys could use some help, but honestly..you aren't that gimped imo.  At least the nightshades on Galahad aren't really hurtin..some are quite feared.  Maybe they have buffbots I dunno.<br>

I do not have access to this dreamy configuration everytime I go out to RVR, hell I'm lucky to go out with a dex/quick buff.<br>
<br>
I raised my starting constitution to 50.  I put 5 in dex, 5 in quick and 10 in strength.<br>
<br>
I am a Level FIFTY ( 50 ) Nightshade in FULL con/hits gear.<br>
<br>
I have a unbuffed with items con of 125 which results in 1103 hit points UNBUFFED but with about +150 in HP gear.<br>
<br>
So? How, with a starting con of 70 have only 63 hitpoints than me?  That's impossible.  You must have neglected to put ANY points into constitution if you only have 2 more con points than me.  Something sounds fishy.  Someone clear this up for me please.  Is con primary, secondary or teritary for Shadowblades?  Your going to tell me that someone who starts with 70 CON, vs someone who starts with 50 CON ends up with 2 more con at End Game?  I have a hard time believing that.<br>
<br>
Bile, I also agree, we have the CHOICE to spec pierce/blades, however we don't have the CHOICE to go for the higher con/str points.  We are restricted to being a spell casting class base.  <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
[edit to clear my point due to some completely seeing red where there isn't any due to the bitterness in this game now] <br>
<br>
I really think Shadowblades should have the CHOICE just as we have the choice to spec weapons.  However, I also believe that Nightshades inherently need the choice to be able to take that 60 con bonus that being a Celt would give us.  Regardless it's a invalid option for me at this point and time.  There is no way on gods green earth i am taking another character to 50. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A> at: 8/1/02 8:18:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujekyllrogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jekyll Rogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 8:07:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3849.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Correcting a Misconception</span><hr size=1> &quot;however we don't have the CHOICE to go for the higher con/str points.

your primary stat is DEX, not STR/CON isnt it ?<br>
STR is not so important for you, especially if you use thrust, however you can alter STR/CON by using items, if you wish.<br>

Kaeen and I will be doing some intensive testing/logs on Pend Friday in regards to how this plays out.<br>
<br>
I'll be sure to post the results here.<br>

Once that is finished I'd be more than happy to do the same with a nightshade.<br>

<br>
It's funny, Balor. I post my stats endgame at level 50 and because SB's don't have 300-400 more HP then a Nightshade you feel I am a liar or I guess you call it &quot;fishy&quot;.<br>
<br>
I didn't put any points into con at start, as no one knew anything about stats when the game came out and I started playing.  Con gets NO raises for SB's as they level. Str, dex and qui are raised, same as the other Assassin classes.<br>
<br>
As my equipment is now, I have 2 more con then you for a total of around 50 more HP then you have.  This is why SB's complained that we were screwed in the patch that gave NS the new shout and Infil's 453 extra spec points.<br>
<br>
Sorry to burst your bubble about SB's having some overpowering load of Hit Points more then NS do. Of course, most NS feel they should get a con buff to even out the hit points now, which is quite funny to me. <br>
<br>
Ask the Kobold level 50's here what there unbuffed con and HP are, and ask what it is naked. Very similiar to a 40 con starting NS.<br>
<br>
