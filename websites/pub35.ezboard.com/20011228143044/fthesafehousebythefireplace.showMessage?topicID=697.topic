With it dead, I withdrew my blood covered dagger and began to loot the body of it's possessions. A shadow overlapped mine as I was tucking away the precious coins into my pocket and I froze.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on thief, we could use you in our party. Orcs aren't an easy foe to vanquish when they outnumber us.&quot;   I slowly rose to my feet and turned around to glance at the person behind me. There was no one.  &quot;Down here you scrawny elf.&quot; Blinking, I glanced down and there, the dwarf stood. My heart leapt into my mouth, a dwarven warrior. Regardless of his size, dwarves were the most proud of races, stubborn and frightfully strong. I did not want to get on his bad side, so I nodded, unable to get any words out. He nodded back and gestured for me to follow him. Reluctantly, I did and we can for a while across the burning deserts of Ro until we arrived near an Oasis. There, I met the other party members. A half elven druid, a wood elven druid, a gnomish magician and an erudite wizard. I kept my gaze downcast as I approached. They welcomed me brifely then quickly returned their attention to the orcs which were roaming the deserts. <br>
<br>
They didn't ask for my name. Not like anyone cared what the name of a thief was. I stood apart from the group, but close enough to hear them converse with one another. After a few moments, the dwarven warrior set his axe on the ground and withdrew his bow. He launched an arrow directly at an orc and I watched as it pierced it's arm. The orc howled in agony and charged at us in a fit of rage. It's howl had alerted the others and a priest with two other orc warriors came to it's aid. The dwarf muttered a violent curse in his own language and strapped his bow back on then quickly picked up his axe.  <br>
<br>
The orcs had not yet seen me so I began to sneak quietly around, closer to the group. The orcs and valiant Norrathians collided with a tremendous force which would have certainly killed a simple thief like myself. I <br>
quickly snuck behind the orcs and choose the one which the dwarf was battling. I took a deep breath. Swiftly, I reached out and plucked the orc priests purse from it's belt then stabbed my dagger into it's back at the same time. Then, it was immediately on me. It said something in it's own tongue and suddenly, an invisible force struck me hard on the chest sending me flying back several feet onto the sand. I laid there stunned but quickly collected my wits. I leapt back to my feet and back into the fray where, this time, I choose a warrior which appeared near death. I made a snatch for it's purse feeling a tang of guilt as I did so. I was such a coward. Like my one friend said before he left the realm, 'We are thieves. We will always be thieves and matching our betters is a dream we all have. A pity it is only a dream.  'My hand faltered at the thought and I missed the purse. Cursing myself for my clumsiness, I tried again only to miss again. Then, a lightning bolt came out of nowhere and fried the orc to the bone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop playing around and start killing something you good-for-nothing-rogue,&quot; the wizard snapped. I grimaced and turned to the nearest orc. Those words burned their way into my mind and anger clouded my judgment. I rushed forward and hurled my spear as hard as I could and watched in satisfaction as it fell to the ground, instantly dead. I ran to retrieve my spear, for it's worth was greater than anything I owned. As I turned around, I saw to my horror the half elven druid and the erudite wizard lay slain on the desert, their blood coating the sand. I felt my lunch begin to rise but forced it back down. Four more orcs had joined in the fray and were mercilessly beating down on the dwarven warrior, sapping away at his defenses and strength. The other druid was far off to the side casting spells to heal the warriors wounds, but the heals were not helping at all.  Then, I just lost it. I rushed away and began to sneak and hide in the sand. My heart was thumping hard against my ribs and sweat poured down my clothing. <br>
<br>
&quot;Get out of here! Now!&quot; the dwarf shouted loudly. A tingle ran down my spine as I realized what the dwarf was doing. The druid hesitated for a brief moment, but when two more orc warriors came, he nodded once to his friend, shouted something to him inaudible, then turned and ran as fast as a wolf. The magician, whose air elemental pet had long been slain, was already gone and no where in sight. The warrior was sacrificing himself to save the lives of his party members...what devotion and loyalty. His courage to face death for his party was outstanding. It was something that I could never have. I watched from the dunes as the orcs finished him off then charged off after the druid and magician. When they were gone, silence reigned. I slowly came out of my hiding and walked through the field of corpses. The sand was completely covered in the mixed blood of orc and Norrathian and the stench was just awful. <br>
<br>
I stopped by the slain warrior and gazed down at the corpse. A single tear dropped down my cheek as I mourned the death of a warrior who made such a noble sacrificed. Never in my life have I seen such a sacrifice. I slowly gazed up at the sky where rain clouds were gathering and silently prayed to Bristlebane that perhaps one day, I too would find such courage and strength to make such a sacrifice. Then, if that does ever happen, I will know for certain that thieves can be more...we can be better.<br>

I remember once when our Warrior was dead and our Wix and me were the only ones alive. Wizzie was dieing! I told him to run...got the Gnoll off him and watched as he gated back to Qeynos. Then I Hide/Sneak BSed the most wounded Gnoll..(there was three)then re hid and BSed him again..he dead. I used this method and auto attack to finish the others. I was declared a hero in BlackBurrow and still am to the ppl that were there. That is how I earned my honor. I know I didnt sacrifice myself because I didnt die but I was willing too. Hehe..it was profitable too...a couple of trains came through(I was RIGHT in the middle hidden)and i pick pocketed everything that came by...I was level 10.<br>
<br>
That was one of the defining days of my career!<br>
<br>
Great Story BTW!<br>
