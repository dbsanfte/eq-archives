<br>
Title           Max     Cost     'Parent' AA Skill<br>
<br>
Coup de Grace   3     2      Finishing Blow<br>
Fury of The Ages   3     3     Combat Fury<br>
Lightning Reflexes   5     2     Combat Agility<br>
Innate Defense     5     2     Combat Stability<br>
Hastened Purification of the Body   3     2     Purify Body<br>
Flash of Steel     3     3     Double Riposte<br>
Mending of the Tranquil     3     3     Critical Mend<br>
Ferocity     3     3<br>
Unstoppable Force     3     3<br>
Technique of Master Wu     5     1<br>
<br>
 All of them require your Luclin Arch/Class skills that are associated with them to be maxxed, with the exception of the last three which do no have prerequisites.<br>
<br>
