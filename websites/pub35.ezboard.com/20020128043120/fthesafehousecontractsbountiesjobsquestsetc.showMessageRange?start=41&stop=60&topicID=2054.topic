I'm sure those FoH warriors are better at keeping agro then most others, thus giving a false impression of how *most* rogues would evade on a normal raid. Also, dont forget that was with 6-12 people, the lag there couldn't have been high, making evade a lot easier. I really think evade is fine as is, I also have a 51 rogue and do enough dmg to get hit regardless of evade due to failed evades. This change could work, but to impliment it, I suggest at least a 50% hate reduction, 33% wont make up for those ragebringer backstabs and it will start a spiral of sure death if the rogue's first evade doesn't get the mob off them.<br>
<br>
I'm not a rogue expert as I love mage too much, but I have a pretty good idea about this issue. And don't hate me because my rogue is a semi tweak, he wasn't powerlevelled, just helped a little with gear <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
There is no hidden agenda, no external threat, no protecting of zones in mind behind these changes, no knee-jerking.  <br>
<br>
They are things we wanted to look at in the past, but didn't have the time. Now we have time. <br>
<br>
Evade as it was originally coded worked fairly well in terms of utility and balance, pre-Kunark.  <br>
<br>
The changes brought on by raising the level cap, (offensive capabilities, hit points, spells, equipment) had side effects we didn't prepare for. Some good, some bad.<br>
<br>
Most of the MANY changes we're testing or have already implemented recently are heavily in favor of the player, but we HAVE to look at both sides. <br>
<br>
When looking at locking down a class for good, which is our goal, we have to look at every aspect of said class.  What do they do, how do they do it, why do they/don't they do it well.<br>
<br>
We looked at Hybrids, and came to the consensus that the experience penalty had to go, and that they could still use some more tuning, hence the changes up on Test right now.<br>
<br>
We looked at Druids, Mages, and Shaman, saw a problem, and went about correcting it. <br>
<br>
We looked at Warriors, saw a bug in the Agressive and Defensive code, fixed it. <br>
<br>
We looked at Rogues, saw an oversight in the way Evade worked, and we proposed a change that will not in any way ruin the class, nor make them less powerful, but will make them responsible for more of their damage output.<br>
<br>
We looked at Clerics at the same time we were looking at the other priest classes, and the Donal's breastplate changes were settled upon.<br>
<br>
We're not done looking at the other classes at this point, and we may well make another pass on those that we have looked at already.<br>
<br>
As to me personally, I am not concerned about how FoH does Sleeper's Tomb, and it has no bearing on my support for Evade changes.  <br>
<br>
I did content for the zone to allow people to have fun while faced with a large challenge.  Ask 'em..they're having fun and facing a challenge.

<br>
Make sure warriors can taunt.  Warrior Taunt blows now and any hybrid can taunt more effectively than warriors.<br>
<br>
Also missed backstab should not taunt, they still do.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this sounds interesting.<br>
<br>
One nerf count so far, wonder what improvements we can see?<br>

<br>
My previous comments notwithstanding, I feel that this change in Evade will come under harsh scrutiny from many rogues who will see it in the same light as many other changes that Verant makes in the game engine:  A change that is directed at ensuring that multi-group raids of &quot;uber&quot; characters are &quot;fair&quot;...  The end result is often that the &quot;normal&quot; player is put at a disadvantage as a result of such changes.<br>
<br>
While I don't think that will necessarily be the case here, I can understand (and fully expect) this type of reactionary response.  Your challenge will be to convince the average &quot;one group&quot; rogue that Evade will still work well in his single group setting.  Indeed, a change that works only in the setting of the multi-group raid and leaves rogues less effective in a single group would not be to my liking either, I must say...<br>

Get some rogues different lvs on test or something then on a live server and kill some frogs in guk a few dragons and then a uber mob and see if the Nerf on Evade does what you claim it is supposed to.<br>
<br>
Plz do some testing and don't just &quot;Donal's bp&quot; us like you guys did to Clerics.You guys come up with one solution out of the blue and no testing is done then you do a &quot;fix&quot; to the first nerf and so on and so forth. Plz if you need people to try out the Nerf you got a few thousand rogues here who whould be glad to test out the new evade.<br>

<br>
When testing this new change, and deciding whether Evade is still doing its work properly, please do some testing with (for US customers) VERY high ping numbers.<br>
<br>
I play from Europe, and when I am on a modem, my ping sits rather steady around 350 ms. When I am on my cable modem, ping can go as low as 230 if I am lucky.<br>
<br>
<br>
This means:<br>
I very often move while attempting to evade, since timing it between mob hits is hard.<br>
<br>
It appears as if I already today often have problems getting down to that 120 hate points. For evade to work and actually make the mob hit someone else is RARE, even when I get the skill success message. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umallocimadvig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malloci Madvig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 1:43:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What we are proposing for Evade.</span><hr size=1> I totaly disagree with what is proposed, but if you are going to do it how about an increase in the percentage as you gain levels, as a level 50 rogue probably doesnt produce half the hate of a level 60.<br>

  All I want to get across is that these two points are equally valid:<br>
<br>
  Xalren:  &quot;The bottom line for me, is that no matter how you sugar coat it, putting a % reduction in how many 'points' of hate evade removes is equivalent to putting a relative cap on the rate of damage that a rogue can do (can only be 25% more than the tank). No matter how 'unfair' you try to make it sound that the rogue can evade themselves to a very low point on the hate list...&quot;<br>
<br>
  Kendrick: &quot;We looked at Rogues, saw an oversight in the way Evade worked, and we proposed a change that will not in any way ruin the class, nor make them less powerful, but will make them responsible for more of their damage output.&quot;<br>
<br>
  The point about making rogues responsible for their damage output is intensely good, Kendrick, major props for that.  But, there is a very very fine line to be walked there.  Xalren is *entirely* correct as well.  In a strange way, a raid containing the best equipped rogue in the game in a dmg dealing sense will be limited by the effectiveness of the warriors (weapons for dmg dealing, procs for taunt, the taunt button, etc).<br>
<br>
  My guild has, honestly, sought to equip their rogues with the most devastating weaponry available in this game and has done a very good job of doing so.  Many of those weapons are no drop, yet... if I can no longer use those weapons effectively due to being unable to mitigate the amount of hate I generate, I will be failing those weapons and I feel my guild as well.  I will have taken away weapons which would be better suited on warriors, as using those weapons to their greatest proficiency and maximum damage may outdue the percentile of hate reduction you place.<br>
<br>
  Essentially, I would like to see the most devastating rogue be able to successfully evade each time and have those evades continue to outstrip maximum damage output.  The responsible rogue will understand the requirement to back off due to failed evades (which *does* occurr currently, btw, in uber mob raids early in the fight... just that in my experience the necessity for continued successful evades drops significantly during prolonged fights).<br>
<br>
  Very interesting topic, to say the least.<br>

Seems to me, if the problem is really rogue never getting hit in battles with more then a group around the mob, the best thing to do would be to simply make a successful evade lower you 6 positions down on the hate list, not make the radical change that has been proposed.<br>
<br>
BTW, tell a ranger to reduce the amount of damage he is doing to avoid getting smacked around so much, dang, I'd hate to have to start telling myself that.<br>

p.s.  As it is, the only thing that can tank for me is a decently equipped ranger or warrior duel wielding.  And I'm not exactly using a blood point and trak tooch (eyerazzia and 8/20 club).  Okay, a caster blowing all his mana at the begginning of a fight can tank nicely as well for a limited time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukivi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kivi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 6:19:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What we are proposing for Evade.</span><hr size=1> *cheer Kivi vs Bloodmaw piccy*<br>

Do us all a favor and tell Absor to shut the @#%$ up if he isn't going to explain things.  Him telling us its a change that they wanted to make, but not a nerf doesn't mean squat.  For Verant to come out and say something, with little info, is stupid.  If decisions haven't been made, and details can't be given, DON'T TELL US.  You see the kind of mess this generated on the boards.  If a post similar to your would have been posted, there would be much more acceptance.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU for telling us what's happening and I just wish every class had someone that would explain issues to them in such a manner.<br>
<br>
Now, I think I'm with Kaylum on this one.  There is a change being made to evade based soley on what happens in multi-group raids?  I don't understand that at all.<br>
<br>
And I agree, I don't get hit much on planes raids and things like that, but I DO get hit plenty on normal grouping, no matter who is tanking, so that's where my concern lies.  If I have to start refusing Haste buffs to keep myself alive, I'm going to be very pissed, but I don't know that yet, so I won't jump to conclusions.<br>
<br>
Also, someone mentioned Warrior taunt... it just isn't there.  Sure, their taunt skill is higher than hybrids, but does anyone at Verant pay attention to normal grouping patterns?  A Pally can keep a mob off me much better than a warrior by using taunt and stuns...you know, besides the fact that it stuns the mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Warrior taunt needs to be high enough so that it can out-taunt hybrid melee/taunt/spells. <p><hr>

Is this going to have any effect on us finding the High Elf mask?  I think a successful evade should point you in the direction of the NPC that you need to talk to about the mask. <p>Colvin - 30 <b>REDEEMED</b> dark elf rogue - Reapers of Fate - Tarew Marr<br>

I get the crap beat outta me still, with evade the way it is.  It DOES keep me from gettin dead as much, but still get beat on pretty hard, even after succesful evades.  Before I can lend my support to the fix of evade, I would like to know what a warrior/hybrids taunt is....  Meaning, if I evade, &amp; it moves me down %30 on the aggro list, what % does a player using taunt move up on that list???  Forgive me all if this question has a simple answer, like &quot;It moves you to the top&quot; but I am ignorant of how taunt works.... I just know that its supposed to make things not hurt me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Grendl Nighthunter<BR>51st Rake<BR>Founder & member: <a href="http://www.sanguineblade.8m.com"><font color=#ff0000>Sanguine Blade</font></a><BR> Bristlebane Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwoodash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woodash</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 8:59:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What we are proposing for Evade.</span><hr size=1> Sounds like a reasonable change to evade to me...<br>

About this post:<br>
---<br>
Oh... And btw... How Absor posted this on the rogue talk thread in the gameplay forum was really awkward... Made it sound like if I was fighting something solo, evaded it, it would run to any nearby target other than me [even if he didn't touch it] and I could backstab it and laugh as it chased him/her...<br>
---<br>
<br>
it DOES work that way. Ever fought near the zone in Karnors? The second you evade it your mob will run after the nearest medding character and start smacking them around. People get really annoyed with me when I evade a mob onto them to get in a free backstab *GRIN*<br>
<br>
I used to ONLY use evade when I needed to turn a mob around. Now I'll have to watch it, calculate it, and try to keep him off of me with multiple evades... *shrug* play your rogue right, group with people who know their classes too, and this could actualy be an improvement in evade, IMO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucreepypete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CreepyPete</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 9:34:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What we are proposing for Evade.</span><hr size=1> I'm with Kaylum and Lurik.<br>

This change smells of tuning the game for every encounter in Norrath based on what most would consider exceptions. The people you are REALLY intending this to affect will have a workaround in place within a week, leaving the rest of our asses swinging in the wind.<br>
<br>
Evade fails often enough due to server latency as it is, but I'm sure anyone with the best equipment plat can buy, a guild to supply them with optimum group composition and a nice fast 'net connection will be very supportive of this change.<br>
<br>
Fix the mobs, not evade. Or make us the new Rangers. Your choice.<br>
<br>
&quot;..modify your damage output..&quot; <br>
<br>
Heh. <br>

Literally.<br>
<br>
For those of us who regular group with hybrids, we will have to "modify [our] damage output" to do LESS damage than our tank.  What good are we then?<br>
<br>
A 37 rogue with SCH and BR does more damage without backstab than a 38 paladin with Wurmslayer.  Add in backstabs and our damage skyrockets above them.  Perhaps evade and taunt will work in this case, but does that mean I can never group with a lower level tank?  A 35 pally or SK may well be ineffective.<br>
<br>
All I ask:  Please test out different hate percentages with different group configurations.<br>

Hmm..actually I already thought Evade was nerfed.  Maybe it's just me but as of 1 or 2 patches ago, I've been evading like crap.  I'm hardly able to get mobs off of me anymore for some reason and it's a huge drain to the clerics.  The warrior's claim they are taunting but to no avail.  I guess I could be wrong, but most other rogues I've talked to agree that it hasn't been working well lately.<br>
<br>
If you haven't already made evade less effective (and it seems like you did) i'm very worried about what this change might do.  I agree that some sort of change needs to be made for accountability of damage, but please make sure it isn't a complete and total nerf.   We aren't evading as much as you think we are as it is.<br>
