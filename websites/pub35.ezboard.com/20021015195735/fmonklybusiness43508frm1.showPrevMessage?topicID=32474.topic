The Sept. 9th patch may have toned down the resist changes a little bit but I'm still seeing extreme unbalance with spells in pvp now.  Anyone on pvp servers ( or who've dueled much, for that matter) know how devastating snare/darkness line can be on a melee if it sticks in pvp. Even with proper buff stacking, pumice often won't remove what you want but will pass it over for some of your good buffs instead.<br><br>A few days ago, a 60 sk gank that jumped me while I was xping was able to stun me using bash skill, every couple of tries. Bash*stun* Bash*stun* Bash *stun*...Guildie SK said bash was significantly improved this last patch.  Maybe when bash was given to clerics, it was improved generally as well? /shrug<br><br>This same sk, uber geared by his long stint in an anti-gank guild (before he went to the griefer side) finally almost went down vs my avge geared medium sized guilded monk (due to some timely heals from an alt) when he hit harmshield and was able to do the &quot;vox port out&quot;, racing to vox lair and getting banished with no life showing. He then shouted to the zone for half an hour like an ass about how &quot;with harmshield he is invincible&quot; and how he will &quot;never die&quot; again in pvp.<br><br><br>I don't know what Verant's thinking but making a super powered pvp class (sks) much stronger with the resist and dot stacking changes, with harmshield and with improved bashing, (go check out shadowknight.org, and see how many of them brag about how &quot;no class should ever be able to beat them&quot;) anyway these changes don't seem to be in the interest of balancing whatsoever. Ok, ok EQ is primarily &quot;not a pvp game&quot;, whatever, but doesn't it make sense they should not ignore pvp balance issues totally, not only for duels but for the thousands who do actually enjoy the zeks? <br><br>If pvp was better implemented in EQ I bet we'd see many more players playing on the zeks (look at the initial huge interest in SB, a game structured around pvp) but due to people &quot;giving up&quot; on VI's version of pvp (likely bc of a widespread perception VI has 'given up' on pvp balance), I think is the real reason the zeks are less populated than they could be. <br><br>But I digress.<br><br>What's this long, semi whiney post about? A couple things. <br><br>1) I'm hoping VI does some similar &quot;fixes&quot; to monks, to make us more effective in pvp.  We need a better way to interrupt.  Some reports I've heard of dragon punch knockback suggest it can work in pvp to interrupt, but looking at details of the skill on lucy's it suggests it has a 18 sec recharge? At any rate SK's in particular can bash and stun like crazy now from my experience, along with their large retinue of spells, skills, and VERY nice hps/ac/resist that is not so hard to attain,what with the nice values VI puts on alot of plate armor. We need some very reliable interrupt skills at least that work this way in pvp. Take away any delay in dragon punch knockback, if there is one (I'm still 10 aaxp away from finding out firsthand).<br><br>2) Keep retuning the pvp resist system, engulfing darkness/snare shouldn't be sticking on a 60 monk with 150+ MR the first try, that spell is just too devastating in pvp to be so easy to stick. It can be instant death to a melee all too often, given the unpredictability of pumice in removing top buffs. (For those who didn't know, golem wands and all other instant cast pumice effects that I know of have all been nerfed to be 3.0-4.0 or worse casting time).<br><br>3) Finally I'd like to hear some from other 60 monks about aaxp skills that have improved their dueling/pvp skills. How has dragon punch worked for you, at least vs the non pure casters (hybrids, with a lesser channeling skill, I'd think it would work better against than the pures)..ANy other skills in particular? I can easily see CA and CS helping in melee v melee jousting battles, any other things you've found to help alot?<br><br>steel<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublytzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blytzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://blytzz.freewebspace.com/images/train.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1267<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/13/02 2:19:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31982.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://blytzz.freewebspace.com/images/train.gif/images/buddies/badassbuddy_com-train!.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monks need pvp upgrades</span><hr size=1> omg!

That's not my question. My question concerns the aaxp &quot;proc&quot; called knockback, that works off of DP to push the target back about 3 ft.  I mentioned that Lucy's states it has a 18 sec recharge time. I'm wondering if this means that it takes about 18 secs for it to proc again as you are dragon punching away, or if in fact it can proc each time you hit dragon punch (giving it a 2.5 sec refresh time, for all practical purposes).  If anyone who has it wants to comment on it, and on how effective it is or isn't in pvp vs hybrids, and also vs. pure casters, thx in advance.<br><br>steel <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uryumasters1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryumasters1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 503<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/14/02 2:03:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31982.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pvp </span><hr size=1> I have been thinking of starting a side toon on a pvp just for fun.<br><br>What I really would like is if I could convince a friend of mine to join me.

Here I am on my class board, monkly-business, and this thread I started to get support and ideas about monks in duels and in pvp situations has been almost ignored by my class, but hijacked by casters.<br><br>This from Haas:<br>__________________________________________<br>Ya, and before the changes, most casters were totally useless against melee PvP. Shamans had the disease line to use on you if they don't have malo. Necros have ignite blood and splurt (pumiced), enchanters are just walking corpses...<br><br>Now the tables are turned, i'm sure some of your caster buddies you've been ganking repeatedly in dungeons are happy to finally be able to return the favor. <br><br>______________________________________________<br><br>I found this hilarious.  <br>Go look at the rosters on RZ' gank guilds(the lower lvl ones all the way up to the ones with 60s in them) and you will find about 95-98% casters in every one of them.  This is not some fluke or strange anomaly. This is because for the style of pvp they do, grief ganking, the fast kill is king, and the ability to be highly effective in so-so no drop gear only(rallos is still one item loot) favors casters. <br>It's been this way from the start, and nothing VI has done has changed it. Why they have been implementing changes that are making the ganks more and more powerful, in light of the above easily verified imbalance already in favor of the caster griefer, raises alot of questions but makes no sense.<br>Beyond any doubt, casters have a large advantage outdoors in pvp, taking advantage of the ghosting bugs, shadowstep spells, and the other easy ways they have to gain distance between them and the melee.<br><br>All the resist and stacking changes VI just made are serving only to make casters king in indoor settings as well, as &quot;Haas&quot; above, tips his hat to.  As a 60 monk I've been having engulfing darkness stick on me through 157 MR first try. That spell is almost game over to a melee, and it's sticking through very good resists. What it's done if anything is make the sk the undisputed king of indoor pvp, with his darkness line sticking easily, his ability to fd helping him with the mobs that often get involved, his ability to easily stun without any resistance checks ramped up even in the latest patch, his lifetaps and harmtouch virtually unresistible and the disc that turn HT into a 1k+ in pvp insta dm spell and the aaxp that turns it into a 1k-ish lifetap, both virtually unresistible too.<br><br>Does this not bother any of you, fellow monks? I was hoping that DP knockback was going to help me regain some ability to fight sks, at least indoors where my strengths are, but it's sounding like its not that hard to resist with half decent resists. <br>Is it ok to you that regardless of how much labor you do in the game to improve your character, that VI keeps making other classes stronger in pvp settings (and the blues here , in duel settings) and has done nothing for us in that setting? Is everyone so happy with fighting computer controlled and predictable mobs, that monks have grown lackadaisical in regards to how we are holding up in one on ones vs other classes? <br><br>If so that's sad. Alot of people here posted that &quot;EQ is not a pvp game&quot;. Go visit the Zeks and you will quickly see that that is false, you can indeed play eq vs other players. I suspect what they really mean is &quot;EQ implementation of pvp is not good enough to warrant playing it with pvp as a significant part of the play&quot;. Well, this deserves a few words.<br><br>I played Age of Empires, a rt strategy game, vs others, and enjoyed it.<br><br>I plyed Warcraft 2, a rt strategy game, vs others, and enjoyed it.<br><br>I played Starcraft, a rt strategy game, against others, and enjoyed it.<br><br>I played Red Alert, a rt strategy game, against others, and enjoyed it.<br><br>I played about myth, and giants:citizen kabuto, and about a dozen other games, vs others, and enjoyed it.<br><br>Similarly, I play EQ, a rts mmorpg, vs others, and I enjoy it.<br><br>Every game I listed above had its issues with pvp. AoE and RA quickly evolved into tank rush type domination due to imbalance favoring certain types of craft/fighters.<br><br>Warcraft had many bugs that enabled the kewl doods to use all sorts of tricks to avoid losses and climb the &quot;ladder&quot; through trickery. <br><br>Giants was unbalanced in its classes favoring the siren type people over the mechs.<br><br>Every single game I've ever played against others has had its issues but every one I've taken up was fun and EQ has been no exception.  It's not perfect, but it's still very fun and is worth the time in my and many others opinion to post things like this thread to try to help fix it rather than dismiss it as a waste.<br><br>So the question remains, what can VI do to improve the monk class and strengthen us a little in light of the recent caster/bash/stacking changes.

Before the patch, I'd never been killed by a green con (which is anyone lower than five levels below me).  After the patch, snare or root lands *immediately* upon first casting and lasts the full duration.  Since the patch, I've run into two groups of green cons--waaay low green cons, as in 20-30th level, three people in each group.  They killed me both times (a snared monk is about as effective as an orc pawn, for those of you who don't play on the PvP servers).<br><br>I'm taking a break until the next patch, when they're supposed to address it.  This is the latest word from former Sullon Zek GM Rytan, who is now a dev:<br><br>&quot;Yeah we changed the resist system for PvP from what it is now on the PvP servers.  It's based on a diminishing returns system so you can't ever get totally immune to certain types of spells, but it's a little easier to get to the &quot;protected&quot; level where you won't get hit every time.  Should be updated next patch.&quot;<br><br>I wrote back and asked:<br><br>&quot;So what's a rough estimate on the protected level?  150 MR?  175?&quot;<br><br>He responded:<br><br>&quot;It's higher then it used to be, but I don't have the actual formula.  I'm guessing your 150 should be adequate in most cases if you're not fighting someone who's red.  I'm glad for the changes actually.  It used to be that anything over about 140 in a resiste made you all but immune to spells of that type other then damage spells.&quot;<br><br>So while I'm pretty much going offline until the next patch, I'll have to check out the rebalancing when the next patch hits.  I completely agree with alot of the people out there--the resistance nerf makes playing a monk on a PvP utterly impossible, unless you're just doing the usual raid/xp session (and not getting interrupted by the other two teams).<br><br>I saw a bard with 300 MR get rooted by a level 14 wizard.  And although PvP servers are the red-headed step-children of EverQuest, I would imagine that Verant makes over $500,000 a year from us (gross, at least), so I kind of wish that whoever was in charge of this patch would've been paying attention a little more.  You'd think that when they do a resistance patch, they'd be thinking about PvP as well as the blue game.  Obviously, they didn't.<br><br>There'll probably be quite a bit of fine-tuning over the next six months with this, so be sure to /feedback it.  Believe it or not, they do read them.<br><br>Z.<br> <p>Zhyang Woo<br>Avatar of Lizard Sexiness, RETIRED<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117842">My Ridiculously Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukazdun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kazdun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/18/02 1:34:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31982.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pvp</span><hr size=1> Yes, eq may not be directed around pvp, but then they should not have made pvp servers if they are just going to ignore them?<br><br>And everyone who is like, oh too bad u play on pvp etc..  wtf..
