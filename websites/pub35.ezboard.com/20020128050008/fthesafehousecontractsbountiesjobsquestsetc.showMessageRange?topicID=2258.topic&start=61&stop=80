Kezzek, the safehouse needs a greater uniformity in the enforcing of its rules. Some people get a slap on the wrist, others have a blind eye turned. Some topics are ok to post about multiple times in the same and other forums, some topics can only be mentioned in one thread before they become blasphemous.<br>
<br>
As far as I can remember (I've been posting here since September, 1999), the Safehouse has been a rogue EQ message board. We occasionally had some non-EQ content, but by and large it was about Everquest and the rogues within. Now a greater portion of the content is more about EQ in general and less about rogues specifically. We went on quite a while, alive and kicking, without Outside Norrath. Outside Norrath is a spillover from the increasing content which wasn't pertinent to EQ (hence the name), I read it maybe once every couple of weeks just for the hell of it. HTML Help isn't essential for our survival.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukezzek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kezzek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/smallPadlock.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asst.

<br>
Things aren't going to be uniform.  We're not robots, we're just trying to be as fair as possible.  We miss some, we catch some.  We're always trying to apply the sig rules as fairly as possible.<br>
<br>
But, there are SO MANY that we can't possibly check them all, every day, without error.<br>
<br>
Truth is, I've long campaigned for disabling sigs altogether on the boards.  I'm alone in this opinion, however--and I can live with that.  As a compromise, there are 2 forums where sigs are disabled--due to traffic and the enormous percentage of visitors (e.g. just swinging by, not their regular board)--and we don't have to waste our time and energy for such a trivial thing.<br>
<br>
I state right out--I loathe graphical sigs.  You all know that.  I hate, hate, HATE them.  They are a waste of bandwidth and our time.<br>
<br>
But I realize I'm in the minority and am able to compromise and accept the differing opinions/wishes.<br>

I thought that was uncalled for, Kezzek.  Without trying to infer anything, that says:  I don't agree with what you said so I want to beat up.  Granted, this is not going to happen on an online board, but it isn't the most loving sentiment either.  I commented, in a civil fashion, that I enjoyed the atmosphere of the safehouse before Halen made his presence known.  This is my own opinion, but its one I think I'm entitled to; it wasn't absusive.  Perhaps we need guidlines as to what remarks are permissable and which aren't, so nobody feels that moderation might be tainted with favortism?<br>
<br>
Like you, I don't like the large graphical signatures.  To me their surge in use signaled .. a second generation for the Safehouse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/01 10:31:40 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Permanently banned</span><hr size=1> Not a flame here, just an explanation - Um, if you know me, which I thought you would do, you'd appreciate that that was humour, not a threat, sheesh ;-).

About your quick thing, scroll up and check out the profile on &quot;jingles&quot;, which is the account I used before changing to &quot;Hyarth&quot;.  Jingles was a multi-purpose account, when my time became more devoted to EQ based boards I went with my character name as to avoid confusion.  The whole reason jingles has that accidental post is because I logged in that account halfway through my post to check the date.  =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/01 10:50:54 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Permanently banned</span><hr size=1> 28th september 1999 compared to 3rd november 1999.... wow, 5 days. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhyarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hyarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/01 10:59:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Permanently banned</span><hr size=1> Ok, swap &quot;Halen&quot; with &quot;Shadowcross&quot;.  =p<br>

&quot;You and me. outside. now&quot;  -- to me this lacked any kind of indication fo humour or jest.  Yes, I can see how it may have been intended that way.  And I don't think Hyarth took it as a THREAT either... more of a sentiment that conveys, &quot;I'm a bully, I'm gonna shove you around.&quot;  That's the way it sounded to me.  Now, yes, knowing your sense of humour Halen, and the british origin of said humour, I understand how it was likely not meant this way.  But this goes back to the age old (years old?) problem with communication on the internet.  Subtext is hard to convey, what might have been apparent through facial expressions or tone of voice doesn't come through... hence emoticons, none of which were present.  And yes I know this isn't news to you or anyone here but sometimes we all need to be reminded of the obvious. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As the post stood, it seemed like boorish, bullying, nonsense.

&quot;I miss the days before... Halen&quot; -- I don't think that is an uncalled for swipe, nor is it an insult.  It wasn't inflammatory, it wasn't insulting.  Simply saying &quot;I don't like what you have brought to the Safehouse&quot; isn't an insult... it's a simple statement of fact expressing his point of view. <p>Notwen Gif<br>

<br>
Uniformity is impossible with 16,000 people to moderate.  Everyone is going to find an instance where they can point to that they feel they, or someone else, was not treated the exact same as someone else who made a similar post.<br>
<br>
It may be cliche and seem condescending, but all I can say to anyone with any complaint about the manner in which the Safehouse is moderated, is make your own board, and see how consistent you can be when the vclume becomes this large.  The staff does the best they can and they do it on a volunteer basis.  It's not a job at which we have some right to hold them accountable.<br>
<br>
On another note, to a point, I agree with Judas.  I don't care about Outside Norrath, never have and rarely look in it.  It's probably been 4 months since I made a post there which is quite a while considering I have made 4,000 of them.  I come here to get information for my rogue, and to debate strategies and theories involving playing Everquest.  Some people think Outside Norrath and threads about muffins promotes an atmosphere of togetherness - I think it promotes more of a clique mentality than anything.  You see threads about old generation vs new and such, but generally when attitudes collide it's more between the "insiders" who feel this is their home versus the people who aren't chummy with everyone dicussing muffins, pancakes and chocolate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujudaslovesjesus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JudaslovesJesus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/01 12:35:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Permanently banned</span><hr size=1> For someone with 3 (well, now 4) posts, I seem to have stirred things up.

I guess that goes to show that Hyrath, who may not have been here as long as some people, but did just solve the most elusive quest in our few year history may have a bit more important things to say than someone with just a higher post count/longer stint here.  No, I didn't mention Halen's name, and no I didn't take his comment as an insult.  Of course the people that stand firmly behind what I attacked are going to be upset.  It's the way it goes.

<br>
I still love posting here as much as I ever did. I miss some of those who have left, but there are other people who have come and continually help to redeem this place. Regular vs. Safehouse noobie isn't a valid argument. <br>
<br>
Basically, there are aspects of the &quot;old days&quot; I miss, and there are aspects of the present that I enjoy more. I'm certain this will hold true as time passes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unimbletoekneeslapper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NimbletoeKneeslapper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://boisdarc.tamu-commerce.edu/~kev/NimDance3.gif WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=22 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/18/01 1:26:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Permanently banned</span><hr size=1> as long as no one is overly sensitive to personal jibes now and again, all should be fine.  I believe it is teh repeated stirring up of trouble that we seek to avoid here, and rightfully so.  But I *have* seen the crew be just a little too sensitive on matters...heated matters...before, and was uncalled for.  <br>
<br>
I think the basic philosophy that needs to be remembered here is &quot;don't stir up S**T just to stir up S**T&quot;.<br>
<br>
