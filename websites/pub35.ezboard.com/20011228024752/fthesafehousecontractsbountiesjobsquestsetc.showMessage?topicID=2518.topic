Players are getting higher in lvl.  I would guess that their newb numbers are dropping and the only true newbies are twinks/alts being created by faithful EQers.  ToV seems to be the location of choice....why? Loot of course.  A game about loot, you'll find the majority of the high end players in these areas. <p><BR>

However, the prudent verant would have taken these actions 1-2 months before DAoC minimum.  Its no secret that a lot of people were not enjoying EQ, and were looking for a viable alternative.  D2 got repetitive, AO was flaky and bad launch marred its future, AC didn't have a chance.   <br>
<br>
But now, DAoC hits the scene and Verant is scrambling to iron some loyalty into its customers.  These rushed ideas are showing the true colours i think.  Verant is losing more customers than they had anticipated and new content is months away.  To me it looks like Verant is getting desperate; they can't add new content, the revenue must be flying south and the future looks bad.  So Verant implements some changes to the way classes work, and loosens the handcuffs on GMs/guides.  Quick easy fixes, but its really just a case of to little to late.  Take a look at the auction sites too, level 60 clerics with epics are being sold for 400 bucks.  200+ days played online tossed away for a fistful of dollars.  2 dollars for 24 hours..  less than 9 cents an hour for 2.5 years of work.  <br>
<br>
Its plain to see; Verant is worried about its future income. <p><img src="http://cervant.netfirms.com/pint.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucervantus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cervantus</A> at: 10/16/01 7:34:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uglipthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glip the Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/16/01 9:28:53 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.keithparkinson.com/glip2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: John Smedley - Reviewing Customer Service at Verant</span><hr size=1> No offense but you don't know what you're talking about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .   You sound way too much like another perpetually pissed off or paranoid gamer looking for a conspiracy theory, who thinks the head honchos at Verant sit in a dark room at night plotting against their paying customers.<br>
<br>
First, new content comes out next month.  Singular.<br>
<br>
Second, maybe this has something to do with Smedley taking over McQuaid's position.  I highly doubt DAoC had anything to do with Brad leaving.<br>
<br>
Yes, and some level 60 characters are being sold.  But do you know what? For that one being sold there's 100 others still playing every day.  Its not like selling uber characters is anything new either.  This has been going on way before either AO or DAoC were anywhere near being playable.  Heck, even before Asheron's Call came out people were hawking characters on Ebay.<br>
<br>
The majority of the players ARE NOT unhappy.  The majority of the players ARE NOT leaving for another game and the majority of the players ARE NOT selling their characters.<br>
<br>
Verant has right now, just as many suscribers as they've ever had.  And believe me, they're not going to have a problem with future income.  <br>
<br>
You can't honestly expect Star Wars not to sell like a trillion copies can you?  I can't even fathom how big that will be.  Not to mention the numerous other games they're currently working on.  All of which are almost shoe-in best sellers.  <br>
<br>
Why can't Verant just be listening to their customers, and changing their policies based on suggestions just TO BE NICE.  They don't another company's game coming out to motivate them into action.  If that was the case, why have we been continually getting upgrades and neat new stuff even when there were no other games in site? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uglipthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glip the Gnome</A> at: 10/16/01 9:30:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugreldek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Greldek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/16/01 10:12:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: John Smedley - Reviewing Customer Service at Verant</span><hr size=1> Solusek Ro+Karana+Cazic-Thule= Ayonae Ro ... just to clarify 3 not 2...<br>

This one is received email from Verant, concerning about ninja-loot incident where no-drop WW 7/6 dragon necklace was been ninjaed while groups were randoming who should get the piece. There is a nice thread on EMarr board about this, so this was just an example of how Verant's written policies (you shall not loot what is not yours) contradict by this one. <br>

Hello,<br>
After investigating this further and speaking to most of the people that<br>
were around at the time, I have decided that my original decision will<br>
stand. From what we were told and could verify, the person who looted the<br>
item was not warned that the corpse was not his to loot. We also had been<br>
told varying information from the people making the claim. Without<br>
undeniable proof and the fact that the corpse was &quot;open&quot;, the person will be<br>
allowed to retain the item.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br>
The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br>

I think 20-40 000 people have left EQ for DAoC.  No one knows for sure anymore b/c we can't see server numbers.  You can't seriously tell me you haven't noticed a decrease in the 50+ zones.<br>
<br>
  You can't seriously think that these changes are just coincidences? Necessity motivates;  a significant portion of Verants customer base has left.  probably somewhere around 5-10% of the purported 400 000 accounts would equal a significant portion of there income.  if each account represents 10 dollars, then verant lost $200 000 - $400 000.  If you ran verant, what would you be thinking when you saw that?<br>
<br>
  I hate doing this but i am going to take your words and discuss them.  you said this &quot;Why can't Verant just be listening to their customers, and changing their policies based on suggestions just TO BE NICE.&quot;   Let me remind you a what was happening a few years ago.  rogues are broken, necros are over powered, wizards are KS'ing us, theres bugs everywhere.  a year later Kunark is released and now everyone says rogues are overpowered, necros are worthless, wizards can't do any meaningful amount of damage, and the 50+ exp table sucks.  It took a long time for changes to come about.  You know they aren't doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.  People are petitioning day in and day out for changes in the classes.  Why couldn't verant be nice back then?<br>
<br>
  Star Wars is a completely different game, and it has no bearing between EQ vs DAoC.  And i don't think the Verant staff sit around in a dark room plotting against customers..  i think they sit around in dark rooms sniffing some white dust thinking &quot;its great being at the top, i hope things never change.&quot;  Theres no doubt Star Wars will be successful, it has the Star Wars fan base to rely on and that is a guarantee that the game will go well.  But that isn't the topic at hand.  Verant making radical changes to the way EQ has been run for years is what is being talked about.  Verant has traditionally been very slow to make changes, and ignorant of what the players believe would improve the game.  <br>

<br>
First of all, yes I myself see server pops down THIS WEEK, because DaoC was just officially release within the LAST WEEK. To make claims that it is the end of EQ is just short sighted.<br>
<br>
DaoC is a LOT like EQ, a lot of folk went to &quot;check it out&quot;, some may stay, some may come back.<br>
<br>
But that is not the ONLY reason server pops are low, if you have not been under a rock, you may have heard about the never RP server called Friona Vie?<br>
<br>
Everyone I talk to are consistantly seeing HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of Nekkid newbies in almost every zone, 400 Barbs in Everfrost, Linkdeaths in Field of bone from massive player count, ad nauseau...<br>
<br>
Yes the general server pops are low. So what, some will come back, some will stay on new servers.<br>
<br>
Do I give a rats arse, nope. At least now you can put together a group, head to a camp and not find 40 peeps in zone.<br>
<br>
As to the base topis of this post...<br>
<br>
Only complaint I have had with Verant CS is their &quot;Guilty until proven innocent&quot; attitude. <br>
<br>
They ban accounts without giving the person a detailed reason. Geee you meant someones system having gotten a virus that hurt a DLL Eq uses constitutes BANNING them?<br>
<br>
If you petition that you went linkdead in a dungeon and died and now can't find your corpse they wont give you a hint to where it is. &quot;Sorry hun, your corpse is where you died.&quot; (quoted from my logs). Basically they assume your lieing when you tell them what happened. Geeee you really think I wanted to leave my entire raid party on first floor of Hate and go die at Inny's feet on 2nd floor? Wow! Thanks for making me buy a 190pp coffin and paying off a Necro to summon me.. Nice, I don't mind loosing 3 hours of a raid I've been waiting to attend and paid a fee to go on because of a link death.. Really I enjoy not rolling on any of the loot that drops in Hate while I'm running to Neriak for a coffin. Really. ;(<br>
<br>
If you have your corpse fall through the world they summon it to &quot;somewhere in zone&quot; and not where you are standing (while in the same zone). Gee thanks for pulling my corpse out from under the world, where is it now? Sorry hun, can't tell you.<br>
<br>
I just hope they start to actually listen to what we say, and review the data before they say NO.<br>
<br>

And until you have the hard statistcs to back it up, all those figures you're posting are just blind guesses.<br>

My main point though didn't really have to do with people playing DAoC.  I just wanted to stress that the guys at Verant ARE NOT out to get you, and ARE NOT programming and doping up at the same time, just because they're the best and they can.<br>

Agreed Glip. I know a couple of Ex-Guides IRL. Really nice folk. I have no problems with GM's myself personally becuase I know the limitation placed on them.<br>
<br>
It is those limitations that make me cringe and I hope they loosen up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucudget.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cudget</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/17/01 9:16:16 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: John Smedley - Reviewing Customer Service at Verant</span><hr size=1> As someone that works on a web application that changes regularly to add/update features for our customers, I know how hard it is to make all the fixes that you would like to.<br>
<br>
There is only so much time in a day, and only so many days in a week.  A company will not let you just sit back and do only fixes, you need to produce new content as well.  So, not everything can be fixed at once.  I have watch VI fix a ton of broken/unbalanced things over the last 1.5 years.<br>
<br>
I don't see that it just started with DAoC coming out.. they have always and will always be fixing issues, but only when they have the time.<br>
<br>
Just my opinions of course.<br>

The players -ie. you and i- are benefitting from the competition.  That is not in question, the question is how much of an impact DAoC has had on EQ.  When D2 and AO went gold, most of us knew it wasn't going to be big.  DAoC has had mostly good reviews from the beta testers, people raved about the trade skills and skills.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;There doesn't have to be secret sinister motives for everything, you know.&quot;   -- there isn't, the motive is fighting for our money.  I win now b/c i have the money.  Motives are often kept secret so competitors don't know, and can't use them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukelthana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelthana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/17/01 11:46:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Take a look at the auction sites too, level 60 clerics with epics are being sold for 400 bucks. 200+ days played online tossed away for a fistful of dollars. 2 dollars for 24 hours.. less than 9 cents an hour for 2.5 years of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> work</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

yes, the game has elements of work.  exp grinding.. trade skills.   EQ is more of an escape rather than a game imo.<br>

selling the account is profitable.  money buys happiness.  i had fun playing the game, i had fun getting to 60.  i am bored with the game and don't want to play, so i will sell it and buy something with the money making me happy again.  happy capitalism <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukeeperofthecows.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keeper of the Cows</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/20/01 3:55:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1>     I've always been the person to defend the less defended side of an arguement, which means I have to go with glip/verant on this one. Yes, verant is very strict with thier rules and regulations. People think that Verant should ease up and let the game flow... but thats not how it works really. Look at games like Starcraft, it is *PERFECTLY*(imo) balanced in every way. the best war strat game out)once again, imo) BUT since blizzard isn't strict at all. people use programs to &quot;Hack&quot; the game to crap. you can't play a game without someone seeing your every move, and every weakness that they normally never would have seen,  with full map hacks. Records mean nothing since people use hacks to alter thier records like crazy. not to mention that about every person who plays on Bnet sounds like a 12 year old Illiterate gangster wanna-be. Same thing with Diablo, people use trainers etc. to get the best items in the game at a click of the button(not sure about diablo 2, becuase I haven't played it... but diablo 1 is like this). I don't know about you.... but I would be pretty pissed off if I saw some level 6 ranger runnin around the the claw oflightning I worked so hard to get.<br>
but thankfully that won't happen :0)<br>
As for Verant not trying to fix anything till now... there has been a patch changing at least one feature ever 2 weeks for the past 2.8 years :0)<br>

<br>
I am sorry, Glip, but I have to disagree. Yes, I think it is a very valid point that CS may be being rearranged because Brad is gone. And it probably is part of the reason. BUT, I don't believe in coincidences. Especially repeated ones. <br>
<br>
1. 3 weeks before DAoC comes out, they block server numbers. They even said it was because they didn't want competition getting thier numbers. Ummm, well, lesse here....they haven't had em blocked all year, so there has been ample time to compile all the info anyone needed. They did this because they don't want others &quot;following the crowd&quot;....saying &quot;Gee, half the server is gone, I wonder if DAoC is that good ?&quot; Gamers are a social breed, if people leave, it generally is in droves.<br>
<br>
2.  New content. Revamping Chardok. The DAY that DAoC comes out and ships, they revamp Chardok. 'Nuff said there.<br>
<br>
3. Approx 2 weeks after releaseof DAoC, they come out with a statement saying they will seriously look at CS. The biggest gripe most any of us have had (non class related) is the customer service. Some GM's guides are great, some are terrible, depending on each server. Povar (as long as I was on it) had NONEXISTENT customer service. We have, as paying customers, been complaining about this through every various channel for 2 years now. If Verant really cared about us as consumers, they would've had a look before now. It hasn't escaped me that the only time they care about our economic vote is when there is finally some competition around.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujtiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jtiel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://jtiel.tripod.ca/j.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/22/01 11:58:25 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://jtiel.tripod.ca/j2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: John Smedley - Reviewing Customer Service at Verant</span><hr size=1> Glip, I respectfully have to disagree with you. <br>
<br>
Could it be pure coincidence that just days after a legitimate competitor hits the market we're getting a review of what for years has arguably been the biggest knock against Verant? Sure. <br>
<br>
Do I honestly believe that? No, I'm sorry. I tried, but I can't.<br>
<br>
No, I don't think the folks there sit around plotting the demise of all my hopes and dreams. But an absence of malice is not enough, in my opinion, to say that things are going well, or to even give them the benefit of the doubt on this subject. They are soliciting guides almost constantly now, which tells me they're under-staffed and the ones that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> there are overworked. Smedley himself would get on Lum's site and try to do damage control for very real customer service failures. For the first time you have people actually walking away in real numbers, when in the past they have just given it angry lip service but kept on playing. All of these can lead one to believe there is a fundamental problem that has been ignored far too long.<br>
<br>
I suppose, too, that we could debate whether DAoC is ligitimate or not, but I have seen too people leave to play it. Time will ultimately answer that question, but it really seems as if Verant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> taking them seriously.<br>
<br>
And why is it that I see Bruce Economy's name in so many of these examples of poor CS? Is he just the unfortunate guy with a title that requires him to be uncooperative, or is he just an ass?<br>

<br>
a) I would take EQ subscription numbers with a grain of salt, as I am sure many many people pay for 3 or 6 months at a time.  So technically they are still a subscriber, though they may have left and won't be renewing.  Time will tell.<br>
<br>
b) With Verant, and their history, coincidences do not exist.  They had 2+ years to recognize and fix their HORRIBLE CS, we as players have been griping about this, publicly, for a long long long time.  Why suddenly now is it a huge priority?<br>
<br>
c) As posted in rant hall a while back, the CEO of SOE has described us as credit cards with legs.  According to him, listening to us only @#%$ them up.  Gee, thanks Mr. Flock.<br>
<br>
d) Better CS != throwing newer phatter lewt at us to distract us for a while (coughSOLcough).  Better CS to me means getting a timely, helpful reply to a request for assistance with bugs, harassment, etc.  Not having someone KS a mob you need for a quest, repeatedly over the span of 2 hours, then having a GM show up and say basically 'too bad, you are SOL' (fitting acronym).  This is all without the 'play nice policies' that were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> supposed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be enforced in situations like this.  Trust me the last thing I want to have to do is petition for help with a conflict with my fellow players.  But I expect that when/if I have to, that THEIR OWN POLICIES will be enforced.  Else why even have them in the first place?<br>
<br>
e) Did I mention Mr. Flock is an @#%$?  And he is the boss of everyone at Verant if I'm not mistaken.  It starts at the top...<br>
<br>
f) No I don't think they sit in a dark room plotting against me.  I think they sit in a dark room with their fingers in their ears chanting &quot;nah nah nah I can't hear you, everything is juuuuust fine&quot;.<br>
<br>
g) I *really really like* the GAME everquest.  I *really really dislike* some of the public figures representing the game, and their shoddy excuse for customer service.<br>
<br>
h) I emailed all of the above points to the email presented by John Smedley the day after I was made aware that they wanted customer input.  I got a form mail returned to me (expected) and to this day there has been no public recognition that they have been doing anything with all the feedback that they got.  And in asking around and reading various boards, it appears that all this feedback merely resulted in a 'search and replace' command on their reimbursement policies.<br>
<br>
In light of all of the above, I did as suggested, and voted with my dollar.  I have 10 bucks a month to spend on online entertainment.  It is no longer going towards a company that treats their customers with disdain.  And I really *did* like the game itself, mainly due to the other players and friends that I have met.  But enough is enough.  <br>
<br>
Too little, too late.  They had 2 YEARS (years, that's a long long time) to make positive changes.  They failed me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2518.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2556.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2554.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2518.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2518.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2518.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2518.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
