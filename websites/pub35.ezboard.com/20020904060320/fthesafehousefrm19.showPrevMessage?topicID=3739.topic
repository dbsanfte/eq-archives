How many of us use faster, quicker weapons so that we have a better chance of disrupting a caster? I certainly was and then I read here that my weapon speed has no meaning what so ever, its based on your level. Whats most astounding to me is the comment:<br>
<br>
&quot;this system is more fair to all weapon users&quot;<br>
<br>
So you have a big fat heavy weapon that does huge damage and the same chance of disrupting spells, while we sacrafice damage for speed and thats fair to us?<br>
<br>
So its my level and luck, and the chance isnt very high, so basically dont bother trying to disrupt spells, does anyone else find that to be rather disturbing? The description also describes why you can stealth and then get hit a tick later, because everything is decided at the cast moment, not after its ticks.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am reading it wrong, love to hear other folks takes.<br>

From todays Grab Bag:<br>
********************<br>
Q: Please explain how interrupts work in your game. In another game I used to play, if a magic user started casting a spell, he could finish it so long as he wasn’t hit during the cast time. In DAOC it seems more random. <br>
<br>
A: It’s not random at all, but it is a very different system than you may be familiar with. It’s a lot more fair to large weapon users, as their potential to interrupt a caster is exactly the same as a small fast weapon user. Hold on to your backpacks, this is going to be fun. <br>
<br>
First, we need to understand how melee attacks work in DAOC. Let’s say you’re swinging a weapon with a five second delay between swings. You press attack. It goes SWING (tick tick tick tick tick) SWING (etc). Obviously, this means a two second delay weapon goes SWING (tick tick) SWING (etc). Now, according to the game, you’re attacking for that whole swing/tick cycle. The damage you do is registered at the same time as the swing, but a full cycle consists of the swing AND the ticks. <br>
<br>
If you attack a caster, you have a chance of interrupting his regular (non-quickcast) spells during the whole cycle. The chance to interrupt is purely level based – if the caster is higher level than you, your chance to interrupt is lower. <br>
<br>
A quickcast spell does not have any chance of being interrupted – doesn’t check for that at all. However, a quickcast spell does not wipe the interrupt check of a cycle. For example, let’s say I am swinging an enormous hammer at Mahrin Skel. There’s a ten second delay. On the third second, he quickcasts something at me. It hits me. Let’s say I’m stunned. But when he casts a regular spell at me during the same ten second cycle that began when I first swung my hammer, I may still interrupt him even though I am stunned by the quickcast, because my cycle is still running. <br>
<br>
Still with me? Let’s see what happens when multiple people are attacking our caster friend. (It’s hard to explain in text, please forgive the sophomoric illustration at the bottom of all this.) <br>
<br>
I have a weapon with a five second delay. Chris has a weapon with a three second delay. And Jason also has a five second delay weapon. Mahrin will yet again serve as our caster, and he is casting a spell with a three second timer. <br>
<br>
First, I swing. One tick later, Chris swings. One tick later than that, Jason swings. One tick after Jason, Mahrin starts to cast. Who will have a chance to interrupt him? It’s all in the timing. In this BEAUTIFUL diagram, s = swing, c = cast, and t = tick. <br>
<br>
Mahrin:__________cT__T__T <br>
Sanya:_sT__T__T__T__T <br>
Chris:_____sT__T__T <br>
Jason:________sT__T__T__T__T <br>
<br>
At about the halfway point during Mahrin’s cast, the interrupt check happens. So, go to halfway (the middle T in Mahrin’s row). Chris’s cycle is finished, and will not interrupt Mahrin. My cycle is ending at about the same time Mahrin’s interrupt check begins on that spell, so I’ve got a 50/50 chance of interrupting him, depending on the exact timing. Jason is in the middle of his cycle, and therefore definitely has a chance of interrupting Mahrin. <br>
<br>
Whether or not Jason DOES interrupt him depends on level and luck. The chance of interruption isn’t very high. The above applies whether the SWING part did damage or not. <br>
<br>
As you can see, this system is more fair to all weapon users, and is more realistic (a big honking axe is actually just as distracting as a dagger when it’s swung at your head). But, in the interests of fun, we’ve kept the actual chance low, and the higher level the caster, the less likely the caster will lose concentration. <br>

If you get your arm chopped off by a big axe with a 7 second delay, you're sure as hell not going to be able to cast for a lot longer than seven seconds. If you're constantly being pummeld by little stings, you won't be able to concentrate enough to cast.<br>
<br>
You shouldn't worry about it, that code is pretty funky. From my experience it's fairly impossible to cast in combat. Like maybe a .00000000001% chance to actually cast in combat if you can time it right. Casters are better off using their staves than trying to cast in combat, it's not like EQ. You can channel better in EQ at level one than you can here at level 50.<br>

Much of it explains why casters are soooo powerfull too.<br>
<br>
If I am casting a spell and someone bounces a spear off my blade turn then I'm going to be distracted.  When I see that the guy is picking his great big heavy weapon up off the floor, trying to disentangle the barbs from some debris, I'm going to be able to take my time and cast a spell.<br>
<br>
With this system I'd be better off with a bezerker whaling on me every 1.5 seconds because there is a better chance that my 'interuption' point will fall just as his attack ends rather than in the middle of his swing.  Additionaly, it seems to make no diference if I cast a fast or slow spell - I have only one interupt point in the middle.<br>
<br>
Furthermore if I'm torn apart by a bezerker who is then stuned I can cast normaly 1.5 seconds later but if I'm torn apart by an armsman who is then stuned I can't cast for 5 seconds - a situation which is exascerbated if I have debuffed his attack speed?!<br>
<br>
I'm extreemly unhappy that 'quick cast' is infalable in PvP.  There should be some chance to avoid that quick cast mez/stun/PBAE other than killing the caster in one blow (especialy as that is now imposible).  PA is not infalible even if you line it up correctly it can still fail - even if this is a bug its still there; there should be a chance that quick cast fails for every interupt oportunity.<br>
<br>
How does bleed or DoT interupt casting and at what point does it do so?  It would be nice if they were on stagerd timers (e.g. bleed on 4 sec timer, venom on 5 sec).<br>
<br>
When the text says 'irrespective of if the attack did damage' does that mean 'wholey absorbed' attacks or any attack even a fumble - I suspect the former?  Does removing BT count as an attack that can initiate a period of interuption?<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that its unfair that a polearm has an equal chance to interupt a spell caster but I do think it unreasonable that a polearm has the advantage in spell interuption.  Now that said... a polearm must wait 2 seconds to initiate the interuption period while a dual wielder need only wait a second or less, thats not such a big deal realy.<br>
<br>
As much as anything this is a 'light tank' issue more than an assassin issue but they are linked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 10:49:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3736.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Er.... hmm... could someone explain how this is better?</span><hr size=1> Actually, this is the reason why casters had to be made so powerful. If you close into melee with a caster, you practically eliminate their ability to use their ONLY speccable abilities: spell casting.<br>
<br>
Thus, spell casters have to kill everything at range or die. There's little room for mistakes. Instead of allowing casters a better chance to avoid interruption, Mythic went the other way around the problem and just made them even more dependant on range for survival by increasing the effectiveness of their spells, then resists came into play nerfing the casters.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the root of the problem is that casters are so easily interrupted that they are better off swinging a staff than trying to cast spell when someone gets within striking distance.<br>
<br>
It makes casters extremely un-fun to play in my experience. EQ sucks in many aspects, but being a caster in EQ is 5 times more interesting than being a caster in DAOC. It's something Mythic didn't copy correctly.<br>

I find, as a level 50 caster (I'm creating an NS which is why I'm reading this board some) that I will get interrupted by anything and anyone no matter what. I have never been in melee and not gotten interrupted, discouting quickcasts. Grey, Green, Blue, all the way to Yellow. It doesn't matter. I've even been interrupted by tanks standing 1500 units away from me when they go into combat mode. They don't even have to hit me. And once interrupted, there's a 3 second wait timer on all spells.<br>
<br>
The long and short of it is that interrupts are a huge pain to casters and the code, as it stands, works very much against them. <p>Cheers,<br>
