found at:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=22568592">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=22568592</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>*** Please post there if you are in support of it<br><br>======================================<br><br>THE ASSASSIN PETITION: The “Bare Minimum” Request to Mythic to help Assassins until they are complete.<br><br>The Assassin Petition IS NOT a request to fix known bugs, or to implement skill or spell sets that were promised at any point in time.<br><br>The Assassin Petition IS a request to fix known Assassin issues and make life easier on Assassins until they are complete.<br><br>The changes requested are chosen because they are enough to make a positive difference to the Assassin, are not designed to be overpowering, and are easier to implement code-wise than adding completely new features.<br><br>Any change requests are by no means an end-all solution to any particular Assassin issue. They are meant to address the here-and-now and not another 3 months down the road.<br><br>======================================<br><br>* Specialization Points *<br><br>Known Issues:<br>- Assassins benefit least through their specializations per point<br>- Interdependent skill chains, and not enough points<br>- Assassin unique skill sets each suffer diminishing returns<br>- Misspent points can severely gimp the Assassin even further<br>- Melee classes often spend 2.0x points between 3 skills<br>- Assassins have 5 skills (all of which are needed to some degree to make the Assassin somewhat effective)<br><br><br>SPECIALIZATION POINTS BARE MINIMUM REQUEST:<br><br>2.5x Specialization Points, between 6 skills (see parry)<br><br><br>======================================<br><br>* Assassin Defenses *<br><br>Known Issues:<br>- Assassins have the weakest AF, Absorb, and HP for any Melee<br>- Archers can potentially match Assassins in Stealth and Melee specialization if they chose to neglect bow<br>- Evade alone is terribly unreliable<br><br>* There is no real reason that Assassins should have superior AF, Absorb or HP than the other melee classes (static defensive factors). There are other ways of going about improving them. Evade has been improved (random defensive factor), but its randomness can allow an Assassin to solo a Yellow in those rare circumstances, die without a fighting chance to a blue the next fight, or nearly die to a green. Two random factors is enough to make it act like a static factor that adds more consistency in combat, instead of gambling each fight from an already disadvantaged disposition. Once in a blue moon, when both random skills align, the Assassin should be able to duel a higher con.<br><br><br>ASSASSIN DEFENSES BARE MINIMUM REQUEST:<br><br>Re-implement Parry as a trainable skill for the Assassin<br>(Even if Evade VII has to be nerfed to Evade VI to compensate)<br><br><br>======================================<br><br>* Unique Skill and Spell Sets *<br><br>The deceptive marketing descriptions that made us buy the game:<br>Infiltrators: Traps and Spying<br>Shadowblades: Illusion and Deceptive magic<br>Nightshades: Powerful spellcaster with sneaking magic<br><br><br>UNIQUE SKILL AND SPELL SETS BARE MINIMUM REQUEST:<br><br>No yet-to-be-implemented skills are requested for this petition. Instead, we request a Heads-Up about which direction each Assassin class is headed with these unique skills and what we can look forward to, and possibly, when.<br><br><br>======================================<br><br>* Dual Weapons *<br><br>- A recent Pendragon patch changed the effectiveness of Dual Weapon rewards at high-end specialization. This increases from a 20% damage from its base specialization to a 32.5% average damage increase. Only Light Tanks are expected to make use of full specialization. The improved Dual Weapons factor does not kick in until after level 20 in its specialization. This provides even less incentive for Assassins to spend any points in Dual Weapons, unless they truly plan on spending more than 20 levels of points in Dual Weapons just to start making it worthwhile. <br><br><br>DUAL WEAPONS BARE MINIMUM REQUEST:<br><br>Further changes specific to Dual Weapons are not needed nor required.<br>Instead, refer to the Specialization Point request.<br><br><br>======================================<br><br>* Stealth *<br><br>- Assassin Stealth in no way makes them to Archers what Archers are to Casters. Instead, Archers are to Archers what Archers are to Casters. Increased Movement and Detection ability, with less chance of being revealed, is necessary to make them an effective Archer killer.<br>- Alternative: Assassins could potentially benefit from a Stealth II ability. An Assassin’s primary Stealth allows them increased detection and prevention from detection from Archers while sharing the same movement rate they do. A Stealth II ability is added, that can revert an Assassin to the same detection standards as an Archer, but with increased movement capacity that nearly matches walking pace with full Stealth specialization.<br><br><br>STEALTH BARE MINIMUM REQUEST:<br><br>Assassins have an additional factor to detect non-Assassin stealth classes equal to their specialization in stealth.<br><br>An Assassin’s Stealth level plays an additional factor in preventing them from being detected by others (including Archers, Roaming Patrols, and Monsters).<br><br>Assassins rate of movement increase in some type of capacity (whether innate or a separate ability).<br><br><br>======================================<br><br>* Critical Strike *<br><br>- Difficult to execute<br>- Very limited use<br>- Very susceptible to network lag<br>- Dependent on multiple specializations<br>- Offers only styles, which are also more difficult to execute<br>- Offers no unique casual melee damage<br>- Redundancy in styles and counter styles<br>- Styles become outdated through leveling<br>- Costly Endurance and Defense penalties<br>- Lack of strong and enduring detrimental effects (Bleed can paper cut a 1000hp tank for 7 points of damage, and does not scale with specialization)<br><br><br>CRITICAL STRIKE BARE MINIMUM REQUEST:<br><br>Critical Hit = (Base Critical Hit Factors)% + (CS Level)%<br><br>Increased Bleeding Damage (Through Base Bleed Damage or have Bleed improve with specialization)<br><br>More potent and longer lasting detrimental effects through styles that are better than normal weapon and dual styles.<br><br><br>======================================<br><br>* Envenom *<br><br>- Lack of Poison Variety<br>- Lack of Poison Potency<br>- Only one useful PvE poison<br>- Poisons are incredibly costly (2x the cost of the previous poison, with only a few points of damage added each poison).<br><br><br>ENVENOM BARE MINIMUM REQUEST:<br><br>20% increased damage scaling for all pre level 25 Lethal Poisons<br>33% increased damage scaling for all level 25 + Lethal Venoms<br><br><br>======================================<br><br>BARE MINIMUM REQUEST SUMMARY:<br><br>- 2.5x Specialization Points<br><br>- Parry as a trainable skill for the Assassin (Evade VII to VI if needed)<br><br>- Heads-Up about where Assassins are going with promised skills<br><br>- Additional Stealth factor to detect non-Assassins.<br><br>- Additional Stealth factor to prevent detection specific to Assassins<br><br>- Increased Stealth movement in some capacity<br><br>- Critical Hit = (Base Critical Hit Factors)% + (CS Level)%<br><br>- Increased bleeding damage, or bleed improves with Specialization<br><br>- More Potent and Lasting CS style effects<br><br>- 20% to 33% improved damage scaling for Lethal Envenoms<br><br>======================================<br>*************************************************<br><br>Again, the Petition is not asking to immediately make Assassins complete class. That would require more time to finish our missing skills/spells that we were promised. It is a request though to fix the known Assassin issues and make life easier until the missing skills/spells are added and then make us a complete class.<br><br><br>If you are in support of the “Bare Minimum” requests Petition, please show your support by posting here, and inform other Assassins of the community about it.<br><br><br>Mythic, we ask you to respond and acknowledge our efforts to shed light and understanding on Assassin issues. Please let this petition be a step toward improved communication between you and the &lt;True Rogue&gt; player base.<br><br><br>======================================<br>*************************************************<br>If you would like to educate yourself about Assassin issues, there are multiple sources of reference material to choose from:<br><br>Volume II:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=19130224">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=19130224</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Volume III:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=20569095">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=20569095</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Critical Strike:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=21145435">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=21145435</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Volume IV:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=22341432">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=22341432</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>======================================<br><br>*** NOTE: This is a duplicate Petition that can be found at:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=22568592">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=22568592</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>*** Please post there if you are in support of it<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cylant>Cylant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 1:46:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1787.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.phata1.com/images/pope1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: THE ASSASSIN PETITION: The “Bare Minimum” Request to Myt</span><hr size=1> That sounds like a very honest request.<br>Most concise and effective assassin plan i've seen to date.<br>I'm not an assassin, and this sounds like a very reasonable request.<br>G'luck, you have my support for what it's worth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uditherdaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dither DAoC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 2:11:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1787.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/dither/smiley2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: THE ASSASSIN PETITION: The “Bare Minimum” Request to Myt</span><hr size=1> very reasonable, a little on the too reasonable end, but definitly worthwhile. <p>Dither Disgustipated<BR>Kobold Shadowblade<BR>Ragnarok, Palomides</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvolsung.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Volsung</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.tripod.co.uk/redhotant/icons/iconoc33.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 2:11:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1787.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: THE ASSASSIN PETITION: The “Bare Minimum” Request to Myt</span><hr size=1> I have read all of your posts, Ela and this as usual is top notch.

1...so it isn't as big of an issue as you are complaining about.<br><br>our only real problem is dealing a sufficient enough amount of damage to kill a tank before they kill us...<br><br>i'll give anyone ten bonus points if they cna guess why....<br>if you said lots of hp's you are wrong! hp's are not the problem...it's the 40% of my damage that platemail wearer is chunking out of my damage...i perf even level tanks for 170-210....even level casters for 300-500+<br>ABSORB IS THE PROBLEM!<br>did you ever possibly think that if we all got 2.5 times skill points we'd all be the same in the end? yeh if i wanted to be the same as every other high levle character i would still be playing eq...im happy we cant max everything...it would be lame if we could...<br><br>another thing people arent realizing is the really high levle poisons are going to destroy people..i use the level 29 at highest now...theres still two more str/con debuffs, hey guess what if you stack that with a infectious poison whatever you just hit has lost a million str.....and prolly cant run...so using the snare poison is worthless anyways....also when they minus all the str and con they have way less attack and hp....making that 70 that i am hitting for be that much more effective..<br><br>as for our damage over time...uhh we aren't supposed to do more damage over time than others...in fact imo we should do near the worse...sitting there and stabbing someone in the chest with a dagger while they beat back on you in no way whatsoever resembles an &quot;assassin&quot; we're supposed to get in, hit our mark, and get the fug out. and we do this just fine right now except that we're limited to killing casters, and maybe rogues in large groups...<br><br>what we need to be able to do at 50 is tear through 1k hp's in 4 seconds betwen crit strike/poison/con debuff/dot's, thats what ive seen to be about the amount of time you have until 7 peopel are beating you down and you feel lucky if you get one. <br><br>and tbh my class isnt even close to finished...im supposed to get alot more spells...plus disguise...one more time im asking youplease rvr and back this all up with some solid exp in rvr....not just what you've heard from the other people on the board.....in no way right now is the nightshade broken...and if they suck compared to sb then the sb cant be broken....since left axes rules cd or whatever...<br><br>personally if you're going to make a wish list, can you ask for things that keep us alive more? like a run buff or instant teleport 50 feet away or a smokescreen spell or something.....i dont have a problem kiling people...you wont have a problem killing people....ffs we play the second best rvr class in the game and all i see people do here all day is whine about us being broken...<br><br>maybe when we start asking for realistic things we might get something instead of them just ignoring us....i'm sure there's someone out here who is going to argue this, tell me i have no clue wtf im saying, but please stop by galahad sometime, feel free to talk to me, or gank someones char and come try to bring it.....eiteher way, even if i dont kill you when you see me laying casters out left and right, and then working my way to the resses you'll understand the power we already possess, and all the pitiful cries for 7 times skill points, higher cs damage on all attack, singing bladeturn or whatever other silly silly things people ask for are just going to make us broken.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujablackhand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>J A  Blackhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.crewsman.homestead.com/files/Demon_Hunter.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 7:41:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1787.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I Second this...</span><hr size=1> I Still support it:<br><br>41.5<br>R2L2 <br>15+k RP nearly all solo, I know, not much but hey it's not like I'm a Shaman who can AoE poison a crowd and the sit back when the melees jump in and thusly rack em in.<br><br>Currently trying to get my epic back from Mythic:<br><br>Brianca?
