It just sucks being an assassin in all realms when it comes to leveling (can I hear an Amen!!!). After leveling a bit, I try to head out to Emain with higher lvl guildies but... alas I am usually destroyed quick. Merlin has mostly 50's running around and I just can't match up. I won't resurface in Emain until 46 or so.  <p>Tak - 4x Crit Assassin<BR>Coldhands - 4x Healer<BR>Sephreth - 31 Shadowzerk<BR>Merlin</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=czerisgawaine>Czeris Gawaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 12:00:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3467.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Around lvl 25 ...</span><hr size=1> I still get the &quot;...if only I was a few levels higher&quot; thoughts all the time at level 50. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaelspear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelspear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 2:00:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3467.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Around lvl 25 ...</span><hr size=1> In my opinion, if you don't enjoy rvr at <50, you won't enjoy it when you're 50 either.  Being 45+ or 50 might increase your odds but doesn't assure you will be the Almighty herself.  :-)<br><br>I think it's less about level and more about opportunity.  Often at lower levels you get the opportunity to die A LOT to higher con players.  However, once in awhile you get something wonderful and magical, like the red-con paladin who chases your little healer behind smack into the group waiting for him in the trees.  Or happening upon a merry group of blue/green/yellow elves strolling along the zone wall in your frontier on their way to cause strife to the realm youngins, and after their AE mez they immediately follow with AE nukes (oops) they are easily slain.  Or taking down a purple-con druid with your guildmates on his way to feast on the greys.<br><br>RvR is all about opportunity.  :-)  I'm sure any rogue player here can attest to that.<br><br>-Elsebet <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaelspear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelspear</A> at: 6/6/02 2:01:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaelodyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelodyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 2:02:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3467.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Around lvl 25 ...</span><hr size=1> I do okay at 36 as long as I mingle in a big group of purple allies.

Then I will be able to casually level and RvR at the same time.. right now every time I go out, I wish everyone wasn't red to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>L45 is probably the best point to start killing like a madman.. no more reds! And I can generally handle myself well against orange con non-tank classes.. just gotta watch out for that epic armor.<br><br>If you're sub-45 and an assassin, try grouping! It's a helluva lot more fun. Group with some friends or guildies and try zerging around in a group of 5-8.. works wonders on solo/duo reds when you have 5+ L38-44 guys cruising around in a pack. We took 2 L50s down the other night in emain in a 30 minute run-around, and I got to learn the lay of the land a bit more on the Hib frontier.<br><br>It's much more fun than trying to find a solo yellow/orange or lower con running around when you're solo yourself. If you can, more power to you -- but I find them rarely, and when I do, they're usually L50 assassins who wipe the floor with me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>-halfhand <p><b>Halfhand Bloodsworn</b><br>L41.5 Norseman Shadowblade<br>&lt;Children of Loki&gt;http://www.bloodoath.net/ <i>[Bedevere]</i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=halfhand>halfhand</A> at: 6/6/02 5:03:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulandril77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Landril77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 5:11:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3467.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: starting rvr</span><hr size=1> I started at level 15, but as others have said it was a whole different world back in those days.
