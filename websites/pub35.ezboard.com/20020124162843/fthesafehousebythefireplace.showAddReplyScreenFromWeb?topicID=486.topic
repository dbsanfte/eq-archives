To the orcs staying their it was the signal that their food was ready. To their human captives however, it was a sign of their doom. They had tried to escape all ready and one of their number had paid the horrible price. His screams as the orcs cruelly roasted him over the spit haunted them in their dreams and occasionally their waking moments.<br>
	Their were four humans left, Galstaff, a wizard of no small regard, his apprentice Niosk, a female paladin Tenya, and a scoundrel who went by the name Rinn. They caged simply but effectively, stuck in the bottom of a 10-foot pit. <br>
"Fools" Galstaff muttered, obviously perturbed that these orcs thought that by killing one of their own they would cower instead of thirst for revenge. He knew better, he believed. All ready Tenya was trying to force them into action.<br>
"It wont work I tell you" Rinn said Theirs no way that I can climb up these walls without getting noticed. I would get up half way before that sentry would spot me."<br>
"You could at least try" Tenya spat at him "Instead you just sit around like a coward."<br>
Rinn took the insult in stride, knowing that she was trying to bleed off the stress from hearing their companion's dying screams. It had been Tenya's plan that had sent the man to his doom, a doom Rinn did not want to share with him. <br>
Rinn looked about his home and wondered how he let the wizard talk him into this adventure. He looked over to the wizards apprentice. Barley out of his childhood the boy stood 6 feet tall, a veritable giant who would likely reach 7 feet in height. That was not the only unusual feature about the boy however. His red hair and freckled face revealed his heritage as a foreigner. Rinn wondered how the boy was doing. He hadn't said a word since the execution of his fellow group member, and had the look of a man who had resigned himself to his fate. <br>
A sudden burst of noise in the camp informed Rinn that the hunting party the orcs had sent out had returned and by the cheers of the orcs in the camp, had been quite successful. That comforted Rinn somewhat, knowing that they wouldn’t have to turn to his companions for food for another few days gave him hope that the wizard or the paladin would come up with a plan on how to get them out without getting caught. A sudden high pierced shriek interrupted his train of thought. "That wasn’t the scream of an orc" Rinn thought "that was the scream of something else." His questions were answered a few moments later when a feminine form was dropped into the pit. She had landed in a pile crumpled up at his feet. Rinn Started to bend down to help her up when she burst into action. In one swift moment she drew a small dagger from her boot and put it up to Rinn's neck.<br>
"There is no need for that down here m'lady."  Galstaff said, "We are prisoners of the orcs, just as you are. Put down the knife." <br>
 "You shut up!" The mysterious lady replied "I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I'm not in the mood for trustin anyone, especially not anyone whose home is an orc camp"<br>
"Our current residence is not by choice I assure you m'lady," Galstaff tried to reason with her "but by a bit of bad luck. We were camping for the night after our fifth day out exploring when this band came upon us in the middle of the knight. We tried to fight but alas the odds were against us. We were captured, beaten, and thrown into this pit. We have tried to escape but failed, and one of our number was taken from us and killed."<br>
The lady inched her dagger away from Rinn's throat, and hung her arms down limply by her sides. Now that Rinn wasn’t focusing on the knife he looked the new arrival over with a curious eye. She was tall tan, and moved with practiced grace. Her brown hair was the color of a great oak tree and her green eyes were her leaves, taking everything in. Her pointed ears revealed that somewhere one of her ancestors was an elf, though that line seemed far removed from her. She slipped the knife into he belt, which held a baggy pair of trousers up and her dark green tunic under control. <br>
"Who are ye all?" she asked<br>
Galstaff introduced them all to her while Rinn studied her movements. Every muscle seemed to be under control, all working in unity to achieve perfection. She seemed to sense his probing stare and gave him an icy stare that showed she didn’t appreciate the attention. Rinn matched the stare, trying to equal the intensity, but knew he couldn’t hold out long under that scrutinizing stare.<br>
"And who are you?" Galstaff dared to venture, breaking the contest of wills.<br>
"Ye may call me Syra, and I am a ranger of these woods."<br>
"A ranger?" Galstaff replied dumbfounded "As I understood it your order was wiped out years ago when they placed their loyalty to nature first, to the kingdom second."<br>
"Aye, most of us were killed" Syra replied "But a few got away and refounded the order. We have been protecting these woods since. Twas only by me own foolishness that they captured me." She put such venom into the word they that Rinn knew for certain that she was not one to be trifled with. <br>
"When I was wandering me woods I came upon a group of orcs. Thinking not more than a handfull could have sneaked into me woods without me noticing. Well I went at them and quickly got em but not quickly enough. That larger group came at me and I knew I didn’t have a chance, but I fought on anyway, till I was knocked out by the butt end of a spear. When I came to I woke with the face of the tribes chief a few inches away from me face and my body tied to a steak in the camp. I screamed and tried to pull free of the rope but they just cut me loose and tossed me in here after I screamed. I guess they figured I'd be less quiet down here."<br>
Rinn listened to the story, trying to seem impassive. A ranger! He had heard stories of the fighting prowess of such people and all the legends spoke of them wielding might magick against all those who trespassed in their woods. He wondered how he might trick her into getting the two of them out at the least when she brought the subject of escape up herself.<br>
"So how are ye planning on getting out?"<br>
Galstaff's jaw lowered at her bluntness surprised that she was so forward about what they were all thinking about.<br>
"Rinn can climb up the wall if he is helped, but is afraid of the sentry spotting him and sounding the alarm" Tenya replied, obviously willing to let go of her mantle of leadership in this situation.<br>
"What if the sentry was taken care of?" Syra asked slyly.<br>
"Then I'd go up." Rinn replied bluntly. "The pit is set up near the back of the camp and I would be able to sneak around till I found a rope to lift the rest of you up"<br>
Syra looked at him carefully then but not having any other choice she had to trust him. "Lets do it."<br>
