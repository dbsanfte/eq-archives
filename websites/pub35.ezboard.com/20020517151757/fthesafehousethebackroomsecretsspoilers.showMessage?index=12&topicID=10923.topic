Grieg created the spires, not the Shissar.<br>
<br>
Interesting little story he wrote, but it doesn't synch up well with VI's back story. As for the curse on the giants? Started in Permafrost - where they were turned into ice giants - and gets weaker the farther away you get. That's why the giants in velious are the most advanced seen so far.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is now Najena, was once a Shissar outpost as can be seen from the lizard like scrawlings upon the entry.&quot; - Er, najena's ruins are what's left of her attempts at creating a rival city to match or best Neriak.<br>

Of course, even in game information can be dubious for at least two reasons.<br>
<br>
a) it's simply incorrect, multiple designers mess up their facts.<br>
b) racial differences would interpret history differently, just like real life.<br>

This was announced in the Wizard Alkabor's journals on the official Luclin page last year.  Shocked me - I had been trying to research the Combine for a year before that.  So it means someone else built the spires.  I'm not saying I believe the Shissar did but I wanted to put that out for speculation - and yes I've heard it from other places than just the Codex of War.  That idea does have a little validity since we know some older race made the spires before the Combine, we are lead to believe the Shissar are quite powerful before they angered the gods, and they someone transported themselves to the Moon - and currently the only way to do it is to either go via wizard teleportation or get blasted up in a big explosion - like the Vah Shir.  I'm not saying the glyphs on the spires represent the Shissar - but even if they don't, it doesn't mean they could not have been involved in their building.  Someone built them but no one knows who.  Dragons seem to have their own teleportation system - some in Velious are much different than the spires; I've read no report that the Elves made them and you'd think they would have had records of that; the Humans (and their kin) aren't that old; Dwarves and Gnomes don't seem magically adept enough to do it; Halflings ... well we know little of their history but they're even less magical than than the other shorties; slight arguements for the Giants and (pre-curse) Ogres - since they did transverse the planes to attack the Rathe ... but still begs the question that why did the Giants not escape to Luclin (or try) when the were cursed if the Shissar could?<br>

Most of their history appears to be lost.  They enslaved the iksar, frogloks, and goblins of Kunark a looong time ago, challenged the gods, and were obliterated.  The Greenmist was just that: a green fog that drifted through the land of Kunark.  The flesh of any Shissar it touched would instantly shrivel and dissolve; no other race was affected by it.  After the Shissar of Norrath were gone, the Greenmist apparently congealed; there are chunks of it, noted as shards of greenish metal, used to make the Greenmist weapon and the corrupted Shissar weapons.<br>
<br>
That is the reason that the Grey is airless; it's an attempt to ward off the Greenmist.  It's not entirely successful; you may note, in the mines beneath the temple, unless I'm wrong, shards of greenish metal have been found... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umikebridge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mikebridge</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/3/02 5:55:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10923.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> i've got the feeling that the 'combine' spires were originally part of the locking system between norrath and the planes of power (see: rallos zek's planar invasions), but since those pesky casters have been chipping off parts of them lately for their nifty portal spells, the lock is weakening, and perhaps in 5 months, the lock will entirely fail... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzemenartheexiled.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zemenar the Exiled</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/4/02 5:21:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10923.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> slight arguements for the Giants and (pre-curse) Ogres - since they did transverse the planes to attack the Rathe ... but still begs the question that why did the Giants not escape to Luclin (or try) when the were cursed if the Shissar could?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
They couldnt escape since the curse The Rathe struck down on them (at least its how I understand it) was almost immedetially and unlike the Shissar who were cursed with a Greenmist there was not enough time to get over the initial panic to organize a plan of escape before they were all &quot;struck dumb&quot;. So I think there still is a good chance that it was them if for no reason other than to explain how they were able to wage war against the Planes of Power.<br>

i remember reading something official bout the shissar bein in troubble for trying(and based on the cursed and emperor) and suceeding in killing gods. The Shissar were not revealed to be creations of any god, although Cazic would make some sense seeing as his other creations(iksar and lizzard men) are also very reptilian. The Greenmist was sent by the gods, not just one god, to punish the Shissar for not respecting the gods. The Shissar were like us, they went to the PoF, PoG, PoH, etc.. and routinely killed the gods for their &quot;phat lewt&quot;. Emperor Ssra is almost a god himself, and he prolly was the raid leader, since he has the +7 VS Extraplanar(god) weapon. they made deals and broke pacts, and that pissed the gods off. Greenmist killed tons of shissar on norrath, and the Shissar wizzards ported themselves and some of their kin to Luclin. The grey was just a normal desert, but then the greenmist came again. The shissar then made the vacume bubble that is there today. From what Ssra is like, it seems the Greenmist when it followed them up to luclin tried to get in thru The Deep, but im just thinkin that because of the bane:shissar metal component. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uneuromt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neuro  MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/4/02 11:30:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10923.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Kendrick, thank you very much.
