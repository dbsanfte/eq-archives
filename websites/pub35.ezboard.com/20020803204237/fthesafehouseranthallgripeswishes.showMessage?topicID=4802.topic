<br>
To Those that Dream<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Yes, I am going to rant.<br>
<br>
And I don't think everyone will be able to hear me, which is perhaps why I am going to rant.<br>
<br>
This is for the level 30s.<br>
The newbies on their first characters.<br>
The low 50s after 3 years. <br>
To everyone that has been so proud of having 500 plat in the bank at one time. <br>
To those with alts that get more playtime then their &quot;mains&quot;. To the roleplayers, to the small guild leaders, to those that are still proud of their first Solesk Ro armor.<br>
<br>
This is the game we play. We log in when we get a chance, maybe hoping for one bubble into 32, maybe to get that last spell that requires us to run to Qeynos. This is the game we still have fond memories of. The game that still delights us only because of the content lovingly poored in. This is the game where we remember what it was to first get a short sword of ykesha, when level 20 was such an achivement. This is the game we've played forever, for the people more than anyone else, this is the game we play.<br>
<br>
And it's being laughed at.<br>
<br>
Our nights, our escape, in between letting the dog out and putting supper on, this is our game, our lives at times, because we love the escape. Our roleplays, our desires...<br>
<br>
Yes, they are laughed at.<br>
<br>
They are dashed against the rocks of envy, those green harbringers of hatred and discord, the pillers of what we fear most, by those that do more faster, those that one up us constantly, those we pretend to look up to.<br>
<br>
They are laughing at us.<br>
<br>
We muzzle our envy.<br>
We make nice sounds like 'oooo'<br>
and 'ahhh'.<br>
<br>
We lie. We are rotten to the core, spoilt by our green green envy, wrecked upon those rocks as we see our fun diminished, fleeting, sorrow on wings, away.<br>
<br>
This is to us, to all those that are still playing a game.<br>
<br>
This is to us, because they... they are not.<br>
<br>
They have grown, they have matured, they say... you can listen to them speak of it as they speak of thier guilds and their achievements. They have learned what we have not, they have... <br>
<br>
Progressed.<br>
Evolved.<br>
<br>
We on the other hand are merely content... we play at our pace, love and laugh and live at our own tempo, and yet, by the definition of things that are... we are not good enough.<br>
<br>
Enough.<br>
<br>
This is for anyone that has had a dream that doesn't end with new items.<br>
<br>
This is for anyone that still thinks level 30 is a massive achivement.<br>
<br>
This is not...<br>
<br>
This is not for anyone else. To steal and maim a line, I have seen the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by the advancement of levels. I have seen friends betray, real emotion lost, and love... <br>
<br>
This is not for you after you've reached those goals. After tonight, I no longer talk to the... top. You want to deal with me, you come down to my level.<br>
<br>
This is my game too... you've stopped playing it.<br>
<br>
Yet you still try to tell me how to play the game I love.<br>
<br>
Enough.<br>
<br>
And you, to those that matter still... to those still with dreams and passions, I urge you... rise...<br>
<br>
Not up. Be yourselves... do not envy, do not desire. That is what they want. It is what makes them more than they are.<br>
<br>
You are you.<br>
<br>
And you are so much more worthy then them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usantril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/21/02 4:51:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4802.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Absolutely Beautiful.</span><hr size=1> To the rest of the world, from<br>
<br>
Those who quest old world items, and die 20 times in the process because you're soloing it. <br>
<br>
Those who still camp the obsolete armors and weapons of their level, not because the armor is the best around, but because it demonstrates the personality of their character. <br>
<br>
Those who've never worn a haste item, or held weapons/armor that they could not have gotten at their level.<br>
<br>
Those who feel that the items of pride, such as the Burning Rapier or the SoulFire are more important than their FBSS. <br>
<br>
Those who've walked the earth and drew their own maps, rather than picked off the work of another.<br>
<br>
Those who've began a quest of their own accord, and solved it on their own effort, using only their own knowledge and that of their friends'. <br>
<br>
Those rogues who still bother to master poison, those who still smith and sell Fine Plate and chainmail, those who bake, those who still attempt to sell low grade jewelry so they can afford to increase their skill.<br>
<br>
Those who cannot solo so much as a yellow, let alone a red.<br>

<br>
I stopped dreaming.<br>
<br>
I didn't miss dreaming. I too said I had progressed, evolved, whatever.<br>
I lost the dream to something different. Not worse, not superior. And I enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
Then I stopped being &quot;uber&quot;, and only then did I realise that I lost the dream. That I long for it. But it's too late - my illusions have been destroyed by the progress and evolution I once strove for and delighted in. They can't be brought back, lost forever.<br>
<br>
It often hurts. Still, I continue. A changeling, fallen from the dream but still remembering it, but not one of the &quot;others&quot; anymore, either.<br>

I had given up on the game because I was sick and tired of uber high lvl play.  I returned only to be with friends and vowed to only play twinks.

I do scorn those who scorn the &quot;ubers&quot;.  We did not buy our way to the high end game (most of us anyways).  We were not PLed there.  We did all those things you are so proud of doing and then some.  We worked hard and enjoyed ourselves through level 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and up to 60.  We quested, we did silly things.  We camped, we grinded, we laughed and we banged our head against our desks in frustration.  <br>
<br>
You are not superior to us because you have pride in your Burning Rapier.  I had pride in my Paw of Opalla.  I had pride in my Kromriff Military Leggings.  I have pride in my Nature Walker's Scimitar and my Nature Walker's Chestguard.  The pride for one is not greater than the pride in the others.  Some were an accomplishment of soloing, others were the accomplishment of a player who excelled at his class enough that he was able to join a guild capable of helping with these quests.<br>
<br>
I have as much pride in my Circlet of Summer as I had from Testament of Vaneer.  <br>

My experiences are no less rich than yours with this game.  Do not suggest otherwise.<br>

<br>
Aidon, you're right in what you said. I hold those who dogged thier way to 60 in high esteem. As well as those who were there when quests were first released and got the old items by going and getting them, be it with a group or solo...better than simply paying off someone who has it to give it to you. <br>
<br>
In reference to my comment about pride in items, I didn't mean that one shouldn't take pride in the items you have. Each item was new and difficult to get at one point or another. I wrote from a standpoint of today though: when the Soulfire is easily outclassed by weapons the average level 20 paladin can afford, and the burning rapier has become a rare sight to see on any rogue. Most skip it because the weapons are not worth the time and money to get them...those that do get them, don't do it because it's practical, but because it's a class defined item. You see a flaming 2HS and you think "Paly" immediately. You see a rogue who marked himself as "Redeemed" under his profile, and you know that the rogue likes to put that extra touch into his character's personality. It's those people I was talking about. We all value our characters: it's the ones who do the things that are absolutely futile nowdays that define the real story behind their character. (Heck, most people don't even bother filling out their profs anymore...)<br>
<br>
Again, I say that I respect those who dogged thier way to their uber level. It's those who haev gotten there, or have a friend who's gotten there, and then twink a new alt with gear that no character of that level should have, and then complain that the other people around them aren't up to standards in an area that the individual could prolly solo with that level gear that piss me off. Each class/race combo was designed to provide it's own unique possibilites to be explored. Yet, at least 1/4- 1/3 of the people I've seen who've started an alt are determined to reach 60 as fast as possible, rather than take thier time, enjoy the lower levels more, and search through the sum total of the possibilities for thier class/race. <br>
<br>
I won't say that I'm superior to anyone, or that my EQ experience has been better than yours. You've gotten a long way, and are still continuing to journey. Likewise, I too have come a good distance, and I have a very long way to go. So my plea is that those of you who seek uberness quickly, be it your alt or your main, don't spoil the game for those of us who like a slow pace with adavancement and like to goof off, just for the sake of goofing off. EverQuest is, after all, a game.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/usantril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santril</A> at: 7/5/02 10:46:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upikawel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pikawel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/27/02 4:32:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4802.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pikawel.com/retard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Absolutely Beautiful.</span><hr size=1> Low levels were a hell of a better time than fighting over spawns in Velks (rallos zek player here...).

Many people just choose to ingnore them. The proudest day of my rogue career was claiming my burning rapier. It wasn't a terribly great weapon, but I wielded it well into my 30's. I just feel sorry for all the new players who get it reasonably easy now. The challenge has been removed from the game at lower levels, because the game has become a high level game now. Getting a full suit of Ravenscale consists of sitting in EC and auctioning for it. I recently went down to the Feerott to help a friend get his Ravenscale Chest Guard back after his account was hacked, only to find the silverflanked guardian that drops it was easily solo'd by me. I remember organising a full group of 40 -45's to get mine, and that wasn't a cake walk either.
