it is not hard to avoid pvp if you chose (by say not exping in the most frequented zones)<br>
<br>
it IS hard to learn the game on a zek server, I would not recommend it to anyone.<br>
<br>
If you don't know the zone as a newbie, they you prolly shouldn't be in that zone.<br>

No one here said EQ PvP is not broken.  My point is merely illustrating that a desire to engage in PvP is not in itself a manifestation of deeply rooted psychological problems, as is suggested by some of the posters here.<br>
<br>
As for your rule one referral to Kagero's comment:  If the 8 year old walks off the field then turns around and flips off the 350 pounder,  the 350 pounder has a moral obligation to smack the 8 year old up-side the head.<br>

PvP.

<br>
I am, however, of the opinion that the particular ways in which EQ PvP is broken tends to draw a greater number of &quot;buttheads&quot; to the PvP servers.  Or maybe its the same number of buttheads per capita, but they're able to express their buttheadedness so much more clearly that it just seems like theres more of them.<br>
<br>
As for the 350 pounder's moral obligations vis-a-vis the peewee player : He should be picking on people his own size, and shouldn't ahve hit the peewee player in the first place, thus encouraging the little one to flip him off.  This holds especially true if the 350 pounder is claiming he plays EQFootball for the challenge.<br>
<br>
In straight EQ terms : Do you think its cool for high level players to camp the newbie zones and continually kill people who have zero chance against them, or do you think that is griefing? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/umoffonfurryhealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moffon Furryhealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/22/02 2:06:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, as I said-</span><hr size=1> Don't assume things about anyone on any server and you'll be ok.

I play on Rallos.  There's a lot of @#%$, and there's just as many people who go out of their way to help you.  There's @#%$ on other servers too.  The only difference is that we can fight the @#%$ until they leave the server in frustration.  It's actually a lot nicer place than you'd imagine.  I wouldn't have said the same thing a few months ago, but we worked hard for the peace we are enjoying.  Me, I'm bored though :/<br>
<br>
p.s. I speak of the high end game, theres still a lot of prick pk's sub 56.<br>

<br>
Personally, I like something called team competition. That way you have the cooperative elements of the &quot;bluebie&quot; game and yet  with the added element of competition with new opportunities for roleplaying as well.<br>
<br>
The Best of the Best competitions mimic the team competition feel as well.<br>
<br>
As for the questions about griefing on the broken PvP servers. I happily left all such questions behind when I left the servers and prefer not to be &quot;dragged back in&quot; as Pacino would say. <p><img src="http://www.thesafehouse.org/%7Efricka/sig/DAOCsig.jpg"><br><b>~Fricka</b>

Players on pvp servers are in general more mature. They either know how to interact with others in a calm and mature manner, or learn to do it fast.<br>
<br>
There are always the loudmouth idiots, especially at lower levels. These exist on non-pvp servers too. The difference is that the loudmouth idiots dont get very far on the zeks, as we can actually put a gag in their mouth. <p>--------------------<BR>

I play on Innoruuk and on Vallon.  As for pvp, I prefer Vallon.  However, I decided to try Sullon about a week or so ago.  Flowers of Happiness was spamming the trade channel with &quot;GO GO GOOD TEAM&quot; and &quot;I AM A HAMSTER.&quot;<br>
<br>
That was the last of my adventure on SZ, and I went right back to Vallon.<br>
<br>
Edit -- I forgot to stay within topic and say what I had been thinking regarding players on pvp servers.  I agree that pvp is for those who enjoy dishing it out, and that's usually the side of pvp'ers get the most crap for.  On the other hand, you have to know how to take it as well.  My first time on pvp, I got killed by a couple of jerks who had been going around killing all the noobs in Blackburrow, picking them off one by one.  I took it personally, and was really upset.  That was quite a while ago.  This weekend I was playing one of my little noobs in Qeynos Hills, when two shorty casters came in doing the same thing.  They killed me, and as I was running back to get my corpse, I started laughing at all the other noobie corpses in the zone.  <br>
<br>
The point is, being a pvp'er isn't just about being someone who can dish out a bunch of crap.  It's someone who knows how to take it, and that to me says a lot about how mature a person can actually be. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/usaereajaciabre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saere Ajaciabre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/24/02 2:22:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ustytchyapgud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stytch Yapgud</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/24/02 4:14:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, as I said-</span><hr size=1> I like competing against other players sometimes.<br>

I apologize that we have such people on Sullon, but I just ignore them... or ( if I'm in the mood) I talk smack to them using 'complicated' words and arguements... they usually keep silent for a minute or two, and say something that -really- makes them look stupid.  Kind of entertaining actually <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
However, I'm not on their team so I have the privelage ( or disgrace if I lose) of venting my justified frustration on them if I meet them outside Bazaar/Nexus. *evil grin* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uspyder001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spyder001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 11:19:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, as I said-</span><hr size=1> I agree with Saere.  The people actually playing on the Zek servers and having fun are NOT the immature ones.  The immature acting people are the ones who try a Zek server, and things dont go right for them, so they quit and come to message boards and talk crap about how &quot;PvP's have bad attitudes and are immature&quot;.  Those are the immature ones. The ones who cant handle losing.  <br>
<br>
So you got Pk'd by someone.  Dont cry about it.  If you dont like it, quit and go back to a server you cant be Pk'd on.  Crying about how immature everyone is for killing you, makes you sound like a person who is bitter about your shock you went through when you realized PvP was NOT for you.   <br>

Try PvP Servers if you can handle a loss.

I agree, I allways give grats where its due and it often ends in advice or at the least not needing to scoot as long as I dont go after them for an hour or so.<br>

There is no comparsion the level of excitment and fun factor on Sullon is far superior at least to this gamer.<br>

The whole concept of playing for a team as oppossed to just playing for yourself or your guild makes a big difference.<br>
