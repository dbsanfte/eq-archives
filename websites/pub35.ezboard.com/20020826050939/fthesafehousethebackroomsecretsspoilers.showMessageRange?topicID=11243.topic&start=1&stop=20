- NPC casters should be a little bit smarter now. They will choose their spells a little more carefully. <br>
<br>
<br>
I always thought it could be scary if NPC casters did stuff PC casters did.

I personally think that they should offset this AI change with making your typical caster mob ( except boss mobs and such) more in line with melee/hp effectiveness.  They've always been rather tough since they were almost as good as your basic warrior mob in terms of pure fighting and how much ac/hp they had.  Don't you think they should tone it down a bit since they're smarter now?    Just my opinion..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unitanita.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NitaNita</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 4:11:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11243.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: News on these smarter caster NPC's yet?</span><hr size=1> I think it's more that npc's will use their full range of spells now instead of just a select few.

<br>
Necromancer NPCs used to only use &quot;Darkness&quot;, today I got slapped with Funeral Pyre. <br>
<br>
So I doubt Velketor will be casting L20 spells anymore, he'll likely be sunstriking instead <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
However, this doesn't upset me really. It's about time they made some aspect of the game more difficult, instead of less...I know I'll get flamed for this, but I think all the changes Verant has implemented have been making the game SO much easier than it ever was. It's getting a bit ridiculous. I hear in PoP there will be a plane of knowledge where you can get to almost any zone in the game. Pet classes are getting things that Verant always stood firm on never implementing, and with all the FT1, 2, 3 and focus items, it's just getting easy. They are making this into a MUCH easier game. <br>
<br>
One of the things that drew me into EQ was it's difficulty and high learning curve. Now it's becoming a very easy game.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion.<br>
