<br>
Flayed Barbarian Skin Legs<br>
<br>
(from memory)<br>
<br>
60 AC, 100 HP, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 10 STA?<br>
<br>
Monk only<br>
<br>
Close anyway.  Now, if you view this as an item alone then I should imagine it would score very highly, the thought of level one monks running around in these would scare the hell out of warriors I should imagine (or any monk not close to 60).  Now consider what is required to obtain these - kill the Avatar of War, hope the drop.  Killing one of the most bad ass mobs in the game, a feat which few guilds can achieve, in order to aquire the item should really lower it's &quot;balance&quot; value quite siginficantly I would have thought, but how do you quantify that?<br>
<br>
Using just stats is like using any just one aspect of any other thing - it does not provide the true picture in order to make an assessment of balance.  A lot of the time you will see people argue this should be nerfed, or this should be beefed up, and they will quite often do so by comparing their class to one very small aspect of another as if comparing like with like.  It is a big trap to not step back and consider the environment within which this item/ability/skill exists.  The classes are not just a set of skills and abilities, they are a whole and should be considered as such.  Items are not just stats, they have a difficulty to attempt to aquire, in addition to the rarity of the item itself dropping when the mob is killed.<br>
<br>
This all makes it very hard to come up with a number.  It also makes it a daunting task to balance everything, I really don't envy Verant in that department.  <br>

<br>
I see where you are coming from.  If you are considering placing a value on the ITEM, every one of your concerns are completely valid and understandable.  I would hate to try and determine a value for each item in the game, and I doubt it would even be feasible.  However, I was looking at it from a different point of view.<br>
<br>
Whatever the value of an ITEM, which must include the difficulty of obtaining it as you stated, the impact it has on the wearer would not change.  For example, you brought up the FBL.  Yes, in a system valuing the ITEM, if this item not only dropped form the AoW, but another item with identical stats for the same slot yet a different name dropped from some miniboss in Hate the value to the monk wearing it would be the same, no?  At least me, if an item gives me +100 hp it has no more or less impact on my character's ending ability whether it was a pain in the butt to acquire or relatively easy to acquire.  100hp is 100hp.<br>
<br>
I was referring to a sysem that places value on the impact of these sorts of things on the person that is currently wearing them, not the worth of the item itself to that person.<br>
<br>
If, for the pure sake of example, we use the item you posted:<br>
<br>
60 AC, 100 HP, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 10 STA<br>
<br>
... and we had a value sytem of, say:<br>
<br>
1hp = 1pt<br>
1ac = 3pt<br>
1str = 0.5pt(monk), 0.9pt(warrior)<br>
1dex = 0.1pt<br>
1sta = level/15(monk), level/10(warrior)<br>
<br>
then a 60 monk wearing this item would have their point value boosted by ((60 x 3)+(100 x 1)+(10 x .5)+(10 x .1)+(10 x 4))  = 326points<br>
<br>
Now a 60 warrior wearing this same item (at least one with the same stats... names don't make an item work better or worse) would get boosted by ((60 x 3)+(100 x 1)+(10 x .9)+(10 x .1)+(10 x 6))  = 350points<br>
<br>
So if we had these two fictional 60s together and were comparing them, and pretend they had absolutely no other skills, stats, equipment, whatever, then in this example they would we unbalanced in favor of the warrior.<br>
<br>
*****************************************<br>
On another note, I'm not so much pushing for a system that is designed for comparing equipped toons, so much as classes.  Of course, once two classes were compared using their levels on the class vs class scale, then you could also add in their equipment to get adjustments.  That way it would be easy to see why class X at level Y in gear Z could beat class A at level B in gear C at project N.<br>
<br>
Yes, some things would be difficult to &quot;value&quot;.  For example, what value does a Monk put on Instill Doubt?  What value does a Rogue put on it?  It's very possible that a rogue values it more than a monk of the same level.  A lot to consider.  But hey, looking at the flame fests going back and forth on these boards regarding balance, and their lengths.... it's not like we don't have the time on our hands, or that we don't care about balance.<br>
<br>
I appreciate your inputs =)  Part of what must be done is clarification of the system itself. <p>Raphayl <BR>

The value of AC is lower for iksars than other races.<br>

An effect of Serpentsight/Ultravision/Truesight will be of high value for only 3 races, and then only for a couple of classes within those races.<br>

The starting line would be totally naked and the finish line would be Y pts of damage per stat point and Y pts of damage saved per stat point.<br>
<br>
For example, you would need to determine how many times a level 60 cleric can cast CH with base stats (set a standard for each class based on the average starting stats of each class). There are mana calculators that can figure this out. If a cleric can cast 8 CHs with base stats at 10k per heal (current) then that is a total of 80,000 pts saved. My guess is that the duration that it takes this cleric to use up all of their CHs would be a good starting point to determine the set amount of time for the comparisons.<br>
I also think that  the damage output should be with a standard weapon that all classes can use with a easy ratio. A  9/18 weapon would be a good one to test all melee classes with since it breaks down to a .50 ratio.<br>
I'm sure there are already analysis done on how strength effects attack rating and how attack rating effects damage output. These should be applied to each class, and added in to a spreadsheet to determine the damage output per point.<br>
Stamina, Agility, Hit Points and resists simply are damage mitigation stats and ought to be considered when  measuring this end of the stick.<br>
The way to do this is to look at and place the most effective damage output and damage mitigation tools each class has. <br>
For example<br>
Warrior- Damage output- standard dual wield<br>
                Damage mitigation- No abilities, just additional stat bonuses.<br>
Cleric- Damage output- summoning hammer<br>
              Damage mitigation- Self Stats plus Complete heal<br>
Rogue- Damage output- Standard melee plus Backstab<br>
               Damage mitigation- Stats plus evasive<br>
Monk- Damage output-Standard melee plus kick<br>
             Damage mitigation-Stats plus mend Mend<br>
<br>
This doesn't take into effect the other abilites like Feining death, mezzing a mob etc. These are additional abilities and can in effect be an infinite amount of mitigation.<br>
<br>
I dont know the classes enough to list the types of base damage output and mitigation for each class. Can someone help me on this as well as some type of formulas to figure out the base damage and mitigation for each class on a similar skill and how it increases given additional stats.<br>

<br>
You are absolutely correct.  Yet, I think that would be a natural part of the formula.  You can't just say a level 60 monk is better than a level 60 warrior.  Too many variables have been left out.  Still, time and again you see posts saying that Warriors are better than Monks, or vice versa.  Are you referring to an Iksar Monk, or Human Monk? Ogre Warrior or Gnome Warrior?  How many AA's does each have, and in what areas?  It's all of these things that people tend to forget to take into consideration when trying to &quot;measure up&quot; two characters.<br>
<br>
A chart where we had everything spelled out for everyone to see would point out weaker or stronger combinations, based on the weight of factors for each combination.  Notice in my very limited example above, STA had different values for Warriors and for Monks since they gain different amounts of hps from it.  I also gave Warriors more value for higher Str since they 1. gain more Attack per point of Str than Monks ( I believe Warriors get 1Attk per 1Str whereas Monks only gain 0.9), and 2. they get the added benefit of being able to carry around more weight due to it.  Is that worth another 0.4 per point of Str to Warriors?  That would be for them to say.  The chart would be something like this:<br>
<br>
Each 1 point of STR<br>
Class A = 1.5 Base  Racial Modifier X = x1.0  Y= x0.7  Z = x0.4<br>
Class B = 1.0 Base  Racial Modifier X = x1.0  Y= x0.9  Z = x0.1<br>
Class C = 0.7 Base  Racial Modifier X = x0.8  Y= x0.7  Z = x0.7<br>
<br>
But that would only be stats.  The important things are stuff like:(just examples)<br>
<br>
Monk FD Skill= 2000pts<br>
ShadowKnight FD Spell= 1700pts<br>
Necromancer FD Spell= 1400pts<br>
<br>
Monk ID = 200pts<br>
Rogue ID = 500pts<br>
<br>
Melee Regeneration = 3pts/regen pt<br>
Necromancer Regen = 8pts/regen pt<br>
Shaman Regen = 10pts/regen pt<br>
<br>
Monk Mend Skill = 500pt<br>
Paladin LoH ability = 20pt/level<br>
<br>
<br>
Far from complete or accurate, but you get the idea.  If this was used, a person could add up everything for their class, race, and level and come up with a value they could compare to any other combination to see who came out where for various situations.  I'd like to see just one chart taking into consideration the &quot;average sitation&quot;, but if that's too general it wouldn't be hard to tweek it into 3 tables of &quot;solo&quot;, &quot;exp groups&quot;, and &quot;raid&quot;.  Or something along those lines.<br>

<br>
Wizards a very clear class to judge other classes on casting damage.<br>
<br>
Direct damage:<br>
   Wiz &gt; mag &gt; nec/enc<br>
<br>
Dot:<br>
   Nec &gt; enc &gt; mag/wiz<br>
<br>
Indirect damage (pets):<br>
   mag &gt; enc/nec &gt; wiz<br>
<br>
Non damage abilities (buffs, ports etc):<br>
   Enc &gt; mag/nec/wiz <br>
<br>
Priest classes:<br>
<br>
dots:<br>
  Shm &gt; druid &gt; cleric<br>
<br>
Nukes (not sure on this one):<br>
  Druid &gt; cleric &gt; shm<br>
<br>
Healing:<br>
  Cleric &gt; druid/shm<br>
<br>
Utility (ports, buffs, etc):<br>
  Druid &gt; shm &gt; cleric<br>
<br>
I suppose warriors would be the next benchmark.  As you increase in damage above the warrior, you should lose proportional tanking ability.  As you lose damage in relation to the warrior, you should gain in abilites such as spells/songs.  Tanking ability should also go down when gaining spells etc.<br>
<br>
So on the melee scale:<br>
<br>
Damage:<br>
   Rog &gt; monk &gt; war &gt; rang/shd/pal/beast &gt; bard<br>
   Looks fair, right now i don't care to distinguish the hybrids atm.<br>
<br>
Tanking ability:<br>
   War &gt; monk/rang/shd/pal/beast/rog &gt; bard<br>
   No particular order for hybrids and monk, but gives a sort of idea about where it should be.<br>
<br>
Abilities/spells<br>
<br>
Bard/pal/shd/rang/beast &gt; rog/monk &gt; war<br>
<br>
Everything has has a slash, is too close to call whether one is better than the other in my opinion.<br>

I think it's also to note not only that one class is better or worse in a certain area, but by how much, hense a scoring of some sort.  If every ability does not have some sort of weighted value, then things quickly become abstract and we wind up right back where we began.  Also, certain things need to be broken down a bit further.  For example, you said a Warrior could be &quot;the standard&quot; for melee-ish comparison.  That sounds fine.  Then you concluded that if you tank worse than a Warrior you get such and such.  The only problem is the blanket statement of tanking.  Tanking includes so many factors: Mitigating damage, Avoiding Damage, Keeping Aggro, Avoiding Stuns, etc.  All of which would have to be taken into consideration.<br>
<br>
But as you said, once all of these are taken into consideration, Warriors would be the best &quot;baseline&quot; per se for melee if we go with a particular class as being a baseline.  There are some facets that would be very challanging to place inline while using a &quot;class&quot; as a baseline, rather than just seeing how a value system based upon what each class has available.<br>

Combat skills would be easier to quantify than other stuff because you could just assign points proportional to how it changes the outcome of a fight.  Even that would depend on if you are interested in how it affects someone soloing vs xp grouping vs raiding though.  <br>
<br>
On a raid a fungi tunic doesn't do much for you.  In an xp group it's nice.  Soloing it's tremendous...  If you're MTing EB procs are godly, if you're not they're a liability.<br>

Depends on what you take into consideration.  You mean solely toe-to-toe melee?  Are you including spells and pet?  What level vs what level?  Is the Warrior going sword and shield or dual-wield? Generalities are what have shot us in the foot before, we will need to be fairly specific on this. <p>Raphayl <BR>

Why Balance classes?<br>
Each class is different and has its advatages and disadvantages. Each class has a niche. If you picked a warrior you did it to be a bad arse tank and be THE man in the high end encounter. If you picked a monk it was to deal good damage and still take some as well and to pull for your group. (this is a broad example)<br>
I play a 60 monk. I would never tank over a 60 warrior in an exp group. The difference in how often the cleric has to heal when I tank is ... the cleric can not melee with me tanking. where as when my warrior friend tanks the cleric can melee and we can plow threw many more mobs and get more exp.<br>
Any melee class can tank its just about who does it best.Warriors Tank the best period. Can a monk tank? sure can a ranger tank? sure. even a rogue could tank, its all about the support you get from your group. The whole point is risk vs reward on the gear like you all are talking about the flayed barb legs. 60 ac is very nice. You have to be in a guild and prob be with them for 2 plus years to even get a chance at these. Dont nerf monks or any other class because VI put out some kick arse gear to give peeps something to strive for.<br>
If the proposed nerf takes effect and is bad as everyone assumes, monks will be a lot less desirable class to group with and to play. There is no need for balance unless it effects a majority of the other players/classes. monks dont plain and simple. However nerfing them will. <br>
<br>
But I guess we need to wait and see what happens<br>

<br>
I appreciate your input, but I'd really like to keep the focus of this thread to my original point.  This was spawned by the recent discussions due to the impending changes, but is not a sounding board regarding them.  We have 1000+ other forums where everyone is voicing their opinions about the changes, and I respectfully request those wishing to post about that topic in one of those.<br>
<br>
This thread is not about balancing classes, as VI/SOE will do what they please regarding that.  Instead, it's aobut us as a player-base determining what we place our value upon so we can perform our own calculations and see where we feel that state of balance is.  We cannot come to VI/SOE with broad generalized statements like &quot;we need to better balanced&quot;, or &quot;class x is better than class y&quot;.  If we are to accomplish anything, we need to be able to have something solid to compare and agree upon, and &quot;hopefully&quot; be able to accomplish what we need as one big team.<br>
<br>
However, one of the things you stated merits special attention.  You stated that each class has it special nitch.  You are absolutely correct.  They part of that we need to be aware of is that, based upon gear, situation, game changes, expansions, etc... those nitches have been known to change, and will most likely change again.  The information I'm hoping to have put together will allow everyone to better determine what those nitches are, should be, or might become in the future. <p>Raphayl <BR>
