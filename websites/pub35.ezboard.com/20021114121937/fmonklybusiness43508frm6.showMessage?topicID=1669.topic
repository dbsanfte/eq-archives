I am currently a level 20 monk, and while grouped with a 26 cleric and a 24? shaman I was trying to carefully pull singles out of the sarnak fort in loio. Got one pair that refused to split, so I led them off in the hills and FD, circled back and pulled a single from deeper in. (led the single out and FD again to make sure he was alone.) Sure enough, on the way to my party the other double came back and joined in. As soon as I noticed this, I took all 3 back to the field, gettin beat in the process, and finally succeeded in a FD, only to find the cleric running up to cast GHealing on me, and the shaman drawing aggro on the triple pull. <br>
This being LOIO, it degenerated into a finger pointing session with me being removed from the party for training them.<br>
My mistake? Or people just not used to playin with a monk?<br>
I'm still learning, just curious. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usebakiswarweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sebakis Warweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/4/02 9:29:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1669.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where, oh where did I go wrong?</span><hr size=1> Your mistake is going to LOIO.  <br>

There is lots of unexperienced people in LOIO, and the exp there completely SUCKS.  Don't worry, it wasn't your fault.  When a Monk pulls and FDs, the others should already be back.  It would only be your fault if you ran right up to the Shammy and FD'ed.  <br>
<br>
Oh by the way, make sure you turn Auto-Attack off before you press FD.   <p><center><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Sebakis/fullsize/sebby.jpg><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Sebakis/fullsize/sebby2.jpg></center><BR><center><font=verdana>Mustaine For Ever</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukelwan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelwan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/4/02 10:17:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1669.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where, oh where did I go wrong?</span><hr size=1> You don't tell us where in the Fort you were camping, but I have noticed some weird pathings at the front entrance.

Even if had been some mistake you made, removing a groupmember for a mistake when in the 20s is plain stupid. We learn from our mistakes, and it's better to do them at the lower levels. <p><font face="Gill Sans MT"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=70469 target=_blank><font size=3 color="3300ff">Jondalar Fairfist</font></A><br>

Unfortunatly not to many listen, be that as it may, they usually wind up dead and me FD somewhere.<br>

As for the pathing, if your on the R Plat, heres a hint. <br>
Stay off the walls, it draws aggro.  <p><img src="http://cbrwolf.homestead.com/files/sig1.jpg">

One thing that you might find handy are a couple hot keys.<br>
<br>
 One of the keys to being a good monk is communicating. Oh, and btw...I am not saying you were wrong, just throwing in something you could have done that might have gotten those others awake. You never know when a caster is in their book, or unfamiliar with a monks way...or any class for that matter.<br>
<br>
 So communicate a lot, so they will know what is going on. Here are a couple hot keys I always use...everytime I pull.<br>
<br>
 Before I even start to leave the group to pull, I hit this hotkey: &quot;Splitting mobs, no casting on the monk.&quot; If I actually do have to split, I let them know again as I'm doing it. I then do my incoming message after I know I have what I'm calling. Whether it is one, or more than one (chanters get bored with us at times :P.)<br>
<br>
 Once they hear all this enough, it becomes a habbit for them to not even think about doing anything until the incoming message. Very helpful with the unfamiliar.<br>
<br>
 Again, you were not wrong, but that might help you a bit...nothing better than turning a bad player into a good one.<br>

Got a terrible love/hate thing with LOIO. Love the ability to solo wandering mobs while waiting for a group, hate bein in many of the groups i find there.<br>
Just for information, we were outside the fort pulling to the cliffs on the north side. The pathing that I've noticed is, once the mobs are far enough from the gate they wander off to the hills for a pow-wow before returning to their spawn point. Normally you have time to grab some yard trash before they come back. If you have sow that is, I didn't. (Mistake 1, shoulda hounded the shammy to mem it.)<br>
My FD skill was somewhere in the 60's at the time, not great for trying to split red con mobs I've learned. Especially when you're acting as tank also.<br>
I've also learned to switch camera views on the run to check for adds. Much better than relying on the group to wave you off.<br>
Communication? After this I started briefing the party not to come to my rescue. Think I will put it on a hotbutton tho, thanks for the tip.<br>
All in all a bad experience, but lessons learned. A wiser monk continues his journey.  <br>
Thanks again everyone!<br>

<br>
And yep, always be aware of the situation around you using 3rd person camera views (have the 2 set up so you get a near complete 360 view if possible). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urabican1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rabican1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/9/02 9:17:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1669.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where, oh where did I go wrong?</span><hr size=1> YOUR MISTAKE AND ONLY MISTAKE, Is wasting your best levels (20-40) in the Oasis-Lake-FM-OT-DL cycle. <br>
<br>
Plant yourself somewhere and max FD. It is your best skill, almost everything else you do as monk stems from that skill.<br>
<br>
If you don't have Luclin and Velious, get them. If you can't afford them, go mow lawns, wash dishes, hell, go mug someone for the US $50, needed for the expansions. <br>
<br>
Go to Shadowhaven and bind yourself there and use it and the Bazaar as your base(s) of operations. There is 10x better loot and Xp in the Netherbian Lair. And the best part is, there is a bank two zones away. <br>
<br>
Also, the Bazaar is rapidly becoming the cross roads, of EQ. You can use that in the buying and selling of items. <br>
<br>
There is a pretty nice earring quest that you can do in the NL, and there are a few faction quests in shadowhaven, that make using that place easier. <br>
<br>
I cant say enough good things about NL for a toon in the twenties. It has the indoor rules, I.e. No SoW allowed. But it has many wide open spaces, so you can learn positioning and agro radius pulling to get the job done. As an indoor zone, it forces you to begin to learn how to pull. Open air kunark zones only teach laziness and breed stupidity.<br>
<br>
NL is a great zone to solo, and group alike. It is also the route from the Nexus to several high end zones, and an occasional drive by buff from a lvl 50+ cleric/shammy/druid/chanter never hurt anyone. <br>
