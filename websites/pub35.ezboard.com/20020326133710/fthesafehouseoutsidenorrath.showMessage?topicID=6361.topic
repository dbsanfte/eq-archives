<br>
You are asking help with a school project and that's fine it just irritates me to no end though that you can't even take the minor effort to write your request legibly.  You constantly misspell the word school.  You misspelled English, and I won't even go into your grammar, and strange capitalization issues.  Normally I could give a crap about a persons grammar when they post, but the fact that you are requesting help with an English assignment and it looks like you have spoken the language for about three days.  If you can't take the minor effort to write your request intellegently then why should anyone else take the time to bother giving you an intellegent answer?  <br>
<br>
Now if English isn't your first language ignore the above, but I tend to doubt that is the case since it's a debate assignent for English class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uriphter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Riphter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/21/02 1:50:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6361.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Righty Kids Sawin Needs Some Help for Skool.....</span><hr size=1> Use that one amendment which allows people to carry guns, Sawin.. lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ubernome>Ubernome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/21/02 1:51:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6361.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/ribbon_small.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Righty Kids Sawin Needs Some Help for Skool.....</span><hr size=1> Seems to me he spelled skool and engrsh on purpose. <p><img src=http://sushicide.homestead.com/files/mrpo.gif height=70 width=70> Pissed off since 1982</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulilum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/21/02 1:54:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6361.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Righty Kids Sawin Needs Some Help for Skool.....</span><hr size=1> I don't care if it was on purpose or not, he's asking for intellegent, enlightened advice and can't even bother to do it in an intellegent way.

If they were randomly investigating students outside of school property, etc. I could understand the concern. That would definately be inappropriate.<br>
<br>
However, As with many other locations, Weapons are prohibited. If I go to town hall, or the airport, weapons are not allowed, and Metal Detectors are installed to prevent such weapons from being snuck into the premises.<br>
<br>
Similarly, If Someone was running a private place of business, they would be perfectly justified in taking security emasures of this nature.<br>
<br>
You know ahead of time that weapons are not allowed, and you know ahead of time that you will be searched upon entry to these places.<br>
<br>
Now, if they suddenly took everyone in the middle of the school day, and ran them through a emtal detector without warning, that I would have a serious problem with. But as long as they know ahead of time, I don't have a problem with it.<br>
<br>
However, Just I do think that parents and children should have more of a choice, so that if they wanted to attend a private school with no metal detectors, they could do so. <br>
<br>
After some of the disasters like Columbine, I wouldn't be too horribly opposed to having Select teachers and/or administrators trained and certified to carry firearms, or other non-lethal weapons to incapacitate attackers in some sort of Columbine situation. But then, I'm a 2nd Amendment Junkie anyway... At the very least, Police Resource officers on campus all during the school day are a good idea. <p><hr><center><small><b>Never give in--never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense.
