GeneralNews [ 1:00 AM EDT ] - Witt <br>
Gordon Wrinn has made an official response to the rumours from the Minneapolis fan faire about possible upcoming changes to the existing PvP servers. He made these comments over at the Developer's Corner.<br>
Hello all,<br>
It’s apparent that as a result of the Fan Faire this weekend in Minneapolis, inaccurate information regarding our PvP plans for the future were released and/or misinterpreted. <br>
<br>
That has always been one of the difficulties of having a real-time interactive discussion where one doesn’t have the time to think about the precise wording of their answers. However, what we gain through the interactive forum makes it worth the effort, even when things appear to come out wrong like they did in the PvP panel this weekend. <br>
<br>
For the most part, regarding the information that has since shown up on web sites, it appears that when it was mentioned that we “discussed” an issue, it was interpreted as “we are doing this”. The fact is, we discuss a TON of things when we’re driven to improve one area of the game. If you name it, we’ve probably discussed it at one time or another. That doesn’t necessarily mean that what we discussed has either been decided or shot down, just that we’ve given it some measure of consideration in the past. <br>
<br>
So, with that in mind, here’s the quote-by-quote clarification of the story on Castersrealm (eq.castersrealm.com) and RallosZek.net. (www.ralloszek.net). <br>
<br>
Quote from Article: In approximately one week, PvP 'rules' will be as on Sullon Zek. In other words, there are no rules with respect to PvP. Standard blue server rules apply and sexual/racial harassment will not be tolerated. Everything else (training/bind point camping/exp killing, etc) will be completely legal. No PvP related petitions will be handled by the CS staff. The standard blue server type problems such as lost corpses, bugs, lost items, etc will still be handled.<br>
<br>
Clarification: Sure, we discussed it, much like we discuss anything. As we were putting together the ruleset for Sullon Zek, someone suggested that we role it out across Sullon first and see how that goes and role it across the other servers if it works out. Will it go across the other servers? We don’t know. We’ll have to see how it goes on Sullon first.<br>
<br>
Quote From Article: ShowEQ is actively being pursued to be 'fixed' <br>
<br>
Clarification: As actively as “bang for the buck” allows. We really need to do something revolutionary and complex in our next attempt to address the problem. It’s just a matter of having enough time to implement and test that. Timeframe? Mid-term, probably prior to Luclin’s launch.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: Classes are being re-examined for viability in a PvP environment. Lady Daegarmo specifically mentioned rangers as being one of the classes that is woeful in PvP.<br>
<br>
Clarification: …with nothing specific planned and nothing beyond minor tweaks, certainly nothing class-redefining planned. Regarding rangers there was talk about improving archery, but that was spoken of with plans to put something out across all servers rather than just as a PvP-related improvement. The truth is, the classes are not balanced for one-on-one PvP, no more than they are balanced for one-on-one PvE (Player versus Environment). If you have to fight as part of a group to be successful in PvE, you’ll most likely have to do so with PvP. Yes, this does mean that a solo melee player will be at a disadvantage when meeting casters, especially those configured for solo play, and yes, that is part of the plan.<br>
<br>
Quote from the Article: Lady Daegarmo is pushing for the return of egg shaped pumice on vendors for approx 200P each<br>
<br>
Clarification: Oh it’s been pushed, but has yet not been taken up by the dev team for consideration. We’re kind of like the supreme court that way <br>
<br>
Quote from Article: It was noted that Harm Touch and Lay Hands are on the same spell function with opposite effects so there's no way to give Lay Hands back to paladins on death while restricting the same recycle on HT<br>
<br>
Clarification: Not entirely accurate. The reuse time is not tied to the spell effect, not to mention that each ability is treated as a skill by the game and uses its own reuse timer. The reason it’s not being done is not a matter of technical unfeasibility, but rather a specific design decision not to. Both are easy to exploit. The level to which they can be exploited is acceptable on the PvE servers and not acceptable on the PvP servers. <br>
<br>
Quote from Article: Cross teaming is coming to an end. Teams (see later notes) will be locked down. There will be no ability to crossteam at all. No grouping, guilding, buffing, etc with non-team members. This lockdown is probably 60 days out. (I stated that the Development team would make an official date on the lock down in which they would give a minimal of 30 day notice. I also stated that I doubted you would see these changes within the next 2 months.)<br>
<br>
Clarification: Yep, we’re planning on addressing cross-teaming, probably through locking down the teams. However, the specifics on how this will be done, along with what if any beneficial abilities will be allowed to cross any lock down is still being discussed. Opinions are welcome.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: The lockdown will entail a guildwipe. All guilds will be deleted and must be reformed. There will be extra staff for the first few days after the wipe to assist in this endeavour<br>
<br>
Clarification: If we decided to do the most severe lockdown (no cross-guilding), then this would probably be the case. However something like this won’t be decided until we decide what kind of lockdown we’ll do.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: It is highly likely that common (the language) will be removed from the racewar servers for general communication use (i.e., public channels). Training in non-team languages will also receive very low caps.<br>
<br>
Clarification: No. While this was one of the many thing suggested as part of a panel discussion, it has only been discussed as one of the many possible options for an “RP Server”, for lack of a better term, by the development team. The “RP Server”, by the way, will not be PvP. Those looking for PvP rules similar to an “RP Server” should look towards Sullon Zek.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: Strong possibility of adding a long (40 or so hours) quest to change your team. Certain classes/races would not be allowed to join certain teams (such as a Paladin joining the evil team).<br>
<br>
Clarification: No. It was one of the suggestions brought up by players in the panel discussion, and has not been discussed by the development team. However, I can say with some certainty that this probably won’t happen.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: TZ likely to be changed to a 2 team server (Good vs. Evil). VZ may be changed to a 3 team server<br>
<br>
Clarification: These were ‘off the cuff’ examples of how a lock down could possibly be accomplished, rather than an indication of the direction planned. To clarify further, we previously decided not to implement a 2-team system, and are considering a 3 team system, by race, due to the percentage breakdown of players on each team currently.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: Rallos will always remain coin + 1 item loot. Code for rain spells is currently being changed to not effect your pet or your immediate group<br>
<br>
Clarification: Yep and Yep, but no ETA.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: Sullon Zek will be live within 3 weeks<br>
<br>
Clarification: Probably within a week actually baring major problems coming up.<br>
<br>
Quote from Article: There's discussion about adding a new Guildwar server with no 'teams' but lockdowns based on your guild.<br>
<br>
Clarification: This was previously discussed and ruled out by the development team, as it would be insufficiently differentiated from the current servers. In other words, most of everything that would be doable on the “guildwar” server is currently doable on Rallos, or one of the existing teams for that matter. <br>
<br>
Quote from Article: On Sullon, the new summon corpse mechanism for good races will be obtained via a quest which likely involves PvP/crests of fallen opponents.<br>
<br>
Clarification: This is accurate. In fact I’ll tell you now that Mages are in line to gain the ability on Sullon. And no, we won’t roll it out that way on other servers <br>
<br>
I hope this gives everyone a better idea of what we have planned for the near and mid-terms. We’ll work to be a little more explicit about what is currently planned or not planned to avoid misunderstandings in the future.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
