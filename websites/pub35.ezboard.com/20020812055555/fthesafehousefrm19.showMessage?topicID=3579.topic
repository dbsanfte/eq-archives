I hit 5 out of 14 PA's.<br>
The ones where it says SoAndSo is not in View, or Is too far away.  A split second later I hit them on my second swing.  So I know they aren't too far away, or not in view.<br>
I guess I feel that's a bit low.  I've been 50 for about 3 months now, so It's not that I dinna know what I'm doin out there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Also in comparison to what I used to be able to hit for before 1.50 patch it seems low.  And right in line with what a lot of other assasins have been 'feeling' about their PA's.<br>
Anyway, just some observations for people ta mull over. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>~Jaeden~

<br>
These are the ones that concern me.<br>
<br>
So far what has been stated by Zedia, is that the server is &quot;loosing&quot; the perforate artery and treating it as a NORMAL attack.  I have also noticed that consistantly, we just simply MISS more often now.  Did they change PA to bounce off weapon spec IN ADDITION to CS skill?<br>
<br>
Like if you have a 12 in blades you'll miss more than if you had a 40.<br>

4) You prepare to perform PA<br>
You are no longer hidden<br>
You hit xxx for paltry damage/miss/evaded/blocked/parried/stabbed yourself in the foot<br>

#4 is the bug people are seeing, #4 is also just #3 without the failure messages. I think the 'bug' here is just the failure mesage getting dropped and in all other respects the mechanics behind #4 are identical to #3. At least I haven't seen any of the shots where you come unhidden after you hit/evaded/whatever.<br>
<br>
What needs to be fixed is #3. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=servo>Servo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 12:09:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3579.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So I was out dueling.
