<br>
If evade fails 30% of the time under optimal conditions, then we will be able to strip off roughly 7% of our total current hate every ten seconds.  Without the actual details of how hate is built, I would suspect that that will buy us a few seconds of bliss.<br>
<br>
If we do the math, this is what this means:<br>
<br>
Let us make some assumptions:<br>
<br>
Rogue hate built per 10 seconds:  500<br>
Rogue evade effectiveness when NOT under attack: 70%<br>
<br>
When you run the numbers, you find out that there is an effective max hate you can generate on a mob if you are constantly evading.  <br>
<br>
You reach that number *much* quicker (obviously) with a 33% decline in hate (original proposal) than you do with a 10% decline in hate (new proposal).<br>
<br>
So much quicker that out of all the proposals, I *really* prefer the first.  I hate to lose the guaranteed switch of evade, but I'd rather get to the &quot;safe zone&quot; faster.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.kabald.org/hategraph.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
With a 33% reduction (modified by the 70% chance of evade), you reach your hate plateau in about 2 minutes.  <br>
<br>
With a 10% reduction (modified by the 70% chance of evade), you reach your hate plateau in about 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
In either case, basically, at the beginning of a fight, you build hate *fast* and need to be very careful.  By the end of the fight, screw it, the reduction per evade in hate will be exactly equal to the hate you produce.<br>
<br>
(Note that the amount of hate you actually build up every 10 seconds is irrelevant.)<br>

How about removing the thing about having to stand still to hide for rogues again?<br>

1) SKs and Necros can invis while running with zero casting time<br>

Most mid 50s warriors have something like a Lamentation and a CSS, while most mid 50s rogues have a Rage and a CSS/Bloodpoint/LL.  Considering that this average warrior isnt using procing weapons (lamentation, CSS) and the Rogue is most likely using a procing weapon in their offhand, i think that the hate points earned by the rogue would be significantly higher then the warrior.  And with your example a successful evade by the rogue is just slightly eeking under the warrior.  So, the mob may turn around and a rogue will probably have time to slip in a backstab, but im guessing that any mob, uber or not, will be right back on that rogue, and we simply dont have the ac/hps to handle mobs that mid 50s groups are working.  Please reconsider just changing it back to a similar effect of what it was before the hate list increase, im no programmer, but that doesnt sound too difficult to implement.  Also, consider the outrage that many rogues are feeling and expressing currently, we play this game day in and day out, we see things that the dev team probably dont, our opinions and ideas are probably the most informed out there, please dont dismiss them. <p><p align=center>~Gaar Liontum~<BR>~Dalimur Darkrazor~<BR>Paladin by day, Rogue by night<BR>~Rodcet~</p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uminionx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MinionX</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 5:07:49 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~minionx-podw/pokepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> Question ..<br>

<br>
Forgive the usenet style quote and underlining.. No l33t html/ezcode skillz here..<br>
<br>
&gt; Yes...we often have as many as 8 level 58+ rogues on our<br>
&gt; raids. These rogues will all be trading off their aggro<br>
&gt; to another rogue 2 or 3 down the list since it's no <br>
&gt; secret rogues climb to the top of the list faster than <br>
&gt; anyone... <br>
<br>
Just a thought, but prior to Velious, if you had 6+ rogues on a raid, you would _in theory_ get exactly the same &quot;rogue evade loop&quot; situation, as the hate list was only 6 long.. <br>
<br>
Can anyone that was on a raid _pre-velious_ with 6+ rogues confirm wether or not this sort of thing did happen? It might be relevant to the situation..<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure I understand Kendricks description of how the old hate list worked.. If it was only 6 long, with the lowest being dropped, how did anyone not in those 6 ever make it up into the top 6, without hitting &quot;taunt&quot; or generating more hate in a single hit than number 6 on the list? Is the &quot;generated hate&quot; value something different from the &quot;hate list&quot;? If it is, then I would have thought the the 6 limit on the hate list would be irrellevant, as anyone with a generated hate value is effectively &quot;on the list&quot; anyway..<br>
<br>
Did the old evade put the rogue at number 6? Or did it drop them off completely.. If it dropped them off entirely (putting them to 120 pts or whatever) then how was it that they generated enough hate to get them back on the list, if you have to be on the list in the first place to have a hate value?<br>
<br>
It's just that I'm thinking, if generated hate value is stored and determines wether or not you're on the list, then what is really the difference between having a 120 long list and a 6 long list? Either way the critter attacks number one and everyone else continues to generate hate until they hit number one..<br>
<br>
But if the old system just dopped the rogue to number 6, rather than off the list, why not put it back that way rather than going to number 2? <br>
<br>
Just some random thoughts, as a programmer myself I can't help but try and think through any problem <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Might isn't good enough for a game where the death penalties are high, and very large amounts of time are lost in one death.<br>
<br>
As MinionX said, we aren't Rangers. Rangers got OUR evade skill.  Evade should ATLEAST be twice as much as jolt, and more when availabe.<br>
<br>
You said yourself that one single melee hit is anywhere between 50-500 hate, jolt reduces 500. So if we evade once, and only reduce 500 hate, then quad, that could easily be 2000 points of hate, and a dead rogue.<br>
<br>
Tell the design team, or whoever is coming up with these ideas that they need to use some math skills, simple ones even, and they'll be able to see that this ideas are, well, ignorant.<br>
<br>
A good solution to evade is like so:<br>
<br>
For mathematical purposes, let's say there are 60 hate slots, 60 being the most hated; 1 being the least hated.<br>
<br>
Rogue is 60th (tanking) rogue evades, his slot divided by 2 gives him the new slot in the hate list, 30. Evades again, while at 30, and drops to 15, again, and he's at 7 or 8, either.<br>
<br>
<br>
Formula: RogueSlot/2=New Slot<br>

Based on a few assumptions, I would like to make a suggestion.<br>
<br>
Assumption 1) something must be done to downgrade the current level of effectiveness of the evade skill<br>
<br>
Assumption 2) if assumption 1 is met, there WILL be a reduction in the damage output of Rogues. After all, if we are not doing too much damage with the way evade currently works, why do we need to change evade?<br>
<br>
I do not have a problem with these assumptions. I have always had a bit of a problem with the straight up slug fest that we as rogues now find our selves in. Not very roguely at all (yes I place RP and character definition above raw combat effectiveness, otherwise I would not have been playing this class for well over a year). <br>
<br>
Suggestion) Reduce the effectiveness of Evade, but allow US to decide when and how much we will employ it. Reduce the evade cycle time a comparable amount and make it harder to interrupt. This allows us to choose when we will be building up hate, and when we will be lowering it. KEEP IN MIND, we have to turn off auto-attack to evade, thus more time attempting to evade=less time dealing damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The real problem arises from the fact that in a few shorts seconds (assuming the evade is not interupted and does not fail) we can currently offset many more rounds of damage than it takes for the evade to cycle through and be ready for use again. Thus if we are lucky we can go through a whole fight at near maximum damage output with minimal damage to ourselves. With the suggested fix, we can only offset a few rounds of damage, WITH THE SAME LENGTHY CYCLE before evade is ready again. This will lead to frustration on the part of those who do the smart/selfish thing and go sit down for a while (assuming they can even withdraw from the fight in good order) and death to those who insist on staying in and contributing to the fight.<br>
<br>
 So reduce the effectiveness and increase the frequency with which we can attempt to evade. This forces us to decide wether we want to be dealing damage at a specific instance, or removing the hate we have accumulated. From a RP point of view this fits better with my own view of how a rogue should be fighting anyway. Looking for openings, darting in to take advantage of them, then darting back out again. Not standing toe to toe and slugging it out and then waving a magic wand that makes our opponent forget we are a threat.<br>
<br>
In summary, if you drastically reduce the efffectiveness of evade (as all of the official solutions WILL do) AND make it cycle much faster, you will have your goal : reduced overall damage IF the rogue decides lowering agro is more important than making maximum damage potential. <br>
<br>
I just hate the idea of sitting on my butt waiting to move down the hate list while my friends are dying. Let me do SOMETHING. Anything. But most importantly, let ME decide when to do it.<br>

I can change the &quot;hate value per 10 seconds&quot; and the charts are identical except for the Y axis.  <br>
<br>
Your question about the variance is a good one.  I don't have any way of modelling it, as I don't know the exact details of how hate is built on an event basis.<br>
<br>
But, I have added a couple of new graphs that show how our hate builds in comparison to, say, a warriors.  I've created two graphs.  The first assumes that a warrior builds hate at 70% the rate of a rogue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.kabald.org/hategraph2.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Note that it takes 2 minutes for the warrior to get ahead and stay ahead on hate.  <br>
<br>
The next assumes that a warrior builds hate at 50% the pace of a rogue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.kabald.org/hategraph3.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
At that rate, it takes about 4 minutes for a warrior to get ahead and stay ahead on hate.<br>
<br>
From there, I asked, &quot;how long do I have to allow a warrior to build up agro to minimize my chances of every getting on top of the agro list.&quot;<br>
<br>
The answers:<br>
<br>
* If a warrior builds hate at 50% the rate of a rogue: ~40 seconds.<br>
* If a warrior builds hate at 70% the rate of a rogue: ~20 seconds.<br>
<br>
My best *guess* is that a warrior builds hate at least half as fast as a rogue.  If true, then the changes to evade are effectively meaningless on epic encounters.<br>
<br>
Also note that these trends predict outcome across a large number of encounters.  The very nature of random numbers means that you cannot be certain that you will succeed on evade 70% of the time in a predictable fashion.  Fail evade too often and you'll die.<br>

Currently you are moved to the bottom of the hate list which I agree is a little much.  But, even at the bottom I can go straight to the top if my next evade fails.  I don't care if I'm moved to 3rd or 4th or 5th or last... either way if I fail my next evade I'm tanking.  <br>

 All I will say on evade is please make sure they HEAVILY test it with 55-60 rogues with high end weapons and max haste. In an xp group I already tank half the time but I get all my backstabs off so thats ok if evade is nerfed I will be permanant tank.  My group does use 2 rogues so us evadeing onto eachother is a potental problem.  The haste factor might be simply solved by allowing haste to affect the Hide button refresh time, that way reduction in hate is scaled with how fast you are building it up somewhat.<br>
<br>
 As for hide/sneak across zones.. am I missing some horribly obvious reason why rogues couldn't just be made to default hide on entering a zone?  Much like the running on entering the game, we put a line in config and then on zone we are hidden? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaeghanttuskbone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeghant Tuskbone</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 6:10:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zen and the Art of Evade Mechanics</span><hr size=1> <br>

I have run through every possible case in my head and I cant think of a single case as how this new evade will be better then before. The assumptions you are making simply dont work in real game play situations. Comming from a ranger who knows how little that -500 hate does I can say with the current setup you are planning simply will not work. <br>
<br>
Why does evade fail?<br>
-  You evade but you fail to duck out of combat(This fail rate is about 35%, depending on mob)<br>
-  You are not standing still for the 3 sec needed before you evade and you fail. (This happens about 10%)<br>
-  You are being attacked and when you try and evade you are being pushed back and fail because you are moving. (This happens about 60% of time when tanking fast hitting mobs)<br>
<br>
You fail to understand that most rogues can get 3 backstabs per one evade attempt when hasted. With the uber aggro of the BS a rogue will alway remain on the top of the hate list as you planned. <br>
<br>
You need to do the following test. Take 36 people to lord yelinak 6 wars, 6 rogues, 3 rng, 3 pal, 3 sk, 8 clerics, 2 enc, 2 nec, 2 mages, 3 wiz. Somthing in that combination. Then note what class die 1st and when they die. I can already tell you the outcome, but see for yourself. Simple put, your plan will not work. <br>
<br>
Dont let what happen to the ranger class happen to rogues. You are sending them down on a path or utter uselessness. Having evade work the same way but making them go down to #12 on the hate list is much more resonable. <br>

<br>
Okay. I spouted off a lot of grave fears about the new proposal (I still have them) over the last 24 hours. I am pleased to see this refinement. I still have my doubts, but a guaranteed minimum Hate reduction does a lot to make the model make more sense.<br>
<br>
Please express my thanks (not that it means that much, but hey) to the team at Verant for working through this and for responding to player concerns. Again, I dunno if this is adequate (just remember how often Evade fails - due to random numbers and movement --- and how often the movement SHOULDN'T be happening but the server mysteriously thinks it is). But I'm glad you are taking a look at it and continuing to refine it.<br>
<br>
I don't mind added risk being a rogue - it comes with the terf. But I REALLY don't see my damage-dealing capability reduced down to the point where I do less damage than the other two &quot;true&quot; melee classes under normal circumstances. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulatro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Latro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 6:32:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kendrick my friend...</span><hr size=1> The new evade proposals are *clearly* not as beneficial to rogues or their gorups as the current evade mechanics.<br>

It is a nerf, after all ;)<br>

But, at least as far as I can tell, against uber mobs of the Velious variety, the change isn't as significant as it might appear.<br>
