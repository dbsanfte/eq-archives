<br>
He had given in to exhaustion some time ago, falling still next to the dead body of a dessert wanderer some time ago. Dusty air washing over cracked, bloody lips. Sucking the moisture out of him from the inside out.<br>
<br>
The corpse next to him long since desiccated to a paper like texture.<br>
<br>
Drafts of sand mounding up on his right side, as the dessert claimed the rogue for its own.<br>
<br>
Barriers held for life, breaking down as the mind finally grasps the finality of his situation.<br>
<br>
?he was at home?on the farm where he grew up.<br>
<br>
?His hands were tiny?unscared. Well mostly. He felt his face?smooth, almost soft, and a lock of reddish hair fell before his eyes. Long ago, that was the only way to tell Minz and Munz apart. Munz has always had the Dark brown hew, while Minz's had a reddish tint to it in the summer.<br>
<br>
'Red?? It hasn't been red since?'<br>
<br>
CCCCRRRAAASSHHHHH<br>
<br>
A high pitched scream pierced the nigh air. Munz sat bolt upright. His young face pale with a knowing horror. Eight, maybe nine years old. Munz's mandolin sat beside his bed. Polished as ever. Sure enough, there was a tarnished dagger underneath my pillow. Stolen from the shop in Quenos.<br>
<br>
SSSMMMMAACCKKKK<br>
<br>
"NNOOOOOO?uuuuhhhhphh"<br>
<br>
THUDD<br>
<br>
Munz was already at the door, glancing back at me urgently.<br>
<br>
I already knew what would happen, what was waiting on the other side of that door. And what it would do to us. But I was already out of my bed and Munz had opened the door, dashing out into the mayhem.<br>
<br>
"LEAVE HER ALONE!!!" Munz yelled. A massive fist bashed him in the jaw. Sending him across the room, land next to mother.<br>
<br>
Bloodied lip and swollen jaw,<br>
<br>
?the loving touch of her husband.<br>
<br>
Furniture was strewn about the room? the rug slid off the side?a chair broken into kindling? dishes broken and smashed.. ..a leg broken off the table. Bottles of beer strewn about the floor.<br>
<br>
Minz was a second behind his twin?but no battle cry erupted from him. Rushing toward his father?arm held high?just catching the terrified glint in his mothers eye as the tiny dagger he held sunk into his fathers thigh.<br>
<br>
RRRRRRRAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRR!!<br>
<br>
He yelled out more in fury than pain.<br>
<br>
The doubled up fists of his father came hurtling down onto his shoulder? knocking him to the floor with a solid whack..<br>
<br>
Eyes clouded<br>
<br>
A scream?mother? again? solid smacking sound and a cry of pain.<br>
<br>
"SOOO YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED NOT TO PLAY WITH KNIVES BOY!!!" A hand grabbed his hair, hauling him upward. His eyes cleared just enough to see Munz help Mom out the door. "THAT'S RIGHT?YOU GIRLS RUN ALONG WHIL MINZ AND I TALK MAN TO MAN!!"<br>
<br>
Minz barley saw the fist as it rushed towards his face?sending a shot of pain though him.. sending him flying across the room.<br>
<br>
"GET UP BOY!!! I AIN'T DONE WITH YOU YET!!!" A boot met his torso. "UP!! LOOSER!" Another kick... this time to his back. He was rolling it seemed.<br>
<br>
"USELESS PIECE OF TRASH!!!"<br>
<br>
Boot.<br>
<br>
"WORTHLESS WASTE OF BREATH!!!"<br>
<br>
Boot<br>
<br>
"PATHETIC PIECE OF FILTH!!!"<br>
<br>
BOOT!!<br>
<br>
He was in a corner now. "UPP!!" Hands hauled him up, and he saw his father. Towering over him. Eyes red with alcohol and fury. Blood trickling down his leg. Tiny blade still embedded deeply. "HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO PLAY WITH KNIVES." He bellowed. Wrenching the dagger from his leg as an exclamation point. "Well this time boy," he hisses "you'll not forget."<br>
<br>
His fathers meaty hand tore off the boy's nightshirt. Pale hairless chest. Minz watched as his father pressed the blade to his sternum? sinking it beneath the skin? a thick stream of blood trickling down his abdomen.<br>
<br>
It took a moment for the pain to reach him? as if his mind couldn't comprehend what was happening. But the searing sting of the blade bit into him, cutting to the bone. And he screamed out horrifically as his father dragged it down to his belly.<br>
<br>
Slicing him open.<br>
<br>
"THERE! THAT'LL TEACHYA!!"<br>
<br>
Minz slumped to the wooden floor.<br>
<br>
"Can't for get to take the TRASH out now, can I?" he heard his father mutter. A rough hand grabbed his arm?dragging him across the littered floor ?splinters and shards of glass dug into him while the his wound stretched open painfully. The barbarian hoisted him up and tossed him easily out the door. Throwing the tiny dagger after him.<br>
<br>
Slamming the door shut behind him.<br>

And... well it was twisted a bit sick, but compelling none the less. A view into maddness if you will.<br>
<br>
Empty eyes stare at the sun?burnt retina...lost in a horrific dreamscape of lost memories and nightmares.<br>
<br>
?all around him the field stretched on. Criss crossing trials of earth, plowed in a jumbled, crazy manner. Weaving in and out of each other. Always strait as an arrow, yet always moving.<br>
<br>
At his hip, a bag full of seed. Seeming to undulate without moving.<br>
<br>
He reached into the bag, grab a hand full to sow.<br>
<br>
Pain seared his skin. Burning his flesh black. Yet he did not flinch. Tossing the seed to the earth around him?tiny bursts of flame shimmering as they floated in slow motion the ground.<br>
<br>
Flames shot up all around him as the first flicker reached the ground. The barren landscape now filled with cascades of flame.<br>
<br>
?a harvest of fire?<br>
<br>
He spread his arms wide?screaming in agony as the tongues of heat licked his body.<br>
<br>
..rising off the ground in an updraft of shimmering heat?willing himself forward across the pyric field?<br>
<br>
His father stared to him ?face split with pride and hatred?<br>
<br>
Minz swung low over the old youth?raining acidic leaves of flame over him?laughing as the man twisted and fell in agony?breathing in deeply the sick sweet smell of burnt flesh?<br>
<br>
?a lyric sing song voice called out to him ? his mother?gazing at him alluringly...demure heavy lidded eyes full of lust?he swooped down cradling her in his arms?kissing her hungrily as her thin clothing burnt off?sailing to the sky in smoldering ashes.<br>
<br>
She giggled wickedly?wrapping her legs about her son's waist?grinding her hips to his pelvis?the son pressing himself to whence he came?crying out loudly?screaming in agony and ecstasy as the burst into flames from the inside out?<br>
<br>
?the world grew white hot?all definition lost?nothing but ?. searing? endless ecstasy?.<br>
<br>
Minz threw himself into it?<br>
<br>
giving himself up to the kiln of eternity<br>
<br>
<cough cough><br>
<br>
The water felt wrong in his mouth?shade? a quiet familiar voice?shapes and colors melding out of focus.<br>
<br>
He was alive?<br>

One of those nights where not a star pierces the evening sky.<br>
<br>
...tried to sit up... "ohhhhhh." Aching mucsles refused to comply with his request.<br>
<br>
There was a rustling near him. A damp cloth blotted his forehead<br>
<br>
He flinched away from the touch...taking a sharp breath.<br>
<br>
"Easy friend...easy." The voice seemed float out of the ether<br>
<br>
He threw his head form one side to the other weakly...frantically. Even in the darkest of nights they should be visable. Nothing!! Not a single flicker of anything...unseen...<br>
<br>
"Whh who's there??" The rogue called out.<br>
<br>
"Rest easy Minz, you've been through a lot. Wasn't sure you'd make it to be honest. Its Sylavn. Jinhizu and Rach are nearby. Here, water...take a sip." A hand slipped behing his head, raising it up a bit and a cup was put to his lips. Still he saw nothing. The water was cool, soathing his sore throat. "As soon as you're strong enough, we'll get you out of this heat. Maybe after the sun goes down."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Sun?? Wha?" Minz asked after coughing up the water<br>
<br>
"Huh? You still with me Minz?" Sylavn asked. Blotting the rogues face again.<br>
<br>
"The sun goes down?? Its night...isn't it??" Minz felt the wave a bit over his face. "Sylavn?"<br>
<br>
"Uhh... No Minz... its day?"<br>

<br>
The possibility of being blind. . .<br>
<br>
"gods" he muttered. Softly pleading before drifting back into the feverish, haunted sleep.<br>
<br>
. . . he was in the hills above his childhood home. . . he could navigate these woods with his eyes closed. Crouching behind a slender elm tree. Wrapped in the shadows he had grown to know. He wore a pair of rough denim pants, torn in spots from the snatching and grabbing brambles of the woods.<br>
<br>
A woolen vest hung loosely on his shoulders. Stolen from an unwary traveler.<br>
<br>
His small dagger tied to his ankle with two pliable vines.<br>
<br>
Blood still seeped from the wound on his chest.<br>
<br>
It had been three days since he ran off. Three days since he had been tossed away as trash.<br>
<br>
Three days of living in the woods around his home. Eating berries and what ever else he could find. He dare not light a fire. Bandits, thieve and all sorts of other creatures who would have no compunction about finishing his fathers work inhabited these woods.<br>
<br>
Ahead of him was the clearing his mother came to pray at some times. A rough circle some 15 feet across. A large slab of stone set just off center. On it were carved marking of some old meaning. Worn and faded. But mother knew them well.<br>
<br>
She was there now. Kneeling in fervent prayer. She'd been there the better part of two days.<br>
<br>
She and Munz had gone to Qeynos that night. She returned in the morn . . . alone. Likely leaving Munz with an old friend. Minz had watched her from the field, hiding among the corn stalks. She went in and left quickly. His father had followed her out . . . pleading with her. But she never even looked at him.<br>
<br>
Minz followed her to the circle, and had stayed close ever since.<br>
<br>
Watching over his mother. . .prone in his own vigil. . . his mother praying in that old language she knew.<br>
<br>
<br>
A thrashing of the woods drew his attention. . . a bear? No, a bear wouldn't be so loud.<br>
<br>
<br>
He snatched the dagger from his ankle as soon as he heard the voice . . . his fathers bellow echoed through the trees.<br>
<br>
He stopped at the circles edge, looking forlorn. Long face . . . dark reddened eyes sunk into his head . . . thick arms hanging limply at his sides. "Nhamine. . . " he almost whisper. ". . .love . . .? . . . I . . . I am sorry." His head dropped. . .chin meeting his chest in a pitiful expression of remorse. " . . .Nhamine . . . please . . . ohhh gods please. . . " A quiet sob escaping the hulking man's lips.<br>
<br>
Young Minz stared. . . mesmerized. His father? This was not the man he knew.<br>
<br>
The movement startled him. Mom raised her head, looking toward dad. From where he hid he couldn't see her face. Just her back.<br>
<br>
Slowly. . . deliberately she stood. Holding her hand out to her husband. For the first time in days, he saw his mother's face.<br>
<br>
Pristine and perfect.<br>
<br>
Dad looked at her confused for a moment. Looking at his feet. No. Looking at the earth in front of his feet.<br>
<br>
The boundary of the circle.<br>
<br>
Then back at his wife. Taking a step forward, planting his foot firmly. Another step and he was in front of her . . . his massive hand slipping into hers.<br>
<br>
"Ohhh Nhamine, I am sorry," he sobbed. Dropping to his knees. Wrapping his arms about her waist. His head nearly at her chin. She held him as he sobbed uncontrollably. Saying "I'm sorry" over and over again.<br>
<br>
The din of the woods seemed to grow a little louder<br>
<br>
Finally the spasms of sorrow seemed to ebb in the man's body He gazed up at her. They spoke softly. For a long time.<br>
<br>
He couldn't quite hear them, no matter how much he tried.<br>
<br>
A weak smile from dad.<br>
<br>
A warm loving one from mom.<br>
<br>
The forest seemed to quiet again and he could hear them.<br>
<br>
". . . should not have been out here alone Nhamine. You know the bandits are about." Thimz said to his wife. Deep voice some how softer, almost quaking.<br>
<br>
She smiled at her husband, stroking his face softly. Gazing down on him. "Husband, I was never alone." A quizzical look ran across the barbarian's face. "Minz is about," she whispered. "He has been watching over me. Over there." She looked directly at him, nodding.<br>
<br>
The shock of it made him fumble. Falling back.<br>
<br>
"Come on out little shadow. Come on." She piped in her sweet elven voice. He stepped out from behind the tree.<br>
<br>
Jaw agape.<br>
<br>
Mom smiles so warmly. "My little shadow and protector." He walked toward the two hesitantly. A look of shock was on his fathers face.<br>
<br>
"You have not. . .? His chest. . .?" Dad managed to stutter out. Minz looked down, halting where he stood.<br>
<br>
Her soft hand pulled Thimz' eyes to hers. "Husband. You are the only one who can heal his wounds. Not I."<br>
<br>
The man gazed at her a moment, the dropped his head solemnly. Standing, he covered the short distance between he and his son in a single step. Towering over the boy. Dropping to one knee. He whisper. "Son, I am sorry. I love you." He touched a finger to the boy's chest, running it down parallel to the long gash. "Your mother and I have talked. This will never happen again. Never."<br>
<br>
Minz's lip quivered. And his throat ached with a sudden piercing agony. Tears burst from him and he was in his father's arms. He was whispering to him. Soft consoling words. He felt himself being lifted.<br>
<br>
Cradled in mighty arms.<br>
<br>
Three nights of no sleep finally catching up to him.<br>
<br>
He awoke in his bed.<br>
<br>
It was dark.<br>
<br>
A rough hand caressed his face. His father sat in a chair next to him. "Shhhh. Go back to sleep boy. You're a good boy. Takin good care of your momma. Momma's lil shadow. You make me proud son. Now rest." Minz closed his eyes.<br>
<br>
The bandage was still there. . .<br>
<br>
. . .damp with blood.<br>
<br>
But things were healing.<br>
