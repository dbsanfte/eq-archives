<br>
Harm are terrible? let me tell you about the last time I had dealings with them.<br>
<br>
Savage were doing a Hate raid and we ran into all sorts of problems which caused loads of delays. This meant that we were well behind schedule and at 6am (our time) we still had Innoruuk to do. The problem with this was Leldil (the monk) and I were exhasuted and we also had no clue as too how to pull Innoruuk. Quite frankly we just wanted to go to bed and most of the raid had retired allready, but the rest wanted to do Inny. We hadn't enough people but at that time a Harmonium Wizard asked to come up to TP a Rogue for his book. We were happy with that and up they came. As the Rogue went for his book, we were chatting with the wizzy and he suggested asking a certain guild to help us and offered to TP them up. When we said that we didn't have the means to pull (basically as we were at the point of wanting to quit, I was cursing the people who wanted to stay) that was a different thing alltogether. The wizzy helped TP the reserves up then logged of his wiz and brought on his Monk.<br>
<br>
So with our new force and the Monk/Wizzy and Leldil pulling the top floor was cleared. We moved up, took out Innoruuk and cheered. Now the bad news...a rogue pathing pet managed to train us just after we killed Innoruuk and almost caused a complete wipe-out. In this time the Harmonium Monk/Wizzy remembered to loot all of the dropable items on Innoruuk. This meant that, none of them rotted before the raid teams were rezzed back and could roll for them (1 no-drop item rotted <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) fairly.<br>
<br>
So you can see, with members like that, does this sound like the guild that some of you seem to be worried about?  <p>Fablar Malamishka<br>

There was no way you could've gotten everyone rezzed and rolling in time to loot - unless this was after they made the change that the high level corpses stay around longer?  I was &quot;leading&quot; in the NEC once when SWC ate it hard and all people went down.  One cleric camped out before the cleric of innoruuk went down which happened to have an ethereal mist breastplate on it - a cleric i knew in the NEC asked me if he should go loot, I told him go for it and I'll take any blame if they get pissy.  When they finally got back together they said it was a good call and they were happy for the cleric that got it.  <br>
<br>
  Although I think a god's corpse stays around longer....so what they did was wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wraine>Wraine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/31/00 6:41:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1877.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tarew Marr and Povar to split</span><hr size=1> Depending on when this was, Inno has a 30 minute rot time now.<br>

I wasn't having a go, I was commending how he played for the whole evening. The bad rep comments are sarcasm directed at the people who have bad-mouthed this guild without knowledge of the players in it.<br>
<br>
I thought this was obvious in my post, but .... well, it's a bad communication medium. /shrug<br>
<br>
[EDIT]Ahhhh.....just noticed my typo (I wrote non-drop instead of dropable). I can see the confusion my post caused now. Just to make 100% sure, I was commending the Harmonium player on how well he played, and helped all of us (whom he didn't know) for a few hours to acheive something that we couldn't have otherwise.<br>

<br>
1. They're very good, and people are jealous<br>
2. They don't like &quot;Reservation&quot; systems, and do things on a first come-first serve basis. They're usually first come, so they're also first-served.<br>
3. Their leader has a penchant for being an @#%$ when it benefits him or his guild. This is a good and bad thing in some respects.<br>
4. They won the warrior and rogue BoB tourneys with people &quot;botting&quot; the winners. This I don't really agree with but worse things have been done.<br>
<br>
All in all, are they my favorite people? No. Do I have friends in the guild? Yes. I'd say I like a lot of them individually, but when they get together as Harmonium I tend not to like them.<br>
<br>
However, that doesn't mean I think they have a bad reputation. I think even people who don't like them respect them. <p>Bedrenken Pigsticker<BR>

Listen to Bedrenken. He hates me with a passion, not because I am a deliberate @#%$, jerk, etc. 99% of what you read and hear are blatent and unfounded lies, the price of large, long lived, and successful guilds. <br>
<br>
I lead my guild for one reason, its what I do. I am a natural leader and I will do whatever I deem in the best interest of my friends and guildmates. After all, is that not the job of a leader? <br>
<br>
Love me or hate me, it matters not to me. The only opinions which matter to me are those which I call friends. Bedrenken and his guild have had numerous confrontations with Harmonium and yet still an underlying understanding of where the behavior comes from. If you want to be an &quot;uber&quot; guild you cannot be the nice guy all the time, to get things done sometimes someone has to be an @#%$ and most of the time there are several on both sides. I disagree with not one word Bedrenken said it is the truth, and I believe every player out there who belongs to a large guild or ever has understands where this comes from. It is not to be a jerk, not to be mean or hog the mobs/items whatever.. its to lead a group of people to doing exceptional things in this game and have fun in the process, sue me.<br>
<br>
People who spend the time to talk to me in a civil manner will learn that I am not nearly as bad as some would make me out to be. An example of this are people I have never heard from before such as Fablar. I have seen her about but never heard a word from her nor of these accusations until this evening. Just dont be clouded by the people who talk the most and post the most, those are people with personal vendettas and jealousy issues, and in many cases those who were denied acceptance to Harmonium.<br>
<br>
If people would like to discuss anything I have said I am always more than willing just drop me an email and you would be suprised how rumors and facts differ.<br>

<br>
The ratio of jerks to cool people on TM is higher than I would have ever thought possible.<br>
<br>
I know only one thing, it can't possibly be any worse on the new server.<br>
<br>
I'll miss some friends on TM when I go but I won't miss the 1000+ assmonkeys that dominate the server.<br>
