There just wasn't that much in the film, it didn't do anything, the Jedi simply turned up to get semi-slaughtered (I hope to christ there is a *little* better justification in Ep. 3). Haven't these fuckers ever heard of strategic bombing instead of sending your elite troops in to get slaughtered ? <br><br>Ugh, then there was the entire Count Dooku thing. WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE. It was nearly *great* but Lucas missed a massive opportunity to make the plot as good as Empire. First thing Dooku says to Kenobi - &quot;a Sith Lord is controlling the senate, help me destroy them&quot;. <br><br>What a mind fuck that could have been - if the Jedi were destroyed FIGHTING FOR THE WRONG SIDE. That would explain everything - Yoda retreating into exile, the complete alienation of the Jedi from the universe. It would HAVE BEEN FUCKING GREAT. <br><br>But no, Dooku ends up with the Emporer and its all irrelevant, everything they do is doomed, without choices. God, this *REALLY* PISSES ME OFF. ANY STUPID IDIOT could have told Lucas &quot;George, go on, make them fight for the wrong side&quot;. But no, the sycophants he must surround himself with are all probably fawning over it and &quot;great show George, who needs a plot or story or any reason for actions&quot;. <br><br>And I haven't finished yet. <br><br>How dumb is that Portman character. She knows Skywalker is already on the Dark Side - even if its the &quot;Secret Squirrel Club&quot;, any advanced technological society ends up with information like that - Hate makes you a Bad Jedi - leaking out. Can't these supposed Jedi realise that Skywalker is fucked in the head? Supposedly they can sense the Dark Side but they can't sense the Emporer and they can't detect Skywalker. Surely, one action of Hate is all it takes - that was the entire trauma of Episode 6, Luke being unable to do a single action - yet Anakin has done shit over and over and over. It's not suble, it's fucked in the head and it competely contradicts and destroys everything that should be on screen. <br><br>I quite liked the Phantom Menace. It was decent, plotted and the actions happened for a reason. The whole &quot;phantom&quot; aspect where the fight was a distraction to the real politics of the Emporer taking control was *great* and most people missed it. In this part, the political maneuvering is secondary and the plot opportunities completely fucking missed. <br><br>Lucas should never have done it. Much as Episode One was enjoyable he is doubling back on himself and destroying the whole mythos now. He is undermining the very universe he supposedly wants to preserve. Making the films without a complete three story arc has to be the biggest mistake in hte history of storytelling. <br><br>That famous quote from AICN - &quot;George Lucas raped my childhood?&quot;, well maybe not but he fucked up my morning and that's enough reason for me. <br><br>Problem is that the &quot;plot&quot; is crap.  It portrays a no-win situation and places *far* too much guile at the hands of the Emporer.  You *admire* him.  But it is also *ALL OVER AT EPISODE ONE*.  There is no point.<br><br>If Dooku *was* a genuine rebel pitching against the Emporer then there would be a real drama to the events.  As it stands you are just watching a meaningless telling of events, there is no story or plot, it's simply a procession of incidents with nothing more involved going on.<br><br>There was a hell of a lot of promise in Episode One, a tremendous amount.  Yet it has been compeltely burnt and turned into an uninvolved, pointless (lack of) drama.<br><br>I mean, think about it this way.  As things stand the Republic *and* the Jedi are worthless wastes of space.  The Jedi order places their monkly code ahead of the humanity of the universe and the Republic is a nonsense talking shop.  It *needs* the Emporer.  The Emporer is a GOOD THING!  How fucking idiotic is that?<br><br>The Emporer doesn't allow slavery, he doesn't let people die and be servile while the politicians chat away.  He doesn't allow strict codecs to prevent progress.  Think of all the employment that Tiberium Industries is about to create, think of the benefits that Imperial control of renegade systems such as Tatooine will bring about.<br><br>Dark Side, Light Side, either can be good &quot;from a certain point of view&quot;.<br><br>The Imperials are the FUCKING GOOD GUYS.

I dont think you really thought about the movie enough to understand how deep the plot really goes.<br><br>The jedi are getting &quot;played&quot; by the Sith. The sith are seeking to control the universe/galaxy in a dictatorship, but right now, the republic is represented as a democracy. So the sith go and build an army of clones, and an army of robots to basically fight each other.                                                        The entire reason they do this, is because the Jedi are the only &quot;army&quot; or peace keeping force in the galaxy. With the jedi there is no need to have an army. The sith create this conflict in order to force the power of the senate into one mans hands, which is Palpatine (the Evil Emperor that we know in ESB and RoTJ).<br><br>Theres more to it than that tho. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Also.. did anyone notice the parallels between Episode2 and ESB? in both movies our hero loses his hand/arm. A loss of humanity, per se'.<br><br>What we should see in Episode 3, is Anakin's suduction to the dark side of the force. Luke also faces his own seduction in Episode 6., RoTJ, but resists it, and saves his father. This is obviously going to be a parrallel between akanin's inablilty to resist the temptation to turn to the dark side in Episode 3.<br><br>my2cp. <p><IMG SRC=> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uradahr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Radahr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/16/02 12:48:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=899.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Ep 2 Rant - N.B. ***SPOILERS PRESENT***</span><hr size=1> Just came back from seeing Clones. <br><br>WHY OH WHY????

Someone that has acting ability. I mean, jeez, this guy makes Al Gore look like a high-personality charmer that literally oozez Don Juan hip ego. <br><br>Second, re-edit ALL the dialog between Portman and Aniken. The verbal exchanges are clipped and forced through the whole movie. It's actually painful. Let the supposed 'love thread' develop on it's own, with more flow. Take at least half of Anakin's dialog time and give it to Mace and Yoda. Expand the actual explanation of the storyline more. And let Natalie show more skin, she really looks good in the white lycra  <br><br>Overall, I give it two stars, and that's generous....thank yoda. <br><br>Only other problem is the realization that Yoda has been pulling my chain for 25 years.

I don't really blame the actors for being stiff. I'm sure its hard as hell to act when your told you have to be looking, standing, sitting this way and that as this piticualar time plus you have to remember your dialog. Thats not acting. Thats being a damned puppet... <br>Lucas needs to go back to his grass roots and throw all this CGI crap out the window. Thats what made the original SW movies so awesome. You knew they made a life sized version of the Falcon. You knew they made a HUGE ATST for the RTJ. <br>The fact that they put some much time into making these HUGE set peices only to blow them up was awesome. It made the movies as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>EPI and EPII have a plasticy stiff feeling to them and it just isn't the same. technology is great and wonderfull and all, but you just can't replace complete set pieces with it...<br><br>Imagen this. <br>Your told by lucas that your in a huge Space doc with ships buzzing around everywhere. And you have to walk from point A to point B. Ok easy enuff... <br>But wait, Oh yeah after the fact we're going to add in some boxes that aren't there now and also a worker that you can't see... <br>We'll if you were acting and you could see the worker and boxes a normal person is going to glance at them as they pass, its a natrual reaction. With out this glance, the scene looses alot of the realisim that it once might have had.

You sound like a David Lynch fanbois dismissing any criticism of the piece of SHIT that was Mulholland Drive with a &quot;you didn't understand&quot; counter.

The sith are seeking to control the universe/galaxy in a dictatorship, but right now, the republic is represented as a democracy. So the sith go and build an army of clones, and an army of robots to basically fight each other. The entire reason they do this, is because the Jedi are the only &quot;army&quot; or peace keeping force in the galaxy. With the jedi there is no need to have an army. The sith create this conflict in order to force the power of the senate into one mans hands, which is Palpatine (the Evil Emperor that we know in ESB and RoTJ).<br></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Who is arguing this?  The whole point of my post was that IT IS ALL DECIDED IN ACT ONE (Episode one).  That means that any storytelling past Act one is pointless.  Wasted.
