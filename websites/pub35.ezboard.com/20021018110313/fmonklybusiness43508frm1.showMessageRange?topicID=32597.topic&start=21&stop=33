Here's my thoughts on it... The human was giving you plans to take to the Giants, most likely war plans. On the way to Kael you are confronted by a CoV ally dragon aka wurm who is suppose to stop you at all costs. You kill him and pass onward to Kael. Enter Kael and turn the note &quot;war plans&quot; over to the named Giant only to be laughed at as he runs to the Tormax room. For us he despawned on the Ramp leading up to the Tormax Throne room.<br>
<br>
It's one of 2 things IMO...<br>
<br>
1. Either the script failed at the Bridge and the Giant was suppose to spawn Tormax for additional Questing. This seems not the case though cause you figure the GM running it would either restart it or at least send you a tell saying the quest bugged out with a script error, check back later. We did notice though that Kael crashed about 3 to 5 times last night after this event. Could be related or could have been an issue with the ongoing /chat channel problems.<br>
<br>
2. This is a mini event tided to the large war that is suppose to take place between the Giants and the CoV in Western Waste soon. This is the more viable explaination that I can come up with. I figure over the next few weeks we will be running into a lot of mini events such as this with the return of Rallos Zek and Vulak/the CoV army taking over Sleepers Tomb, etc. I don't exactly have all the story details but my hunch is that this is where they are heading with it. Maybe someone with more of the story and lore background can add to this theory. /shrug <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=255554"><img src="http://www.adventurersanon.com/images/sigs/hikitsu.gif" border="0"></a>

I found him(human monk outside Thurg) and told him I would help him. He gave me a sealed note and a diamond to take to Captain Drovag or something in Kael.<br>
<br>
When I zoned into EQ and was running to Kael, I was attacked by a weak dragon as mentioned above and upon killing him, looted Reinforced Dragonhorn Boots.<br>
<br>
Once in Kael, I found the Captain and handed him the diamond and sealed note. He then told me as my reward to take this and promptly handed the diamond back to me. Then he took off for Tormax who he said he needed to take the note to and depopped. Tormax was not even up BTW.<br>
<br>
Although the reward was nothing to speak of, it was fun nonetheless.<br>

<br>
One of them consisted of 5 GM's in the form of Drolvargs, with names like Rover, Phido, etc... We killed them all, and I heard one of them actually dropped a Runed Bolster Belt. I didn't get the kill on any of them, too many weezards around.<br>
<br>
The other had the GM's in the form of named Drachnids, there was even a special version of Queen Drachnia. I was shouting throughout the zone about rallying to defeat the evil creatures, and whatnot, but I was eventually killed by the queen, who hit for 250 and must have had about 32k HP. However, I did not lose exp, of course, and the GM ressed me once all the spiders were dead. I was then given a Crystalline Torque (AC 12, 0.0lbs, neck slot) for my good roleplaying. Sure, I didn't need the thing, but it was a nice gift for a friend of mine.<br>
<br>
I also saw an event in SK once where the GM's spawned at least 50 Tesch'Mas Gnolls, and let them loose at the aviak treehouse. Man, so many lowbies died there... Fortunately, I was able to slaughter a good portion of the gnolls, personaly, and save the day. I don't think there were any rewards at all, for that one... Unless you consider losing exp a reward.<br>
<br>
But yeah, most GM events are a waste of time, and only seem to succeed in killing droves of lowbies. It's a shame, too. <p><center>Argond Valiantfist<br>Grandmaster Geezer of Morell-Thule<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133460>Magelo Profile</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umackdaddymonky.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MackDaddyMonky</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/1/02 12:30:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32597.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GM event</span><hr size=1> only GM event I was a part of was back when I was lvl 24 fighting gnolls in SK.<br>

there was literally 400+ skeletons runnin around SK attacking people.<br>
then in the aviak house undead cyclopses startin poppin.<br>
that was prolly the best train I ever had.<br>
I was runnin around the zone with like 20+ undead cyclopses after me.it was pretty funny.<br>
