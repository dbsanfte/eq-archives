<br>
You lose out on dragonfang and the bonus against chain armor, but you will be in great shape against casters, archers and other assassins.  Slash has much better styles than thrust with the exception of dragonfang.  If you go full slash the amethyst slash/diamond slash combo is much better than gar/AH as an anytime chain.<br>
<br>
Anothing thing to look at is that all the player crafter thrust weapons at high level are either slow, or low dps.  There is not a good high level fast thrust weapon to use.  With slash you can get crafted Jambiya's which are 16.5dps and 2.5 speed.  To get around 16dps with thrust you get stuck with a speed of 3.2 or something like that.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/22/02 10:15:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3784.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Briton Slash infiltrator??</span><hr size=1> You would think there are more 50 Thrust Infiltrators out there.

<br>
id especially go this route if your going to play on andred/mordred.<br>
<br>
worst case you can always change your stats over later.<br>
<br>
in the end,its still just personal choice though.<br>
<br>
you really dont lose anything,as you can level up via slash,which is eaiser anyway,then switch to thrust for dragonfang down the road.<br>

They also, as mentioned before, have a better choice of weaponry (but lose out on some special assassin weapons like bladeturn stilletos).  A Slash infiltrator can perf with a 3.9 bastard sword playermade for highest cap results.<br>
<br>
Thrust infiltrators have inferiour offensive styles and thier weapons are usually a good .1 behind the dps scale (but faster per dps than thier slash counterparts - sans jamybias).    Thrusters end up having to fight defensively with evade styles, and dragonfang is really the only viable option for such a style.  Thrust infiltrators can perf with a 3.7 speed player made gladius for thier highest results, which will be less than the 3.9 bastard sword.<br>
<br>
Basically a slash infiltrator is going to try to flip out and cut your head off like its nothing, and a thrust infiltrator is going to turtle up into fetal position until they evade, then stun you and then cut your head off while you cant hit them.  <br>
<br>
in terms of attack bonus:<br>
<br>
Slashers will do better than thrusters against assassins, archers, Light tanks (zerker blademaster), bards (not skalds).<br>
<br>
Slashers will do the same against Heroes, Champions, Druids, Wardens, cloth casters.<br>
<br>
Slashers will do poorly against warriors, healers, thanes, skalds, and shaman - although you should be able to kill a shaman blindfolded with a staff, IF you can get them to leave the portal keep... so they really dont count for much.<br>
<br>
1 of the 7 classes a slasher does better against than a thruster has insta mez (bards).  <br>
<br>
2 of the 5 classes that a thrust does better against than a slasher has insta mez (healer, skald).  Healers also have insta stun, and insta heals, as well as self buffs.<br>
<br>
Both classes have to deal with the same thing vs neutral targerts so no need to list them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uservethemachine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ServeTheMachine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 11:10:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3784.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> If you're playing a Slash inf on the PvP servers...one other thing to remember.

If you roll a briton and put 10 into str and 10 into dex, at lvl 50 your str will be 85 and dex 115.  Won't your weapon skill be much lower then a thrust briton or saracen?  <br>
<br>
Sure, you can add str w/ items, but every well equiped inf has their stats from items at or near their cap throughout their careers.  At lvl 50 there is a 75 cap on item bonuses, so your str will still lag behind your dex by 30 points.<br>
<br>
P.S.
