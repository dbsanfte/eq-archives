<br>
It seems that in addition to this new content the recently revised Lost Temple of Cazic Thule is also a Legends-only service:<br>
<br>
From Caster's Realm:<br>
<br>
&quot;What sort of new stuff can we expect? <br>
<br>
Well Cazic-Thule has already been totally redone. We aren't going to redo the whole world, but we will be augmenting it to make it more interesting and challenging. <br>
<br>
How long will new content stay on Legends before going to regular servers? <br>
<br>
Right now we are looking at it being approximately 3 months. This may increase or decrease as we go along. Some things, such as the completion of the Bazaar, will go live on all servers at once. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Clearly the Legends customers are going to be getting their money's worth.  Personally I am annoyed that new content is being generated for this service instead of being used on the existing servers.  Dynamic GM support is one thing, but having developers who generate non-dynamic content exclusive to one server is very annoying for those of us who chose to not leave friends behind on our home servers.<br>
<br>
I would probably pay for a Legends-like level of service if it allowed me to access non-dynamic new content without having to leave my home server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubenolas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Benolas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/25/02 7:18:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Cazic Thule exclusive to the Legend's Server(s)</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
Anyways, as they have re-stated several times, content such as this will filter down to the regular servers after a period of time.<br>
<br>
Whether you like it or not, that is how it is going to be.  While some people may feel that their $10.00 a month entitles them to all that a bag of chips, those paying 4x might disagree.<br>
<br>
Anyways, one way to look at it is that the Legends Server will get a lot of bugs worked out of changes before they hit the other servers.  This will limit the ability to exploit bugs, drops and other issues that usually go with new zones and items, though.  Guess it is all a trade-off.<br>

I remember exploring the uncharted parts of the original EQ.  I remember stumbling on Karnor's Castle the first day Kunark was live and when no one was there.  I remember figuring out the Sebilis key-quest and exploring a whole new dungeon full of frogloks.  I remember doing the Charasis key quest and exploring THAT when its was shiny and new.<br>
<br>
I was the first to take the ship to Velious,  I was waiting for the portals to open to Luclin...<br>
<br>
Now all new content will come into the game only on Legends servers and even if I manage to avoid reading spoilers myself, when these zones make the transition to LIVE servers all the loot will be spoiled and on the first day people will have maps in hand and already be calling out camps!   Nothing like finding the secret passage deep in the ancient crypt only to find a group of 6 people camping behind it and rolling on loot.<br>

Addition  of a whole new continent is always in the form of expansion, only the beta testers can see them before we do, Legend players or not.<br>

because SOE invested money into legends before the regular monthly income started?  Ahhh, so that money should have gone to our dev?  Thats right... I forgot that 100% of our $10 is to be used on our service, and SOE has no right to profit or to spend some on other ventures.<br>

Hope this will get fixed and is not working as intended. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19892" target="_new">Kiladrain 60 Assassin, Phantom Raiders, Bertox</a>

They don't let Beta Testers see ALL of it. In Luclin you'de be surprised how much content wasn't beta tested and suddenly was part of the zones we were testing 2-3 months. <p>Dazzler Twodirks<br>

<br>
I mean think about it...a bunch of people are now paying more money than ever...anyone else think that Verant might turn some of that into development money to add new content to the regular servers? (after of course it goes to legends)  We could be looking at new content, faster, and with fewer bugs, because a select group of people are willing to put up the cash. I for one are more than willing to pay my $10 and ride on their coattails.<br>
