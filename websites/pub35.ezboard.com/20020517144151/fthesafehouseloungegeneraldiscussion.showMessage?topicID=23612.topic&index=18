<br>
This is a place that Luclin does pretty well in.  Va'dyn, Servitor, the Umbral mobs, and a few other mobs like them provide some raid content accessible by most any guild.  However, the loot on these encounters varies quite a bit.  Some of it is junk, others of it is too good for what they are dropping off.<br>
<br>
Spell drops needs some adjusting.  Mainly, the level 60 int caster spells need to be made more accessible outside of Srae.<br>
<br>
Waiting for ports up sucks.  Not as bad as the 30 minutes for boats, but come on, could have done 5-7 minutes easy.  Let druids port people up and give wizards ports to Seru and Katta.  After all, it's the combine empire, don't you think they'd have a port spell to get home?  Also, who cares about the bloody spires... give us a way to NRO/Nektulos and back.  EC is the hub on buying and selling for most servers.  Let us get there.<br>
<br>
AA I like.  But it does create problems.  Basically, even though they aren't levels, you now need AA to be all that you can be.  So everyone is levelling their mains again.  That's a lot of 60s gathering xp and not many places to go.<br>
<br>
A few zones need adjusting.  Griegs would benefit nicely from a few named camps and a few more mini-bosses of about the level of the Servitor.  Right now, this zone is empty most of the time.  Akheva needs to be seriously looked at, both at the rate at which it's nameds spawn and the fact that they rarely drop anything.  It also needs some nice nameds/loot placed in deep, to encourage good single groups to go in and get xp/loot from there.  As is, it supports 1-2 groups xp'ing unless someone is feeling frisky enough to risk the traps.  The Deep needs to have it's mobs drop some cash.  It needs to be slightly tweaked as well to make it more desirable to standard xp groups.  Also, how xp works needs to be revamped.  A mob's max hp should impact how much xp you get for it.  This will make level 60 mobs like the Shiknar Royalty worth killing for xp reasons.<br>
<br>
Some ideas are cool.  I like the caller encounter, for instance.  An autopulling camp, if you can keep up, with a chance of some nice loot.  Great idea, well done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utenoroallegro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tenoro Allegro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/6/02 1:18:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What...</span><hr size=1> Content-wise Luclin has failed where Kunark and Velious succeeded.<br>
<br>
But as far as the worst expansion in the game, I beg to differ.<br>
<br>
Some huge bonuses with this expansion were with the new spells.<br>
<br>
Moonfire, Group Aego, Group Focus, KEI, AE mana song, AE resists songs, group haste over cap songs.  MGB on the big buffs helps a lot too.<br>
<br>
AA skills may be unbalanced for some classes (dire charm vs. mage pet), but for other classes they did a lot.  <br>

<br>
I beg to differ, I play a 55 bard on Tarew Marr and I will say this expansion completely sucks for bards. Whereas before luclin any guild that had 4-5 bards could take a bard and put them in each group. And the bard could individually benefit each group and you would build groups around where the bard was and how many you had. We all had a purpose pre Luclin.<br>
<br>
Now Post Luclin you need 1 single 58+ bard (if your under level 58 youre useless) to cover the entire raid for your bard needs. Instead of giving us more use on raids and making us more versatile you now need a single Bard on a raid completly taking away use for bards in guilds. We used to be pretty desirable in Uber guilds as there is a shortage of bards. Now noone wants to be bothered with us.<br>
<br>
Spells: Besides the aforementioned Mistake that is our AE songs, Most of our Luclin spells suck<br>
Level 15 food song:Why the hell do we get a food song? Not only is this song useless but as i write this today the song is accually still broken! Amazing<br>
Level 30 Amplification: A decent song to be sure, but its limitations and lack of really good applications on raids make me not use this till past level 50. This WOULD have made a great song for Targeted resists With our Psalm series of songs+epic stacking+puretone. But unfortunatley due to the AE songs you cant play these Psalm songs becuase they dont stack. Without AE resist songs, this would have made a GRAET song for the group raid bard<br>
Level 39 Kattas song dancing:The dex buff and weapon proc technically should be nice, but any shaman buffs dex better than we can. It just seems thrown in to give bards a dex buff which we were lacking. And without an instrument this songs useless<br>
Level 49 Selos Chorus:Ok, kudos to verant on this one. This is a Great great song, Now we finally have a way to travel quickly through indoor zones. the 2 and a half minute duration is just right for this song. The problem is for the Most part this makes the level 51 travel song uselss. With the level 51 song we got lev speed and invis all in one shot, but the song breaks if you get spotted, leaving you very vulnerable, Now I just proc my SS boots, play this song and cast invis And I have the same effect and I cant get the song dropped for 3 minutes. The level 51 travel song needs to be changed to not drop when your hit and this song will be balanced<br>
<br>
Level 52 battlecry of the Vahshir:This song was nerfed to be group only (yay! Its not AE no more)And it would be a great song except for the fact that its STILL aftre 5 Months Bugged. If you arent wearing a Haste item or you have no haste cast on you, this song will accually SLOW your attacks to nothing. In groups without a chanter thi song is too risky.<br>
<br>
Level 54 56 and 58: AE resist and mana, ive already covered why these songs suck no need to explain again.<br>
<br>
Level 60 Warsong of the Vahshir: Would be good but has the same bug as the level 52 song<br>
<br>
Level 60 Ervaj's lost composition: This song drops where? I rest my case<br>
<br>
AA skills<br>
Singing mastery: would be a GREAT skill for our Psalm resist songs but becuase of the AE resist songs we cant use them<br>
<br>
Instrument Mastery: Cant complain about this skill, if you have an epic its great and can make us Very good soloers. maybe overpowered but I havent been able to try it. If it stacks with drums of the beast, bards can be a force to be reckoned with soloing<br>
<br>
Jam fest:Not bad either, this will make us solo better combined with IM<br>
<br>
Extended notes: Errr since this only affects our group songs id say this is a pretty useless skill as I never have a problem reaching people. Guess it would be ok for people following me when travvelling<br>
<br>
Ambidextery: Gives us a little more melee pop I could see us soloing decent with this combined with IM and epic<br>
<br>
Scribble notes: Useless, a few patches ago we had our mem times doubled so i really dont see how we need this<br>

Loot was few and far between and when it dropped it made a little difference. Spells were also very limited and they offered pretty much the same mana ratio as lower 50s spells did.<br>
<br>
Kunark beefed up melee classes with the gear and the same happened again with Velious. To add insult to injury mob hps were scaled way up and mana limited damage caster became somewhat useless.<br>
<br>
Luclin did add more variety: summoned focus items, nuke criticals, alternate advancement skills, lower resist rates and casters could get some useful loot. That counts for something. <p><hr noshade size=1><font size=1><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14465">Ragbert</a>    / <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14471">Camembert</a>,

<br>
Make the quest for the Vex Thal key as long and boring as you want, but let the other 95% of the population have a chance of getting it, and make the zone itself not some massively insanely end game encounter.  Make us work for the keys but let us all have a chance.<br>
<br>
The &quot;uber&quot; guilds will still be the 1st there, still get the best gear dropped so they will have bragging rights.  But why should the other 95% of the reg EQ population never get to see zones that they pay for?  Sure there is a good population of &quot;uber guilds&quot;, but take away the regulars and theres a lot of money out the door.<br>
<br>
I think doin my VP key was very fun, a little long at time but fun.  I do not go there much at all, just with friends as a tag along with their guild(s), point being, VP is a lot more readily avail to the common player.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that every zone should be avail to every player.  Make us work our butts off....make it a long camp, but give us the chance!! <br>
<br>

<br>
The level 60 songs <br>
<br>
Warsong of the Vahshir increases melee damage output by roughly 12.5 percent of fully hasted values.  That means a lot to rogues/monks and ensures a bard place in every melee group.<br>
<br>
Ervaj's lost composition.  Now that I have instrument mastery 3, I'm draining about 600 mana a pulse.  That is quite significant.<br>
<br>
Other songs worth mentioning - Amplification - adds 90 percent to vocal songs, stacks with epic.  Doing 55 hps &quot;legal&quot; damage shields to a group before mage/druid/potion stacking is very significant.  <br>
<br>
Doing 58 dps before hitting the autoattack key while soloing is also very significant due to AA skills.<br>
<br>
That AE mana song I sing now does about 35 hps regen AE to the raid with AA skills.<br>
<br>
AE songs take up slots vs. dispelling mobs and ensures that buffs will stay up.<br>

Yeah, you're right though, this expansion sucked for bards far worse than a &quot;5 percent and 10 percent stackable haste song not breaking cap that requires a brass instrument&quot; like our Velious songs that have the SAME bug that you described.  (if there are melee in your groups that can't break down and spend 3k for an fbss then there's something wrong)<br>

From a Rogues point of view Luclin blows sucks, eat them, craps them out, eats them again, vomits, et inf.<br>

Ungodly high AC mobs, Laughable AA, other classes taking over our class role, @#%$ Rogue loot.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utenoroallegro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tenoro Allegro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/6/02 11:21:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard point of view</span><hr size=1> Most of those nice weapons and various bracers also drop off the fire and ice nameds in the caves...one groupable and does drop the 11/17 dagger. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usalgurdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salgurdar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/6/02 11:48:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard point of view</span><hr size=1> Spirit of Radir drops Shadow Heart. Not a difficult mob really. Our guild has killed him about 4 times and he yielded the dagger once among other nice loot. However, the Netherbian Swormlord, another triggered mob found in the same cave as the ice spirit, Spirit of Tawro, is level 58-60, triggered by killing the netherbian swarmcaller, then about 20 netherbian ravagers. He drops absolute garbage with those useless damage modifiers on them. The named vampyres in Tenebrous Mountains drop fairly ordinary loot for the level required to kill them. Loot is not very well balanced in Luclin IMO. <p><p><img src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/salgurdar/salgurdar.jpg" usemap="#map" border ="0"><map name="Map">

<br>
Taking five times as long to kill a grimling than a skeleton in the same zone or any mob on other contients when all of them have the same hitpoints and grant the same experience is just a LITTLE screwy, don't you think?<br>
<br>
One thing that is funny to me - did you notice that every positive point that was listed had nothing to do with the content of luclin itself (the zones/quests etc) and just with things that could have been added without requiring expansion zones at all?<br>
<br>
Luclin zones are 100% pure grade A @#%$, there's no nice way of putting it.  EQ Live has a huge task ahead of them to fix things, but they are still led by the same people that produced this junk in the first place and they honestly do not have much to work with.  How exciting can they make a bunch of repeative outdoor zones.  Luclin handed us what, six or eight clones of Lake of ill omen?  Who the hell is it at verant that thinks more guks sebilis and charasis zones is a BAD idea?  <br>
<br>
As a side note, the best new content in the last year is definately the Cazic Thule revamp.  It's better than anything in luclin because it's a dungeon with some uber content, with well tuned risk reward and powerful mobs with a high xp bonus.<br>
<br>
At this point making the timesinks significanly shorter would just piss off the people who already went through them even further.  They don't need to go overboard - only a few SPECIFIC timesinks were overdone.  I mean, you have ssra, where it took a month for the keys to the doors to be put in, another month for the quest for the emperor key to go in, another month for that quest to actually work, and then a month for a mysterous locked door that had no key to be taken away.  But things are working pretty good now - we keyed up our last twenty or so people in under a week.   Ssra is nowhere near as bad for people just entering it as it was for us, that's for damn sure.  Now make the creator as hard as HP/lich and bring all their loot to up to par with ntov please.<br>
<br>
The vex thal key quest is not bad at all EXCEPT for the horribly broken maiden's eye shard - that and acrylia are the only shards that need their drops significantly increased.  The seru encounter is being totally reworked to make the bane weapons actually matter, so we'll see how that goes this week.  The cursed was finally fixed and Emperor Ssra should be next, so as long as they don't screw up and find new ways to break things luclin's uber content should be pretty decent soon. <br>
<br>
The worst problem will be the horridly bad xp zones, which I don't think they can fix. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uparticleboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>particleboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/02 6:00:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard point of view</span><hr size=1> You only need a mage for three things:<br>

1. CotH;<br>
2. Focus/resist items; and<br>
3. Mod rods.<br>
<br>
One mage can do all this.  Two is better.  Thats all a guild needs.  Oh you wanted to play one to be a pet class and be useful in a single group?  Sure you can for the first 59 levels but after that watch an enchanter completely invalidate your reason for a single-group presence.  Dire charm anyone?<br>
<br>
This has to be the second best AA in the game (MGB is the best) and the best in single group play.  Its actually quite sickening.  I only realised the true horror of this yesterday when the enchanter gave his pet (a sebilite golem) a silken whip of ensarning and some stun weapon.  That pet was ridiculously powerful.  In the end what did he do?  He broke charm, we killed the pet and he got his weapons back.  This is seriously broken.  Verant stopped necro/mage/SK pets keeping weapons for exactly this reason.<br>
<br>
As for Luclin more generally, the zones I think are really pretty.  They are horribly laggy though.  I couldn't believe how laggy the Twilight Sea was and I have an Athlon 1900+, GF3 Ti500 and a gig of ram FFS.  Thats just stupid.<br>
<br>
Some of the lower level zones are good but they are zerg zones.  They're lower level versions (or equivalents) to the Oasis/LOIO/OT/DL<br>
<br>
High end content is mixed.  Some good, some bad, some completely out of whack.  The sooner they fix Acrylia to stop enchanters/clerics/wizards making 10x the exp anyone else can make the better.<br>
<br>
Ultra high end content seems to be horribly broken (Vex Thal key anyone?) and a complete waste of time.<br>
<br>
Velious is good.  At best Luclin is mediocre.<br>

It Makes guilds only want 1 bard on a raid whereas before they wanted 4 of us. The added group stuff is nice and the AA skills are good for soloing, very good for soloing, but I could give a crap about soloing, i want to be useful on raids, but with our resident 60 bard laying around Im useless now becuase of the AE songs.<br>
Ervaj's lost composition is an incredibly rare drop right now. yes battlecry and warsong are still bugged Like the velious songs now and no, not every tank in a regular grind group will have a Haste item (i dont know why either), and I dont equip a haste item myself and this song bugs the hell out of me. A lot of the luclin bard stuff is good for soloing and xp grinds. But none of that makes or breaks a raid so we wind up now just having one bard on a raid playig mana and resists completely dumbing down our class.....and thats a crime IMHO <p><p>~Genado Ginsinger</p>

*Burrower Worm Ring is good<br>
*Original Acrylia RoF was good (before the uber guilds asked for it to be buffed)<br>
*Wizards made useful<br>
*Nexus ports<br>

Bad things about Luclin:<br>
*High AC MOBs make many zones suck for melees, so the zones are emtpy<br>
*Zones designed for the level 40-52 have MOBs which are too hard to kill(other than Dawnshroud)<br>
*Lack of compelling content in dungeons (other than the rare bosses)<br>
 - examples: The Deep, Acrylia, Griegs, Akheva, FG<br>
*Lifetap MOBs suck for melees, making some zones useless<br>
 - examples: Tenebrous Mts<br>
*Nexus ports are still too slow.<br>
*Certain items too common (centi swords, Goranga idols, e.g.)<br>
*No druid ports to Luclin.  No ports within Luclin<br>
*2HS was made too powerful, disrupting class balance.  Knights with high-end 2HS outdamage dual-wielders with high-end 1H weapons (esp on high AC MOBs).<br>
*Lack of high-end ranger weapons (RNG weapons are proportionally inferior to war/rog/mnk/knight weaponary when compared to Kunark or Velious) <p>Locz Agneyastra <BR>
