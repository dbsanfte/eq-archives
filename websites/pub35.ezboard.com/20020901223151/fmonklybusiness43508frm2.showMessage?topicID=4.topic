After being bored to tears over the past two days getting faction up enough to bank in North Freeport I decided to try SolA again. The first time I tried SolA I absolutely hated the place when I tried the bar room -- just too many goblins packed in there for me.<br><br>After reading about the area around the king room I decided to give it a shot today and got a nice payoff. You have a long hallway to pull to that is very safe, you have a goblin merchant right next door to sell those FS weapons and other loot and you have the opportunity of nabbing the goblin king who after several hours of camping today popped and I got the Ring of the Goblin Lords -- ac4 str3 int3 LORE all races all classes weight 0.1lbs.<br><br>This is a monk's paradise. Open the door to the king room, throw a shuriken and pull the little buggers to the corner in the hallway and FD. Almost everytime one of them stayed while the others returned and boom you have one dead goblin priest/champion/mage. Sell whatever loot you have to the merchant and buy bandages from him too. Rest up and repeat. If you manage to take all 3 in the room before the 20 minute spawn timer then there is another room right next door to grab more from.<br><br>The XP is pretty good, not anything like Dalnir but not bad either. I made about 2 bubs in the 4-6 hours I was there. I made a ton of loot in the process. Several FS weapons, a couple bricks of clay that sell for 8pp, some amber and other assorted little goodies.<br><br>When the goblin king pops it gets pretty tricky. He'll cast a damage shield on himself and the others in the room. When you pull the room he will nuke you pretty good, some cases a whole bub worth or more. What finally worked for me was after I killed one of the goblins in the room I pulled the other one and the king almost to the area near the merchant room. When I feigned there the priest went back to his spot the long way around -- down the hall toward the jail so this left me with the king all alone. I got up and proceeded to beat on the king, it was a pretty tough fight and I had less than one bub HP left when it was all over. I think what saved me was my MR and FR resists which are 35 and 50 respectively because I noticed I resisted all of his fire-based Force Shock(Inferno?) spells which are quite nasty when they land. His cold-based spells I didn't resist at all since my CR is a pathetic 15 but as I recall he only casted two or three of these and I think it was the weaker Frost Shock and not the deadly Ice Shock but I'm not certain.<br><br>The best part about SolA is that during that whole time there were on average 3 other people in the zone, I never saw it go above 5. <br><br><b>Levels before 37?</b> - You might be ok at 36. It depends on a lot of factors. If you have batons that will make a huge difference. If you have good MR, FR and CR gear that also helps. Defintely bring a pumice stone or two if you can afford them.<br><br>What is tricky about the area is when a mage pops in the king room, something I forgot to mention in my original post. If it's just a mage and two melee types then you can pull but you will take some damage from the mage's spells. It varies drastically at times. Sometimes it's less than half a bub other times 1-2 bubs. They cast a mixture of cold-based and fire-based spells at you so pump up that CR and FR. Also, the mage will cast damage shields on the others at all times. If you get lucky and have a string of all melee types which I did the first time there then your life is a lot easier.  <p><b>Unis</b> 37th lvl Iksar Monk <i>Bertox</i><br><i>This lizard banks in: Rivervale and North Freeport</i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 3/12/02 6:00:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ughennafistflinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GhennaFistFlinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/26/00 3:56:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sol A Gnomes, Levels 37 to 42</span><hr size=1> Also, you can do gnomes for  unreal exp, they are located at the gnome castle( duh ) and I did 37-42 there in about 4-5 days.<br><br>Also I looted around 2k pp in fs (which you can sell to Marfen (just sneak behind him) and then have a friend pick up the money for ya and store it (or one person said to buy fire opals which is a good idea, I think you buy for 550 gold and with high cha you can sell back for that much, and they weigh 0.1!) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 1/9/02 2:51:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/urukekle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rukekle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/29/00 8:48:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sol A Clockworks, Levels 38 - 43</span><hr size=1> I don't know if the gnome merchant sells bandages. I don't think so. I just ran over and used the goblin. <br><br>I fought the clockworks in Sol A for about 5-6 hours the other night. I stayed in the room found at (-300, -800) on this map: http://www.eqatlas.com/solusekseyemap.html <br><br>There are 2 clockworks that spawn in that room, easy to split. There is a 3rd just around the corner before the lava bridge that I pulled back into the room. There is a 4th one, a wanderer, that is the EXG or it's placeholder. It wanders between that room and the castle. There are 3 more gnomes on the way to the castle you can pull, but I left them alone. If a conjurer spawns they are mean and they begin to dmg shield the EXG and it's PH as they walk by, making them difficult too. <br><br>Over the course of my stay there I got 3 charred guardian shields. The EXG is a wimp and the shields are not lore :)  Most of the clockworks have FS weapons. I got a few pieces of dufrenite, and 1 melatite. I also got over half a lvl exp. (half of 38 and into 39). Overall a very profitable evening. Almost all of them are still blue at 39. Have fun.<br><br>-Rukekle, 39th lvl Iksar Monk<br><br>~~~~~~~<br><i>More info:</i><br><br><b>Unis</b>: I took a much needed break from questing and faction building and finally got a chance to try the clockworks last night. <br><br>All I can say is thank you, Ghenna and Rukekle! The clockworks are way better than the king room due to the fact that I never saw a caster spawn there. On occasion you'll see a clockwork with a forceback module or one with an ice-based module but these are nothing to worry about. Just make sure to fight in that room that Rukekle mentioned so you don't get accidentially pushed into the lava. I never did see an EXG walk by but I looted plenty of FS weapons, a couple bricks of clay, broken modules and many other goodies.<br><br>With a total of 4 clockworks in that area, if you space them out correctly you have plenty of time to heal up, go sell your weapons and kill the goblins in the area for kicks who even though they con green will sometimes carry 1-2pp and sometimes FS weapons. I wandered up to the castle to sell to Marfan but saw some gnome curators and miners who cast some nasty spells so I don't recommend hunting in that area just yet. Maybe at 40? Not sure. So if you need to sell then just hop, skip and FD your way to the goblin merchant near the king room.<br><br>Rukekle, if you are not up to writing a guide to the clockworks I'll see what I can come up with and submit one to Zadkiel giving you credit of course. That room is a perfect place to hunt and should be known to all monks. <br><br><b>Rukekle</b>: Glad you found the room useful Unis. I'm 40th now, and have almost outgrown it. It's still good for exp, but there is a lot of time spent waiting for spawns now. I now have time between spawns to check other areas for rares. It's good if you need cash, but not as good now for exp. It was a good place to build cash for my tinkers bag which I finally got :) <br><br>I am surprised to hear you found clay on the clockworks. I never have. They do drop melatite though, same icon as the HQ ores the goblins drop. It's worth a lot more, used to make ronium for paladin quest armor, and ranger boots. Might want to check it. They also drop a gem, dufrenite. Shaman need that for their armor. They pay ~170p to buy it from a vendor. You can make a tidy profit if you hang on to it and sell to players rather than vendors. <br><br>As far as a guide goes, there are already good ones out there for Sol A. I use this one:<br><br>http://monks.volitionx.com/soluseka.htm<br><br>It has good maps and useful spawn info. The room I mentioned is labeled "D" on that map. It's already well known I think, and they give good details on clockwork types and lvls. <br><br>I think it's time for me to go check on some yeti :) <br><br><b>Asadoorian Clubfoot</b>: If those 4 spawns are not enough to keep you occupied, try just down the hallway in front of the gnome castle. There you will have AT LEAST 7 spawns to pull from - the 2 outside the castle, the 2 in Gabbie's room, the 1 in Marfen's room, the EXG wanderer, and the wanderer inside the castle. There is also the model CX that spawns in Gabbie's room, though is on a different timer. Best of all, with the exception of Gabbie, they are ALL non casters.<br><br>Pull to and fight at one of the corners of the front courtyard. From 40-43 I had no problems mowing through all 7 spawns within the 20 minute repop. You may even have time to pull a couple from the second floor or go clear out the Reckless Efreet spawn.<br><br>Gabbie is, unfortunately, not soloable at this level. She is more or less a slightly tougher version of the king (btw I would not recommend trying to solo the king until AT LEAST your low 40s). Not to worry, however, cuz she is usually permacamped by some high level farmer. If, by some miracle of nature, she is actually left up - just skip her room and pull a couple from upstairs, up to and around the Captain spawn.<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 1/9/02 3:13:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaedintigerfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aedin Tigerfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/15/00 12:51:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/id/phalliqua/newanis/handorb5.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sol A Bar room, Level: 35+</span><hr size=1> Hmm. I loved sol a. But I never did the king room. For me the bar was where its at.<br><br>Now that was 20 some odd levels ago but at 35 a monk CAN solo the bartender room with some practice and knowledge of FD. (if you have batons or other new school monk weapons it will make your life easier. I did this using my fists since when I was 35, the standard equiptment for you was mesh and fists :) )<br><br>Basic tactic is to sneak into the bar room, and get to the corner of the bar (the left side of the actual bar table where there is 4 goblins, two on the inside and two on the outside. As long as you stay on the corner you will NOT be agro.<br><br>ok, throw a knife or shuriken to the one closest to you BEHIND the bar. It looks like the others will attack you but in most cases they wont. Fight him in the corner and pray he isnt sow'd, he will run and the other ones will come after you but you can just head back to the corner and FD them off.<br> <br>Bandages are a must since you will be self relian on healing yourself.<br><br>After you finish with that one go kill the second one behind the bar. He's easier because you can probably kill him before he runs off and agro's the others. After that pull the two on the other side of the bar table and feign split them. Works like a charm.<br><br>After you kill the 4 bar gobs there are two other rooms with 2 gobs each in them, kill those off if you have the time and hp before the bar gobs spawn.<br><br><br>Breaking the room can be difficult but once you break it. It becomes easy money. Watch out for the wizzards and shamans though. wizzies nuke and shamans SoW :) <br><br><br><br><br><br>This is not for the sensitive monk. And can be quite difficult at times. I was one of the first monks on my server to actually solo the bar at my level. But it CAN be done and you will get some nice exp and DRAKE LEGS from the bartender when he spawns (might get the crappy arms though).<br><br>After word spread that the bar could be solo'd by a monk I was getting requests for other monks to group and do it. This can be fun too since it can get very lonely solo'ing and is good practice for puller/ peeler stratagies that will prove invalubal later on<br><br><br>Anyhow, try it out, and let me know the results. I did this till 40 then I moved on to grouping for gnome clockworks (at that time a monk couldnt really solo one due to equiptment restrictions but i'm sure now monks of that level can do it with the equiptment  that is now available.<br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 1/9/02 3:17:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukolobos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kolobos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/20/00 3:30:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Clockworks</span><hr size=1> I can testify to Clockworks being great exp.<br><br>Found them first at 37 when i was looking for the Foreman.

I also found it more effective just to kick the efreeti insted of standard melee...if wielding batons it really hurts, and besides, he has really low hp's anyway.

A few wise pioneers scribed on this board the many benefits of training our Monkly skills on this battleground, so when the time seemed right, I headed there (about level 33). <br><br>The how-to's are well explained in other people's writings. I am simply here to confirm their validity. The high-level view is that I started fighting goblins at 33 (mostly at the goblin merchant room, then moving to the king area), then moved to Gnomes at about 38 (at the gate to the castle near Gabbie's room). Unbelievable experience is the term to use here. There is nothing that I know of that can compare to it for these levels. 40, a hell level, blew by in a few days of casual play, maybe 10 hours total. At 42 now, I'm still fighting Gnomes, even though many are green (but still give exp). <br><br>Here is a brief list of some of the many very good reasons why this are is awesome for Monks:<br><br>1) Goblin Merchant to buy bandages, and to sell<br><br>2) Gnome Merchant to sell<br><br>3) Easy to split mobs and they don't run from you if you pull them to the right spots (like behind the counter in the merchant room, or behind the bar)<br><br>4) Lots of fine steel and other items that sell for a good amount of platinum<br><br>5) Compared to many other zones, it's very close to a bank<br><br>6) Some neat items drop, that you will surely get if you stay there long enough (Charred Guardian Shield, Charred Guardian BP, Platinum Armband, Glowing Stone Band, Drake-Hide legs and arms, Molten Cloak…)<br><br>7) Very un-crowded. Most of the time there are no more than 10 people there.<br><br>And here are the best reasons:<br><br>8 ) Close to a Druid ring, which means you can always run over there and ask politely for skin like nature<br><br>9) A Cleric epic item is found here, which means there is almost always a very very bored 55+ cleric in the zone who will almost always completely buff you for free if you chat with him or her for a few minutes<br><br>10) Lots of Druids want the Molten Cloak for its wisdom so Gabbie is often camped by a 49+ Druid who will usually help you out with an occasional heal/regen/skin blessing.<br><br>I've been there 10 full levels, almost exclusively, and almost all the time solo, and almost every minute I've been buffed with either Resolution/Hero or Skin Like Nature. I've never had to beg for blessings, most people are very happy to offer their aid.<br><br>I keep expecting the experience to dry up, but it hasn't yet. I'm averaging 1 full bubble per hour at 42<br><br>I have a great guild and we all get together on events frequently, but when nobody is available and I need to solo, it's time to head to Solusek's Eye. I hope you have as good of an experience there as I have had.<br><br>Good luck!<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usonador.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sonador</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(12/1/00 12:57:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Unbeliveable but true</span><hr size=1> I have been here now for about 3 hours straight.

This way you really never have to go back to the city.  Cash gets heavy after a time and the last thing you want to do is leave once you have the spawn broken.  One cool idea to convert cash is to take a nice item that trades for a good price.  I use a piece of jade sell it to the merchant for 3p7s and buy it back for 4p7s.

It was doable, but a bit slow, at 30th level, because I sometimes could not take them before having to feign, bind, etc.  It was pretty easy at 31st level, except when an inferno goblin wizard spawned.  My equipment was pretty good (unbuffed AC of 640, batons, set of starter MR gear - see below).  No need to wait until 35th level, or whatever, to come here!  The XP and loot are great at 31 -- drake hide legs sell fast at 200pp a pop.  An earlier post talked about there being *two* goblins behind the bar, but I never saw more than one, the bartender or his PH.<br><br>    You can get to the bar fairly easily by running and feigning, or feign flopping (the latter only really being needed if there are a lot of wizard spawns between zone-in and the bar).  Watch out for chain nuking casters.<br><br>    There are three static spawns in the bar, plus a wanderer who *will* aggro at times when you fight behind the bar.  The spawn time was 19 minutes -- your mileage may vary, but that's what I consistently timed it at on Torv with only a few other people, if any, in the zone.  Basically, med in a corner behind the bar until you're ready, pop up and nail the bartender/PH, bind, mend, and med (if needed).  Celebrate if you got some 200+ pp leggings, which are the common drop.  Then feign split the two bar patrons (easy) and take them one at a time.  The wanderer will likely aggro on you a couple of times, but you can just feign until he starts to go away (don't even need to wait for him to get out of room), pop back up, and keep fighting.<br><br>    Once you've cleared the room, you can start pulling from the side rooms.  There are two statics to the north, plus the wanderer seems to stick here often.  There are two statics in the room to the south, plus one static in each of the smaller rooms off it (including the goblin drunkard or his PH).<br><br>    What can spawn here (levels courtesy of Allakhazam)?<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - fire goblin (L24-26 warrior)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - fire goblin shaman (L25-26 shaman)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - fire goblin wizard (L24-26 wizard)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - inferno goblin (L26-28 warrior)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - inferno goblin shaman (L26-27 shaman)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - inferno goblin wizard (L26-27 wizard)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - goblin bartender (L25 warrior)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - goblin drunkard L25 magician)<br><br>    The warriors are easy, and the shamen are even easier.  I carry around two gold wolf's eye agate bracers, a plat wolf's eye agate necklace, and a split-paw hide mask, which put my MR at 53 -- fire goblin shaman spells bounce off.  The wizards are a pain in the butt - their spells seem to be much less resistable than shamen spells.  I have not even tried the drunkard (don't carry pumice on me).  You will collect tons of FS weapons, and can easily run/feign to the goblin merchant to sell, past two statics and a random number of wanderers.  At 31st level, I could easily make several hundred plat in a couple of hours, which is amazing cash flow for that level (in my experience).  If I was mostly not playing (e.g., reading or something), I could just hold the three spawns in the bar, with enough time to mend and get back to full health between each spawn, which made it trivial.  It took two and a half to three gobs to get a blue bubble, which meant I could get a bubble in two RL hours with very little effort.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Chiangli<br><br>P.S. Watch out for the lava.  I fell in twice - unfortunately, while Chiangli has good AGI, I do not. :-)<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzinj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zinj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(12/22/00 7:01:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sol A </span><hr size=1> I need to consolidate all these posts into a Guide to Solusek's Eye.<br><br>Maybe over Christmas (if I don't get killed driving all over the place).<br><br>One place a lot of people don't mention is the Goblin Torturer.  This particular area is immediately underneath the King Room complex.  Torturer drops a rare Momento Box (Wt 2.0, 25% reduction, 6 small slots) which you can sell for 270-300pp; as well as the common Turquois Eyepatch ((face) +2AC, +2 STA, +2 INT, +2 CHA, Wt 0.1, all/all), sells for roughly 140pp and is an exceptionally nice item for Enchanters before they get up enough levels to do their Solusek Quests. <br><br>To get there, sneak past the goblin merchant room, turn left, through the door, down the stairs and take the first right door.  The guard room through the door has two spawns fire or inferno (very rarely a solusek), any class.  I usually take sneak off, open the door, run straight across and feign, wait for recycle, open the door, jump up and run through to the cell blocks.  There are four cell blocks, two on each side.  First pair are empty.  Second pair have one goblin each, fire or inferno, any class.  I usually run/jump right past them and feign at the door on the end of the cell block.  50% chance to aggro them this way.  Wait for recycle, open the door, and run to the left back corner of the Torturer chamber and feign again.  Turn sneak on again, make sure nothing is aggroed on you and then stand up and turn around.  The Torturer or his placeholder (fire or inferno goblin, any class) is the only spawn in this room.  <br><br>Usually the Torturer/PH mobs can be taken one at a time; although occassionally you'll get one of the cell block goblins aggroed through the wall.  I found that I could take the torturer and each of the cell blocks one at a time at 35/36 (blue cons) and rotate through the 18 minute spawn interval without burning many bandages.  At 36, the fire goblins go high green, and at 37 only half the fire goblins give xp.  Also at 37, you can start taking the two from the guard area on rotation every 18 min.  Lots of fine steel, fire goblin skins, fire goblin totems.<br><br>Pull all mobs to the torture chamber, and when they run, you can usually have them dead before they reach the guard room; although sometimes they reach the hallway and aggro several of the roaming mobs fire/inferno/soluseks.  Another occasional problem is that a runner may aggro one or several mobs from the King room complex and they will drop right through the ceiling on your back (yuck), requiring you to decide to feign immediately, or to gut it out, and stick with your mob to kill it before feigning.<br><br>Zinj<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufeodor7.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feodor7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(12/22/00 2:50:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sol A</span><hr size=1> <br>/e bows to all the courageous dungeon crawlers.<br><br>I've been crawling around SolA for the last week (RL) or so.

Becareful, there's a gk spawn in the intersection. You'll enter a room with really odd architecture. I call it the spiral room, others call it the circle room. If you jump down to the lower part, there's a little room with two gk spawns. If you go up the ramp and turn left, you'll be in a corridor that leads to the window room. There's a spawn in the corridor, close to the spiral room. If you keep going up the ramp, instead of left, you'll go to the KPC.<br><br>Ok, if you took a left, congratulations, you're in the window room. Killer exp if stupid high levels who shouldn't be still killing gks are in your group. In the window room, there's a ramp that leads to the small room (with the window) above it, the corridor you came in, and another ramp, which leads to the zone to SolA. That ramp is your "my ass is getting whupped, run!" route. In the window room, there are two spawns. One on the wall between the window and the corridor you came in, and the other right behind the small ramp. A kobold also spawns in the ramp-corridor to SolA, and will wander down eventually.<br><br>Pulling the rest.<br>Good, you've broken the room. This place is fairly easy to pull, usually doubles, never more than triples...well, maybe a quadruple if you're really unlucky. :P<br><br>Directly above the window room is a small room with a single gk spawn. After you've killed him, take the hallway in that room. It leads to a 2 spawn room. One is directly in front of you as you come in, on the opposite wall, and the other is to your right, in a little alcove.<br><br>The next room above that is the "pool" room. I prefer Jacuzzi room myself. It also has two spawns in it. One is about 5 feet in front of you as you come in (on the little carpet), and the other is in the back of the room, also on the little carpet.<br><br>There are two corridors leading out from the jacuzzi room, one on either side of the jacuzzi. Facing the jacuzzi, turn right, and take the corridor that you didn't come into the room my. There is sometimes a wanderer in the hall. On your left will be a small room, this has two gk spawns.<br><br>If you keep following the hall, you'll eventually come to another medium sized room. This has 2 (maybe 3, I'm not exactly sure...I think the hall wanderer may spawn here) gk spawns. One on the left as you come in, one on the right. There are two corridors leading from this room, not including the one you came in. The one on the right is a zone to SolA, (I think...) and the one on the left goes to the other kobolds you want to pull.<br><br>Left corridor...There'll be an almost 90 degree angle in the hall, there's a spawn there, yank it back the way you came. Sometimes the wanderer is also in this hall.<br><br>Ok, at the end of that hall is a little 4-way crossroad. If you turn left, it takes you to the jacuzzi room. If you go right, or straight, it takes you to the last room on this side. This room has two gk spawns, fairly easy to pull.<br><br>By now, either your room is probably popping. If not, go pull from the spiral room, or that kobold near the zone.<br><br><br>HAZARDS:<br>sks and gks come in two forms: X Kobold, which is a warrior, and X Kobold Shaman. As you know, casters are more annoying to pull, and in addition to that, Tagar's Insects will make you cry. :P<br><br>Bats and bugs: These are what you hunt in solb when you're too old for kobolds. Bats aren't that bad, they're around level 40. Lava beetles (look like fire beetles) aren't too tough, though they're tougher than bats. The bug you have to watch out for is the LDC, or Lava Duct Crawler. These are nasty mofos, and look like red and black spiders. I don't know what level they are, but I'm pretty sure they're red to me at 41. If you see one, immediately feign. They also cast a nasty necro dot.<br><br>I haven't broken the KPC enough to feel knowledgable enough to post a guide on it, anyone up for it?<br><br>Edit: Here is a map. The little red dots are kobold spawns. The green line is the wanderer's path. A, B, and C are the zones to SolA. My apologies to EQatlas.com for ripping off their map. :) <br><br><b>Edit: Map was hosted at Geocities, and needs to be hosted elsewhere</b><br><br><b>Other Info posted:</b><br><br><b>Brodaan Syes</b>: Nother little note to add to your guide bro...If you see a wandering Noxx spider..FD...That is,<br>if your in a group that is low 40s/high 30s.

Also, its one of the most under-utilized zone in the game.<br><br>* Indicate rooms a level 40-45 may have trouble with<br><br>1) High Shaman *<br><br>I've only recently added this to my list because I accidently sold my Glowing Stone Band. Kill both mobs in the first room and your done. I've killed more than 30 respawns here and have yet to see the high shaman. Drops Glowing Stone Band or Platinum Totem<br><br>2) Torturer<br><br>This requires going through a not well known path near the lava pit. Run straight to the door holding the torturer/ph and feign. Open door, stand up, kill Ph and move along. Drops Turquoise Eyepatch or Momento Box.<br><br>3) King *<br><br>If you are high enough you can open the door and only the king's spot will agro you. Can't solo him unless you are probably 45, maybe lower with pumice. Drops Ring of Goblin Lords and some Fire Wand.<br><br>4) Bartender<br><br>Run quickly behind bar, if you do it right you won't aggro the two in front. Drops Drake-hide legs and Drake-hide arms.<br><br>5) Drunkard *<br><br>I just run straight to his room to the side and feign. He may be difficult for lower levels because he has a pet and damage shield. Might as well get him for his nifty potion.<br><br>6) Predator<br><br>Look for a goblin in the hall just outside. If look for one just inside the room on the upper level, if you can't find one, move on. Drops Kobold-hide Boots and Obsidian Shard.<br><br>7) Foreman<br><br>Run in and kill both the guys standing next to well. Yes its true folks, I have seen the foreman in both spots. Drops Foremans Tunic and Obsidian Scimitar<br><br> Kindle<br><br>Run through secret passage and head to kindle. Find the wandering ph and kill it. This can take a while. Drops Obsidian Ring and Imp-skin Gloves. <br><br>9) Captain<br><br>Go through the Kindle area and hit the captain room. Just kill his ph while the other two beat on you, no problem. Drops Charred Gloves and Boots<br><br>10) Efreeti *<br><br>Run in, aggro the two elementals, run back by captain area and feign. The goblins will kill the elementals. Return to room, if there is another elemental do the same. If there is efreeti kill him which can be tough because he has a wicked damage shield. Use slow weapons.<br><br>11) Optional *<br><br>I like having my gnome faction so I don't camp EXG, Gabby, or Lava Elemental but these can be easily added. Normally I can clear those 10 named spawns in just under 10 minutes.<br><br>Best of luck! Oh, and keep in mind that you should always let people take one of the spawns because it will prevent a lot of trouble. Just pick one or two and "claim" them and spend the most time there.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1805<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(1/22/02 5:34:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: **Zone Guide: Soluseks A and B (Level: 37 to 40+)</span><hr size=1> <b>Originally posted by Xayne</b><br><br> 1) if your only killing the 2 gobs in the front room, it is no wonder you have not seen the High Shaman, he spawns in the room with the table on the wall directly opposite the door.<br><br>3) Even if you don't solo pull him, you can always FD pull him. Pumice stone HIGHLY recommened.<br><br>4) Agro all the gobs you want, just jump behind the bar and FD, you can stand up immediately as long as no other gobs are behind the bar. Only the gobs behind the bar will pay any attention to you.<br><br>10) I love making the goblins kill the fire elementals, I derive great pleasure from it for some odd reason. The Efreeti's damage sheild is AMAZING. Pumice Stone also Highly recommended. If you don't have a Pumice stone you can also Flying Kick him to death. Just FK him, then immediately FD and stand up, you should be off his agro list, wait for FK to come back up again. Rinse repeat until he starts to run, then you gotta beat the crap out of him. Pray you have Mend or enough HP to survive his Damage sheild. This is a very time consuming method, though.<br><br>11) EXG is also a pretty easy one. And you really have to kill HUNDREDS of Clocks before you faction goes KOS. You can also use a similiar method on the EXG and Gabby as I described on Gabby. I would highly recommend a pumice stone because if gabbie has her damage sheild up, she is a REAL pain.<br><br>OTHER THINGS OF NOTE:<br>A) LOOT all that FS... yeah, that is right! Why? Well, why NOT? Your their to farm and make PP, right? Don't forget that there is a Merchant that you can sell to and who sells BANDAGES... just make sure to stop in at the merchant as you make your rounds.<br><br>B) Take 2 Pumice Stones. Sure, they may have cost you 30pp but just the money you will make in FS alone will EASILY pay for that, and that gives you the ability to get rid of 10 damage sheilds... it makes life a LOT easier.<br><br>C) Try to be respectful of the other players in the dungeon. Don't run from one side of the dungeon to the other with a trail of gobs on your tail cuz you know you can just FD when you get where you're going. There still are some lower levels that adventure in Sol A who appreciate not getting trained, even if it wasn't on purpose. FD every so often around corners or before crossing intersections and such.<br><br><b>Originally posted by Catranizi  </b><br><br> Kindle also has an annoying damage shield. Bring the blazing elementals one by one to him to lower his life, and pick him up after that. Do the same bu the other way with the efreeti.<br><br>EXG is green at 42 and very easy. You'll also make lots of good friends helping them kill him, since its mostly casters that wants the shield.<br><br>The toughest mob solo is most probably Gabbie, being a caster and all. Some conjurers might also be a pain in the ass if they are 35+. <br> <br><b>Originally posted by Stormfyst Starbringer</b><br><br> Does this work becuase you're 50? I'm a 35 monk and i've been toasted twice trying to break the bar room. everything aggros over the bar...heck even a wizzy from outside aggrod. Help! I thought i read somewhere that i can solo this place.<br>***<br>I was honestly behind the counter. There were two goblins in the room and one outside with a wizzy. When i'd smack the one on the end of the bar, both would come running, and i'd fd. then one would respawn in it's spot and i'd start bashing the other one. when i did this they all came running. ??? <br><br><b>Originally posted by Yuuzhan</b><br><br> Ya, if the roamer(s?) are in the room they will aggro ya behind the bar. And if a shaman or wiz is the spawn against the far wall in either of the side rooms and your behind the bar fighting they will heal, dmg shield the gobbie your fighting. Makes no sense at all to me. <br><br>and btw if your fighting a wizard and hes nukin the hell outta ya, use your resist discipline. saved my bacon a couple of times. HOW can a non-xpgivingwizard still nuke me with 50mr??? <br><br><b>Originally posted by Krystalis</b><br><br> I was doing a bit of farming tonight, I'm still in the process of learning the zone so I just held the foreman / kobold and EXG spawns, and killed gnomes for xp to kill time waiting on respawn. Was really easy to do at 40. I'm probly going to change my route to include the bartender / torturer tommorrow eve. <br><br><b>Originally posted by Syke Auttic</b><br><br> Good ideas on farming this place. I've spent a bit of time there recently too...and didn't know about going behind the bar... of course I tend to just kill everything...<br><br>Also Singe is a nice kill as well. He drops the obsidian hoop and something else (can't remember the rare), but I've scraped up around a half dozen hoops in as many kills. They are great for pure casters and SKs.<br><br>Lately though it seems that Sol A has become popular again (since the xp increase), so farming it has to be done later on my server...although I will sometimes grab a room (either Bartender or King) and work just that area. Gets a little slow at times, but both have a nice selection of mobs to kill (although the King side is much better). <br> <br> <br><b>Originally posted by Zinj</b><br><br> 1. As has been said previously, do not drag trains around the zone just because you can dump them when you reach your destination. Best method is to run through a room, and feign in a hall on the other side, dropping that bunch of mobs, then rinse and repeat until you reach your destination. This has the added benefit of only aggroing a couple of casters on you at a time. I'd tried running through three spawn points one time (Lavastorm entrance to the Bar) and had 3 wizzies and 2 shaman blasting me back to my Freeport bind point before I even knew they were there.<br><br>2. Don't be a spawn hog. Just because you can hold 2, 3, 5 or all the spawns in the zone doesn't give you license to do so. Sol A IS a lot more popular than it used to be. If it starts filling up, voluntarily drop a spawn to newcomers if they're looking for a place.<br><br>3. Always ask. First thing I do when entering the zone is do a /who and then call /ooc Camp check please. If you only get 1 or 2 responses, do another camp check after a minute; they may be in a battle and missed your /ooc or can't reply to it. If all the spawns are taken, ask the campers if you can take one of their sites. <br><br>4. In light of rule 2 and 3, and the Play Nice Policy - If you've asked, and no spots are open that you can take (and hold), and people are claiming multiple spawns, you have a RIGHT to claim any spawn/room a person is NOT PHYSICALLY on station AT. <br><br>5. If you ask to clear other spawns out of a room where a person is camping a specific spawn; don't leave that camper in a lurch with respawns that forces him/her out of the camp. Kind of like the Dalnir etiquette. The bar, predator, and foreman rooms are particular areas this applies. A person may spend an hour or more setting up spawns so they can hold the room. Casters are a bitch for <30 players. You may be able to hold the bar with non-casters on the other side; but an inferno shaman or a couple of wizzies may make it impossible to take down a mob because of multiple damage shields or heals.<br><br>*side note on barroom *<br>Most wanderers can see OVER the top of the bar from the doorway if you are fighting behind the bar. (Increased aggro range due to combat) They almost never see you, even if unfeigned, if you just stand there.<br><br><b>Originally posted by Lingus Khan</b><br><br> Here are a couple more points to add to the evergrowing hints on SolA....<br><br>1. While fighting the bartender or his placeholder, it's easier to keep watch for the wandering MOBs if you fight with your back to the south side wall behind the bar. This will give you adequate time to FD before the wandering mob gets to you. This means he will leave much sooner than if he manages to get to you before you FD.<br><br>2. While fighting said bartender or placeholder, DO NOT back up to the point you are standing on the barrels on the south wall. You will aggro the mobs on the other side of the wall (not sure why..) They in turn will pull the patrons along with them. This is commonly called a "bad thing"...<br><br>3. Not sure if this is my imagination, but it seems that if there are high level (50+) chars in the zone, casters seem to hit harder. I was nailed 3 times in a row with 181 point dd spells by green wizzies.....they don't seem to hit as hard if the zone is populated with low-mid level chars. Like I said, could just be my imagination.  <br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 3/12/02 6:36:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 2098<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/8/02 7:09:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: **Zone Guide: Soluseks A and B (Level: 37 to 40+)</span><hr size=1> <b>Originally posted by chinaboxer</b><br><br> As most of you know, the Bar room in Sol A is a great place for exp.

I've been in sol a at all stages of my career - exp'ing and getting phat lewt at mid 20s (I still remember when I first got a foremans tunic, i was sooo happy), and from there to farming just about every possible named at 49.<br><br>You left three spawns out - Captain Bipnupple, the Lava Elemental, and the Goblin Torturer. Let me go through them one by one:<br><br>1) The goblin torturer isn't worth killing. He drops a lame face item (<a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=soldunga&item=1176">turqouise eye patch</a>) and a small weight reducing box (<a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=soldunga&item=819">momento box</a>).  However, if you are interested, he spawns in the little room at the end of the corridor that is marked 18.<br><br>2) Captain Bipnupple is only worth killing for his *very* rare drop, the <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=soldunga&item=744">Gnomish Environment Suit</a>. This gives 10 to fire, poison, and cold resist, so is very useful for dragon raids but not much else. His common drop,the <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=soldunga&item=538">brick of blue ore</A>, is totally useless, just sell it to the vendor. Bipnupple spawns in the  upper level of the gnome castle, above Gabbie Mardoodle. There are 3 gnomes in the room where he spawns - you want to kill the one against the west wall. If there are curators nearby, kill them - otherwise they will heal even if htey don't join in.<br><br>3) The lava elemental is found in the room marked 4 on the map. I've killed him countless times and I never once got that stupid <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=soldunga&item=822">runed lava pendant</a> - in fact, I ended up buying it. Usually, he drops either the <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=soldunga&item=3047">power of fire</a> (no idea what its for) or a <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=soldunga&item=902">damage shield potion</a>, which can be semi useful when you are soloing a tough mob. Including the PH, there are 5 clockworks in this room. You only have to kill the one that wanders around in a circle. If you are unlucky and a curator is outside that room, they will heal him or the PH while you are fighting so be sure to kill those.<br><br>Now, when I was *heavily* farming this dungeon, I was level 49 and none of the gnomes or clockworks would assist when I was killing one of their friends. At level 41 they definitely will assist - I'm not sure where the magic level is but be sure to experiment some if this is your first time. The goblins are a different story - even the damn young ones will aggro on you, and that is with 30+ difference in levels. However, if the dungeon is empty its pretty easy to train up a bunch of gobs heading to a named spawn and then just feigned 'em off when you get there.<br><br>Sol A is an amazing place both when you are young and when you are old. Especially since they raise the exp given in the zone, there are awesome camps for groups ranging from level 25 to level 35 or 40. And once the whole thing has greened out to you, there are incredible opportunities to farm your way to a tink bag, fbss, or whatever else your heart may desire! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 5/17/02 4:26:24 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2>Guides and Tactics</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
