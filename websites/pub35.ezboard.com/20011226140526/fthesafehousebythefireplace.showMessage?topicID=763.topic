Hope you enjoy.  Let me know what you think of it.<br>
<br>
Shaitin is in many ways a paradox.  His speech is rough and accented, yet he is able to sweet-talk the most canny of noblemen.  The dwarven race is not known for great intelligence, and the only thing sharper than this dwarf's blade is his wit.  Physically, he is built like a rock, powerful and stout, but he is able to move with the lithe grace of a Teir'Dal acrobat.  In combat, Shaitin uses tactics that best fit each situation, whether that be a bloodthirsty charge or stealthy blade in the back.<br>
<br>
His history remains mostly unknown, with the exception of one major catastrophe.  Shaitin was not always a dwarf, which perhaps explains his unusual duplicity.  The story you are about to read is known only to a few wise scholars, all of which have scars to remind them that some knowledge has a high price.<br>
<br>
Drazuul was born a Teir'Dal.  In the distant past, he lived in the underground metropolis, Neriak.  Throughout his youth, Drazuul learned well the dark intricacies of survival in that fey city.  At a young age, he joined the Order of the  Ebon Mask, and rose quickly through its ranks.  <br>
<br>
Eventually he tired of the constraints placed on him by the Order, and left the city to travel the land.  Many an adventure he had, and his fortune grew daily.  Among his most prized possessions was a powerful magical artifact.  No name has ever been given to this artifact, but its powers are now painfully obvious.  When worn by one of a truly evil heart, it creates a bond to their soul.  Upon the death of the wearer, their soul is cast into the nearest infant body.  In the process, the poor victim's soul is absorbed into the intruding one.  The artifact created such a bond with Drazuul, and what followed was horrible indeed.<br>
<br>
Drazuul's travels eventually brought him to the continent of Faydwer, and the Butcherblock Mountains near Kaladim.  For over a decade, Drazuul terrorized the areas surrounding Kaladim.  He killed every dwarf, elf, and gnome that crossed his path, and stole a fortune in precious metals and stones.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the bloodbath was ended.  Furtog Ogrebane, the Commander of the mighty Stormguards, was able to track Drazuul to his lair near the Ocean of Tears with a band of his men.  A fierce battle ensued, but there was no hope for Drazuul against the overwhelming odds.  The killing blow was struck by Furtog himself, and Drazuul's butchered corpse was unceremoniously dropped into the sea, food for the sharks.<br>
<br>
Of course, this was not the end of Drazuul, though the world did not know it at the time.  His soul was carried into the body of an infant dwarf, whose parents had named Shaitin.  He grew from childhood in the closely knit dwarven community, supported by a loving family.  Shaitin had no conscious knowledge of whom he really was, though he knew he was different form the others.  He was tormented daily by dark urges and surges of hatred for those around him.  Shaitin eventually found an inner balance, becoming a neutral being.  While he had few altruistic notions, neither did he display the raw evil of Drazuul.<br>
<br>
Shaitin eventually left Kaladim to once again travel the world.  While searching for a lost treasure in the infamous dungeon, Guk, Shaitin came across another artifact of great power.  Called the Guise of the Deceiver by many, it is a mask which, when wore by Shaitin, enables the evil half of his soul to become dominant.  Not only does his mind become that of Drazuul, but his body undergoes a transformation into the physical form as well.<br>
<br>
That is all which is known of Shaitin, and to seek more would be a dangerous task indeed.  I leave you with this story, that you may be wary of incurring the wrath of the dwarf assassin, Shaitin.  Gather your own conclusions, reader, as to whether his tortured soul deserves to live. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulordtrevor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordTrevor</A> at: 6/2/01 11:41:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rethul>Rethul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/01 7:06:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Of Assassins and Dwarves</span><hr size=1> Interesting and creative...
