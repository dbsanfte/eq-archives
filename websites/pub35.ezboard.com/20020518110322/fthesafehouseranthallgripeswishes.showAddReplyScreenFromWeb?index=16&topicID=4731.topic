<br>
School had just gotten out at the high school, and of course there are people who walk home. Others drive, get a ride, whatever.<br>
<br>
So, people are walking across the street. Usually in huge groups. The signals for pedestrians are weird, IMO. They say &quot;WALK&quot; or show the walking guy for like 2 seconds, then have the blinking &quot;DON'T WALK&quot; or red hand for about 2 more seconds, then the blinking stops and it just says &quot;DON'T WALK&quot; or has the red hand.<br>
<br>
So anyways, kids are crossing the street. About halfway across the thing is blinking, and before they get 3/4 the way across, it stops blinking. Once they get to the sidewalk again the cop starts writing up tickets for all of the kids that didn't make it before it stopped blinking.<br>
<br>
And yes, the law enforcement in my area is notorious for only enforcing law for quotas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/1/02 4:03:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4731.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Nope, dont have stats to back that up.

No, I'm not pissed at cops for being cops, I dont think I'm special and that the laws dont apply to me. Lots of people here took this the wrong way. I simply asked cops to think about what they are doing to the person they are busting. I can't count the amount of times I've thought about trying to become a cop so I could do it different. <br>

<br>
Are you still seriously saying that 90% of the people out there are stoners? Geeze, I've got to put you in touch with the nightly news. That sounds like one of the statistics they would throw up there without bothering to check it. If even 20% of the people did, that would be a HUGE political force to be dealt with, and Its almost certain that it would be legal. The actual numbers don't back you up, unless you are basing it on your own experiences, and biasing the results by simply hanging out with a bunch of pot-heads. I'd be willing to bet that is the case.<br>
<br>
P.S. Good luck on trying to become a cop. I'm fairly certain drug testing and background checks are involved in that process for most jurisdictions. a police record and a positive drug test aren't going to make it any easier on you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublazeodead.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blaze ODead</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/1/02 4:19:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4731.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I've never written a DWI.

<br>
I'm 18 now, i've had my lisence since i was 16, but it hasn't been quite two years yet (not till may).  For the first year and change that I had my lisence, i drove a run down 1982 volvo sedan and never got looked twice at by a cop.  I had no clue why everyone was ranting so much about cops and the such constantly, as they had never done anything to me.  Well, I enjoy cars a lot, and I bought a 1984 buick regal, that passes as a muscle car for the 80's, though it only has a 3.8 liter v6 (though i wish it had a 350 or a turbo v6).  <br>
<br>
here's a pic of the type of car i have, mine is soild blue with a vynal roof and chrome rims, and a different grill style <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.aol.com/mikalito/featuretest.jpg">members.aol.com/mikalito/featuretest.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
anyways, its been 5 months since i've gotten my buick.  Since then, i've been pulled over 6 times.  My driving habits havn't changed one bit, but the cops see the car and they'll pass up whatever they're doing and follow me, and find the smallest reason to pull me over.  I got a speeding ticket that wasn't on radar, the cop thought I was racing the car next to me, and I was just going next to it at 10 over (which i have no problem admiting was speeding, but he wrote me up for 25 over becuse thats what it looked like).  I've gotten warnings for haivng my exhaust too loud, 1/5 of my tailight out, having too dark of window tint (had it removed, was legal in maryland where it was put on).  Then last week I got a 92 dollar ticket for rolling through a stop sign ever so slowly.  I just feel like they go after me because they know i'm a teenager, and they know my car is for looks.  Pisses me off because now i'm probably gonna lose my lisence for 2 months since i havn't had it for 2 years, for rolling a stop sign, its a crock load of @#%$.<br>
<br>
(got out of the first ticket through defensive driving classes)<br>

yes, she and I spent 2 days in @#%$ court arguing over this.<br>
yes, she ended up with 500$ in fines because a cop saw a beer can on top of her car.<br>

The cops in my area are the laziest people ever. They will &quot;camp&quot; the places teenagers travel through or hang out at and bust them for really stupid reasons. Then there's the kids who smoke (under 18!) outside the stores across from the highschool. Where's the cop?

I started this rant because one of the 30,000 users on here is some form of cop. And I wanted them to look at this and remember it the next time they bust someone. It may not change how they feel, or how they act, but when they look into the eyes of the person they are busting, they will remember this, and hopefully, they will give someone a break.

<br>
Yup, at least here in Pennsylvania, DUI is driving under the influence of anything.<br>
<br>
DWI, however, is driving while intoxicated, and that's generally only alcohol.<br>
<br>
As for this quote... it's laughable...<br>
<br>
"One of the few cops I respect has mine because he said 'I've never written a DWI. I've never issued a drug citation. I've never given a speeding ticket. Because of al the @#%$ up things that go on in this world, why should I be spending my time and joe shmoe's time with something that will end up in paper work for me, bills for him, and the feeling that cops are there to screw you. I have better things to do with my time, like busting people that actually need it.'"<br>
<br>
That is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard, in all honesty.  I know for a fact, from statistics (I saw them in a book not more than a week ago), that these 'people that actually need it' are MUCH rarer than things like traffic citations and DUI's.  DUI's endager lives much more than rapists or murderers, because there are so many more of them and what they're doing is just as deadly.  That cop is an idiot... he needs to start doing his @#%$ job and not believing that fairy tale life of a cop that he grew up learning about... Bust the robber, drag the murderer in, beat up the rapist... all in the regular day of a cop!  Guess what the real regular day of a cop is... desk work, traffic citations, DUI's... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utrolojesterkinng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trolo Jesterkinng</A> at: 4/1/02 8:18:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udaemoniaai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaemoniaAI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/1/02 9:07:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4731.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> &quot;My brother (22) and my boyfriend (23) both have this intense hate-on for law enforcement&quot;<br>

sounds like a couple good guys...honestly<br>
<br>
cops are a joke...they abuse their power...how many times have i seen the town hero football player get into brawls and let go to his fathers custody without anything being done so he can play in the big game? too many...<br>
<br>
how many times have me and my friends stopped because 'they want to question us' and then patted down because of an anonymous tip given to the pigs by someone who thought we were up to no good (illegal btw see FLA vs JL)? too many times...<br>
<br>
every cop ive come into contact with (which is quite a few) has been an arogant piece of @#%$ who calls me boy and son because im younger than they are...how many times have i been threatend with arrest because i dont sit there and bend over to them? a lot...so i just keep talkin @#%$ and if they arrest me so be it...@#%$ the pigs <p><center><B>Daemonia Abefa'Ira</B><BR>57 Beguiler<BR>[no guild]

<br>
Have you ever read To Kill a Mockingbird?  Mayella Ewell pulls this same crap on Atticus when he's just being respectful to her using.<br>
<br>
Boy and son may not be deragatory... I can see how boy might be bad (depending on how it was said), but son?  Come on.<br>
