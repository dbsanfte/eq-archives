I was thinking about that, and to me it seemed silly so I conducted a green svart killing test.  I used two setups:<br>
<br>
Setup 1:  2h Infernal soulblade, 5.5 sp with stats 38+8 sword and 34+2 crit.<br>
<br>
Setup 2:  Arcanium sword 4.1 sp with infernal spined axe 4.0 sp with stats 38+2 sword, 39+11 L axe, and 34+2 cs.<br>
<br>
I went to spin and perfed 10 thralls with each setup and recorded the damage.  With setup 1 the damage is the perf style+the sword base damage.  With setup 2 the damage is the perf style + sword base+L. axe base.<br>
<br>
The averaged results:<br>
<br>
Setup 1: 492.8 dam<br>
Setup 2: 484.6 dam<br>
<br>
My class specific advantage allows me to do 8 more damage per perf for the price of another 1.5 seconds of delay along with loss of the ability apply 2 poisons at the same time.   <br>
<br>
The point:  Using a 2h to perf is not what everyone thinks it is, and it makes me mad when even the dev's believe it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 6:33:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3897.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SB's Advantage is being able to crit with 2h weapons?  </span><hr size=1> Hey,<br>
<br>
Did you check to be sure the thrall's were all the same level?<br>
<br>
Anyways, I agree two handed perfs don't really make a lot of difference.  It  would have been an okay statement had they left in stealthed one shot.  But sbs get hammered for having something that used to be pretty effected.  Our main ra is even geered towards stealthed one shots..that don't exist.  <br>
<br>
Most of the critblades I know now go 1h with an extra poison on left axe to avoid the long delay.<br>

<br>
No in depth numbers - but i did it a lot of times against Spindels in spindelhalla to ease the boredome of soloing.  I used a crafted dwarven arcanium 2hander and a crafted arc bastard sword/arc hand axe.<br>
<br>
The varience on my 2hander was all over the place from 60 below my LA perf to 150 above it.  with the LA combo, I had 4.0 +2.4 /2 for 3.2 second delay as opposed to the 5 second delay on the 2hander.  <br>
<br>
Recently I need to get in in my CD FAST before I get Instamezzed.   the 2hander just doesn't cut it- anyone worth anything can <br>
a) move out of the way<br>
b) step through cd<br>
c) insta mez or even quickcast stun/mez/root me<br>
<br>
Mabye a full critblade spec would have enough of a first hit to kill the caster... or at least get it low enough so that a few tics of poison will take out the caster before he nukes you to death. <p>Pitz

The Critblade spec often yielded damage in excess of 900 points.  Back before epic armor, when we could still remain stealthed after a oneshot, this DID give shadowblades an advantage.  They could oneshot a much higher percentage of their targets, making it more likely that they could kill quite a few people and never get discovered.  Infs one-shotted far less often, most capping damage at around 650 to 700 points.  I'm not sure where NSs capped at, but I'd think it was somewhere around the Infs numbers.<br>
<br>
The primary advantage of the 2H was that you could chain kill people and not really have to worry too much about getting discovered and killed.  With the removal of one-shot stealth, it doesn't really matter much if you do 900 or 600 points of damage (or more realistically 300 or 400 with epic).  Either way you are going to unstealth.  The only advantage I see of a 2H now is that it MIGHT allow you to one-shot someone who might otherwise be able to avoid a second attack (i.e. insta mez, insta stun, insta heal, etc.).<br>
<br>
The 2H weapon thing is kinda cool, but it probably shouldn't be called a real advantage anymore.  There is however, the 15% damage bonus to two handed weapons to consider.  /shrug <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarxantael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arxantael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/6/02 11:37:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3897.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SB's Advantage is being able to crit with 2h weapons?  </span><hr size=1> 2 Handers are definately a thing of the Past and Battlegrounds.

Are you a five spec now?  I am and I am really interested in trying this spec.<br>
<br>
A friend told me he has a spec of high sword, high cs, 36 stealth and like 38 envenom.  He has lifebane.  He is really pleased with this spec and I am considering switching to that from five spec.  This guy opens with a 2h.<br>
<br>
I have a second friend who is also specced like this and he opens with a 1hand for speed with nonskilled la for poison.  I read somewhere that we can copy to pend now.  I want to do some testing on that myself if I can.<br>

<br>
Total PA damage is base weapon damage + PA bonus damage.  PA bonus damage is not dps based, so all things being equal the bonus damage on the 5.5 and the 4.1 will be the same.  However, the base damage is dps based so a 5.5 spd weap will hit for much more base damage (and thus more total PA damage) than a 4.1 spd weap.     <br>
<br>
Lets do the math:<br>
<br>
5.5/4.1 = 1.34 - the 5.5 is 34% slower, so that if effective DPS, qual, etc. of weapons is the same, the 5.5 will hit for 34% more per swing.  <br>
<br>
If the 5.5 hit for only 8pts more, then 8pts = 34% of your total base damage with the 4.1 spd weapon.  This means that your total base damage with the 4.1 spd weapon was only 23.53 points (1/.34 = 2.94117  and 2.94117 X 8 pts = 23.53 pts).  A base damage of only 23.53 is not really a fair example because I'm sure a lvl 50 hits for a much, much higher base damage then that.  <br>
<br>
Here is a more realistic example:  if a 4.1 spd weapon would have hit for 132 base damage then moving to a 5.5 spd will add an additional 45 points of damage  (177).   Since each lvl of CS adds only +9 to PA CAP (which transilates into a mere 4.5 pts on average) using a 5.5 spd weapon is like having an additional 10 levels of Crit Strike with a 4.1 spd weapon.  <br>
<br>
This means alot.  The slowest Albion thruster I can use is 3.7 spd gladius.  I would have hit for 119 base dmg.  177 damage with a 5.5 2-H is like a 13 CS lvl advantage over me.  Not to mention, I didn't even account for the additional damage bonus 2-H weaps have.  <br>
<br>
A 2-H means you'll one-shot more than a 1-H weap user w/ equal CS spec.  Even with the one-shot-stealth nerf, this is still important.  It  means your more likely to avoid insta mez, heal, stun, etc.  <br>
<br>
Alternatively, the 2-H advantage lets you spec 10 or more levels lower in CS then an Inf/NS, and still have the same PA damage.  You can put all the extra spec points into LA which is much, much better then DW/CD.  <br>
<br>
Just hotkey your 1-H weapons and switch after PA.  Even though an Inf or NS has the chance to hit with off hand on PA and apply 2 poisons, there is also a chance he may have to wait 2-3 combat rounds before off hand swings.  The fact that the LA user will always swing w/ both weapons every round makes up for using a single 2-H weapon in the first combat round.  <br>

<br>
The 4.0 delay sword + L axe will hit for something like 50-60% over 1h 4.0 delay due to L axe skill and level.  The exact number is hard to know because mythic changed it 2-3 times.<br>
<br>
In my case the base damage per hit from sword+L axe with 4.0 delay is about the same as damage per hit from a 2h with 5.5 delay.  <br>
<br>
I have no idea why anyone would want to use a 2h to perf with.  You can do as much with L axe like I have shown here.  You also get to apply 2 poisons and have to wait 1.5 seconds less before you get to swing again.  I have perfed with a 2h sword, and while you are standing there waiting for the creeping death you feel very silly and vulnerable, and often your target manages to wiggle out of view or cast on you.  I also get way better to use with L axe than the CS line or from my sword line.<br>

<br>
Prior to evade fixes and dodger, frontloaded 2h damage was always superiour to 1 handed / dual for a number of reasons, some of which include<br>
<br>
#1  1h users attack faster for less damage.  When the target is out of view / range they gain more delay between attacks (or lose rounds of attack).  A good critblade could garrot, which does snare (and the snare will stick because there is no second hit), kite a few steps out of range, and garrot again - repeat, which effectivly makes the dual wield user's higher speed dual weapons much less effective.  Prior to the /stick fix, there was really no way at all to keep up with a joust fighter other than doing the same thing they are doing, which doesnt work with dual wield.<br>
<br>
#2.  faster and slower weapons of equal dps (excluding the 2h damage bonus) may do the same damage over time, but the 2h will always do it faster because the 1h requires a second hit.  3 round fights favor 2h weapons when the person's chance to avoid the attack is virtually nothing.<br>
<br>
#3.  2h perf is potentiallly (and pre epic armor was) the most powerful melee attack in the game, and quite possibly the most powerful attack of any kind in the game.  Couple that with one shotting and you have yourself a nifty setup.<br>
<br>
<br>
add in dodger, epic armor, and a few other nifty things like backup styling and all this flips around<br>
<br>
2h user has good frontloaded damage, but the fight lasts longer, and people have a much better chance to avoid the attack.  Faster weapons can now semi reliably do reactionarys also, which a 2h generally doesnt do as well.  Sorta does make them more of a liablility i would say now.  All perfs generally are ghetto unless botted also, so as the original posted said, 2h isnt much of an advantage NOW,  it WAS back before 1.50 though.<br>
<br>
If evade styles could be done off of offhand attacks on LA, I would be afraid to melee if i were a SB.<br>

39 Sword<br>
34 CS<br>
33 Stealth<br>
27 Env<br>

I'm not sure what I'm going to do, I like being able to stun mages with PA CD before they can quickast me. After that, a DF usually cuts them down with help from DOT and Enervating.<br>
<br>
As we are losing a lot due to new resistences and the new poisons going it, I think it will be important to have high Env.  I'm considering lowering LA and upping env.  I think with SC, my LA damage won't suck too bad 50 vs 54 LA with items only.<br>
<br>
I am really debating lowering my Weapon to 37 or 35.<br>
If I lower it to 37 I can get 35 env.<br>
If I lower it to 35 I can get 35 env and 35 stealth (better run spd) <p>Pitz

The answer is yes.. There are Happy, 4 Specs out there.. I am one.. Autotrained stealth to level 40, Specs at 50 are 40 Stealth 40 CS, 40 Env 40 Sword. I us a 2 handed arcanium 90% of the time RvR with Lifebane, and in my 3 weeks of full time RvR, I have pushed past 350k rps. My CD now only serves to stun the target so I can run, as lifebane is what I rely on to kill 90% of my targets.<br>
<br>
I can oneshot casters (standing and sitting) in epic depending on their buffs/class/spec, have little trouble taking out most archers, healer classes etc. About the only things that I fear are other Stealther Classes, Archers + Truesight, and Tanks (of course).<br>
