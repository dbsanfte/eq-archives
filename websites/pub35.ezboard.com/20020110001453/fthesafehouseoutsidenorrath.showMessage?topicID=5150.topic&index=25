Ebonics is basically a slurred form of english spoken primarily by lower class blacks in the inner cities.  <br>
<br>
As for it being used in schools?  Around my area is mostly used by middle class kids (of all colors) who think they're gangsters, and real k3wl d00dz.  <br>
<br>
I've always attended suburban schools, so thats the only perspective I can offer on that. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uglipthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glip the Gnome</A> at: 12/16/01 6:21:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usnottra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snot Tra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/16/01 6:40:33 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://qxylji.homestead.com/files/Snotra.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebonics.....</span><hr size=1> Just curious..

*edit* If you dislike Ebonics, take a trip to Belize! Spent a year there in in the 80's.  They speak what is commonly referred to as &quot;Pigeon English&quot;. Its VERY difficult to understand. <br>

Sometimes those jokes can be funny.  I don't take offense to the jokes on Mad TV or King of the Hill.  But I didn't think this joke was funny.  <br>

Anyway Sawin said &quot;Warning(?) Language(?)&quot; and I corrected him saying the warning should be &quot;racial stereotypes&quot; because there really isn't language.  What racial stereotypes?  That blacks talk like that, call women &quot;hos,&quot; drive Cadillacs, are ex-cons and deadbeat dads, etc.  If you don't think that's a stereotype, what is it then, reality?<br>

Maybe, a bit.  Except that most asians lose that accent completely after being the first generation born in the US, and most would gladly speak &quot;newscaster English&quot; if only they could.<br>
<br>
Stytch - <br>
<br>
Ebonics is the term given (by whom I do not know) to some flavor of American black slang.  Perhaps 7 or so years ago, the Oakland school district sought to teach it as a legitimate alternative to the formal rules of American English.  They immediately ran into criticism from almost all educators, of whatever ethnicity.  Many black leaders expressed sympathy for the motivations (give inner city youth some self esteem and validation), but condemned the proposal as dangerous (what better way to keep kids down that to teach them to speak in a manner which is gauranteed to dispose people badly towards them), poorly defined (who gets to say just what ebonics is, anyway?) and basically at odds with common sense.  Ebonics, to my recollection, was NEVER taught in any public school, and the proponents of it pretty quickly piped down.<br>
<br>
Lots of accents make one sound ignorant to my ears.  Inner city Boston is probably my favorite to pick on.  I have some cousins who grew up in Haverhill, MA.  Good lord, when they talk like that, they sound downright stupid!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Just because one person instantly thinks of one color and one person doesn't, doesn't mean one (or both) are lying, or even deluding themselves. Different people have much different experiences with people speaking Ebonics (or something close), and that colors their perception of who would be speaking it. To some people, it's black and only black people who talk this way. To some it's mainly young whites. In my area, people of many colors and at least 3 definite racial groups speak it. Not all of the young people mind you, but a good mix of the neighborhood at any rate. So personally, when I read something like that, I don't mentally tag a race on the speaker most of the time. (But, also knowing a touch of history and news regarding Ebonics, I'm not ignorant to it's roots and public perceptions, either.)<br>
<br>
I also happen to suspect that the &quot;idiot&quot; perception regarding Ebonics has a lot more to do with the age stereotype than the racial one.  <p><p><table><tr><td>

The world should not cater to you due to your skin color, religious preference, or sexual orientation. Im tired of people crying about being oppressed and stereotyped and trod upon by such examples as the first post here. Jebus H Baldheaded Christ! Is there a difference between a nationally syndicated show on HBO called &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; in which people of a different race spend a good 80% of the program trashing an entirely different race by making amusing anecdotes based solely on the mannerisms of the afore mentioned.<br>
<br>
Notice how I walked on eggshells around that question... as to not offend any of your sensitivities?<br>
<br>
Why should I? Is the same consideration granted to me? No, not anywhere have I seen lately (hmm... lets say in the past 20 years) has anything been equal. Why is it someone in my department who is inept at their job be passed over for a layoff while another perfectly good canidate gets walked out of the building because of a thing that the government requires companies to do that noone likes to talk about?<br>
<br>
See how this subject is escalating? You think that one doesnt have anything to do with another? Well thats where your wrong.<br>
<br>
Im sure someone will misinterpret me as a supremist or the like, but I assure you, thats not me. If you really get the gist of what Im saying, youll realize that Im arguing equality for all.<br>

There are enough white suburban wanna-be gang bangers out there that talk like this to make it an equal opportunity annoyance. <p><SELECT NAME="D1">
