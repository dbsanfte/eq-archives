I can't take damage but my damage output pulls agro on me like an overnuking raid wizard. To save myself death &amp; party mana I have to FD, which dramatically cuts my damage output. This is a horrible circle I've been put in.<br>
my only solution is to be grouped with an SK my level as tank or a warrior 4+ levels higher that remembers (s)he has a Taunt Button.<br>

After seeing a bard tank better than me with the same mobs, and having comparable gear and stats, I want to know why this bard should be able to tank better than a monk who supposedly is a master of the body. At least, doesn't it say that in the description? <br>
<br>
Dying 5-10 times a night pulling, instead of maybe once or twice, is rediculous. My clerics are tired of rezzing me, tired of buffing for sure. Splitting 4c was hard enough in cazic. And while I would go there before, I won't go there now. Unless I'm not pulling, because it's such a waste of time if I'm doing it now. I think what bothers me the most is not only Verant ignoring us, but also that when I hit 60, the nerf hit, and now I can't do half of what I used to at even 55. Some advancement that was. It's dumb, I'm tired of it.. <br>
<br>
And this isn't the only thing, actually receiving a response from a GM that a guide would say would talk to you, never happens.

Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks. Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment. This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose. <br>
<br>
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character. It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br>
<br>
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness. This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game. Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br>
<br>
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power. The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this. Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class. Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem. <br>
<br>
Monk defense will be altered somewhat. It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes. (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.) It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to. As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br>
<br>
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it. What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks. The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.&quot;<br>

Believe me EVERY monk is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>VERY</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> familar with that bit of text.<br>

<br>
Never-the-less it doesn't really explain very much about HOW the nerf was done, nor what they intend to do (if anything) about the ways in which a monk is now subpar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nor about the envisioned role of a monk post-nerf (unless the role was subpar to pretty much every other class in every situation).<br>
<br>
<br>
Depending on what the envisioned role is to be post nerf (purely damage dealer etc.) then post nerf they need to do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (not all, just one) of the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Increase avoidance so damage taken is same as pre-nerf, only more is avoided now mitigated.<br>
<br>
2. Increase inate monk damage (either through upgrading the damage tables again or something like an offhand damage bonus)<br>
<br>
3. Give monks some group utility.<br>
<br>
4. Un-nerf monk and use alternative solution. i.e. Fix Taunt and make monks generate less hate (thanks Korph <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) or give warriors a mitigation bonus. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fopoodzo@monklybusiness43508>Fopoodzo</A> at: 10/24/02 10:47:33 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skykungfu>SkyKungfu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 11:54:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Keamil u retard stop posting the patch message all over our board.<br>

Post nerf you're offbase a bit there, post nerf monks would be at the bottom of that, maybe even under rangers.<br>
<br>
Looking at the wider picture it looks something like below, the main issue is that in almost every situation one class does almost everything better than a monk (post-nerf), yet the one thing monks are still supposed to be, in fact the thing monks are being <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>nerfed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> into being, toe to toe damage dealer, monks no longer really have the tools to equip them for it. <br>
<br>
i.e not enough damage when compared to warriors (real tanks), or many hybrids, plus an inability to take hits, and no ability to reduce hate without also reducing DPS, not good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
To make it balanced in the role VI seems to be nerfing monks into, that of pure damage dealer, it would have to be something like this:<br>
<br>
(damage) rogue&gt;&gt;monk&gt;&gt;warrior<br>
(tanking) warrior&gt;&gt;monk&gt;\=rogue<br>
<br>
(rogues still come out ahead, but their damage is more situational)<br>
<br>
Not to mention that hybrids are beginning to equal monk in damage, tanking and still have spells etc (which also renders FD less useful as FD pulling in many cases is now better done with a SK than a monk).<br>

It's the old &quot;hybrid&quot; paradox that paladins were caught in. The place for a monk to be is between warrior and rogue in terms of damage and defence. The &quot;balanced&quot; warrior if you will.<br>
<br>
However the hybrid has to be almost as good as both parent classes or it takes a massive penalty for never being the best at anything. Paladin's used to have 80% warrior DPS and woefully inferior cleric spells. So while they could fight and heal they would never actually do anything well. And an efficient party, or raid, always wants the best.<br>
<br>
At the moment monks are sizeably outdamaged by rogues. If you have to add the most damage for one group slot you would be insane to pick anything else. That would be cool if monks were reasonable tanks as well. Such that warrior, monk and monk, rogue would be synergistic partnerships.<br>
<br>
But they pushed it too far I think. The monk is now such a poor tank that they are often unsatisfactory as tanks. Meaning that their only claim to fame is damage, which they are inferior to rogues in and not always that much higher than warriors or rangers outside of end game weapons.<br>

Where did all this suddenly arise that warriors were dealing close to the damage of a monk? On a post-nerf parse from Statue, our top monk parsed out about 9.5 DPS higher than our top warrior. Comparitively speaking, that was about 16-17% better. In that scenario; the warrior had far better damage equipment (TSBS (53/45) vs. primal 2hb (45/44). The warrior was also in the bard group; which means he had higher ATK and additional haste. Had all situations been normal, and we were parsing our top warrior damage dealer vs. our top monk damage dealer under the same damage-dealing scenarios; I have no doubt the monk would parse out at least 30% more damage than teh warrrior. Even if the monk parsed out 25%; this is far more than the 5% some people here are suggesting.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xiththewizard>Xith the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 12:09:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what balance?</span><hr size=1> Warrior Damage, better than monk damage ... you are smoking crack, and lots of it ... laced with heroin or something.<br>
<br>
Last statue raid i remember parsed (we stopped parsing after our statue days, it got to be too much work):<br>
<br>
Warrior average Damage ~11k<br>
Monk average Damage ~ 20k<br>
<br>
seems a bigger gap that just 5%<br>
<br>
At 59, West ToV/North ToV weapons ... i have a hard time keeping up in damage with a monk 5 levels lower than me, with his fists.<br>
<br>
Yes monks ... a Warrior weilding NToV/WToV weapons, is outdamaged by a monk and his fists.  With equal gear said monk would have his epic.  <br>
<br>
Monk epic not even in the same league as ToV weapons ... its much earlier in the game.<br>
<br>
the difference between monk damage and warrior damage is so insane, how can you even try to compare.<br>
<br>
Even using 2handers, monks will own me for damage.<br>
<br>
so stop whining, you got what you needed.  Balance.<br>
<br>
Monks were described as a class that does a decent amount of damage, armed or unarmed, with equiptment or without,  with penaltys in defense, due to there lack of available gear.<br>
<br>
You just got your penalty in defense, which was one of the principal explainations of your class.<br>
<br>
Monks are traditionally, by definition, scholars and priests of martial disciplines.  Monks are poor, they have no need for wealth, and they get by with what they have, without complaint. <br>
<br>
All i see is a bunch of children that didnt get that carton of milk before nap time.  <br>
<br>
Ive read through this post, front to end ... and it took me a while, and i was curious. <br>
<br>
Most of you have no clue what your talking about when it comes to warrior damage.  Bards outdamage us.  Bards and melee casters.  Yes monks, warriors have some of the worst DPS in the game, why, because a tank knows hes not there to do damage, he equips himself to hold aggro any way he can, this means aggro procs (Slows, stuns, dots, debuffs, Enraging blow), usually at the cost of DPS, DDs arnt aggro procs, neither are lifetaps, thats why a wizzy can chain nuke against a good tank and not get summoned (i know from experiance).<br>
<br>
so yeah ... continue your holy crusade to get warrior damage nerfed ... or monk damage increased ... just know that youll be tanking, because if you do any more damage than your already insane numbers, it wont matter what kind of outrageous double EB procing 40/10 weapons a warrior gets his hand on, we wont be able to keep aggro from a monk.  Its hard enough as it is, because you do so much damage compared to us.<br>

<br>
But they pushed it too far I think. The monk is now such a poor tank that they are often unsatisfactory as tanks.

Yup post nerf there's little reason to take a monk over anyone else (only real reason is where FD pulling is vital and a SK can do that better than a monk in a lot of cases - plus VI doesn't support FD pulling).<br>
<br>
Pure melee balance has been thrown out of the window, it wouldn't take much to regain it, a small damage increase or a small avoidance increase, or un-nerfing monks and giving warriors a mitigation bonus.

Those of you who actually believe that monks and warriors do roughly equal damage in roughly eqiovalent gear are in serious need of a cranial-rectal removal procedure. I'm not here to offer numbers or pick apart special abilities and attacks. Even your elders here know this to be true. Take time now to sit back and listen to them. Learn from your sensei and perhaps one day you will surpass them. Until then, you really are naught but a young grasshoppah. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=336.topic&start=221&stop=238>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=336.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=336.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.emailToFriend?topicID=336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.threadControl?topicID=336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=336.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=336.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17>Monk Change</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
