<br>
As my journey begins, I find myself standing next to the bank in High Keep. Ah, familiar ground...the place I have hunted for many levels, ridding their area of goblins...I still don't understand why they don't like me. On this day, I venture down into the depths of High Keep and find all rooms full. Having been here awhile, I decide to find a change of scenery - The Overthere. I wave goodbye to the great exp and nice loot and set off.<br>
<br>
I cross over into High Pass, wandering into a few gnolls on my way to Kithicor Forest. I kill them easily, laughing in the face of the once-blue/yellow, now-green foes that had once caused my death. <br>
<br>
Safely arriving in Kithicor, I pause. Was this the place where the undead roamed at night? Or was it just another newbie forest? Looking at my time monitor, I discover that it is just after 5 AM. I decide to sit and wait until it is light. No use dying needlessly, right? I set out on my way to West Commonlands, having only a zone-connection map and a cloth map of the continents (pre-Velious) given to me by a generous Iksar warrior as my guide. I sneak/hide here and there, as I come across things that appear ready to attack me. I know they are green and an easy kill, but why waste my time? I'm on an adventure!<br>
<br>
I run along the path, smiling as I pass the younger ones, killing the green snakes and beetles. Suddenly, I come to a toll booth, with a sign that says &quot;Pay Toll.&quot; I hail the guard next to me, and he tells me to pay a toll of 2 gold pieces (or was it two silver pieces?). Not wanting to upset anyone, I gladly hand over two gold pieces to the guard. He promptly tells me that I should be paying someone else instead. I look around, but can find noone else to pay. Glancing nervously behind me, I continue on my way, expecting someone to come out of nowhere and accost me, asking for money. Thankfully, this never happens. Maybe it's because I'm a big Barbarian! *stands tall* Well, maybe not.<br>
<br>
Having made it to East Commonlands, I figure I'm safe. Looking to my cloth continental map, I find that I should have to go southwest to get to my next destination of the Northern Desert of Ro. I enter a tunnel with merchants. Wonderful! Time to buy some of those bandages...<br>
<br>
I ask a fellow traveler if this is the way to the Northern Desert of Ro. Being assured that it is, I zone on in. I ask for the location of the Oasis of Marr, since I'm not exactly sure where I zoned in at, and my zone connection map does not have a location grid. I am answered pretty quickly by &quot;you are joking, right?&quot; to which I reply &quot;no, I have never been here before...&quot; Thankfully, someone soon gives me a location to head to. I go on my way, taking in the sights around me. Being new to this land, I also sneak/hide a bit. It is slow going, but I certainly do not want to start over from way back in High Keep, where I am bound. As I near the said location, I look for tunnels or anything to suggest a zone. Seeing nothing, I continue on until I approach some fellow travelers. I ask if they could point the way to the Oasis of Marr, and one of them points straight ahead. I thank them, take two steps forward, and zone into the Oasis, feeling more than a little silly.<br>
<br>
I reach into my bag and pull out a zone map of the Oasis of Marr. Pretty straightforward (why did I bother getting a map? finding out on your own where you need to go is more fun...oh well), right? I walk toward where I believe the docks are. I sneak/hide for a little while, as this is another new zone to me, and I do not wish to die and be thrown back to High Keep. It does not occur to me to get bound here or anywhere else along my journey (if that is even possible), because I have not yet reached my ultimate destination. (go ahead, laugh. I know you want to. Hell, even I laugh about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But this is how we learn, by experiencing it ourselves.)<br>
<br>
I look ahead of me and see...the dock! Gleefully, I step onto the docks, stop sneak/hiding, and sit down to await the boat. I hail a fellow traveler and ask if I'm in the right place to head to Overthere on the boat. Assured that I am, I wait with the others. At one point, I look up and realize that no one else is there on the docks. At virtually the same instant, I am hit by none other than a sand giant! I con him (of course he's red to me) and realize I have no hope. Someone says &quot;run!&quot;, but to where? The zone was miles away! My last thought was to jump in the water, but it was too late. I was toast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Back in High Keep. A little disappointed, but maybe I could get a port from a friend of mine to somewhere in the general area. No such luck. He wasn't online. Ok, no big deal, I know the zones more now, I can take another trip over there (lol...sigh it's been a long day already) myself. I zoned into High Pass and immediately get two tells saying &quot;I see your corpse here, do you need a rez?&quot; I was astonished because no one had ever offered me a rez before. So I jumped at the chance, naturally! I got a 56 rez and 8 random buffs on top of that! I offered to pay the guy all I had on me (or my corpse, as it were), which was about 26 platinum. He would not accept payment. I was floored. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The genuinely nice people that come along kind of wipe out all those not-so-nice people. It was wonderful. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Right about that time, a friend of mine that I had met fighting in High Keep showed up. He was on his way to Overthere too, and he had been there before (which was obviously one up on me), so he offered to guide me the rest of the way. By this time I'm feeling like a really lucky girl. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He took me to the docks from where my corpse had been dragged and along the way, he was kind enough to warn me about the sand giants (grr...) and the spectres. He said that basically everything else in the zone was just fine. We sat on the docks and waited (this time I decided to stay hidden while I was on the docks, hehehe) for the barge to come along. <br>
<br>
We boarded the barge and I got to watch the sunrise. It was beautiful against the water. Eventually we zoned...<br>
<br>
As soon as I got into The Overthere, I received a tell from my friend, saying &quot;HIDE FAST AND JUMP!!&quot; Knowing that the shore held good-race hating guards, I sneak hid and jumped into the water. The problem with that was that as you all know, sneak hide swimming is agonizingly slow. So as I was trying to surface, I noticed that I was running out of air. I had to stop sneak hiding to be able to breathe again. I'm sure you can all guess what happened next. As soon as I got to the shore I had some random thing and about three guards on me and I went to swim with the fishes again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Back in High Keep. |l At this point I was ready to give up, and I told my friend so as well. I figured I would just go on a CR later, dammit. But my friend would have none of it, and found someone to rez me AGAIN. I was further amazed when my friend insisted on paying for the rez himself. He said, &quot;I was in trouble and needed help too once.&quot; I haven't even known this friend that long! Holy cow, there are some NICE people out there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
By now the adventure is winding down...they dragged my corpse to a safe area, rezzed me, and that was that. It took a long, long time, but I finally made it to...The Overthere. Here's to hoping I like it, lol. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulivonya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Livonya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/30/01 12:56:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=809.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~rgratzer/images/circle2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Journey to The Overthere</span><hr size=1> No adventures in Timorous Deep on the barge or waiting for the big ugly boat?

<br>
Anyway, good story and I'm glad you got there okay eventually. I would suggest going to cheery ol' Firiona Vie, though, unless you really like hunting so close to danger and darkies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usadelia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadelia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/31/01 5:28:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=809.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~pamalam/_uimages/kitty.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Journey to The Overthere</span><hr size=1> Sounds like many of the adventures I have had.
