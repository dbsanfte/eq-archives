Nights alone.  He huddles there, among the green folds of the rolling hills, an invisible shadow.<br>
<br>
It begins to rain.  He hates the rain.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Still. Still.  Stay Still, D. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Three inches to his right, a squirrel scampers towards a nut on the ground, completely ignoring him.  He kills it without a thought, a twitch, planting his short dagger between its skull and its spinal cord, severing all life instantaneously.  <br>
<br>
He doesn't even move his head, doesn't blink.<br>
<br>
Quickly, silently, almost without effort, the steely blade slips from the dead animals body and back into the manifold of his black cloak.  A tight quiver rips through his body, every muscle tenses.  And releases.<br>
<br>
Rain patters incessantly against his hood.  He hates the rain.  In the distance, the dying remains of the reddened sun slip behind the jagged teeth of the mountains.  He sighs, then stands up, removing his cloak to reveal a dark, padded tunic, a pair of brown leather leggings, and long, soft boots.  On his chest, he wears a dull, bluish-silver medallion.<br>
<br>
He grasps it now, in his black-gloved hands, rubbing the smooth surface with his thumb.<br>
<br>
A scream comes from deep within--some primal yell, a flashfire, boiling up from within his heart, throttling heedlessly down his narrow throat, and then thundering violently out of his outstretched maw--a scream no man could understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;RELEASE ME!!!&quot;<br>

<br>
Its not like he could he could help it.  He, after all, was a rogue.  A thief.  A regular taffer extraordinaire.  <br>
<br>
So when she, the richest Madame in all of Freeport, strolled by him lugging that overly heavy platinum purse of hers, he couldn't help but relieve her of the terrible, weighty burden.<br>
<br>
And so he did.<br>
<br>
Right in front of Captain Moore.<br>
<br>
But no man could catch Dmitri Shadowstepper, no man.  Especially not some oaf weighed down with a hundred pounds of steel armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;C'mon Moore!  Surely they trained you to catch rogues in Goon School!  One so frail as I should be kidstuff for a war-weary vet like you!&quot;<br>
<br>
True to his name, Dmitri quickly ducked round a corner into a familiar alleyway, into the shadows, and out of immediate harm.<br>
<br>
Once he had lost the trail, Moore loosed a harsh yell: &quot;Your time is soon, Dmitri.  I'll make sure of it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dmitri, of course, didn't hear him.  Minutes earlier, he had ducked beneath an iron grating, and into his own domain--the sewer. <br>
<br>
 Down the long black tunnel.  He couldn't see, but it didn't matter.  He knew it by heart.  Thirty four wide paces, left, two-hundred and sixteen, right, ten, down, forty-four, right again, and then straight, straight ahead.<br>
<br>
The dim, flickering glow of firelight was barely visible from the end of the long tunnel.  Home.  His pace quickened, his breath shortened, and soon, he ducked beneath the low, circular entrance of his room.  He took a deep breath as he glanced at the familiar surroundings.  The floor, unlike the rest of the rest of the sewers, was of dry (or about as dry as one could get in a sewer), worn cobblestone, raw after years of enduring the incessant pacings of its owner.  Pressed up against the left wall was a simple, wooden table--four legs, two pieces of wood for the surface-- he had pilfered long ago from some ancient scholar at the Academy, Sagehand something-or-other.  Easy job, really.  Just went in the door, 'appropriated' the table, and back out again.  At night of course.  And during a guild war of some sort, but that really didn't matter.  Hardest part was cramming the thing into the Sewers.  Ended up just cutting it in half with a hatchet he had 'found' earlier, then repairing it in the comfort of his abode deep within the recesses of the sewer.  Did it out of necessity, really.  Gotta have somethin' to write on, after all.  Or forge official documents, as it were.  He moves his eyes from the desk to the fireplace.  Those first nights without a fire were pretty hard, especially in the damp sewer, and any kind of fire pit was out of the question.  Smoke would've filled the place, he'd have died.  End of that story.  So, he jury-rigged a fireplace on the far wall, attaching a hood and a short length of tubing to a disused sewer pipe.  Found out where it went once, too.  Pretty funny stuff.  As it turned out, the pipe eventually led to some new Cleric monastery in the midst of construction.  So when smoke began piping out of their sanctuary floor, the elders concluded Innoruuk himself had defiled the ground.  Course, they had to stop construction of the place immediatley.  Cost ‘em a lot of money, apparently.  Funny stuff.  His steely eyes shifted from the fire to his favorite place in the whole of Norrath—his cot.  Made out of the skin of a kodie.  Killed it himself, skinned it too.  Well, after it brutally mauled most of the rest of his party, but, well, that’s doesn’t really matter.  Got a good bed out of it, after all, and nobody else was around to tell it different.  His eyes moved on, from the bed, and settle firmly on an old friend, who, at the moment, was hanging silently from Dmitri’s clothesline.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhh, Magnus... I'm home.  Didja miss me?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bat didn't respond.  He never did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh.  I knew you'd say that.  Well if my mere presence doesn't get your wings a flappin' mebbe this will!&quot;  He held up his newly acquired coin-sack.  The bat remained motionless.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, well the sack itself isn't really all that interesting I guess.  Standard leather make, you've seen it all before, right?  Well how about this!&quot;  Dmitri drew a fistfull of platinum coins out of the bag.  The bat tilted its head, imperceptibly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thats it, Magnus?  Thats all the reaction I get out of you?&quot;  Dmitri grabbed some of the coins and flung them at the disinterested bat, missing.<br>
<br>
&quot;EEE!  EEE!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Haha.  I knew that would wake you up.  Good times this week.  Too bad you hate the light and all.  I know youd’ve been proud of my skullduggery.  Single-handedly cut down three rampaging Sand Giants in Northern Ro on my way back from…&quot;<br>
<br>
“EEE!”<br>
<br>
“Oh, ok, two then.”<br>
<br>
Magnus remained silent.  “Fine, none.  I didn’t kill anything in the last week.  Not a single Veeshan-be-damned thing.  Not an orc.  Not a skeleton.  Not even a decaying skeleton,” under his breath, he muttered “curse you, bat, always make me tell the truth.”<br>
<br>
“EEE!”<br>
<br>
“Hmmm?  Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t say anything.  I was just clearing my throat.”<br>
<br>
“EEE!  EEE!”<br>
<br>
“Oh right, right.  Bats have good ears.”<br>
<br>
 Dmitri's stomach rumbled.  &quot;Well, Magnus, I know you've got plenty of bugs and such to eat down here, but I need something a little more... digestible.  I'll be back in a bit.&quot;  He ducked out of the without hesitation.<br>
<br>
And ducked back in almost immediately.  “Where is it!  I just had it!”  He began tearing through piles and piles of dirtied cloaks and tunics, old, tattered tablecloths, pieces of discarded bread, a moldy hunk of dried cheese, in all his boxes, taking care to avoid the traps of course, even behind the old picture he has affixed to the wall.  He didn’t even look at it as he frantically stuck his hand into the pipe concealed behind.  Found it posted on a tavern door once.  Says: <br>
<br>
“WANTED: Taffin Coppers, for acts of unconscionable roguery.  <br>
REWARD: 250 Platinum, preferably alive, or corpse in identifiable condition.<br>
<br>
Taffin was an old chum, from back in the early, early days.  They had a contest goin’.  See who could get the highest bounty placed on their heads.  Dmitri had gotten up to three hundred, but Taffin was always one step ahead of him.  Contest ended when Taffin got killed.  Poster was a memento of sorts, he liked to keep it around as a reminder of the little hafling.  The little guy liked to expound big, clever-sounding quotes, which Dmitri had scrawled errantly on the wrinkled surface of the poster: things like “Write the bad things that are done to you in sand, but write the good things that happen to you on a piece of marble”, and “Discretion is being able to raise your eyebrow instead of your voice”.  Too bad lil’ fella didn’t adhere to his own creed.  Made a name for himself pilfering gems, then started a bar fight during the peak of his infamy.  Bad idea, really.<br>
<br>
“Its not here Magnus, where did I put it?”<br>
<br>
“EEE! EE…”<br>
<br>
“Right, right, eee, eee.  Such a wondrous, damn help you are, you little bastard.  Now where is it?”<br>
<br>
His hands plunged into all of the pockets in his cloak for the tenth time.  Nothing but the same three pieces of silver that were there all ten times before.  “Arghh!!!”<br>
<br>
A gleam of light caught the corner of his eye. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>           There it is! </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He scooped up the small, silver medallion from the worn cobblestone, deftly placing it round his neck in one quick motion.  He grasps it in his hand as he ducks out of the low door and into the darkened sewer hall, rubbing the bumpy engraving with his thumb.<br>

He moves from tree to tree, shadow to shadow.  His sillouetted figure is but a blur against the great, infinite span of mountains that spread before him.

“Huh?  Rainin’ again.  Eh, no worries,” Dmitri muttered to himself as he slipped out from beneath the sewer hatch.<br>
<br>
Night had fallen, and the rain striking his pale, white cheeks was bitter cold.  Pulling his hood over his face, Dmitri slipped silently onto the street, heading intently towards a familiar target.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>         Budgins. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Budgins was the proprietor of a local bakery, real small time, of course.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>         Never steal from really rich people.

Spear went right through its beady little eye, into its pea-sized brain, killing it instantaneously. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      They called me a hero.  Captain himself shook my hand.  So why did I hate doing it so much? </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Rain keeps fallin’.  Fallin’ on my hood.” <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Lotsa rain this week.  Blacker’n usual too.  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Budgins wide, oblong-shaped hut crawls into view.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Well, enough thought.  Gotta get to work.  Gotta get movin'. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In through the window, out through the door.  Same job, every week.  Scam a few shark cakes out of the pantries, mebbe filch a cupcake or two.  Never take any money.  After all, gotta keep the lil' gnome in buisiness.<br>
<br>
Job took four minutes.  Every single time, he'd be in, borrow some food, be out, in four minutes.<br>
<br>
As he hastily moved for the door, the exit, a sackful of gold, tipped on its side, caught his eye.  He stopped in his tracks.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      So easy.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  One of his hands involountarily reached out towards the bag.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      No!  Gotta keep movin'!  Gotta keep on runnin'!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  And he is gone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Rain stopped.  Thats a good sign. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  A rush of cold wind bristled through the alleyway, beneath his tunic, up his spine, into his mind.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Better get back.  Gotta bad feeling about this. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He began to run.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Breathin' hard, gotta cool it.  Don't panic. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He rounds a corner.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Uh- </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Dmitri Shadowstepper!  What a pleasure to run into you on such a fine night.  I believe you have something of mine.”  Moore.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      Oh… </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Heya Officer Moore… love to stay and chat, but I got a grumblin’ tummy to feed!”  He turned, ran.<br>
<br>
“Ah Dmitri!  You of all people should know we feed all our prisoners the finest pieces of bread and the purest of water.  And I promise I won’t room you with a troll this time!”  Moore yelled after him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>         He’s not pursuing.  I smell a… </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Three more guards in front of him, brandishing some really sharp swords.<br>
<br>
“TRAP!”<br>
<br>
He wheeled in place, turning headlong for somewhere… somewhere safe.<br>
<br>
Moments later, the lead guard heaved his great sword directly at Dmitri's neck… catching nothing but a cloud of dust particles.  &quot;'Ees on the roofs!&quot;<br>
<br>
Moore strolls up to the guards, staring past them towards something else.  “Get ‘em, Boys.”<br>
<br>
Two grinning Kolbods step out from behind the guards--  Kolbod Predators, with long, glistening fangs, wide, fire-red eyes, and impossibly long noses-- each brandishing a short, sharp sword, stained ever so green, ever so poisonous.  They leaped onto the roofs, hot on the scent of Mr. Dmitri Shadowstepper.<br>
<br>
“Keep him alive, pets!”  Moore shouted.<br>
<br>

Green light filters through the lattice of tall trees, and in the distance, a noisy brook babbles endlessly.  Dirt is hard, doesn't leave tracks.  Smells good too.  Smells like... home.  Not that filthy Freeport, mind you.  Like home. <br>
<br>
His destination looms in front of him: a great Fir, by far the tallest tree in all the forest, that had served as his sanctuary from hell for the last two years.  Dogs couldn't smell him up there, and men couldn't find him.<br>
<br>
For a second, he stares at the tree.  He closes his eyes, touches the rough bark, and, after a moment, his skin begins to change color, from the usual pale grey, to pure white, and then to an emerald green. <br>
<br>
Seconds pass like hours.<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
And he is gone, disappeared.<br>

He had a bad feeling about that night.  Too black, too cold. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       Must have lost 'em by now... no way those doofs could catch me. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Stopping on a flat roof, he turned his head to verify his safety.  In the distance, two hunched shadows leaped effortlessly from roof to roof.  The shadows were not what interested Dmitri, however...it was their eyes.  Two sets of two red, fiery orbs, leaping and landing in perfect synchronisity with one another.  Even from a distance of sixty meters, those eyes burned Dmitri, burned his mind, his heart, his very soul. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       Those aren't human. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Feet and legs and chest and arms and hands--frozen.  The tight fist of fear wrapped its tendrils round his throat, leaving him without a voice.  His right eye involunarily began to twitch.  And the rain resumed.<br>
<br>
Fire, closer, Fire, closer...  Those orbs, those eyes.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       C'mon Dmitri.  Time to move.  Gotta move, gotta move.  Can't stop! </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>       MOVE DAMNIT! </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Slowly, a quivering hand fell to his scabbard.  The moment he touched the hilt, the fear flooded from his body, fleeing heedlessly through all orifices.  His free hand pulled back the hood, revealing a long, sharp, grey face, framed with pointed ears, sandy-blonde hair, and iridescent, emerald green eyes.  Thin lips formed a steely grimace round bared pearl teeth.  He drew the sword.<br>
<br>
The two figures stood just one building away, hesitating ever so slightly for the final jump to battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;C'MON!&quot;  Dmitri screamed.<br>
<br>
And everything went white.<br>

Meter after meter of dark brown bark fall beneath his slender legs and hands.  Much of the trunk is without branches or handholds, but he continues, unimpeded.

Dmitri looks out over the sprawling green canopy of the forest, drawing his strength from its strength.  Far to the west, the last dying yellow rays of the Sun slip beneath the rolling horizon.  From this lofty perch, he sees the silhouette of a small river of smoke sieving through the natural green velvet of the forest roof.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    Hunters. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A rough, cold wind blasts his cheeks, hueing them a vibrant red.  He shrugs, and then pulls his hood over his face.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     First time, I was sure it wasn't me.  Me an Taffin' were in a bar... </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The sun falls beneath the horizon, and the world is covered in a blanket of darkness.  Stars soon pinprick the black roof, quickly assuming their ancient positions as constellations.  &quot;Hey guys,&quot; Dmitri whispers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     He kept complaining about the ale.  Said it was watered down.  Said he wouldn't stand for such filth. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The moon crawls into view, casting an eerie shadow on things.  Removing all color from them.  Shades of grey and black mingle nervously among the paler whites.  Dmitri shivers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     I told him to cool it.  Said he shouldn't cause a ruckus when he had such a high bounty on his head.  He wouln't listen.  Never did. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Dmitri holds his palm into the air, and immediately, a globe of fire appears, levitating inches in front of his hand.  Heat courses through his frozen fingers, his aching limbs.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Finally, he stormed off in disgust, looking for someone to blame.  I, of course, followed.  Ended up in the innkeepers face, some big Barbarian named Trunk.

His entire body convulsed, realizing the obvious before his mind, and vomit raced up his throat, only to be stopped by a firmly clamped jaw.  Swallow it.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I... I must have... killed him? </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He sat down, eyes forward, wide and dry.  He vomited again, and this time, no physical resolve could hold the bile back.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  His death always seemed so strange to me... now I know why. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The sound of barking dogs temporarily summoned his survivor instinct, calling him back to reality.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Where am I? </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He was in a totally foriegn sector of the city.  All around him, dark green ivy clung to the crumbling masonry of the ancient slums.  He was in an alley of somesort. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Gotta move. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Running came, as it always did, naturally.<br>
<br>
His heart beat loudly, and, as he ran, the silver medallion placed so carefully round his neck pounded incessantly against his bare-flesh, sending waves of unimaginable, unendurable pain throughout his entire body.  &quot;YOU!&quot;  He shouted at the top of his lungs, heedless of any encroaching guards.  &quot;IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!&quot;  Forcibly, quite unlike the rougish Dmitri of old, he tore the medallion from his neck, and, in a single mighty thrust, cast it as far as flight would take.<br>
<br>
As the black form of Dmitri Shadowstepper disappeared into the dark, the medallion's singular pulse of silver light throbbed endlessly into the infinite night.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upercytosscobble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Percy Tosscobble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/01 11:59:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hrmmm...</span><hr size=1> Well folks, this 'short-story' is starting to turn into more of a novel than I intended, so I think i'm going to take an extended break from writing for a while.

<br>
As night slipped to day, as dark to light, as Dmitri to the shadows, to the wilderness, Freeport awoke to the tulmult of a full-blown elfhunt.  Captain Moore had fully expected the Kolbods to return with Dmitri in a matter of minutes.  When this did not transpire, he grew increasingly moody.  As day broke, he called upon the full might of Freeport Guard to find some evidence of the rogue.<br>
<br>
What he found made him <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     very </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> moody.  Two of his favorite pets, Urlot and Klixnix, were now no more than a disheveled heap of dirt, fur, and blood.  He was, oddly, very quiet.  He knelt there, over the bodies of his two prized hunters, motionless. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   So close.  It was almost mine. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Griln, a subordinate, tapped him on the shoulder.  &quot;Sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
Moore didn't respond.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, I was... uh... I mean, maybe we ought to, er, not to be out of line or anythi...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What, Griln?&quot;  Moore stared straight ahead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I just thought it'd be a good idea to, well, what with the killings an' all to jus'...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OUT WITH IT, GRILN.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We should chase him, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
Moore slowly stood up, wiping his hands on the corner of his tan cloak.  &quot;Griln?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yessir?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     you </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like to pursue somebody who does this,&quot; he gestured to the corpses &quot;to his prey?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nnnnnoooo, sir, no.&quot;<br>
<br>
Moore surveyed the scene.  His quarry had long since disappeared.  And he didn't know what to do.  Moore was a smart man, at least he liked to think so.  Kept an eye on most of the rogues and villans in the town, made sure they didn't step to far out of line.  Surely, he didn't expect this out of a simple rogue like Dmitri.  He had merely hoped to capture the elf without bloodshed, get the medallion. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Never expected this. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
A cry from the street broke Moore's concentration.  Pitor, as his nameplate indicated, came tearing around the corner into the alley. &quot;Sir!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes private?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We've found something, sir!  A medallion of somesort, sort of fits the description you gave us.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Has anybody touched it yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, we sort of just found it, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
His heart beat wildly.  This kind of dumb luck happened to people in bardsongs.  Perhaps his piousness was paying off.  Steadily, almost nonchalantly, he intoned &quot;Lead on, private.&quot;  <br>
<br>
It sat there, wedged into the worn cobblestone, throbbing incessantly.  Moore felt a strange sensation sweep over his brain, as though it were calling to him.  He wanted to just reach out and grab it.  He wasn't the only one apparently.  Every guard in the vicinity had neglected his or her post and gathered round the glowing object to oogle it.  As each new body neared the small round medallion, it glowed a little brighter, a little hotter.  One of the privates, Moore didn't reckognize him, lurched towards the medallion.<br>
<br>
&quot;STOP HIM!&quot;  Shouted Moore.<br>
<br>
Too late.  The moment the soldier grasped the thin, blueish-silver metal in his gloved hand, a great, encapsulating ball of fire engulfed his entire body, and, without a sound, his crumbling skeleton dropped to the cobblestone, bursting into a spray of dust.  The wind swept what remained of him away.  Horror coursed through the onlookers.<br>
<br>
&quot;He, he didn't even have time to scream...&quot;  one of the female guards whispered to herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anybody else want to try a stunt like that?&quot;  Moore muttered.  &quot;Griln, get me Sagehand Maxtor.  The rest of you, need I repeat myself?  Don't touch it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Outwardly, he appeared stoic, stony as always.  But on the inside, his heart railed violently against his ribcage, his breath grew short, and his mind raced.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Could this be real?  Could this be The Dragonnade? </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Anyway, I guess I will continue to write, (and write and write and write and write).  Like I said in a previous post, this is shaping into more of a novella and less of a short story, but heck, whatever works, I suppose.  <br>
<br>
My next undertaking will be to revise what is already written.  After scanning what I have written so far, several errors or missing words popped out at me, so I think I'm going to fix those.  Additionally, I'm going to make several continuity changes (fairly important) like changing Sergant Moore's rank to something much higher like Captain or Sheriff or something, so as to make him a more plausible antagonist.  I will make note as to all of these changes at the bottom of the respective posts so as to keep you as *minimally* confused as possible.  Won't clear everything up though.  After all, some of that wacky stuff is confusing for a purpose. <br>
