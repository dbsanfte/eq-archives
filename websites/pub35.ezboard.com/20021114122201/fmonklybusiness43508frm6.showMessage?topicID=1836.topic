<br>
Here's my situation.<br>
<br>
I dual-box, I decided to raise a monk because of the damage output and because they're more useful on raids than sk's (or so i've been spoonfed...). Regardless, here's my problem:<br>
<br>
My gear is nice, even great to some..<br>
I can solo with ease, gettings levels have been no problem and I know the zones to go and such BUT<br>
<br>
-I'm level 44 and I still don't know how to split<br>
-I'm a horrible puller in dungeons<br>
<br>
And is H2H better dps than 2hb?<br>
<br>
I've been using IFS and my 2hb is at like 219<br>
but occasionally(when grouped) I'll switch to Fist of rock/horn combo to raise h2h. H2h is at like 197 but i'm not really noticing much damage... I hit in the 20's about four times, but I'm hitting for 150 with 2hb...Did I do something wrong? <br>
<br>
Basically, I'd like any tips on playing a monk...when I finally do get past 50 I don't want to look like a ebayed retard because I don't know wtf i'm doing. I know how to play my wiz/sk, that's about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=341261">Dolliee</a> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=360232">Kanah</a> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=360223">Zamani</a> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=360240">Niinjaturtle</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unorpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Norpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand High Poobah</span><br>  Posts: 3892<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/31/02 6:09:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1836.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few newbie questions...</span><hr size=1> Welcome to monkly business.<br>

Ok, have you read the following guides yet?<br>
<br>

<br>
After you read those, let post here if you have any specific questions or problems.<br>
<br>
&quot;And is H2H better dps than 2hb?&quot;<br>
<br>
It can be, but not with the weapons you are using.  That Fist of Horn for example, is a terrible weapon for your level.  Your bare fist is a much better offhand weapon at this point than a Fist of Horn, and it will improve even more as you level.<br>
<br>
If you get rid of that Fist of Horn, your h2h dps will get a lot closer to your IFS's dsp, for the moment.  Once you get past level 50, the gap between 1 handed and 2 handed weapons begins to widen again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
Depends, I didn't see any mention of 1hb.  I hope you didn't neglect your 1hb skill completely.  One day you might get a really good 1hb weapon and you'll kick yourself if you haven't been keeping the skill up to par. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unorpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Norpin</A> at: 8/31/02 6:19:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uargfeld.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Argfeld</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 428<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/4/02 7:45:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1836.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few newbie questions...</span><hr size=1> On the plus side, 1hb skill goes up AMAZINGLY FAST, particularly if you have one in each hand.<br>
<br>
BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, MAX FD SKILL!!!  It is soooooo important.  I can't stress it enough.  Then, get sneak up past 100.  <br>
<br>
There are many techniques for pulling, but the ones I use the most are as follows (I have over-simplified some of these so you should really read those guides):<br>
<br>
1:  I use sneak to lower my aggro radius.  This allows me to pull as though I were a higher level.  This means that if I aggro a monster while sneaking, his buddies nearby are much less likely to come after me as well.  Practice your sneak past 100 (where it never fails).  It is invaluable for pulling.  A trick that you can use while sneaking is to slowly creep towards the monster you want to pull, making sure that no other monsters are closer than that one, then at the moment that he starts to come after you, move away.  He will break sneak when he hits you, but hopefully you will be far enough away from his buddies by that time that they will not aggro.  Another trick that can be used with sneak is that most monsters with their back to you won't aggro.  Con monsters with their back to you while you are sneaking.  If they are normally hostile but become indifferent while you are sneaking behind them, then you can get maneuver until only the monster(s) that you want to pull can actually see you, using this to split them away from the ones you want to remain.  It takes practice.  Sneak actually affects monsters that you are behind, to the side of, and even a little bit in front of.<br>
<br>
2:  I sometimes use distance weapons.  Buy some somewhere with a decent range (100+ is good).  You can use them while sneaking.  One advantage is that you have a little distance between yourself and the monsters you are pulling, which means less chance of aggroing the wrong ones and more time to get away or FD if you aggro too many.  It also means that by the time the monster gets to you to hit you and break your sneak, that you are almost certainly out of the aggro range of his buddies.  For a really nasty monster that can kill you in 5 seconds flat, pulling from a distance is essential.  At the high end of the game in raids, a monk MUST have some means of distance attack (usually a ranged weapon, but sometimes a clicky item), in order to be a truly effective puller.<br>
<br>
3:  FD-splitting is something every good monk should know, although I usually don't need it.  If you are constantly having to FD-split, you are probably (A) in a really nasty place for pulling, (B) breaking the spawn in some area, (C)  are too low a level for the place you are pulling, or (D) don't know what the heck you are doing.  Basically, you pull some monsters a certain distance, FD, then wait for the monsters to separate on their way back home, allowing you or a friend to bring back the one(s) you want.  A friend might tag the last one left hovering over your body or the one that stayed behind while the rest of the monsters chased after you.  You might have to FD several times and run to various locations to achieve this.  Sometimes FD pulling doesn't work very well and you just have to give up or try a new technique.  FD-splitting is really too complicated for me to fully explain here.  Read one of those guides.<br>
<br>
It is a really good idea to read maps and guides to a zone before pulling there.  I usually have a zone map in front of me while I pull, unless I am so familiar with the zone that I don't need a map.<br>
<br>
On raids, pulling becomes a much more sophisticated thing, which may involve several other people, such as a mage to summon you back to the raid-group if you get in over your head or a couple of monks grouped with you to help with tagging and splitting.  <br>
<br>
Level is absolutely vital to splitting.  Your level as compared to the monster's level affects the range at which is friends will jump in to assist him.  I couldn't understand why a monk in my guild was so much better at splitting certain monsters than I was.  He was good at it, but not that good (compared to me I mean).  When I got to his level, splitting those same monsters became a piece of cake.<br>
<br>
Don't forget the &quot;/q&quot; technique.  If you get in way over your head and end up low on health and unable to lose aggro from a group of monsters, find a place away from nasty spawn points, FD (make sure you don't fall to the ground), then /q.  You might want to disband before doing this, lest you create the dreaded &quot;group bug&quot;.  Wait a few minutes to let the monsters go back to their spawn points, then come back into the game.  Even before you enter the game, start tapping that FD hotkey.  It might be that you will experience a few seconds lag entering the game, such that you will be in the game and getting pounded by monsters, even though you think you haven't entered the game yet.  That is why it is a good idea to be tapping that FD hotkey beforehand.<br>
<br>
The general rule for monks and their weapons is that you use the fastest weapon in your main hand and the best damage/delay weapon in your off hand.  This is because you get a damage bonus to your main hand that you want to come into play as often as possible.  If perchance you had a 1hb that was 1 damage and 5 delay (no such weapon exists), this would be an appallingly bad ratio, but it would be the most powerful monk weapon in the game because your damage bonus would be used so often if it were equipped in your main hand.  Regarding one handed weapons versus 2hb, that is a tough one that needs to be considered on a case by case basis.  IFS is pretty good at your level and is probably superior to your other weapons. <p>Argfeld<BR>
