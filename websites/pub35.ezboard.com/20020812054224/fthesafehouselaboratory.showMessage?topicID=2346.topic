Now I've done many, about 23 total, and I doubt any have been read.  Last night I did a feedback on the idea of an endless vial skill.  When a rogue hits a certain skill I said 250, the poison would be applied and the vial would not be used up.  This eliminates the issue with poison vials not stacking, they don't need to, and allows for poisons to be useful in every day grouping.  It would allow a rogue to carry a backpack full of poisons one vial of each type, and reward those who maxed their skill.<br><br>The idea doesn't seem overly unbalancing, and should be an easy code change to implement.
