As the door of the coach opened, the mayor was in the process of running out of his study and barreling over Mistletoe, who shrieked in surprise.  He took the stairs two at a time, somehow making the bottom without completely losing his balance.  He stopped with his hand on the front door.  He couldn’t breathe.  His heart pounded in his chest, he could feel the pulse thumping in his throat.  He could barely swallow, but tried desperately to gulp down his fear.  This is ridiculous he thought to himself.  This is my sister.  There is no reason to be afraid.  I warned her that it would be a bad idea to send her sons here.  I knew what kind of trouble they would get into.  The fact that they died is her fault, not mine!  Angrily, annoyed at his terror of a confrontation with his sister, he swung the door open.  He started, stumbling backwards in surprise.  Theophilia was not two feet from him, standing on the entryway, waiting for him to come out.<br>
<br>
No one would have mistaken them for siblings.  Where the Mayor was short and stubby, Theophila was tall, extremely tall, and thin to the point of emaciation.  The skin seemed to cling to her bones like some parasitic organism trying to suck the life from her skeleton.  Yet, despite her extreme thinness, she was beautiful beyond comparison.  Her dark hair hung thickly about her shoulders, a stark white lock ran along the left side of her hair.  A shimmering black robe hung from her shoulders, and a matching hooded cloak fell behind her.  Dim red and purple colors rippled along the material, as if the cloak and robe were made of a thick, liquid-like substance.<br>
<br>
She took a small breath before speaking, and made a slight motion with a long thin finger.  The mayor felt as if that breath was pulling the life directly from his chest.  A cold shudder passed through him.  His knees gave out and he collapsed on the ground in front of his sister.  He looked up at Theophilia, shoulders quivering, knowing if he wasn’t going to die in the immediate future, he was in for an awful lot of pain.<br>
<br>
“So Bardemus, you can’t keep track of two boys long enough to keep them alive?”  Her voice was musical, like wind chimes singing in the wind, but there was a venomous undertone to it, as if a serpent was speaking.  “I specifically told you to keep them under your wing.  Only you could fail such a miserably simplistic task.”<br>
<br>
The mayor choked and tried to speak, “Theophila, listen…”  He couldn’t breathe again.  He grasped at his neck, struggling for a breath that wouldn’t pass his constricted throat.  His sister glared at him, a malevolent grin etched across her face.<br>
<br>
“You will not speak unless I tell you to do so fool!  Where is their father?  Get him here now!  If you will not do what I tell you to do, perhaps that sniveling worm can do it instead.”  She made another small motion with her hands, and Bardemus went sailing across the street, landing in a heap next to his sister’s coach.  “Get him NOW!”<br>
<br>
The mayor collapsed when his sister made a shooing motion with her hands.  She released the magical hold that was strangling him.  He fell backwards, landing on his hands.  He worked his way forward, crawling to his knees.  Shifting his feet underneath him, he almost made it upright, but a slap to the back of his head sent him careening to the ground again, planting him face first in the gravel and dirt.  Bardemus looked up to see what had sent him sprawling to the ground.<br>
<br>
A giant of a man stood next to the coach.  He was covered head to toe in a suit of armor.  A huge two- handed sword was strapped to his back.  He took a step towards Bardemus, reached for the mayor, and picked him up by the front of his shirt.  He held the small man up to his plate helmet holding him at eye level.  The mayor’s feet dangled in the air as he struggled in the man’s grasp.  A slight putrid stench emanated from the armored figure, nearly gagging Bardemus.  He tried to look into the eyes of his captor, but the torchlight was too dim to see behind the helmet.  What was visible, however, was the armor itself.  The metal of the armor seemed to twist and writhe like some mercurial source.  Images formed in the armor, images of faces in their death throes.  Bodies twisting in torture.  Images of people in agony.<br>
<br>
“Ahh Bardemus, let me introduce you to my companion.  This in Paen.”  Bardemus closed his eyes to shut out the horrible visions gleaming in the tall man’s armor.  “Paen and I have been discussing the situation here Bardemus.  We both feel that he would be a good addition to your staff.  Especially since you seem to be unable to handle simple tasks on your own.”<br>
<br>
The tall man never moved, didn’t make a sound.  He just held the mayor in front of him.  Bardemus’s only indication that the man was even alive, was the fact that he grabbed him in the first place.  Right now, Bardemus could be held by a statue, the man was so rigid.  He again saw the deadly images dancing within the man’s armor, and turned his head away, shutting his eyes from the sight.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure by now, my brother, you have noticed his armor.  All those images you see, they are the souls that tried to cross my companion.  The soul of every opponent he has slain now suffers in eternal torment, they are bound to his armor, and those that are able to land a stroke against Paen in combat, the souls in the armor will all feel the strike.”<br>
<br>
The mayor turned to look at his sister.  “So you see Bardemus, my companion thrives in the knowledge that he can cause suffering.  How would you like to live forever Bardemus?  It can be arranged.”<br>
<br>
The huge man threw the mayor to the ground, and in one fluid motion, drew the sword from behind his back, pointing it under the chin of the fallen Bardemus.  The effort should have been awkward, considering the heavy plate-like armor the man wore, but he moved as if he were wearing silk.  The clanking and shifting you would expect to hear on such a suit of armor was missing.  The man in the armor was completely silent.<br>
<br>
Bardemus crawled backwards, away from the sword pointing at his throat.  “I’ll go find Remus right away Theophilia.”  The mayor started to run off.  “I may not be able to get to him with your troops running around the city like this.  I probably won’t make it one block.”<br>
<br>
His sister made another motion with her hands.  A ball of shimmering green and purple light surrounded Bardemus.  The mayor fell to the ground, screaming and holding the sides of his face.  The light dissipated and Bardemus struggled to his feet.  Hot pain shot through his face on both sides.  He reached to touch the sides of his face, and winced.  He moved hands away from his cheeks, examining what he thought was blood dripping from two wounds on either side of his face.  The left hand was covered in a green, glowing substance, and the right, an iridescent purple.  The fluid dripped from his face like an open wound, burning him as if it were slightly acidic.<br>
<br>
“None of them will bother you now Bardemus.  I must advise brother, that you should not even think about not returning with Remus, and don’t even consider trying to leave the city now.  Those wounds on your face will protect you from my minions for now, but should you choose to not come back within an hour, you will become one of them.  You will serve me either way Bardemus, it is up to you how you choose to do so.”<br>
<br>
His face filled with horror, the mayor started backing up, scurrying away from his sister.<br>
<br>
“Run Bardemus, you haven’t much time.”  <br>
<br>
He turned and bolted for the officer’s barracks, praying that Remus would be there, and not lying drunk and unconscious in some alley, or dead from the city invaders.  An hour was very little time to find one man in an entire city in ruin.<br>
