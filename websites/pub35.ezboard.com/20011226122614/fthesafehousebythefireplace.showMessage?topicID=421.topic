Normally, I don't participate too much (it's bad for business), but sometimes we have swords thrust in our faces.<br>
<br>
Ironically, my most memorable battles always begin (and end) with me running away. I'm great at that.<br>
<br>
I was hunting in the Nother Desert of Ro, just minding my own business at about, oh, season 8 or 9, when I accidentally got a little too close to the skeleton ruins, when a Lesser Mummy was awake.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uht-oh...&quot; I thought to myself in less time that it takes to tell it, &quot;Time to scoot!&quot;<br>
<br>
So I turned and ran. Being new to North Ro, I couldn't count on my ability to find the tunnel, and I didn't want to give any of my Dark Elf bretheren the unpleasant surprised of zoning into a nasty rabies-dealing undead, and given the fact that I, being young and a worshipper of Bristlebane (shhh... don't tell Neriak), I wasn't going to be killed on sight to the guards yet.<br>
<br>
Thus, I took off for the guards.<br>
<br>
Along the way, a SECOND lesser mummy joins the chase. Or maybe it was shriveled, I didn't take the time to look. It was red, what more do I need to see?<br>
<br>
Running as fast as I can across the sand, jumping at the top of dunes to get a bit more ahead even though it hurts to land, I start shouting &quot;TRAIN TO GUARDS!!&quot; repeatedly. No use getting in trouble with the Gods for not playing nice.<br>
<br>
By the time I get to the edge of the desert, where grass grows and guards hang out, the mummies are decently far behind me, juuuust out of easy visual range (which is short in Ro, thanks to the sands). Sitting right at the edge is a group of humans, all of whom are easily more powerful than little me. Appearently, they hadn't payed attention to mywarning shouts, and instead of getting out of my way, proceeded to stand up and prepare to attack!!<br>
<br>
I'm so out of breath from running that I can't explain, and the mummies aren't in sight yet, so there's really nothing I can do. I keep going past them.<br>
<br>
As they turn around to persue, the mummies catch up. As soon as I hear the first human cry out in pain, I turn around and look. The mummies, finding a more convienent target, decended on THEM instead of ME... which, race war or not, is always a good thing from my perspective. The battle was fierce, but one of the humans refused to help his companions. Instead, he came out after ME. This bronze-laden warrior, with a big nasty-looking sword, leaves the mummies behind and slashes me a heavy blow across my shoulder. That snapped me out of my confusion, and I took off again, back out into the desert with the human in hot pursuit (no pun intended).<br>
<br>
We get just a little ways off the grasslands and I realize that this hound-like person was not going to be shaken as easily as the mummies were. I had a slight bit of a lead due to my natural quickness, but not enough to lose him through conventional means... and I still couldn't rely on the tunnel. My options seemed to be turn and fight, or hope allies could be found in the Oasis of Marr; an insanely long way away.<br>
<br>
Finally, as a last ditch effort, I hopped over a tall tall dune just seconds before the human, and before he could regain sight of me, i attempted to hide!<br>
<br>
Just as I finished, the human crested the top of the dune, and, not seeing me expertly blended with the sand, kept right on running out into the desert.<br>
<br>
It was many many many more seconds before I regained the courage to leave my hiding spot and seek out the tunnel. My hands were shaking so bad I looked like a caffine addict with Parkinson's Disease. My heart was racing all the way back to my beloved Nektulos... where I spent a long time in shock hunting skeletons.<br>
<br>
My next encounter with a human wouldn't come for several more seasons.. but that's a tale for a later date. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=423.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=409.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=421.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=421.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=421.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=421.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
