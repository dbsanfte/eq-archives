Xvar walked through the bustling camp. Some soldiers were playing a drinking game and bellowing out louder laughs then spell kickbacks. <br>
A few were barking out orders to some workers putting up tents.<br>
Xvar began to help, having twice the strength of a man his age the others were impressed and surprised. The man in charge walked up to Xvar who was helping raise a heavy wood frame. He put his face inches from Xvar’s and screamed. Xvar held up his piece of the frame with one hand and pushed the man to the side before helping hoist it to the stop. The other soldiers laughed and cheered. Xvar kept himself busy for the rest of the day. In the evening the loud noises of tired, hungry soldiers filled the camp. Most soldiers were dusty and sweaty. The grunts, groans and complaints rang out over the disgusting slop called dinner.  Eventually the vociferous motley crew settled in, chomping down the brown lumpy goo assumed to be meat and gravy.<br>
The youngest at the table, who looked a year Xvar’s younger, finished first but remained silent. He seemed resentful at the other soldiers, of the tent, of the food.<br>
One of the older, more experienced soldiers jeered him.<br>
“Eh now wee muscles, fast eater too? Hope your sword is as quick as your fork!”<br>
All the others, except Xvar gave a boom of laughter.<br>
Xvar sat over his food in total silence. The same man poked some fun at Xvar.<br>
“So, you a big talker or ya scared?”<br>
Xvar didn’t respond.<br>
“C’mon boy, we’re fighting tomorrow! Glory! Riches! Heroes! The rise of a beautiful age is afoot! And revenge for Lugiver.”<br>
Xvar put down his fork, matching the man’s look with a stare of stern apathy, “Lugiver deserves no revenge, his people did and they will have their way. No thanks to him, or your army.”<br>
Another man spoke up in defense of the first. “He might not of been a good man, but he was a damn good general and you know it. He showed us just how good war can be to us.”<br>
The young soldier interrupted. “I don’t see the glory in death. From where I come from death and glory are natural opposites. War is hideous, but it pays my way. I came for a meal, for some coins. I don’t see why I should help this world.”<br>
The first man shouted at him, drawing his sword. “How dare you! We fight to be heroes!”<br>
“So do they.” Xvar said as he stood up. The man was frozen by his words. Sitting down looking subdued he slammed his sword right through the table.<br>
“Fighting because you’re hopeless is just as bad as fighting for false glory, just as it is for fortune. There is no truly noble battle.” Xvar said.<br>
“I never said I was a good man.” The young soldier retorted.<br>
“But a good soldier, yeah, I know. I would have said just the same thing myself. I’m so inconsistent it’s disgraceful.”<br>
The young man looked fairly subdued by this comment as well.<br>
“You don’t seem to understand why this battle if going to happen. It’s ironic that those who see it first hand would be the last to understand. I guess that’s just another evil of battle itself.” Xvar threw his bowl in the wash pile and walked out of the tent.<br>
<br>
The next day began far before dawn etched the land with cryptic heat. The men were suiting up in armor, sharpening blades, and getting into battle formations.<br>
Xvar went to Magnatic’s tent. He was already suited in armor, ready for battle.<br>
“Ahh, changing your mind?”<br>
“No.”<br>
Magnatic nodded, he was looking out of the small window from his tent. The first rays of light illuminated the edge of the land. It was then that Xvar noticed Magnatic had cut his hair so that only a very short ponytail existed.<br>
“I only cut my hair before battle.” Magnatic said, not moving his gaze from the window.<br>
“I hope someday that it will grow to my feet then maybe I can have some peace.” He chuckled, although Xvar could tell even Magnatic yearned for better times.<br>
“It’s not your fault.” Xvar said.<br>
Magnatic looked over the land slowly eyeing each feature.<br>
“But that doesn’t mean it’s not my responsibility.” Magnatic said, his voice showing a trace of guilt, but maybe Xvar was imagining that.<br>
“You have to kill Aftar. I’ll get Serhan back for you.” It was a statement, not a question.<br>
Magnatic looked back slightly surprised yet acceptantly he nodded.<br>
“Why is it you want to save her?”<br>
Xvar didn’t respond until he was almost out of the door, pausing long enough for a simple sentence. “What better do I have to do?”<br>
Magnatic smirked. Walking slowly out the door he thought to himself. “He’s less selfish then he thinks.”<br>
<br>
Magnatic rode out to the battle line. In front of him a large array of soldiers in tight formation stood in near silence.<br>
Parallel to them the plateau was dotted with archers on the top and a mass of soldiers thickening around where he assumed the entrance of the underground fort.<br>
He gestured to the first rows. Pointing strategic parts to take first.<br>
“Leave the leader for me.” He said as the soldiers stiffened in readiness.<br>
Asunder, Jerra, Tyu and Farren stood not far behind Magnatic, awaiting his word.<br>
Battle drums sounded helping the premature flow of adrenaline. The men felt anxious and their grips tightened and loosened on their weapons as the minutes crept by.<br>
Xvar was far to the side, deciding he would go along the plateau until he reached the entrance, then to just wing it. Satisfied with his lack of plan and adorning a look of impatience he waited.<br>
Suddenly one cry opened a dam of others. Several catapults and magicians from behind supported the first surge of soldiers, but they were still no more then simple cannon fodder.  Xvar watched as the men from the plateau abandoned the positions, running forward to join the fray. Noticing this seeming lack of good soldiers he rode forward to the entrance. He took one last look back at the seeming living entities of soldiers. The formation moved like one being rather then a hundred. Aftar’s soldiers lacked this organization but were twice as motivated at the defenders of their home and ideas.<br>
Xvar ran through the long chambers, he wore no colors to distinguish himself and the others thought he was a soldier of Aftar. Some yelled at him to get back to the battle but he ignored them and continued going up and down and right and left. It was like being lost in a foggy haze, an endless maze of twisting corridors. He grabbed a younger looking man and thrust him against the wall, his rage leaking into his actions. “Where is the prisoner?”<br>
“Up! Up at the top!”<br>
Xvar threw him to the ground and ran to the stairs, it was obvious to him now that not only did this fort go underground, but up into the plateau as well. He skipped as many steps as he could with each leap, trying to get up them as fast as he could.<br>
Aftar sat in a large armchair waiting by her cell.<br>
Xvar drew his blade and thrust it next to Aftar’s throat, growling. “Let her out.”<br>
Aftar didn’t even raise his head, he simply flipped up the lock and rested his head down back on his fist. Xvar kicked the door open from where he stood and yelled into Serhan. “Out, now!”<br>
She ran out looking over to the seemingly crestfallen Aftar and Xvar. His blade managed to collect a small toll of blood.<br>
“You’re not who I’m supposed to fight. You’re Magnatic’s.”<br>
Aftar nodded silently. Then looking up to Xvar his gaze sincere, he spoke. “Take care of her Dakan. Brother Dakan.”<br>
Xvar withdrew his dagger and sheathed it in his scabbard. Grabbing Serhan by the hand he pulled her down the hallway.<br>
Aftar rose and wiped the blood from his neck and picked up his sword. Walking down to the main chamber he sat, waiting.<br>
Xvar held tightly to Serhan as they made their escape. She spoke as they ran. “Aftar was right. I know he was, but I just hope someone is going to tell everyone about this.”<br>
“I’m pretty sure that’s your job.” Xvar said, stopping her abruptly from turning a corner. Shaking his head silently he removed his dagger hearing footsteps in the hall.<br>
He readied to pounce except the footsteps announced themselves. “Xvar!” Asunder’s voice called. Xvar pulled Serhan into the hall.<br>
“Get her out of her Xvar.”<br>
Xvar nodded and Asunder continued running through the halls. Magnatic was close on Asunder’s tail. He stopped thanking Xvar then bolting down the dark hall again.<br>
As Magnatic reached the great chamber Aftar stood, turning to him.<br>
“I’ve been waiting.”<br>
Magnatic charged and slashed his sword down from above his head, wasting no time. <br>
“My apologies, shall we?” Magnatic said from clenched teeth.<br>
Aftar thwarted off Magnatic’s blow with a crosscut.<br>
He threw down blow after blow advancing forward slowly.<br>
“Do you understand why we’re fighting?” Aftar said, leaning in.<br>
“I fight to restore order.” Magnatic said somewhat caught off guard by the question.<br>
Emphasizing each word with a strike of equal measure.<br>
“You are wrong. We’re not fighting for that, and I won’t die until you figure out why we really are. I am always right.”<br>
“Is that a motto or a threat?” Magnatic nearly shouted.<br>
“Advice.” Aftar countered.<br>
“Lies.”<br>
“Promises.”<br>
“Death wish.”<br>
“Peace.”<br>
Magnatic looked into Aftar’s eyes. He was panting from exhaustion, at this pace Aftar would kill him.<br>
“We are fighting for a reason, the only and last noble reason.”<br>
It suddenly came to Magnatic why Aftar was fighting.<br>
The leaned into each other’s force as the sword blades pushed together.<br>
“The Dakans came up with this noble reason. This reason to show how bad conflict is. You have to tell everyone how bad this was. How it was a massacre of rebels, rebels who were good men, who wanted a good world. Show them in this world there are no bad men except for those truly evil. This is a civil war, Magnatic. The true battle lies with evil itself. In men and beasts.”<br>
Magnatic threw Aftar’s blade off the handle of his own they stood back. Magnatic nervously eyed Aftar. Aftar sat on his knees, he lay his sword to the side and removed his chest plate, exposing a thin leather tunic.<br>
Magnatic walked forward, thrusting the sword with all his force into Aftar’s chest.<br>
Leaning down into a kneel he whispered, “Commend me to Tunare.”<br>
Aftar kissed the blade and whispered back, “With pleasure, friend, king.”<br>

Wait, what did I do again? Oh yeah! I remember now, I defended the validity of my game and after a long discussion you left the board without having me have to ban you.<br>
I really thought that was respectful and felt that I had gotten my point across.<br>
This story has nothing to do with my game, so you have no reason to start tossing names at me.<br>
What you're doing is immature, and seems to be motivated by some odd kind of soreloserness or plain old jealousy.<br>
If you want me Arachnis, if you hate me, and hate who I am as a person then attack me. Don't attack what others hold so dear like the game, or what others find a little entertainment in, like my story.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want me, come and get me, because you accomplish nothing like this except demonstrate what a conceded, jealous little 13 year old that you are. You give all us teens a bad name. And if you're not a teen - then this is a @#%$ tragedy.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Note: I bet $10 that Arachnis will not e-mail me, or have any civil contact with me. I've seen foolish human nature long enough to see pride win over logic a million times over. Oh, and I also assume that you made McKerran's account considering it was used once then never again when he said he's been following the story since it began. I'm going to ask the administrator for the IP number of him and I already have yours -- it's very easy to see through your facade.) <p><B>Koz. Lean, Mean, Posting machine.</B>

Magnatic stood silently but after a moment or two raised his hand in salute.<br>
“The only way I can show my respect is to not regret your death. Thank you, friend.”<br>
The battle waged on for the remainder of the day. Even without a leader the men fought to the bitter end. The Gariks leaving several final surprises, including the explosion and collapse of the fort’s plateau crushing all inside and all within a close proximity.  This battle was now without a purpose, ugly in it’s own worthlessness. Although Magnatic saw it as the last great battle ever to be fought, the soldiers saw it as a cold, heartless, terrifying battle. He hated to subject anyone to that, but he knew if it was not as bloody, as gory, as unromantic as it was that no man would speak of it in glory. It would always be a beautiful tragedy. <br>
As the last banners fell to the dust in pools of partially dried red-brown blood the victors galloped back to camp, to exhausted to gather the wounded and dead or even hold their banners up. They looked as if they had lost. But no matter what the outcome had been, there wouldn’t have been a true victor, because this battle was not fought to win, but fought to be recorded. It was unknown to the soldiers, but many of the officers realized this. They cried with downplayed pride knowing their place in history was secured. The soldiers simply trodded back to camp. They fought like soulless zombies. Escaping the hopelessness of battle and life in violence. It was a noble, respectable distraction and noone would ever question them. It was a way to fill the hole with another hole that was easier to deny. Trading one poison for another.  It was the only way for them to somehow feel like they were doing the right thing, using their own uselessness to help other worthwhile people. Just another battle to fight at the end of many others. Each was the same in its painful but soothing confusion. Each battle giving man the leeway to do as he pleased. Each man could simply fight to die and noone would stop him.<br>
A respectable suicide. The only thing that kept some of these men alive was that they had a small house or farm to return to, and maybe a wife or a child. Soulless men walking back to an empty camp. Soulless men walking back to a home. Noone stops them, because a man with no soul is more likely to give his body up in battle. They were more likely to be a steadfast soldier, a ready elite, and men with a wish for death, a prayer for death. They were not men; they were mindless, soulless, blind automatons. They were the void in humanity that continued to think they served for the good of man. But all they do is prolong their own sorrow and add that of those who never meant to be part of the battle in the first place.<br>
At the camp Xvar stood silently with Serhan. She turned to him and spoke. <br>
“What will you do now?”<br>
Xvar reached for the amulet under his tunic, rubbing it to a shine he stared at his own reflection in it. “I know who I have to defeat for the time being, maybe then I can figure everything out. You have to defeat Lugiver, Serhan.”<br>
Her look asked the question and he answered staring off into the distance.<br>
“You aren’t fighting evil. You’re fighting the humanistic traits of evil. I know what I have to do. I have to fight evil itself. I am not fighting to win.”<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
“Evil and good will always exist because evil teaches people how to be evil, because in truth everyone has that within them. This is just another time to fight. Don’t try to make us all the same Serhan, that won’t work. You have to figure out to make everyone want to accept each other. Unity is a mindset, not tangible equality.”<br>
She nodded. “Will you die you think?”<br>
“No. In the end good has to always win the battles because evil always owns the hearts of power. I’m just another person fighting for good. Magnatic did the right thing. He’s going to make it easier for people to want to accept eachother. For people to love eachother on some level.”<br>
“If you can’t win forever, why fight?”<br>
“Someday tangible equality may become a reality. People may become open enough to want everyone to be happy. We’re not working to end the story, Serhan. We’re just working to end our chapter.”<br>
“Will you come back?”<br>
“I can’t say. I still haven’t figured out exactly who I am. I know what I’m supposed to do, and how I’m supposed to do it. Now I have to go and try. If I fail I’ll be back at the first step.”<br>
“I’ll wait for you.”<br>
“I know. Believe me Serhan, I wish more then anything if I could have a reason to come back it would be you. But it’s for that same reason I have to go and see if this is who I’m supposed to be. Do you understand?”<br>
She nodded. He leaned his forehead against hers and they shut their eyes.<br>
“You need to figure out if this is who you’re supposed to be too. Maybe by the time I come back we’ll both know and we can have some real peace.”<br>
He put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her away so he could see her face.<br>
A small gentle smile formed on his lips.<br>
“I’ll wait for you.” She said again, with a smile. He nodded and cloaked. <br>
<br>
Magnatic returned to Felwithe a hero, just as he knew he would.  He soon declared the promotion and partial disbandment of Lugiver’s army. Of course it was masked as a reward, and all soldiers he thought fit were simply put in the royal army. His plan was working perfectly. He commissioned 50 artists, 20 poets and 10 authors to write about the battle. Copies of each of the works were mass circulated as much as they could be. Any veterans who stepped forward to make a work of art or prose, or to tell tales to the young were given rewards by the kingdom. The battle was greatly exaggerated, but it was one of the best secrets ever kept. After only several weeks the war was legendary and forever imprinted into the minds of the men.<br>
Now he just had to make sure Serhan understood what she would have to do when he left. <br>
Well, everything seemed to be going well until he got news that Lugiver had successfully fled Faydark and it was rumored he was going to create an orcan army.<br>
Orcs were only born to fight. They weren’t born with good or evil, because that’s not why they fought. They fought out of a need to feel good and evil, a subconscious yearning for a conscience. From the moment they are born they look to kill and kill and kill, stupidly, blindly looking to feel regret – an appetite with no satisfaction because this capacity eludes them. This is not evil, this is tragedy. The ambitious orcs would seek riches, trying to fill this void in them by quenching their greed, a merciless, bottomless greed. But these are not the root of it, evil is not to blame. Simple and utter ignorance is the only one to blame. Created without need for love, in stead a need to feel at all. Created without need for life, in stead a need to find out why they lived. All of this was because of their apathy and in no way by their fault or deliberate intent. <br>
Simple and utter ignorance is the only one to blame for the tragedy that is their meaningless existence. The greater tragedy of course is that no other race helps them, but in stead takes full advantage of them, playing on their needs for meaning, playing on their greed. Playing on their ignorance. <br>
Like telling a child whom knows no better to hit another person, a disgusting act of cowardice and malice. <br>
<br>
Serhan knew that. She knew that soon Lugiver would be able to convince the orcs to rise up and try to defeat the elves again, despite their recent defeats.<br>
This relentless need to justify their existence seems to drive them even more then how much the people want happiness.  Serhan knew what Xvar meant now. Lugiver was whom she had to defeat because he was human evil. Xvar wasn’t fighting that. He’s just keeping the balance in this world. She put her hands on the windowsill, looking to the outstretched forest in front of her. Leaning over the sill she watched as the guards barked orders in the rain. A few young cadets ran around, some were doing exercises in the mud, some sparring. She looked at the young men, who’d give their lives for her. She wondered if they had family, if she was worth that.<br>
“I don’t know how I’m worth so much if I can be replaced so easily. But I guess that’s not my problem yet.”<br>
<br>
Magnatic looked to Serhan. She seemed lost in thought.<br>
“Who was that boy?”<br>
Although her expression made her continue to look a million miles away she replied. “The force for good. Xvar.”<br>
Magnatic nodded a smile forming on his lips.<br>
“A force for good…? Hmm… Serhan? I need to speak with you.”<br>
“Yes, what about? I thought we were finished today.”<br>
“It’s not about your studies I’m afraid.”<br>
“Lugiver?” Serhan said looking back over her shoulder from the lofty castle window.<br>
“I know about him already. He’s going to raise an army of orcs and try and take us back by force, hoping to win favor with his old army. He’s clever. I think you should have someone kill him alone and spare us all the bloodshed he would wreak.”<br>
“I don’t think that’s possible unless we got an orc to do it. And there are no orc assassins we can find. We’ll have to battle.”<br>
“The people are tired of battle.”<br>
“The elves are tired of battle because that’s what they saw. But the orcs see nothing else and can not tire of it.”<br>
“All that effort to inform people of the battle for nothing?” Serhan said her voice growing in anger.<br>
“No, now the elves know they don’t want to fight anymore. Now we need to find a way to show the orcs.”<br>
She nodded. “I don’t think they can be shown by the horrors of battle. Maybe we need to show them the opposite to get the right effect.”<br>
Magnatic spoke firmly. “Yes. That is how we have to do it. Now I just have one question to ask, if Xvar is a force for good why did he leave?”<br>
“Because we’re not fighting the force of evil itself. We’re fighting greed and ignorance. He is fighting evil itself.” She said a note of finality in her voice.<br>
“We can defeat them.”<br>
Serhan looked up to him, smiling. “We will get the mindset for unity.” She said looking out the window again.<br>
“Xvar…” she mumbled. “Just don’t die.”<br>
She sat on the edge of the windowsill looking out to the rain soaked forest. Her gaze traced the contours of the landscape from the dew-covered grass to the heavy-branched trees, sagging with the weight of the water. Everything seemed freshened by this symbolic gesture of unhappiness and sorrow. She smiled, “Irony is beautiful in an odd way…”<br>
<br>
Deep in the orc caves, the new home of the orcs, Lugiver sat reviewing ideas for conquer. The orcs were fickle in their hatred. All hatred has its root in incident or difference, but they caused the grudges they sited as justification. But like waving a piece of candy in front of a child’s face for motivation Lugiver had their loyalty within a day. He promised them to get revenge for the loss of Orcport. He promised them riches and victory, as any leader does. But his plans were complicated. He planned to destroy important areas of agriculture one by one until Faydark relinquished. A devious, insidious plot to take over the area without permanently destroying it. He then planned to turn on the orcs and destroy them. He figured he could then raise a rebellion against the orcs, since he wasn’t conspicuously leading them, noone would know the double cross except the orcs. Lugiver was a man of arrogance, greed, temerity and recalcitrance – like a spoiled child.<br>
<br>
But he was also clever. He knew enough to find someone else to represent him in public. To the orcs he adorned a new name, “Grananaric” or “grand orc”. This way the elves would never know he had been the one to organize their destruction. Now he had to find someone hopeless, soulless, ruthless, and loyal. Someone looking for a reason to kill, and using that as a reason to live. Men like this made the best soldiers. Recently a man had become famous, he had once been a simple man who lived to write, draw and take care of his sister. The rumors varied that she had run off with some man, a rogue. And that after that he lost the will to live a good life.<br>
Because all love really is, is a reason to live – a reason to be a good person. As long as a person has this they will never fight to offend, but always to defend. Love keeps battles pure. But he had lost this, and supposedly found peace in the chaos of battle. His name was Dacrin.<br>
<br>
He was smart, arrogant, cruel and merciless. He fought to escape himself and with each battle became further empowered by his drug of choice, adrenaline of murder. <br>
When asked why he fights he always says the same thing, “Because men without souls aren’t good for anything but fighting.”<br>
He was undefeated. He sported several scars that looked as if they’d require immortality to survive. He felt no pain. He felt no remorse. And strangest of all he had no true reason to be heartbroken, no reason to have lost his soul. All he had done was kept asking himself why, over and over until he convinced himself there is no reason why and there is no reason to live a good life. <br>
Lugiver made Dacrin the general of his army of orcs. Dacrin fought with less mercy then even the deadliest of orcs. They soon respected him and grew to admire his attitude toward war and death.<br>
<br>
His hair was often unwashed from the last battle and patches were stained and hardened in blood. He flaunted them like trophies and soon so did the orcs. They mimicked his disregard and indifference for life. He was casual about killing things, much like D’vinn and this got to the orcs like nothing else.<br>
He had painted he skin jet black, only his palms were still the native color since his weapons rubbed off any paint applied. He was strong, not as strong as the orcs but his own ruthlessness helped any shortsights in strength, as did his cunning nature.<br>
He was a mongrel, some said possessed by a demon. When an orc asked him what true strength was he replied, “The only strength is to never fear death, pain, dishonor, and injury. Nothing can make up for this.”<br>
<br>
The emptiness his questions created made a suitable vessel for blood. He had to fill this hole, but there was no fill to it because blood can not fill a hole like that. Some part of him knew this and yearned for hope, hope to peace. But Dacrin, much like many lost behind him had given up his soul for blood. This is not a hole that one thing can fill, maybe nothing can fill it. The secret is not in the hole’s depth, it is not meant to be filled. The secret of this hole is its length, and how to mend it.<br>
All violence is created by need. This need is so varied from situation to situation, and justified in some and not in others that it is nearly impossible for most to find a different solution. Violence is created by need and creates more need; violence creates more of it self. To stop violence the need must be filled, besides the simple stripping of weapons and stop of combat. Maybe, somewhere in his mind Dacrin knew this. But he took orders, and had stopped listening to his own thoughts for far to long for this truth to be realized.<br>
<br>
Dacrin was a soldier. He fought to fill what he could not fill because a clever leader took advantage of his soulless actions. Lugiver was very, very clever in a manipulative sense. He knew just what needs caused conflict. He understood perfectly how he could create these needs to create conflict exactly where he wanted it and avoid it where it wasn’t useful to his purposes. It was this clever manipulation of human need and want, this deep understanding of human consciousness that gave Lugiver true power over others. No amount of physical power could equal what his understanding showed him. This is the darkest side of human nature. Taking advantage of ignorant innocents to fulfill his petty, unlasting wants. He was selfish to the point of killing others for what he felt he deserved.<br>
<br>
Xvar had been riding in the rugged Dakan highlands for what seemed like weeks, but with no sure way to keep track of the days it could have as well been months. A small, chin-covering beard had grown on his face and his hair had grown slightly. Whenever it got overly annoying he simply sliced off the bangs and ponytail he was growing and let it grow again.  He was searching for several things. First of all Korrash’s original home, the cell, and the armor. He knew if he didn’t find them in the right order nothing would work out. Asunder had managed to track him down several days previous and said that Jerra may try and come as well. Xvar didn’t mind the extra company, it meant a helping hand with the regular chores of setting up and taking down camp and provided an extra pair of eyes for searching.<br>
It wasn’t for several weeks more that they found the first thing they needed to find. A small white marble door shown out of a large rock outcropping. It gave no great resistance when Xvar pushed it open. Warily stepping inside he lit a torch and walked down the long first corridor.<br>
The first room was Korrash’s library. Cobwebs hung like thin sheets over the shelves and desks. This room was full of unlit torches. Xvar of course lit them and was able to further explore. Through the large marble room was another corridor. Asunder had just caught up with him and walked tentatively behind him.  They descended deeper and deeper into the building. Each level was colder, mustier, and danker then the last. Eventually they reached the dungeon levels. The very bottom level consisted of a simple 500-foot corridor with a black door at the end.<br>
“The cell.” Xvar muttered spying the door at the end. It was dark black iron, a great contrast to the polished white marble all around.<br>
Each of the marble floor slabs contained a trap. Each had a different way to die, and by the time they reached the cell they were exhausted from the run and the dodging and the warding off of snakes… Xvar put his hand on the cool iron door, sliding to the handle, which had a lock. He carefully picked the lock and turned the handle.<br>
He pushed the door open calmly without even a hint of fear.<br>
Inside Daro sat twitching every few seconds, his eyes tightly shut and his fists clenched.<br>
Asunder let out a small gasp and Xvar silenced him walking back out and shutting the door. “Korrash made a cell for Daro’s MIND, not for his body. Korrash knew no physical bounds could keep him, so he made a cell for his mind. I believe the only way to wake him up is to remove the curse. I’m no magician of course, so there’s no way I can fight him until the curse is removed.”<br>
“Can’t you kill him while he’s like that?”<br>
“Not like this.” Xvar gestured to his weapon and armor.<br>
“Even if I had the proper equipment I don’t think I’d be able to harm him in this building, I bet you anything Korrash put a curse here. So noone could fight or use majik. So noone would be able to kill him or free him while he’s in here. I guess it’s a safeguard. He did everything he could.”<br>
Xvar pulled out a map of the area and marked the place of Korrash’s home.<br>
“I would have thought he’d have hidden it a lot better then this.” Asunder looked back down the hall to the now subdued traps, panting slightly.<br>
“Oh, I think he did an alright job.” He said with a smirk.<br>
“I imagine he also created this so Daro can’t be moved. But when I get the armor maybe I’ll be stronger then his curse.”<br>
Asunder nodded. “And if you aren’t?”<br>
“Then I’m sure Daro’s priests are.” Xvar said sternly turning back to the traps.<br>
“They’re disabled now. Korrash knew no simple traps would affect Daro if he escaped.”<br>
Asunder nodded as they returned above ground.<br>
“Korrash was smart, but he knew he couldn’t kill Daro himself. He knew he had to delay the battle and make sure Daro couldn’t grow stronger.”<br>
“Why couldn’t he?”<br>
“Because he knew what he was fighting for, and he wasn’t supposed to be fighting Daro. The man who was supposed to fight him didn’t for some reason, and he had to continue the fight.”<br>
“Who was supposed to fight him?”<br>
“I don’t know. All I know is that Korrash was fighting what Serhan is supposed to be fighting, the evils of human nature, not evil it self.”<br>
“I don’t understand how there’s a difference…”<br>
“Evil is a force within everything. Human evil is the ignorance that makes people think violence solves problems and fills the hole those problems create. These have to be fought separately.”<br>
Asunder nodded thoughtfully, the night had already drawn a curtain over the usually blue sky.<br>
“So you’re not trying to end this are you?”<br>
“No, that’s not what I’m supposed to do Asunder. Fools can change all of history with one bad action. I’m not going to do this because I’m going to find out exactly where I’m supposed to be and exactly what I’m supposed to do so I won’t live with any regret because I’ll do what the fates bid me do.”<br>
“Don’t you dislike heeding the word of the stars?”<br>
“They’ve seen the entire span of all history, they’ve guided everything before me and you and they’ve taken me this far, I don’t see how I can mistrust them. I know parts of what are going to happen to me. I know I’m going to live and I know I’m going to have to fight Daro. That’s where I’m supposed to be.”<br>
Asunder mounted his horse, looking back to the sky.<br>
“I often wonder if my life up to this point has been entirely worthless. But I think the fact that I’ve learned from it makes it worth it. The fates are good teachers at least.”<br>
“They have to be so we can understand where we’re supposed to be. Otherwise nothing they do would work.”<br>
“I wonder where I’m supposed to be.”<br>
“Only you can figure that out, but if you’re here and feel right then you’re supposed to be here.”<br>
“What if you feel wrong?”<br>
“Then you do what everyone who is lost does, find yourself. To many people use that as a reason to become a soldier. They are wrong of course. Because you’ll still feel wrong, you’ll just feel wrong in a different way.”<br>
Asunder nodded as Xvar mounted and they rode back to camp, taking their time to admire the stars.<br>

Asunder groaned and snored and shifted in his bed but none of this bothered Xvar at all.<br>
His dreams were quiet, absolutely silent and peaceful. He dreamed of sitting in the colony on a hill in the snow when he was a young boy. Before he had to go to training, before he came here. The entire land would be covered in a light sheet of snow. He would run through it, looking behind him intermittently at the familiar footprints he made. All that he heard in the dream was that soothing sound of the snow crunching under the weight of his foot. He would dance around, trying to confuse his footprints, trying to get them to miss their step. He would smile and jeer at them, racing them into the open fields.<br>
He started to hear the drums in the background. The sky was growing darker and he saw the firelight gaining more presence in his site then the sun’s last rays. He skipped back to the city’s walls and his mother would taunt him playfully. His father was bending down to ruffle his hair, a sign of affection. Xvar would smile and grab their hands and swing on them until they returned home.<br>
More sounds in the dream appeared the scene shifted suddenly to his days in training. The walls of musty stone seeming to go on forever as he looked up to them. He saw himself running through Faydark, chasing and orc and killing him. The first orc he ever killed. He saw himself standing over it asphyxiated in bewilderment and guilt as he warily touched the blood on his blade and then gave the orc a timid kick.<br>
“Dead… He’s dead…” the little boy whispered. Xvar jolted out of his dream, sitting upright, sweating lightly and panting. The tent door had blown open and he saw snowflakes coming through. He fidgeted and then put his legs over the edge of the bed leaning his weight onto them as he sat. His arms resting on his knees he looked out the window, cocking his head slightly to its side.<br>
He stifled the urge to shiver as he stood up and the wind blew on him. He walked to the tent door and looked out as the tent flap gently slapped against his leg with each wind gust. Putting his hand on the tent pole he leaned out slightly, there were at least 3 inches of snow covering the ground. Securing the tent flap he went back to his bed, sitting down and pulling on his boots and over tunic. He walked over to Asunder’s cot and nudged him Asunder rolled over and grunted something to the affect of, “Just a bit longer.”<br>
Xvar went outside and began to pack up his things into his saddlebags.<br>
The hairs bristled on the back of his neck as he thought he heard a sound. Calmly he spoke. “Asunder?”<br>
No answer. His brow furrowed in quandary and he turned around slowly.<br>
A lone figure stood. A long, hunter green cape wrapped tightly around them.<br>
“Jerra?” Xvar asked, his eyebrow slightly raised.<br>
Jerra smiled. “Did I surprise you?”<br>
Xvar smirked slightly then turned back to his horse, speaking. “I thought you’d stay with Serhan, or is Dacrin not your enemy?”<br>
Jerra shook her head and gave a sigh of defeat. “No. He’s not. He took a new name too.”<br>
“Yeah, Ekul Mekon. Doesn’t that mean “Sure Victory” in Orc?”<br>
Jerra nodded slowly. “Someone else has appeared as a general in Lugiver’s forces.”<br>
“Who’s that?”<br>
“Kurt Durmen.”<br>
Xvar turned around, his look made it obvious that the name was familiar but unplacable.<br>
“He was some sort of gladiator in Freeport for awhile, when the Deathfist took over he served them loyally. So I guess the orcs have teamed up.”<br>
Xvar nodded, still looking as if thinking about the name.<br>
“Yeah, I would’ve guessed by now the orcs have at least figured out they need to unify to defeat anyone.”<br>
Jerra was towing her horse behind her and walked up next to Xvar, tying her horse to the tree.<br>
 She turned and leaned her back against it, nuzzling her horse’s nose while she stood looking up into the sky. “What’s it like being home like this?”<br>
“This isn’t my home.” Xvar said flatly.<br>
Jerra looked over at him rather surprised. “But you’re Dakan aren’t you?”<br>
Xvar nodded. “This is my homeland, but not my home. My home is in Kelethin now.”<br>
“Why is that?”<br>
“Home is wherever whoever believes in you lives. That’s the only place worth going back to after you fight.”<br>
Jerra gave a gentle smile, as if reminiscing about her childhood.<br>
“Where’s my home now I wonder.” Jerra said sadly.<br>
“With me and Asunder. Xvar turned away and walked back over to the tent. “Speaking of Asunder I need to wake him up before death is tricked into thinking he should pull Asunder to the otherside for resembling rigormortice.”<br>
Jerra laughed and stood up from the tree walking to her saddlebag she removed a small meat pie and happily munched on it, watching the gray clouds slowly crawl over the sky.<br>
Xvar pulled Asunder’s cot over and then walked back out of the tent. Pulling on his armor. <br>
“5…4…3…2…1…”<br>
“Bloody hell! Don’t do that Xvar, the floor is cold as ice!” Asunder yelled from in the tent.<br>
“You’d think he’d wake up when he hit the ground…” Xvar said conversationally to Jerra passing her and moving to his horse. Asunder had pulled on his armor and boots and started to put the tent down. After they were done disassembling it they mounted their horses and discussed where they should search. Xvar circled several areas with his finger on the map. <br>
“We might have some luck around here, these castle ruins date back to about when the legend started.”<br>
Asunder nodded and pulled on his reins lightly, getting his horse’s attention.<br>
“Shall we?” He said with a smile.<br>
Xvar nodded. “Let’s shall.”<br>
<br>
Lugiver smiled as he looked over the maps spread out on the thick oak table. Dacrin and Kurt sat at opposite ends nodding and making suggestions on Lugiver’s plans.<br>
The slowly poured over the plans for Kelethin, looking for all the weak beam supports and lifts.<br>
“We will destroy the lifts, cutting them off from getting more food. Then we trap the Elven forces within Felwithe until they to starve or relinquish defeat.”<br>
Kurt spoke up. “As long as I get to fight, the plans are fine with me.”<br>
Dacrin nodded silently, his arms folded and his eyes closed, his chin nearly touching his chest.<br>
“I’m glad you’re both so eager to fight.” Lugiver said slowly. “But it’s best that you remember the plan.”<br>
Simultaneously reciting the plan Dacrin and Kurt then stood and left the room.<br>
Lugiver knocked over a chair in anger. Moving his weight onto the table through his hands he began to mutter angrily. “Live or die I don’t care as long as they die for me and live for their duty alone.”<br>

Asunder was giving Jerra some riding tips and they were laughing and talking. The snow had stopped, and as the neared the coast, the snow was more and more scarce. <br>
The riding had progressively gotten easier as well as the neared the ruins of the coastal castle. It had once been a magnificent, proud castle standing like a king over all the people. The stones were now covered in moss and lichens, rodents scurrying between them. Jerra and Asunder fell silent as they neared it. Asunder stopped about 50 feet away and tied his horse to a tree. Walking forward slowly, looking warily around the clearing.<br>
Jerra follow his example, dismounting and tying her horse. Xvar had already tied his up and was nearly at the ruins. She jogged to catch up with them.<br>
Xvar put his hand up and Asunder and Jerra froze in their step. Xvar approached the ruins more slowly, looking as if focused on something in them just out of site.<br>
He reached down and picked it up, it was an old torn banner.<br>
"Marko Qerec Dasan Dakan!" He read aloud.<br>
Asunder translated under his breath, "Long live the Dakan."<br>
Xvar fell to his knees cradling the banner in his arms his eyes shut tightly. Jerra ran to his side falling to her knees as well. Xvar wasn't crying but looked as if remembering something painful. He stood up Jerra looking up at him with much worry in her eyes. Asunder walked over to it and took the banner from Xvar.<br>
"This is not what we fought for. We didn't fight for banners, for fabric with symbols on them. We are the true lands, the true banners. We fought for our people, our way, our children!" He started to yell, then threw the banner to the ground and fell over sobbing. Jerra was by his side in an instant, rubbing his back and trying to sooth him.<br>
Xvar looked over to Jerra who looked up at him concerned.<br>
Xvar walked into the ruins, rummaging around through the boulders and rocks.<br>
Asunder had composed himself and was now looking around as well, Jerra close to his side. Asunder treated Jerra like a daughter, helping her with any rocks she couldn't move and always being protective. Xvar almost smiled at this.<br>
"When Asunder and I return to Kelethin I know Jerra will have a home." He thought to himself. The thought reassured him and he thought of his own home.<br>
"Mine will be with Serhan, because she is my reason." He thought to himself.<br>
At that moment Asunder rolled over a large stone with his shoulder and shouted to Xvar. Xvar ran over and looked down at the curious chest. He removed his lock picks from his belt pouch and began to coerce the lock into opening.<br>
Finally he heard a triumphant click and pulled the lock off. He slowly opened the lid to the chest revealing something covered by purple silk.<br>
"Damnit." He said. "That's not it." He said standing and turning away.<br>
Asunder looked at him with perplexity, pulling off the silk revealing a king's ransom in jewels.<br>
"How did you know?"<br>
"I recognized the lock as being royal issue and the purple silk was a dead give away. Only kings use purple, it's the royal color."<br>
Asunder nodded then smirked. "Well, we can't just leave it here, can we?"<br>
Xvar was already walking over to his horse. "Grab anything you can carry, it'll buy you some better armor. Same to you Jerra."<br>
Jerra and Asunder nodded and took handfuls of the jewels, using their shirts as makeshift pouches then dumping the riches into their saddlebags.<br>
Xvar pulled out the map mumbling to himself the names of the various routes.<br>
"Hn. His one looks promising." He said pointing to a route slightly north of the ruins. Tracing the line with his finger it led to the ruins of the old capital. The capital was moved several times, and this was one of the oldest.<br>
"This was built around that time, wasn't it Asunder?"<br>
"Yes, yes it was. That's Fliran right?"<br>
Xvar nodded as Jerra watched on.<br>
Asunder hopped on his horse and grabbed the reins. "Well then, let's give it a shot."<br>
Jerra nodded and Xvar gave his horse a stern kick setting it into a trot so he could keep talking. Asunder and Jerra matched his pace as he explained how they were going to have to go through several obstacles to reach Fliran.<br>
"Fliran was very well protected, but since a couple of key flaws in the defenses were found the capital was moved."<br>
Asunder nodded, "I heard there's some sort of underground tunnel."<br>
"Yes, there is. It's big enough to travel by cart through if you wanted. But getting to the entrance isn't exactly easy and I'd expect by now the tunnels are heavily infested by Tunare knows what."<br>
Jerra spoke up. "Do you think we could make it through safely?"<br>
"It's pretty much our only option, so we have to give it a try."<br>
Asunder smiled at Jerra. "Don't worry a bit, we'll all watch each other's backs. Right Xvar?"<br>
"Right."<br>
<br>
Serhan moved quickly through the halls to Magnatic's chambers several parchments in hand.<br>
"Magnatic!"<br>
Magnatic was leaning over a letter, writing slowly.<br>
"Yes?"<br>
She slapped the paper on his desk, on top of the letter.<br>
"Mysterious orc forces seem to be targeting farms on outskirts of Faydark…" <br>
"Lugiver." Magnatic muttered angrily.<br>
"He's slowly trying to attack our food sources and infrastructure, cutting us off from the frontiers. The orcs have been attacking all messengers on the roads."<br>
"He's clever. But he made one mistake he started to soon. It's too obvious that he's behind it. We can turn the people completely against him. Leave it to him to try and ruin this fragile peace."<br>
"I don't think fighting is the best answer here. The orcs are like children, ignorant and spoiled. We have to change them, not kill them."<br>
"I know that Serhan, but how do we do that? They are very loyal to the tradition of war."<br>
Serhan nodded sadly. "We must find a way."<br>
"And soon." Magnatic finished. "Before we have to fight a war. It's foolish of Lugiver to do this unless he has something up his sleeve. The Crushbone could never defeat us alone…" A wave of realization washed over Magnatic and Serhan instantaneously.<br>
"They're not alone," They both said slowly, turning to eachother.<br>
"We have to find out exactly who they are allying with!"<br>
"We must send spies…"<br>
"But who?"<br>
Magnatic stood quickly, holding Serhan's shoulders he said with a smile. "I know exactly who can do it."<br>
"Tyu and Farren?" Serhan questioned.<br>
Magnatic nodded and walked briskly out of the room.<br>
Serhan sat down on his desk catching her cheek in her hand, her elbow on her knee.<br>
"If they can't do it there's only one person who can…"<br>
<br>
"Xvar!" Asunder shouted pointing to the horizon.<br>
"Kobolds?" Xvar questioned.<br>
"What are they doing around in this area?" Jerra asked.<br>
Xvar shook his head dumbly. "I have no idea."<br>
Asunder tugged the reins fiercely stopping his horse abruptly.<br>
Xvar and Jerra also stopped looking at the band of dots slowly descending from the horizon.<br>
"A whole pack. Maybe 12 most."<br>
"Think we can take them?" Asunder questioned at Xvar.<br>
Xvar nodded. "Yes, but we need to get the horse away from here, we can only keep some many kobolds entertained at once the others would rip the horses to shreads."<br>
Asunder nodded and they all dismounted.<br>
"Jerra." Xvar shouted and she turned her head quickly. "Take the horses as deep in to that brush as you can, don't change direction, just walk straight. We'll shout to you when we've got this finished. If something goes wrong and we don't shout, jump on your horse and ride out of here. Got it?"<br>
She nodded hurriedly and grabbed the horses running into the dense thicket on the side of the road.<br>
Xvar looked to Asunder who had already drawn his sword and was ready for the impending fight.<br>
"Don't stop fighting. I know we're not supposed to die here." Xvar placed a stick right by his feet, it's end was slightly sharpened.<br>
Asunder nodded, slightly reassured by Xvar's stern voice.<br>
The kobolds were tackling eachother every few steps. Playfully wrestling without a care. Then one stopped in mid gate and sniffed the air. All the others stopped and mimicked his behavior. A fit of barking and howling ensued as they recognized the smell. The stronger males went to the front, charging ahead.<br>
Xvar pulled out his daggers and stood stock still, waiting for the males to reach them.<br>
"Once we kill these the others will probably flee, but don't move until I tell you we'd killed them all."<br>
"I understand." Asunder hissed through his teeth, his gaze locked on the 4 stocky males approaching. It was their hair color that confused Xvar the most. Most kobolds are light brown with large flecks of blackish spots. But these were a red clay color with tan spots.<br>
They bared their teeth and growled as they grew closer, their claws began to show out of their paws.<br>
"You take the two on the left." Xvar whispered quietly.<br>
"Got 'em." Asunder whispered back.<br>
Suddenly the males charged forward gaining speed with each step. Xvar leaned down and grabbed a stick on the ground and as the kobold jumped it landed on the stick's end - impaling it straight through. The stick broke under the kobold's weight and Xvar had to roll out of the way so the kobold wouldn't crush him. As he turned the other kobold pounced on him. Xvar held the kobold's mouth away from his neck and they rolled over the ground, Xvar desperately trying to make his mark with his dagger.<br>
Asunder had decapitated the first kobold with a clean diagonal slash, but the other was far more elusive. He swung and swung but the kobold managed to dodge each blow.<br>
Xvar finally managed to stab the kobold just below the neck and tried to pull his dagger down the body through the collar bone and the kobold yelped out in pain. The kobold backed off of him and swayed back and forth slightly. Making some dog-like whimpering sounds until it finally fell with a large "thump" on the ground. Xvar sat panting for a moment then jumped up as he saw Asunder still fighting the other kobold. He ran and jumped on the kobold's large back thrusting his dagger between several ribs then pulling the dagger out only to stab again at the base of the neck. The kobold gave a large howl of pain then immediately fell to the ground.<br>
Asunder held his sword and let the tip touch the ground as he reached out to Xvar helping him up. He sheathed his sword back in its scabbard and Xvar sat on the kobold corpse wiping the greenish blood off his daggers.<br>
The other kobolds howled for several minutes in the distance, mourning the death of the males then eventually moped off into the thicket.<br>
Xvar yelled to Jerra. "Return now."<br>
Asunder sat next to him on the kobold corpse. "Should we skin them?"<br>
"We don't really need to, we've got enough furs for now."<br>
Asunder nodded looking down to the kobold's head which was slowly drooling blood into a large puddle underneath its left temple. <br>
Jerra pulled the horses out of the thicket several feet in front on them. She looked at the kobolds and walked forward slowly to inspect one.<br>
"I've never seen any kobolds this color."<br>
"Neither have we." Asunder said.<br>
"I think we should be more careful, if the kobolds are different who knows what else may have changed or migrated to this area." Xvar said, standing and walking to his horse.<br>
They mounted and began again on the road, but this more alert…<br>

it is excellent writing.  the content is very in depth encompassing many areas.  the ideas of government, good vs evil, war, etc are expressed very well.  i'd have to agree with everyone else and beg that you continue.  however, it is the holiday season, maybe you should take a break no?  <br>
<br>
i do have one question though...  where in the world do you have time to write all of this??  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG align=baseline border=0 hspace=0
