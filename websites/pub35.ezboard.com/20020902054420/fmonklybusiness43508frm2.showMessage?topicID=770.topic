Somewhere in your playing days you will visit kael. Almost all of the higher level giants there (45+) drop chain/silk/leather/plate quest pieces. According to the slot, you hand in these pieces along with the right gems (found on many sites) to the corresponding quest giver in thurgadin (located in the building right after you zone in from GD above the bridge). This armor is fairly good mid-high level armor, but you need at least amiable to coldain (I think). Starting off at dubious to all, you're going to need to do some work on this faction.<br><br>2. There are many good SS quests (bracer of hammerfal, DTC, etc.) that require decent faction with Skyshrine (which is almost all on CoV). Like Kael, you need the right armor piece and the gems to go along with it to get the armor. The armor drops in ToV (off of WW) in the HoT. You need ally to do these quests.<br><br><br>            RAISING FACTION<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ There are many ways to raise your CoV and COldain faction. Faction hits are directly related to the level of the mob/difficulty of quest. You can use the simple quests stated in Xorshaik's post and I think the SS armors give CoV faction as well (but you have ally already). Around level 40 you can hunt drakkel wolves in GD for some good xp and faction that would probably raise you a few levels by the time you're done. If grouped or around level 50 you can hunt the giants outside the giant fort in GD but stay away from elites and beserkers. If 55+ or 50+ grouped you can hunt at the giant fort in EW or in kael near the EW or WL zone line. If you want faction fast (and loot) get a few 50+ groups and go to the arena. You will go from kos to CoV to dubious in maybe 4 hours and get some good loot to boot. Also note that going from kos to dubious = going from dubious to ally or so, so don't get discouraged. <br><br>PS: Sometime you might go deep in SS and realize your kos to some mobs - these are on yelinak faction that can only be raised by killing tormax and/or his guards. The same thing can happen if you go inside icewell and are dubious to most poeple there, they are on dain faction that I don't know how to raise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/01/12/24/flamingtext_com.111719681.gif"><br> 52 Barrels of Monkeys<br>Karana Server<br><a href= "http://clanofunity.com.cnchost.com" target=_blank>Clan of Unity</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=805" target=_blank>My Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ukanerwei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanerwei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(2/2/02 1:13:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=770.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting CoV/Coldain faction</span><hr size=1> To expand on some of the kael info above...<br><br>Arena can be done with a single group, at/around 55.. we've done it with 59 monk, 56 war, 52 cleric, 52 cleric, 52 war, 52 druid. Single groups in arena can get a bit hairy, but it can be done if you keep your cool.<br><br>If you're just in arena for faction, then yes - bring as many groups as possible... more groups = more kills. More kills = more faction.<br><br>Hits in arena are nice, - kromzek, -kromriff, -tormax, +CoV (for most mobs). Arena giants are Storm Giants (kromzek) which means they *DONT* give dwarf faction... only some senior guards and regular guards do.<br><br>In 4 hours, I gained probably.... 3 faction levels with CoV. This was with 2 groups, so we werent slaughtering the giants. With a full, 4 group raid, i think it would be possible to get to ally in 4 hours.<br><br>Drops in arena - Anything 50+ has a chance to drop armor. So, while working on faction, you can get armor! yippie =D And there's always Bkjor the cold, who drops Gladiator Chain Leggings, and Sceptre of Mastery, and other named mobs.<br><br>Also, I've noticed that not very many Giant Warrior Helms drop in the Arena. Maybe Stormies dont drop helms... not sure. If you want to get some good faction, with a group of 50ish, head over to square, or icehouse. Mobs around there drop helms all the time. Helms are used in a SkyShrine faction quest.<br><br>As for Non-arena hunting, Drakkel Dire Wolves are good for quick, small faction hits... but really, you should only kill Dire's if you're solo and cant take giants, or if they're adds during fight. In my experience, i've found that about 5 wolves give an equal faction hit to a frosty scout. I could be wrong here, i dont have any *hard* evidence <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p><table width=640 border=1 bgcolor=#333333 bordercolor=#000000><tr><td width=320 bgcolor=#660000><img src="http://ga.vr9.com/ga-small.gif" align=right><font face="Arial"><font color=#FFFFFF size=+1><b><br><center>Yeonik Shadowclinger</b><br></font><font color=#969696 size=-1>42 Monk<br><a href="http://www.guardianalliance.org" style="text-decoration:none; color: #969696;"><u>Guardian Alliance</u></a><br>Zeb Server</center></font></font></td><td width=320 bgcolor=#660000><img src="http://ga.vr9.com/ga-small.gif" align=right><font face="Arial"><font color=#FFFFFF size=+1><b><br><center>Kanerwei Stonescream</b><br></font><font color=#969696 size=-1>52 Wanderer<br><a href="http://www.guardianalliance.org" style="text-decoration:none; color: #969696;"><u>Guardian Alliance</u></a><br>Zeb Server</center></font></font></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/urenalan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Renalan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~kwch1/1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(2/2/02 11:03:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=770.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~kwch1/1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting CoV/Coldain faction</span><hr size=1> Another good idea:<br><br>Check your server's calendar and find out when an uber guild will be doing the 10th ring war.... stay in it from the beginning tagging mobs.
