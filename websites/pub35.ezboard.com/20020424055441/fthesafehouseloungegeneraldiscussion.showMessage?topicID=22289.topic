A thief is a very combat weak class that basically wears very light armor and easily concealable weapons.<br>They have a lot of skills finding and removing traps, and can ambush extremely well.  A rogue on the other hand is almost a warrior type with some thieves skills, though they never get as good as a thief in that respect.  They wear semi-light armor, and can fight almost as well as a warrior from the front ( though they don't have quite the hit points of one ).  <br><br>I guess the question is, would you be willing to give up more hit points, not fight as well from the front and wearing leather armor only, in exchange for: being an expert in trapfinding/removing, having a single backstab that can turn the tide of a battle, climbing walls, having a chance to read just about any language, and even having a chance to use INT caster spells ( you could buy a spell from a vendor, and have a chance of right-clicking on it to use it up, with a 25% chance of backfiring )  ?<br><br>Granted EQ will never have these kinds of things, and starting over when you have a extremely high level character wouldn't be appealing.  However is a thief basically the class a lot of people were actually looking for and rogue was just the closest thing EQ had ?  <br><br>This is not a flame in any way shape or form, as I find EQ to be a great game ( even if it gets aggravating at times ).  Please feel free to disagree, add, or change any of the ideas that were thought of up there.  For those that are table-top RPG game fans, the games in question I got the comparsions from were Dungeons and Dragons, Rolemaster, and Palladium. <p><img src="http://www.twilite.org/~chrome/images/sigs/larcensig.jpg" border="0"><BR>Larcen Mistwalker <BR>Assassin of Amity<BR><BR>Love is the greatest treasure</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=myndrall>myndrall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 1:20:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22289.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I think the class some of us really wanted was a THIEF</span><hr size=1> Well, not to high jack a pretty decent thread, but...<br><br>I dont think i would go for Thief so much as Assassin... i dont just mean the title you get at lvl 60..

Maybe (randomly) later once the effect wears off, you will lose faction form what it was originally. ie the if Merchant realise he was cheated.<br><br>SPRINT<br>Allows rogues to run off at sow speed for a few secs or till stamina drains. Reuse time maybe like 20-30 min. RL scenario would be like when a thief gets caught stealing so he dashes off to get away from the authority. (yeah similar to DAOC) <br><br>SPELL<br>Maybe simple spell should be good enough. More in the line of causing mishief. Can't think of any yet.<br><br>LEAP:<br>Allows us to jump higher than others.(think ninja)<br><br>STALK /ING<br>Basically target a mob click stalk after that you just follow the mob manually of course. There is a chance that the mob being stalked will realise it is being followed. When you later(certain time limitation) engage the mob you will have a chance to cause insane damage to this specific mob. Basically you been stalking the enemy and know its weak pts so chance to cause more dam. <br><br>This skill should be used in conjunction with distraction to lure a mob to a safe spot to finish off.<br><br>SET TRAPS<br>Basically it should work by placing a trap object on the ground and when a mob walks over it. Dam or effect is dealt to the mob. Of course some mob will be able to detect traps and will be unharmed by the traps.<br><br>CLIMB<br>Wood elfs should get this ). Anyways I don't think it will be implemented. Or that they can make only certain wall scalable.<br><br>Jump -&gt; Backstab<br>To Cause even a higher BS damge. But has a high chance of missing.<br><br>DISGUISE<br>NOT disguise as a different race but a CLASS only. ( just a toy or could be used in certain quests, in PvP servers and to stop people form thinking I am a druid/ranger) <br><br>STRANGULATE<br>With the correct equipment the ability to Strangulate certain mobs but can only be done from behind. If mob have EB capability then it will not work. Mob will lose HP from when this skill is used after they run out of breath. This skill should be affected by STR and also drains the enemy and your stamina. If the rogue str is lower than the mob it will be easily be disrupted.<br><br><br>Will add more later. <br><br>regards,<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uredniwrah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Redniwrah</A> at: 2/15/02 6:43:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukelthana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelthana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 7:16:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22289.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I think the class some of us really wanted was a THIEF</span><hr size=1> Distraction was an ability that we discussed here before settling on Evade, back around the time of the original Reasonable Rogue Petition.

The thief class, as I defined it to myself, could go two ways: <br><br>1 - ultra-light combat concentrating mainly on missiles and the occasional backstab (definitely not a survivor in melee) who relied on the laying of traps, use of poison, and the skills of larceny (pickpocket and pick-lock) to get by. These types have high agility and dexterity, excellent avoidance, and are limited to light and fast weaponry (piercers and missiles) which can be easily concealed. They have high skill in trap placement and disarming, and are never short of cash, or trouble, and can hide &quot;in the shadows&quot; to avoid detection. This is a typical AD&amp;D thief.<br><br>2 - the ambusher / assassin. Medium combat durability with superlative fighting skills and high damage but relatively low hitpoints. Made to attack fast, do big damage, and get back out of range. Limited to piercing or low-delay slashing weapons, excellent agility and avoidance but limited armor class. Their skills are almost totally weaponry-based and they have a high attack capability but not much defense. Their non-combat abilities are somewhat limited, but they enjoy the same stealth characteristics as thieves. AD&amp;D has called these types &quot;assassins&quot; and &quot;swashbucklers&quot; and even &quot;blademasters&quot;. <br><br>Prior to EQ I played my rogues as assassins: acrobatic, elusive, and devestating in attack, but vulnerable in defense being somewhat frailer than most melee. I have toyed with the thief style somewhat, but when I got into my EQ rogue I found my &quot;home&quot; style pretty much perfectly represented - even if they DID advise putting points into utterly useless stats =/ <p><font size=3><font color=#990033><font face=copperplate gothic light, times new roman, arial>Merribelle Stealshearts</font><BR><font size=2><font face=copperplate gothic light, times new roman, arial>~hench-wench~ <BR><A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/bwarcry97210>Cry of War</A></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udizzykid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dizzy Kid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 8:19:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22289.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dizzykid.homestead.com/files/eyes01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I think the class some of us really wanted was a THIEF</span><hr size=1> Hrmm, in UO, I played a Thief (Nico) and an Assassin (Rulu) type of rogues.

You can spend some good time working on stealth, pick locks, pockets, traps etc and view yourself as a thief, or be a weaker melee class with a big assassin backstab. Rogues are really a lil of both. Some of the aaxp choices you pick, and what skills you really work on would partly make the difference on whether you view yourself as a thief or assassin.
