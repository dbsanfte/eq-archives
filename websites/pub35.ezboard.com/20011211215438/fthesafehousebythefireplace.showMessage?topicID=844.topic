<br>
My name is Darigaaz Kezzerdrix, and I am a thief not by choice but out of necessity.  I was born a half-elf, but that is only part of my story. <br>
<br>
I was born to a wood elf female, and my mothers name is Mordoria, she was a kind and loving person.  Her brethren considered her a druid and at one with nature and the delicate balance of life.  She was born and raised amongst her brethren in Kelethin on the island of Faydwer.  My father was a human warrior name Kamahl.  My father belonged to the warriors of Freeport.  He was a highly respected and decorated warrior.  It was only natural that he was asked to help assist the elfs and their battle against the Orcs on Faydwer.  The myth passed down is that the elfs were able to withstand the onslaught of the Orcs but there were many, many losses.  My father had been so badly wounded that he was unable to travel back to Freeport and partake in the hero’s welcome that awaited him.  <br>
<br>
Mordoria tended to my father, she wrapped his wounds and changed his battle dressings.  He was so badly wounded that at night he would awake trembling and gasping for air, he claimed that he could feel water filling his lungs as he plunged deeper and deeper into black and cold water.  Over time he was well enough to accompany my mother on walks thru the lush woodlands, and it is there under the tallest tree that I was conceived.  <br>
<br>
My mother and father wed in a secret ceremony, and 2 months later I was born.  I was half human and half elf.  Some would think that this would make a fine young man – the strength of a human and the quickness of an elf, but my mother’s family did not feel this way….in fact they disowned her and asked her to leave her home.  My mother and father had been confronted by a foe that they had not seen, a foe that could not be slain; that foe was hate and indifference.  <br>
<br>
My parents decided that the time had come to leave Faydwer and sail back to Antonica.  They thought for sure that my father would be able to provide my mother and I with a comfortable and modest living.  As my parents waited for the boat they heard the whispers and they watched as people moved from their path…they thought how could a love like theirs be so impure.  My father held my mother and sobbed.  In years prior; these very people cheered my father, now he was their bane.  <br>
<br>
The boat ride was long and arduous, 30 days be told, they had picked the worst time to make the trip.  My father had become ill.  As they passed thru the Ocean of Tears my father worsened, my mother’s pleas for help went unanswered…she soaked rags and placed them on his forehead and she hoped that in time things could be like they had envisioned.  One morning my father awoke, unable to see his wifes face in front of him – he whispered to her…be safe, be strong…and raise our son to be a….a ….and with that his eyes froze open and his mouth gaped.  My mother sat and held my father; she stroked his hair and rocked him in her arms.   The captain of the boat shyly asked my mother to release my father to the sea.  My mother wanted to give him a proper burial but she was denied, she wrapped him in his cloak, placed his shield and blade on his chest and lowered him into the sea.  With a plunge he drifted slowly into the murky waters.     <br>
<br>
My mother and I finally arrived on Antonica, I still remember the shouts of “Boat, Boat, Boat”, as we slid into the docks.  Prior to getting off of the boat my mother stared solemnly at the sea and then she turned towards the docks and took a step onto the creaky planks and shuttled me to safety.  The people of Freeport were no less forgiving and accepting then those on Faydwer.  My mother was shunned and forced to endure harsh working conditions and long work hours to put food on the table and clothes on our backs.  It wasn’t that my mother was incapable of work, it was because I was a half-elf and that she was not able to freely work amongst others.  <br>
<br>
Over time I grew, I was barely 9 seasons when I recall watching my mother returning from her work at a merchants store inside the East Freeport gates, I watched helplessly as my mother was knocked down by a Freeport guard and spat on – he called her a harsh name and kept walking.  <br>
<br>
My mother entered our doorway crying and she fell on the floor sobbing…..I screamed that I wish I was never born!   <br>
<br>
That was the last time that I ever shared a home with my mother.  <br>
<br>
I left home; I would rather live amongst sewer rats then watch my mother suffer.  I had to steal to eat, I had to pick pockets for coin, and I did all I could do to survive.  One day I was able to lift a fine steel dagger from a Freeport guard.  It was a sight to hold, it glistened in the sunlight and it was sharp as broken stained glass.  I had become so good at sneaking around town that I was able to walk up behind merchants, take a bite from an apple and return it without being seen.  One day I was actually hiding in an alleyway waiting for the April rains to pass when I heard talking…it was that guard that had kicked my mother many years prior!  My heart pounded and my hands shook…as his friend walked away he sat there laughing and mumbling…he had obviously been drinking ale.  I snuck up behind him, I wanted to see his eyes, I wanted to curse him….he then slowly stumbled to his feet, I felt a rush flow thru me.  At that moment I felt rage fill my heart, and I could see my mother lying motionless on the cold dirt….I grabbed my dagger and buried it deep in his back – it pierced his cloak and the tip of my blade just stuck out of his chest guard.  He turned to me, almost amazed by what was happening.  I looked into his eyes and I gritted my teeth….I whispered to him “you can’t slay what you cannot see, you can’t beat what you cannot catch”.  I let him slump to the floor and I drifted away.  <br>
<br>
I had felt vilified for a moment.  I felt a need to return to see my mother – late spring I found her working in an alehouse not far from the bank in North Freeport.  I slipped into the back door and I snuck behind a box, my mother entered the room a moment later.  I could see that time had been kind to my mother.  She looked beautiful but her eyes were filled with such sadness.  The patrons grumbled for more ale and as quickly as she entered the room she was gone.  I wanted to hug her, tell her that I was okay but I was afraid that she wouldn’t approve of me and what I had become – a two bit thief.  I knew that if I only had enough coin to take her away, to show her that I was honorable, we could rekindle some of what was lost.      <br>
<br>
That summer I was sitting on the docks in Freeport.  I was hungry and I noticed a maiden fishing from the docks.  Her pail was filled with fresh catch; I could almost taste the fish on a skewer roasting over a flame with some freshly picked vegetables.  I slowly snuck up behind her; I had become so adept at sneaking past guards and folk that even the creaky old plank boards hardly moved to my weight.  I took a fish from her pail and I back peddled under the dock.  I sat down on a flour bag, I reached up for a torch and I skewered the fish.  I was sitting down enjoying my reward when I felt a hard, firm hand slap and grab my shoulder.  I turned around quickly to see a dwarven gentlemen standing there.  His eyes were black as coal but I knew that he had meant no harm.  I spit out the fish that had filled my mouth and inquired as to how I could help him – I thought for sure that I had finally been caught.  He told me that he knew of me, and that he knew of my father and mother.  I was both excited and fearful.  He saw my dagger dangling from my belt pouch, he laughed and pulled out a serrated dagger.  He offered it to me handle first and said “the only weapon superior to a dagger, is two”.  I quickly took the dagger, I was hopeful to remove any chance of him turning it on me.  I asked him how he knew of me?  He grinned, looked side to side; he tugged his beard and said, “follow me”.  I followed him down some stairs to a dark and hidden area that I never knew existed, and I had crept thru every hole and crevice in town I thought.  <br>
<br>
It was there amongst the sound of the surf and gulls that he told me that my path had been chosen and that I could not turn it now.  He said he thought for sure that I’d grow to be a warrior like my father.  I pleaded again – how did he know of me?  He took a deep breath, slumped down and told me of the battle of the Orcs.  This gentleman had fought side by side with my father.  I said so you’re a warrior!  He laughed, and said, “well, not really”.  He said I’m a Rogue, like you.  I said like me?  I was amazed….he said he had become a Rogue not by choice, but by path.  <br>
<br>
I explained to him my troubles and how I wanted to aid my mother.  But I felt that how could I a “Rogue”, amount to anything?  How could one with daggers battle armies with lances?  He angrily pulled 2 daggers from a shoulder strap and spun them on the tip of each index finger independently, he quickly turned and threw them at me – I ducked and they stuck into the wall behind me with a shudder.  I slowly rose to me feet running my fingers thru my hair checking to see if I lost any hair.  He grabbed me and shook me, he said if you remember one thing remember this - “armies can defeat armies, but assassins can dethrone kings”.  He said that I already knew most of what needed to be known, and that in time I should return to seek additional training as my skills were sharpened.  I fell asleep on a pile of flour bags as friends of my host slowly entered the same way I did and watched as they quickly and silently disappeared out of sight.  <br>
<br>
The following morning he told me of the city of Highhold Pass.  Evidently they were having problems controlling the local Orcs, and that the Highhold Keep was seeking help as well.  I wasn’t too enthused to go till I heard that many people were going there and acquiring great wealth.  After a hearty breakfast I decided to pack a backpack and head to this new city.  I felt renewed; I felt a sense of purpose and most of all I felt DEADLY. <br>
