We then swept around into the ass end of kuwait and ended up 50km outside of kuwait city before turning around and sweeping back through iraq and into SA where we started..<br>

1. There is no possible way only 45% of total force in theater was US.. It was a much higher number..I believe the VA says there was about 580k or 600k troops in theater at that time..<br>

I am sure there was not over 1 million total troops used in this operation.<br>

Ok, perhaps 90% was a high estimate, but 45% is definately low. Say approximately 2/3 of the forces there were US, based on Expedia.<br>
<br>
<br>
And to say that The US didn't do as much fighting? Hogwash. Anyone there knows that the US did their share of the Heavy Lifting. They had the training and equipment to be much more effective than any other military force there.<br>

Meddik, you may be interested in this quote, from an official account of the early stages of the gulf war...<br>
<br>
<br>
'At 0400, 6th French Light Armored Division scouts advanced into Iraq. Three hours later, the French main body attacked through a light rain. Its objective was As-Salman, a small airfield about 90 miles inside Iraq. Reinforced by the 2nd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, the French crossed the border unopposed and attacked north. Short of their objective, the French ran into outposts of the 45th Iraqi Mechanized Infantry Division. After a brief battle, using missile-armed Gazelle attack helicopters against dug-in enemy tanks and bunkers, the French captured 2,500 prisoners and controlled the objective. The French moved on through Objective Rochambeau and onto As-Salman, known as Objective White in the plan, without opposition. Less than seven hours into the operation, the French 6th Light Armored Division, supported by the 82nd Airborne Division, secured its objectives and continued the attack north. The left flank was secured.'<br>

<br>
However, their "Snootiness" and tendency to surrender to germans at the drop of a hat are overwhelming, (if perhaps unfair) stereotypes of the French.<br>
<br>
If someone mentions Canadians, they are often stereotyped as Heavyweight Beer drinkers, who consider Poutine to be a delicacy.<br>
<br>
If Someone mentions England, you immediately get the stereotype of really bad food and dentistry.<br>
<br>
Likewise, if someone mentions the US in another country, you are likely to get a stereotype of a bunch of uncouth yokels with gunracks in our pickup trucks, who consider a Big Mac with a Coke to be a delicacy.<br>
<br>
No, None of these stereotypes are entirely true. But that doesn't mean I'm going to quit poking fun at the french any time soon. I don't expect them to treat US Tourists any better either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaeildylanena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caeildy Lanena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/13/02 9:38:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4495.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.loftinspace.com.au/image/bowl.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;</span><hr size=1> Meddik your undeniable nationalism is, um, commendable.

<br>
I realise that some sections of the US do like to taunt the french with the collapse of 1940. But 'surrender to the Germans at the drop of a hat' IS unfair. VERY unfair.<br>
<br>
Some other statistics that may interest you, from just 25 years earlier... well within living memory of 1940.<br>
<br>
From 1914 to 1918 France mobilised 8,410,000 men. By 1918, 76% of them were casualties of war. 1,357,800 dead, 4,266,000 wounded, 537,000 MIA. A total of 6,160,800.<br>
<br>
Do you have the slightest conception of the national trauma that accompanied that? At all? I can barely understand it. Our casualty rate was half that, 34%, and it was still routinely assumed through to the 1960s that a significant number of women would not find husbands, because there were too few men. Society reeled after the war, and the much reviled appeasement policy was largely driven by determination to avoid it.<br>
<br>
The French were not enthusiastic about the Second World War, that's true. But is it any wonder? after six million casualties, SIX MILLION!<br>
<br>
No offence, Meddik, but while I can appreciate the occasional joke, it might be better if you backed off just a little bit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ullabaktharr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llabak Tharr</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 6:23:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4495.topic&index=103>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;</span><hr size=1> Just for the record casualty |= death.

Approx half of the wounded were permanently impaired. Not necessarily full on crippled, but lamed, or lung damaged, or something that would be noticable. (that applies to the British casualties actually, but I assume the French were the same).<br>
<br>
So your looking at about 4 million dead, crippled/perma-wounded or MIA.<br>
<br>
Some of the MIAs were found in POW camps but I'm not sure how many.<br>
<br>
As a basis for comparison, you may wish to note that according to US DoD records, the US have taken less than half as many casualties, 2,757,196.<br>
<br>
ever.<br>
<br>
since the US existed.<br>
<br>
pause for thought?<br>
<br>
<br>
PS. something else I found at the same time...<br>
<br>
For the Gulf War it is worth noting that various members of the allied coalition reimbursed the U.S. for 88-percent ($54 billion) of the amount shown, so the actual cost to the taxpayer was only about $7 billion, roughly the same as for the Spanish-American War, and on a per capita basis only $26.92, arguably the least expensive war in the nation's history. <br>

People need to wake up and smell the carnage.  This will only make people hate us more, and create, IMHO, more terrorists.  You think we'll be able to stop them too?  News Flash:  IF SOMEONE WANTS TO KILL YOU BAD ENOUGH, THEY WILL KILL YOU!!!  There's your &quot;Telling is like it is&quot;.  What we need to work on is getting the other countries to not want to kill us.  And don't even go into this crap about they hate us because we represent freedom.  They hate us because we're always sticking our nose in their buisseness.  Our presense over there has caused more deaths for them than anything they have ever done to us.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for finding and punishing the culprit.  I'm just not sure taking out a whole @#%$ load of innocent people in the process is quite the world relations reputation the U.S. needs.  Not to mention all this petty name calling.  You're evil!  No, you're evil!  ...I thought our civilization had gotten past all this stupid childish behavior.<br>
<br>
Call me paranoid, (and people have), but it seems to me the U.S. government is using this whole tragedy to gain more power over its own people.  I'm always hearing people say they are willing to give up there rights for security and it just makes me sick.  Security is just an illusion.  Trust me, if someone wants you dead bad enough, you'll be dead.  No amount of &quot;Security&quot; will help.  Security is just a tool for governments to create a police state and we're just falling right into place for them.  I believe that as American's it's our job to make sure America is protected, especially from ourselves.<br>

In case you aren't familiar with this particular person/quote, he was Prime minister of Great Britain when WWII began. He had had a long standing foreign policy that insisted on appeasing the Nazi regime, rather than stand up to it.<br>

All I'm saying is that getting all these countries mad at us for name calling and mass bombing innocent people is not going to solve our problem. <br>
<br>
What we need to do is establish better relations with the countries that hate us.  I'm not talking about the terrorists.  They are a byproduct of hate, which is what we are sowing right now.  You don't put out a fire by throwing more wood on it.  You find its source, it's fuel, and you remove it.  In this case it's hate.  If you can explain to me how what we're doing now is going to create better relations with foreign countries then please tell.<br>

And yes I believe we need to decrease security.  Like I said, &quot;It's just an illusion anyway.&quot;  Call for a cop, call for an ambulance, and call for a pizza.  See which one gets here first.

Iraq is hostile to us because of the attitudes of the dictator. A large number of his subjects don't like him. If he can be removed a more favourable government will take his place.<br>

As for security, sure it can't be perfect. but it can be better. you will not be 100 per cent safe, but you can be safer than you are now.<br>

<br>
&quot;Bitter after being snubbed for membership in the Axis of Evil, Libya, China<br>
and Syria today announced that they had formed the Axis of Just as Evil,<br>
which they said would be way eviler than that of the Iran-Iraq-North Korea<br>
axis President Bush warned of in his State of the Union address.<br>
<br>
Axis of Evil members however, immediately dismissed this new axis as<br>
having, for starters, a really dumb name.  &quot;Right. They are 'Just as<br>
Evil'...in their dreams!&quot; declared North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.<br>
&quot;Everybody knows we're the best at being evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
Diplomats from Syria denied they were jealous over being excluded, although<br>
they conceded that they did ask if they could join the Axis of Evil.  &quot;They<br>
told us it was full,&quot; said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.<br>
<br>
&quot;An axis can't have more than three countries,&quot; explained Iraqi President<br>
Saddam Hussein.  &quot;This is not my rule, it's tradition.  In World War II you<br>
had Germany, Italy and Japan in the Evil Axis.  So you can only have three.<br>
And a secret handshake - ours is wicked cool.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, peer-conscious nations rushed to gain triumvirate status in what<br>
became a game of geopolitical musical chairs.  Cuba, Sudan and Serbia<br>
announced they have formed the Axis of Somewhat Evil, forcing Somalia to<br>
join with Uganda and Myanmar in the Axis of Occasionally Evil.   Meanwhile,<br>
Bulgaria, Indonesia and Russia have established the Axis of Not So Much<br>
Evil, Really Just Generally Disagreeable.<br>
<br>
With the criteria suddenly expanded and all of the desirable clubs filling<br>
up, Sierra Leone, El Salvador and Rwanda applied to be called the Axis of<br>
Countries That Aren't the Worst But Certainly Won't Be Asked to Host the<br>
Olympics Anytime Soon.<br>
<br>
Canada, Mexico and Australia have formed the Axis of Nations That Are<br>
Actually Quite Nice but Secretly Have Nasty Thoughts About America, while<br>
Scotland, Spain and New Zealand established the Axis of Countries That<br>
Allow Sheep to Wear Lipstick.   &quot;That's not a threat, really, just<br>
something we like to do,&quot; said Scottish Executive First Minister Jack<br>
McConnell.<br>
<br>
Bush has granted approval for most axes, although he rejected the<br>
establishment of the Axis of Countries Whose Names End in &quot;Guay&quot;, accusing<br>
one of its members of filing a false application.  Officials from Paraguay,<br>
Uruguay and Chadguay denied the charges.&quot;<br>
