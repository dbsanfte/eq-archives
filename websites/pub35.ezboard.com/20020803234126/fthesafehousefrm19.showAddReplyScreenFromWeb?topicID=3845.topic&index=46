Yes, you're not going to be able to protect your &quot;healers and chain wearers&quot; from infs and NS's quite as well but you'll probably be busy killing scale wearers now anyway. Either assassins can kill healers and tanks or they can't. Which one is it? You can't complain about not being able to take on heros and bards even with bonuses and then talk about infs and NS owning your &quot;healers and chain wearers&quot; in the same paragraph. Am i the only one that thinks this is a bit silly? If you've got other imbalance problems fine but please stop using this one as an example.&quot;<br>
<br>
Please understand things a little better.  PRE PATCH Infils tear apart our chain wearers (warriors/healers).  FYI healers are a specific class.  The composer was not referring to cross-realm healers.  Dragon fang is lethal against tanks.<br>
<br>
4 Classes are vulnerable to SB's.  Heros- yeah right- bullwinkle form PLUS they 2 hit me.  Champions, tanks with debufs and more HPs?, Druids- probably take em (do they have insta mez?), and Wardens (PBT makes them hard).<br>
Something got left out here.... WAIT, there is another realm... Albion.  Musta left them out....<br>
<br>
As for POST PATCH look at nightshade (pierce) vs Mid Tank (slash)<br>
<br>
Nightshade leather is resistant to slash.  Mid Tank is vulnerable to pierce.  Add the small evade stun from the Hib Pierce line, and they will be doing very well against tanks- both Alb and Mid. <br>
<br>
In summary YES you are the only one who thinks this is silly because assassins was refering to pre patch Infils (not Cross realm assasins) with thrust and D'Fang against MIDGARD HEALERS (not cross realm healers) and Midgard tanks (not cross realm tanks).  <br>
<br>
ON TOP OF THAT  the Hib classes we go against will be able to spec slash (for the most part) and heavy tank with heavy hitpoints against light assassin with light hitpoints will both be vulnerable to each other. The best we could hope for is that a HIB tank specs pierce.  With them going crush we are just neutral.   <p>Pitz

Knock, knock.  Anybody home in there?  PRE PATCH infs could kill healers (the class) and tanks because of the 15% BONUS TO CHAIN.  If the tank was slash he had his own 15% bonus vs us.  Now you guys get a 30% bonus to the Hib version of chain.  And lots of classes have abilities or spells that make them a pain in the ass, not just your new targets.  You seem to forget that your poor little defenseless healers have INSTA stun and INSTA mez.  That combined with a whistle makes them a royal pain in the ass unless done right.  Now i'm not talking about any other class balance issues, i'm talking about the resistances and target choices.  Yes there are only 4 classes you get a bonus too now and they're all hib.  Thats compared to the whopping 5 midgard classes i have a choice from 2 of which have insta stun/mez and the others will likely be swinging a hammer at me (30% bonus now).  Yell about them changing your class role, about not getting what your paid for.  But don't say that inf have it so easy against your tanks and healing classes and you have it so hard against the hib tanks and healing classes.<br>
<br>
The &quot;i'm only willing to see my disadvantages and your advantages&quot; attitude is exactly why half the world can't get along with the other half. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaxus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caxus</A> at: 8/1/02 9:26:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarxantael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arxantael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 1:31:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm...</span><hr size=1> --------------------<br>

LOL man. Where do we get 30% bonus?? G, Dragon fang would be an exceptionally choice style to have.  True, we have and evade chain, but its a shorter duration stun and the follow up stun style is usually evaded or blocked. <br>
<br>
Its not like healers have multiple insta's at their disposal. Wait for em to pop of the instas and then get em.  I will admit though, getting around stuns/mezzes suck.  But its not like the healer has the offensive power to melee anything down.  Healer mezzes, run buff, runs away usually.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how we will win.  Hib tanks have shield training- stun- i die.  Large weapons? 2 hits, I die.<br>

Sigh, i don't know how many times i can keep trying to beat this into your heads.  SB's have MORE of a bonus to scale now than thrust infs and NS had to chain before.  And if for some reason you can't kill scale wearers with a 30% bonus when we were appearantly slaughtering your chain wearers with a 15% bonus then i don't know what to tell you.  All the same difficulties of you killing a scale tank/healer can be just as easily applied to an inf killing a chain tank/healer.  Thats my point, plain and simple.  Stop with the double standard.<br>

Warriors, for the record, don't get any +thrust on their epic armor as well.  Sadly enough, one of the reason those thrusters will kiling stuff.<br>

Druids, maybe.<br>

Champs, maybe, though with all those insta's I am not going to hold my breath.<br>

<br>
Pre patch theory.<br>
thrust infs -&gt; trade their advantage for attacking other stealthers for an advantage to attacking healers/shaman/tanks<br>
<br>
slash infs -&gt; advantage to attacking stealthers<br>
<br>
perce NS -&gt;  trade their advantage for attacking other stealthers for an advantage to attacking healers/shaman/tanks<br>
<br>
slash infs -&gt; advantage to attacking stealthers<br>
<br>
SB's (only spec slash) -&gt; advantage to attacking stealthers.<br>
<br>
This is the reason most SB's feel that the fights SB vs thrust/pierce assassin should be slanted toward the SB, because thrust/pierce trade their advantage to attacking SB's when they choose to spec thrust/pierce.  However, the SB vs Slash assassin should be 50-50. (I am not debating if this was actually working correctly in game, but in theory should be correct)<br>
<br>
After the patch.  It seems to SB's like thrust/pierce users pretty much get their cake and eat it too.  They have advantages to attacking Mid chain wearers and SB's, while SB's are now forced into taking advantages against other tanks, while losing our advantage over pierce/thrust assassins.<br>
<br>
Since SB's have always only been able to spec Slash, this is pretty much the role we all have taken from Day 1.  Personally, I have a Soulblade (I guess that is what it is dubbed now), that I use specifically to play bodyguard to our healing classes, archers, etc, against other assassins.  This is also why I chose Slash for my Inf, because I wanted to fill a similar role for Scouts/Casters.  With the new resists, I can respec my Inf to thrust, fill the same role without too much trouble and get advantages to chain wearers, while I have no idea what to do with my SB.<br>

I would like to see NS get some kind of a boost to help them fight (stronger/faster ticking poison, or better magic, anything) besides the PoS shout they got.<br>
<br>
For SBs i dont know what to say yet. I still need more experience with them.<br>
<br>
If anyone would like to do some clean testing duels with me on Galahad, (SB preferred but any class is great) send me an email plz (sameth79@hotmail.com). Maybe we can find out what the hell needs to be done to fix rogues.<br>
<br>
Responding to a random idea: Yes, druids die very fast. People forget that they are hibernia's main healer, with no mez/stun. They have their strengths (rvr) in large groups, not solo.<br>

Happy hunting<br>

<br>
They have two insta heals, and now have an insta root.<br>
<br>
If an assassin gets hit with the instaroot all they can do is used their ranged weapon or shouts if they don't have Purge.  <br>
<br>
Discounting RAs, a semi-competent Druid should <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> die to an assassin one-on-one.  The same goes for Bards and Healers because of the instacasts.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying these classes can kill assassins, but they definitely have all the tools necessary to get away. <br>

By druids, maybe... i meant... yes... druids are on the definite I can kill list.<br>

<br>
Heros, champs are still not.<br>

Blademasters, I'm not sure about.  Most of the ones I face on pendragon are slashers, and they chew me up pretty good. There just aren't very many of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I still maintain this is a crappy way to help nightshades.  Swapping NS and SB and leaving INF at the top of the food chain of assassins isn't helping anything.  It's just downright stupid.<br>
