Whether to continue with the development of Minz's relationship with his family here, or get have him wake up, continuing in present day, as it were. In the end I came to the decision that the discussion of his family deserves attention in its own right. Plus, I need a break from it. Writing such stuff is hard.<br>
<br>
Soooooo bipidy bopidy boo! Wake up sleeping ? errr well wake up goofy.<br>
<br>
/ic<br>
The sounds about him seemed to well up. Starting as mere background to the somnolent images floating across his minds eye. Familiar voices grafting themselves into dreams.<br>
<br>
Mumurings in the background.<br>
<br>
Words slowly taking shape . . . voices drifting into sharp focus.<br>
<br>
It was dark. . . soooo dark. The blackest night he had ever seen.<br>
<br>
A soft tune seemed to weave itself on the air's loom.<br>
<br>
". . .CHIN CAMARAO, BITCHIN CAMARO<br>
Now it's in all the papers.<br>
<br>
My folks bought me a BITCHIN CAMARO<br>
with no insurance to match;<br>
So if you happen to run me down,<br>
please don't leave a scratch.<br>
<br>
I ran over some old lady<br>
one night at the county fair;<br>
And I didn't get arrested,<br>
because my dad's the mayor.<br>
<br>
BITCHIN CAMA?"<br>
<br>
"mmmmmmm. . . Rach? Is that you?" Minz murmured.<br>
<br>
"Welcome back Minz. We've been worried." Rach's melodic voice floated to him. "Jing! Syl!"<br>
<br>
Footsteps.<br>
<br>
First in the sand, then on planks. One set light. . . faint . . . Clearly the step of a thief. Jing. The second . . . firm and steady. Must be Syl.<br>
<br>
His body began to assert itself over him. Aching muscles sending long slow cries of pain through his limbs. Stiff from disuse. Yet to weak to be used. His mouth had a dry bitter taste to it. Lips seemed stretched and cracked. Simmering waves of heat emanated from his skin. Flowing both outward and inward. Sweating under the sting, yet shivering at the slightest breeze.<br>
<br>
"Welcome back buddy." Syl said. "Here." Minz turned his head toward the voice. His neck aching in protest. A hand slipped under his neck . . . turning and raising his head.<br>
<br>
Pottery brushing to his lips . . . a cup . . . cool water. He tried to raise his hands. To hold the cup. But, they fell limply back to the cot he was on.<br>
<br>
He gagged and coughed. Trying to gulp down too much. Aching spasms wracking his chest. Some one helped him sit up. Holding him steady as his wind pipe cleared. Laying him down softly once he had his breath. A few deep breaths and he was OK. "Why doncha light a candle or something Syl. I can't see a thing. And where's Jez? We were hunting together yesterday. . . ."<br>
<br>
<br>
The silence seemed to stretch on.<br>
<br>
<br>
A dull sinking feeling came over him. Worry. . . . did something happen to her?<br>
<br>
Please no please.<br>
<br>
"Are you there? Jing? Rach? What's wrong? Where is Jez?"<br>

Alright, this is out of order, but y'all know me. Once something gets in my head, it has to get out. Prolly has something to do with the lack of space up there.<br>
<br>
*shrugs*<br>
<br>
Well on with the story<br>
<br>
/ic<br>
<br>
'Gods!' he thought. 'Blind? What use is a blind theif??' The image of the old man beggar in Qeynos flashed across his mind. ' . . . that's what happens to blind thieves. That or worse.'<br>
<br>
His mind tumbled over the possibilities. Plotting the inevitable course of his downfall. He had already fallen so far. Failed in so many different ways. This was in all liklihood the inevitable end. Or the last step befor the end.<br>
<br>
Heart aching he sighed heavily.<br>
<br>
It was night. Or at least he supposed it was. He could hear the regular breathing of Rachella and Sylavn. Jing was awake. Near the door as far as he could tell. Shifting softly from one foot to another. His slim dagger making soft whisps as he tossed it in the air.<br>
<br>
Outside the wind blew over the sand. It was a shimmering sound. Like tiny feet skipping over a marble plate.<br>
<br>
'. . .I hope Jezeran is OK . . .' His heart sank even farther. 'Where had I gone so wrong. I care for her so . . . yet I cannot tell her some how. Each time I try something happens. . . I faint. . .<br>
<br>
we are attacked.<br>
<br>
Something . . . always something.<br>
<br>
He could gaze at her, and she wouldn't notice. Lost in a critique of her last fight. Completely unaware of his affection it seemed.<br>
<br>
Gods . . .what a fool he was. She is a Knight of Truth. And he a thief. An assassin. Wanted in the town she called home . . . by some of the very ones she called family. "Ohhh Jez," he muttered under his breath. Sighing heavily<br>
<br>
At times her eys seem so warm . . .so deep. I could get lost in those eyes. Well I could have. What would she want with me now. . .<br>
<br>
Other moments she seems confused. . . distant and unresponsive. Almost freightend.'<br>
<br>
He laughed to himself. 'Ironic . . .she would face the fiercest enemy, yet is freightened of a friend. I must have done something to deserve it. . . Something to curse my chances of ever being close to one again.<br>
<br>
And now this . . .'<br>
<br>
He reached up to his face with both hands, dragging his nails from his forehead to his chin in a hateful manner. The raking sound like heavy fabric ripping. Warm droplets slipping down his face. The taste of iron on his lips.<br>
<br>
'useless . . . that's what a blind assasin is . . . useless. . . better of to use my art on myself that to suffer the long drawn out freefall of death that living so promises.' He struggled to sit up. Hands on his shoulder and behind his back. Helping him sit upright. "Thanks Jing," He whispered.<br>
<br>
"Huh? How did you . . ."<br>
<br>
Minz smirked. "You need to bathe brother. Plus I heard you." He swore he could hear the color rising to the young rogue's face. "I want to go outside. I want to go into the ocean."<br>
<br>
He planted an palm on Jing's shoulder and pushed up.<br>
<br>
Jing protested. "Minz . . . its late, and you should rest."<br>
<br>
"I am going to the ocean. Help me or don't. But get out of my way." Jing sighed, taking his arm and leading him into the night air. The sand felt good under his feet. Soft. . . squishing through his toes. The roar of the waves was growing louder. 'Tides coming in . . . good.' "I got it from here brother." He patted Jings hand and walked on, leaving the young elf behind.<br>
<br>
Foam liking at his toes, now his ankles. Soaking the cotton pants he wore. Up to his waist.<br>
<br>
Jing yelled something. "Its OK buddy!" he yelled back. Wading deeper and deeper.<br>
<br>
He stopped . . . feeling the currents wash around him. Swaying with the oceans eternal motion. The ocean sounds so different now. Feels so different. Sounded so much richer. He had missed so much it seemed. There was a splashing behind him. . . Feet running into the ocean . . .Jinghizu.<br>
<br>
"Everything OK Minz," Jing said trying to catch his breath.<br>
<br>
Minz pondered the question. Thinking of what he'd lost, but also of what he'd gained. "I don't know Jing."<br>
