(note I play midguard chars 99% of my time)<br>
<br>
Albion has 35.6% of all the rps (1869.2 million)<br>
Hibernia has 33% of all the rps (1729.2 million)<br>
Midguard has 31.4% of all the rps (1648.2 million)<br>
<br>
Those numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand rp points accross all the servers except mordred and  Pendragon.<br>
<br>
Ok so here we would say that alb clearly needs to be nerfed.  Hib is okay and midguard needs help.  Remember we are talking a difference of 4.1%.  That's a lot given that you are talking about a difference of 221 _million_ rps.  <br>
<br>
I know people will say wait albion has more people and that's the difference.  I am willing to bet that that's correct.  There are servers where alb is killing the others and there are servers where mid is killing the others and there are servers where hib is killing the others.<br>
<br>
From the pattern I saw when I looked at servers and totals in rps I would suggest this:<br>
<br>
I think the different realms win and lose based on population differences.  Thus, the problems people are experiencing are based on population differences more than anything else.<br>
<br>
We need to push mythic hard to put in something to ballance population differences among the servers.  Until then you just can't judge rps as a measure of anything.  It's not fair at all and I would guess from the fights I have seen that this is the single most unballancing feature in the game.<br>
<br>
How can you ballance classes or realms or ANYTHING if you have 20% in one realm and 40% of the people playing in another realm.  It will never be entirely equal but right now why would you join a gimped realm to spend days of your life leveling to be frustrated..why would you knowingly do that to yourself? <br>
<br>
The forces that control populations all point towards an increase in the differences not a decrease.  There is currently NO incentive to join an underpopulated realm..unless you are the odd hero who likes the underdog and seeks thats situation out I guess.<br>
<br>
I think mythic should put in an xp bonus system based on the number of active characters 40+ in each realm.<br>
<br>
For example, if one realm has 50% of the active characters over 40 then they gain xp the same as they do right now.  However if one realm drops below 33.3 percent they get a bonus based on that difference.  Again the xp bonus should be bigger if the population difference is bigger and thus smaller if the difference is smaller.<br>
<br>
These differences and the bonuses that are in effect should be clearly posted on the web page, thus allowing people to make an informed choice about the server and realm that they play. <br>
<br>
This would provide an incentive to join underpopulated realms and not hurt the populated realms.  People could still play with their friends.  <br>
<br>
I can't see a loser here.  The realms that are dominant have to be bored.  They need people to fight.  The realms that are losing need more people and certainly need more people 40+.<br>
<br>
In the end as the population ballances out I think patterns would begin to appear.  Then you could look at these patterns and ballance the classes appropriately.<br>

<br>
all realm points do,is show whos active,as a player base,as a guild,and as a realm on every server.<br>
<br>
i also believe the issue of class vs class balance,is the basic root of the problem. people dont want to be inferior to other classes in any fashion,this is what caused the sb issues here,and will cause the infiltrators to get nerfed at some point in time.<br>
<br>
casters will most likely see nerfs coming up sometime in the future as well,as possible nerfs on mez/stun again. all this is due to mythic searching endlessly for class balance,and they are unable to achieve it.<br>
<br>
the only way to compensate for this is to focus on realm balance. this means you have to have classes that are stronger in one realm then others,classes that have more magic in others,and classes that are a good mixture of both.<br>
<br>
right now,the reason albion is all powerful,is due to numbers,and basically thats because of the class variety,and the fact that many classes are equal to or better then the speciality classes in the other 2 realms,who were suppose to be specalized realms.<br>
<br>
i like your ideas,but i honestly dont think they will accomplish what you intend for them to,because even if you have 200 mids all level 50,on a server where you still have 450 albsions 40-50,the albions are almost always going to do better overall.<br>
<br>
the easiest way to solve population imbalance is to honestly shut down about 1/3 -1/2 of the game servers,and combine all the accounts into seperate servers. this will increase the player bse by a large margin.<br>
<br>
it wont solve the imbalance per say,but what it will do,is give realms that are underpopulated on the server more people overall,and more of a chance to compete,or at least defend there realms.<br>

2. Small, but well organized realms can easily overwhelm large, unorganized realms (watch Midgard take all of Albions keeps in 15 minutes on Percival for an example).<br>
<br>
3. It doesn't require help from Mythic to balance out realms as proven by Lurikeen Uprising and other massive rushes to other servers to repair realm balance problems. Why on earth would you ask for help from the same group of people who can't properly balance Left Axe, Celtic Dual Wield, and 2 Handed Weapons?<br>
<br>

Besides that, people play to have fun. Dictating to people what realm and what server they can play on is bad for business...Populations will balance themselves out over time as long as all other variables besides population remain balanced.<br>

Mids are badly outnumbered there, and I mean badly. We are lucky to have 30 people RvR a night, and less than a 1/3 are 50s. Our level 50's are quitting at an alarming rate. I could go into the reasons why, but it doesn't really matter any more. People's desire to play this game is being destroyed by class nerfs and bonuses to some and lack of bonuses to others. I still cannot get over how Mythic nerfed healers saying &quot;too much CC was bad for RvR&quot;, then turned around and gave countless other classes more and better CC in 1.51. I have complete and total empathy for healers, and understand fully why many (if not most) of them left. The conflicting desires, the lack of any other useful spell line, the list goes on. Remove the primary healer and CCer from a realm and many servers just die. That is the story of Midgard Galahad. Sad. Very sad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blender>Blender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 11:35:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3677.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance Shmalance...</span><hr size=1> The forumlas are:<br>

Everything seems to be evenly spread out across al servers.  Generaly speaking of course.  there is one server where Mid has 50%.  Now on my server Albion is in the lead.  But for the past 2 weeks wehave had constant attacks from both Mids and Hibs.  Even during the quiet times with like 400 people server wide we are lossing keeps.  During the peak times we lose keeps.  We spend, what seems like 99% of RvsR time retaking keeps and repelling attacks against Excal from relic raids.  Even with our high population we do not Own the server.  Hibs seem to be kicking us hard, and the mids.  well that's just gravey to the whole situation.  I did post this in it's own thread.  But I thought I would add it here and let the mods delete the old one.<br>
<br>
I’m actually writing this in Word so I can do a spell and grammar check. Some of my spelling and grammar will still be wrong, but at least this way it will be a heck of a lot easier to read.<br>
<br>
Now the way that I look at Dark Age for magic and melee strength is how Mythic have said, or I think they said. Albion is evenly split for power of melee and magic. Hibernia is stronger in the magic but weaker in melee. And Midgard is stronger in melee and weaker in magic. Okay. We all know this, but lets but some basic numbers so it’s more of a visual thing, the higher the number the stronger ability is. Albion: melee=2, magic=2. Hibernia: melee=1, magic=3. Midgard: melee=3, magic=1.<br>
<br>
Okay. A simple basic concept for the above. The actual numbers I do not know. Heck, with all the changes being implemented over the release time, I bet Mythic doesn’t know off hand and would have to do some sort of an analyze on the programming. Now the game is released and it’s discovered that some of the programming does not work as they had intended and/or a spec line/class is unfinished. So they start adding things and fixing genuine, non-whiner problems. This changes the balance, which was originally envisioned slightly. Over all this is not a major problem. Until people start doing the degrade analysis of battles and comparing them to past ones and to other classes. See a problem? I do. People are comparing same category of class from other realms to their character. Woops. That doesn’t work, because each realm is a different balance of melee/magic from the other 2. It sounds simple but I get the feeling sometimes that a lot of people forget this.<br>
<br>
To balance fairly they should look at the class first to see if everything is working as was intended. Then to see how it compares with the idea of the power lvl for that realm. For example. If a main tank for Midgard is always having major trouble in soloing any green con mob then it needs to be looked at. And what I mean by trouble is almost being killed and you started at full health. Now it’s possible to lose any match because it’s a game based off of random numbers it’s possible to have a really bad string of bad numbers that can cause the death of a character. I myself was fighting a middle range con blue mob and was killed because the numbers went against me in that extremely rare case. Another reason for balancing would be to make a class or spec line a viable option to use. That kind of balancing, no one should have a problem with that.<br>
<br>
It’s when the whiners come in and say, nerf this! And nerf that! Why? Because I don’t have it or I don’t have a defence against it that makes that ability (or what ever they are crying about) useless or so weak that there would be no reason to use that ability. It’s this kind of “balancing” that bothers me to no end. Because if it’s done it’s not balancing to the original vision to what was intended. I think some of the whiners would want “their class” to be melee=3 and magic=3, while everyone who is against them should be a melee=1 and magic=1. Some of the other whiners I believe are looking for that perfectly “balanced” game. And if a perfectly balanced game came out there would still be this to consider, as Majin said, “there is always the Player Skill itself which you can’t balance.” For myself, every same con player that I have faced, which admittedly is not a lot, I have won, except for one battle. No excuses, I got outplayed by that player. It was fast and painless. If someone is playing a class that most people say is nerfed and can no longer be played then why do some still play? I’m going to use the scout as an example. Now if, according to the whiners that the scout has been nerfed and really is not a viable class any more. Then why is the top RP holder of my server a scout with 2,021,336 Realm points? Approximately 550,000 points ahead of the person in second? It’s because that person learned how to use what skills they have and the rest is player skill. From what I understand in EQ it’s all about what items you have. If you have the items, then you can go somewhere. If you do not have the items. Well. Sorry. I have found in DAoC that you can have inferior weapons to your target and still come out on top, because in this game player skill is more of a factor then what people realise. Don’t get me wrong. Items are still very important, but they are not the end all and be all that will either make or break a character.<br>
<br>
Wow! This is a heck of a lot longer then I had intended. To sum it up. Yes, some balancing is necessary for a game to work, but not the kind of balancing that most of the post at the Vault seems to address. After all, the majority of the “balancing” requests seem to come from whiners who, IMHO, don’t understand the appropriate level of balancing necessary for a game like this.<br>

I don't think realm points are a good measure of balance in fact I said that above.<br>
<br>
2.  I do think realm points are a measure of time played or in this case the number of characters playing (thus more collective time)<br>
<br>
3.  I notice a big difference in the servers and I attribute that to population differences.  It was pointed out that a smaller more organized realm can win against a larger unorganized realm.  On Galahad the albs are extremely well organized and often out number us 2 to 1 or 3 to 1 or even 5 to 1.  So thus my post.  <br>
<br>
4.  I did NOT say people would HAVE to play a certain realm.  I never suggested it.  What I suggested is that people get a bonus for playing a realm that is lower in population.  An incentive to do something by no means forces people to do it.<br>
<br>
5.  The lurikeen uprising was so far a one time thing.  No question it did help that realm, but in the end it's not happening on every server.  Thus I see no great force towards balancing the servers.  If it happens on 5 servers I would change my mind, but I doubt it will.<br>
<br>
I am not suggesting nerfing anyone.  I am not suggesting that it be harder to level for realms with lots of active players over 40.  I am just suggesting that it would be nice to see an incentive program that rewarded people for playing underpopulated realms.  <br>
<br>
This would help in 2 ways.  The underpopulated realm would level faster and thus have more people 40+ (but thus also the bonus would go down)  and people would probably want to play on that server because it's easier to level.  Once they got 40+ then the bonus would go down as well.<br>
<br>
What I don't see is how anyone loses out on this?  Except for realms that are overpopulated and enjoy dominating their server.<br>

<br>
its realitively easy to level fast,from 0-40,as long as you have a steady group system. either a guild group system,or a set group.<br>
<br>
granted rogues tend to suffer in this area somewhat,but you can do ok. biggest problem of levelling on normal servers in midgard now,is that theres a serious lack of healers across the realms. this tends to slow things down. even if you find 2-3 good healers,they are generally always grouped,because there name gets around and they almost always level faster then a non healer.<br>
<br>
the real bonus needs to come in from 40-50 imo,not prior to that,but i think the 40-50 level grind is a pointless waste of time,and one of the major reasons people who are part time,more relaxed players leave the game. i see the posts here,about how player X levels 3 charectesr to level 50,in the same realm,then goes to another realm and levels 1 more. honestly that baffles me,because there isnt alot of enjoyment in that imo.<br>
<br>
i agree with you that it would help some,i just dont think it would solve the problems mythic has at the present time. the only way i can see to solve it is to combine servers,as much as some people will hate that.<br>
<br>
if you look at it,the pvp servers are a perfect reflection of the state of the game imo. its by far the most popular server now,and i dont see that changing. frankly people want something challanging and they arent seeing it from the normal servers.<br>

If you want a more accurate picture of whats going on take a look at whats happening in the last 7 days.<br>
<br>
Out of 14 Servers<br>
Albion: 3 1st, 10 2nd, 1 3rd<br>
Hiberia:  10 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd<br>
Midgard:  2 1st, 2 2nd, 11 3rd<br>
<br>
Totals last 7 days (198,865,514)<br>
Albion: 64,654,293 - 33%<br>
Hiberia: 78,334,513 - 39%<br>
Midgard: 55,876,708 - 28%<br>
<br>
The cause of this is fairly simple:  <br>
<br>
Group purge + Warden bubbles + Instant mez + Caster Stuns<br>
<br>
Hibs &gt; Alb population<br>
Hib and Alb &gt; Mids<br>

I didn't have the time to do the last 7 days.  Wow what  a difference.<br>
<br>
They need to make group purge available to all realms imo.  It's far more powerful than the truesight that was split among the archers imo.<br>
