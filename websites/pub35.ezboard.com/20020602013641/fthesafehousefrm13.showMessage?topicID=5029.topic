Here's the logic:<br><br>do 3 units of exp to get from 51-52<br>do 3 units to get from 52-53<br>do 3 units to get from 53-54<br>do 6 units to get from 54-55<br>do 4 units to get from 55-56<br><br>Obviously, i'm simplifying. The point is that if you do six points of AA right after you ding 52, you could have gotten to 54 on the same experience, and 2 levels is worth more than 6 AA. If you do it right after dinging 54, you would only have gained one level for the same exp, so this makes AA better compared to leveling. On the other hand, if the AA is really better than leveling, you're better off doing them as soon as you can: run 3 and regen or first aid at 51, archetype at 55 and class at 59. It's never a good idea to split the exp though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxiggin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xiggin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/25/02 9:10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5029.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: which are the hell level? is 51 count as one?</span><hr size=1> Not quite!  No changes weer made for 51-59.<br><br>The experience was only leveled down from 1 to 50. This means that the levels previously known as hell levels (30,35,40,45) are now just progressing like all the other ones. <br><br>After that, the progression keep going up with ALL hell levels. The first one is 51, then there is 54 that represents the first double-hell. It is so traumatic and that is why most people are annoyed by it. <br><br>After that 55,56,57,58 are requiring progressively higher experience until you hit the second double-hell level at 59.  In absolute numbers, 59 is BY FAR the largest experience need.  The requirements in 60 are lower than for 59.<br><br>So here you have hit: All levels are 50, starting with 51 are HELL levels. 54 and 59 are double levels.

Levels are higher skills, more AC, more HP, more mana, more resists, mobs resisting YOU less, more spells, more disciplines, special abilities- the list goes on.<br><br>3 AA points is, what, the ability to outrun mobs naked and indoors? Powerful, yes. Run3 is the only AA ability I can see as, in some distorted way, better then levels. But it really isn't- levels will do *so* much more for you, as any class. If you're worried about mobs outrunning you that much, exp outdoors with jboots. And if you think it gets better after run3- it doesn't. Regen3 is not nearly as game breaking, and archetype skills are basically overpriced improvements you'd get anyway as you level (60s get these because we don't have the option to level). Class skills are only available at 59 anyway, and trust me, spending 21 AP to get the most basic class skill is a huge waste when you could be 60. <br><br>I don't think I can really convince any level 52 who wants run3 to wait till 60. But I say this from my experience as a 60, and the vast majority of 60s agree- run3 isn't the end-all of power, but 60 basically is.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulomack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lomack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 8:21:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5029.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: which are the hell level? is 51 count as one?</span><hr size=1> I've been leveling up an Iksar SK, in my spair time.

Usually once they get to it, with the new title and all, they tend to ( maybe unconsciously ) take exp'ing a bit lightly and when they finally hit 52 and start grinding again they think 51 was a hell. <br><br>Btw, I 100% disagree that 54 is a hell level also, I was getting over 2y per day, which is equal to, or more, than what I was getting in all the other levels, per day, up to 57.  At 57 I slowed down a bit, but that was by choice not by game mechanics.  My rogue is 58 now, and this is my 2nd character to 60, and I'll stand by my stance that only 59 is a &quot;hell&quot; level.  <br><br>That said, I don't think any level is hard as long as you grind and have 4-5 hours a day to play.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uezrick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ezrick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 1:49:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5029.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: which are the hell level? is 51 count as one?</span><hr size=1> OK here is the math, old syle anyway:<br><br>xp = lvl^3*1000*mod<br><br>Where XP is the total amount of experience your character needs to advance to the next level (NOT to get from one level to the next).  lvl is your characters level.  mod is the experience point modifier for that level.<br><br>The modifiers are as follows.<br><br>1 - 29 1.0<br>30 -34 1.1<br>35 - 39 1.2<br>40 - 44 1.3<br>45 - 50 1.4<br>51 1.5<br>52 1.6<br>53 1.7<br>54 1.9<br>55 2.0<br>56 2.1<br>57 2.2<br>58 2.3<br>59 2.5<br>60 2.6<br><br>So, to get from level 1 to 10 the formula is:<br><br>10*10*10*1000*1.0 = 1,000,000 xp<br><br>The important thing to remember is that the caculation is based on the players <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> level</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to come up with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> total</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> experience required to advance.  This is Verant's initial screw up way back when.  Had they used a players level and made some sort of calculation on how much xp to go from one level to the next (and not a total xp figure to level) 'hell levels' would have never happened. <br><br>Level 49 = 49*49*49*1000*1.4 = 164,708,600 xp<br>Level 50 = 50*50*50*1000*1.4 = 175,000,000 xp<br>Level 51 = 51*51*51*1000*1.5 = 198,976,500 xp<br><br>So while it takes a little under 10 million xp to get through 49 and a little over 10 million to get through 50 it takes over 23 million to get through 51.  28 mil in 53, 46 mil in 54; 41 mil in 58 and 63 mil in 59 becuase the modifier jumps not .1 but .2.<br><br>So, by the old standard of 'hell level', yes every level post 50 is a hell level with 54 and 59 being outright satanic.  Because the formula uses level to calculate total xp you have to pay the entire modifier raise in one level.<br><br>And why isn't this in spoilers anyway? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uantonyocorleone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Antonyo Corleone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 10:11:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5029.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: which are the hell level? is 51 count as one?</span><hr size=1> &quot;with 54 and 59 being outright satanic&quot;<br><br>Having done 54 twice, and both times finding it just as easy as any other 50+, I have to take your whole post with a grain of salt because I know from personal experience that 54 is not difficult.  <br><br>10,000 people could show me numbers saying that 54 is a hell level, but I know what I see.
