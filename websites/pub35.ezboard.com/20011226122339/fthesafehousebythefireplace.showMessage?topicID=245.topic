     I've been playing EverQuest since beta phase three began in September 1998.  I like to consider myself an experienced rogue because it's been my profession of choice since that time.  Although I've been playing for a while I'd like to go ahead and scratch my experiences as a rogue from September 1998 through December 1999.  See.. those months were spent on blue servers, not my current and final server Vallon Zek (PvP-Teams).   In my opinion a rogue belongs on a PvP server.  No matter how &quot;good&quot; you are as a rogue there is only one reason your character ever chose that profession in the first place.  Money.  You are a robber.  Perhaps you are the type of robber that gets paid for assassinating others.. whatever the case, money is why you do what you do.  You want to get paid and you use the skills that you have been granted to do so.<br>
<br>
     Now that you know where I'm coming from I feel you can understand the tales I am going to share.  The events I'm going to describe have left me literally shaking with joy and satisfaction at my keyboard.  Have you ever gotten the &quot;excitement jitters&quot; when you were about to log on and play your rogue after a 4, 5, etc day absence from EQ?  Well... imagine that only 10x more intense.<br>
<br>
/ic<br>
<br>
     Tonight I did get an idea.  I'm not one fer thinkin' of world changin' ideas but I gotta admit this one I had was a big 'un.  We've all seen the inks roamin' around in the Commonlands, wearin' nearly nothin' except the stuff that gets em by.  Sword, dagger, heh even fingers are pretty much the most valuable commodities out there in the &quot;Warzone.&quot;  Well tonight I was thinkin'.... where do those inks put their valuables at?  If you've ever spoken to an ink for even the briefest moment you're know'in that they are a self-righteous bunch.. braggers, about power'n fame an' all that.  Well then they gotta put their most valuable jewels and clothing on sometime if they're gonna do all that braggin'.  Right?  Tonight ah found out where they're wearin' all that nice stuff.  I even managed to persuade them to let me take it offa their hands for a while.  Tonight I snuck into Neriak.<br>
<br>
/ooc<br>
<br>
-= Sneaking into Neriak =-<br>
<br>
Empty your pockets.  Bag your equipment if you aren't confident the first time.  Before you even enter Nektulos Forest have a shaman or druid enchant you with Spirit of the Wolf.  Pay for it if you have to because it will make the trip into the city so much easier and faster.  When you enter Nektulos forest immediately sneak/hide (S/H) in case any guards just happen to be near the zone.  Normally the closest a guard gets to the zone is the end of the path that leads to the zone tunnel, but it's better to be safe than sorry especially this early in your trip.  S/H down the zone tunnel until the forest opens up in front of you.  Head to the right, up the zone tunnel hill, toward an area the inkie newbies like to call the &quot;Monolith&quot; or &quot;Mono.&quot;  You will come to a tree that is right next to the Monolith.  I usually stop behind this tree and listen up to /shouts and /ooc's in case I have been spotted.  I spend a few seconds peaking out from behind the tree or using camera view to see who happens to be at the Monolith.  Usually only a few scattered levels 7-10 inkies will be there.  If the inks are high in numbers it might be safe to just sit there and wait.  I have rested there after attacking folks for upwards of 15 minutes and have never been spotted.  Once you feel ready, sneak up the zone mountain border behind the Monolith and follow it all the way to the river's edge.  It's probably safest to keep S/H up while making it to the river if this is your first time.  Once at the river, emerge from the shadows and prepare to leap into and swim quickly to the opposite side.  There are some rather large pirhana's that frequent the area (though 75% of the time the river is clear at that location) so be ready to hear crunches.  Don't stop and fight.  Get to the other side and rest.<br>
<br>
Once you've reached the opposite shore continue to run along the zone border.  I do not bother with S/H at this point because it's not a heavily populated area.  Keep running until you reach white colored stone.  You are now getting close to a place the inks call the pyramid.  It is a hunting location for levels 5-10 and also happens to be the teleport in point for wizards.  Begin to S/H now.  If you are curious as to who is at the pyramid you can sneak up to a tree that is far enough away from the pyramid to be safe, yet close enough to see the action.  Be wary, however, for those wizards and other adventurers that teleport in from the pyramid frequently run toward the zone border and follow it into Neriak.  That run puts them right behind you if you are hiding at that tree.  If this is your first time I recommend you forego the scouting and just continue along the zone border.  Approximately 45 seconds after passing the pyramid the landscape will begin to turn grey and ashen in color.  You are getting close to Neriak... <br>
<br>
I'm going to make a very safe location known now.  Shortly after the landscape turns grey you will notice a V-shaped dip in the zone border.  If you sneak up and into this dip you can rest along the very edge of the zone in safety.  Make sure you sit so that even those folks with the see invisible enchantment won't even see you if they run by.  You are still about a minute's worth of sneaking away from Neriak so it won't be long now.<br>
<br>
You will pass a group of stones just after the V dip.  This is also a great place to hide out.  You can duck and get in between the stones to rest or confuse any opponents you may have (except casters of course).  Continue sneaking along the zone wall until the entrance to Neriak is in sight.  There are two guards outside the tunnel in.  Make sure you /con them before getting close.  Casters have on occasion enchanted the guards with see invisible.  All safe?  Well keep going... be warned that due to some sort of invisible object blocking the way you will not be able to drop into the tunnel opening from the top.  You will be forced to move down until about half way down the opening then drop in.  No matter what you see/hear, once you are this close you only have one option.  Keep moving as fast as S/H will allow you and zone into Neriak.  You may have been seen by some higher level folks there at the zone or even lower level ones with see invis.  This does not matter.  They will not hesitate to cast a spell on you, whether they know it will effect you or not, which will remove your S/H and make those guards come rushing in.  Zone, zone, zone.<br>
<br>
Once you zone in you will IMMEDIATELY begin to S/H.  If someone did happen to see you zone in from the Neriak side they will be confused if they don't have see invisible.  If they begin to cast see invisible you need to move by them as fast as possible and head down toward the right side of the front city wall.<br>
<br>
-= Story Time =-<br>
<br>
I was seen once when I zoned into Neriak.  There was a HUGE group of evils hanging out on the city side of the zone, perhaps waiting to group.  Immediately one of them shouted &quot;HUMAN!&quot; and they all turned to stare right at me.  I was sneaking/hiding but their spells came in at me as soon as the word left the ink's mouth.  Good news, though, their spells were not affecting me.  I think I was level 15 or so at that time.  I found something out that night though.  Visible and sweating I sprinted along the very edge of the wall at the entrance to the right.  The two guards at the front gate were sleepy, perhaps, but they did not see my pale form running while along the wall.  I sat and camped as all the higher level folks surrounded me.  The shouts began immediately &quot;HUMAN AT THE ENTRANCE UP FOR GRABS&quot;  &quot;COME KILL THE LIGHTIE AT THE FRONT WALL, WE'LL HEAL YOU.&quot; Etc, etc... so.. I camped.  Muhahaha... fortunately when spells cannot affect you they do not interrupt your camping mode.  I made a head call, chatted with the wife, and then safely entered the game 20 minutes later to continue my trip....<br>
<br>
I'm going to stop here.  If you folks show interest in this subject I have a lot more information to share, including the numerous slaying I've done while within the Neriak city walls.<br>

That's what I had intended.<br>
<br>
I've been sneaking into Neriak since I was level 11. I wasn't found out once until my mid teens. About that time (level 15 or so) I killed my first inkie inside the city itself. Her name was Seleina and here's what happened...<br>
<br>
There was a necromancer out in Nektulos that spotted me earlier that evening. He tried to do the regular PvP thing, and it was a close fight, but he eventually ran to the guards at the bridge. His name was Aargorroth. After he ran he messaged me with &quot;good fight&quot; yada yada yada. (note: I have since then become more courageous and follow my opponents to the bridge after they run... but more about that later) We both wanted a rematch.<br>
<br>
So we decided to meet in a secluded spot and /duel. I let him summon a pet (/con'd easy blue to me), buff himself, and then meditate to full. The duel was rough.. but a rogue with fast weapons can beat a caster every time. Normally when fighting a character with a pet I go for the pet first... but this time I decided to off the owner of the pet. I won the duel with little over a bubble of health left. Little did I know the inkie woman Seleina was watching the duel from afar. She came right in after I won and killed me.<br>
<br>
One thing that surprises my opponents most is my excellent memory (yellow stickies next to my monitor). I never forget my opponents who get away or those that actually defeat me.<br>
<br>
After I retrieved my corpse I noticed that Seleina was still online. She wasn't in Nektulos and I had a friend check if she was in East Commonlands or Freeport area. Nope.. hmm, so she must be in Neriak.<br>
<br>
To make this really long story short... I snuck into Neriak (using the techniques I'm going to describe in a new thread) and found her right outside the Toadstool in Neriak Commons. She was at about 1/4 health, and bandaging. She probably gated in to avoid death out in the wilderness. Muhaha.<br>
<br>
It was really risky attacking her outside Toadstool. There are a few roaming guards out there but I didn't see any in sight. I backstabbed, pierced a few times and she went down fast. She had time to blurt out &quot;oh my god&quot; right before her last breath of air. I think I taught her a lesson about messing with rogues. <br>
