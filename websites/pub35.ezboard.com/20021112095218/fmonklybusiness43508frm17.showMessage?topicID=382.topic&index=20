Damage is nice we are beat in that, giving us less diserability(sp) for raids. Now that there are a ton of monks around they want to reduce them.

<br>
I don't think it would be much at all. First of all , go check out how much our other specials do for damage. Very low dm, generally. You can have what, 6 choices right now for which of your combat skills are hotkeyed (click on  &quot;Combat&quot; and it lets you choose to rightclick 6 things to make hotkeys of). As far as I know our specials are all categorized as combat, none of them overlap as abilities (for the 6 &quot;abilities&quot; choices you can also hotkey).<br>
<br>
We don't have enough hotkey making ability to make all of our specials hotkeyed first off without having to drop some of our very important stuff (feign death, instill doubt, etc). (I'm not talking about the hot key &quot;banks&quot;, we have tons of those, I'm talking about the initial process of making the hotkey for the special) Go check it out. You could make maybe one or two of our specials besides flying kick a hotkey before you'll start wishing you had alot more hotkey making ability. <br>
<br>
More importantly though, to me giving us a reliable inherent stun is more necessary than giving us a small amount of extra dm from unlinking the specials, particularly in light of the resist changes, and now the dm mitigation nerf. Seriously, if SK's get to do 95 dm with their bashes , most of which stun, give me the reason that we can not? Thought flying kick made you special? Bash blows flying kick away in what it does.  IF you doubt this, duel a SK and tell him to bash you whenever he can. Big damage, long stuns, keeps opponents dps down while he's stunned, stops any pumice casting you might be trying to do etc. to get rid of his asystole/boil blood line/debuff/darkness stuff that lands.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
an SK above posted this:<br>
------------------------<br>
Please actually play the class before you make us out to be gods<br>
<br>
Ever try channeling a lifetap on a mob knocking the shit out of you? FD for that matter also? <br>
<br>
HT? 1001 damage every 72 mins 1501 with Uholy aura at 60. The other HT's you mentioned cost AA points and are on the same timer. Every 72 mins!<br>
<br>
DoT's are relatively crappy and usually not worth the spell slot. Sometimes good to use sometimes not. Theres only 8 spell slots. 6 for most SK's I'd imagine. FD is always memed and assuming most have Harmshield memmed as well. I know I do.<br>
<br>
Our monster weapons? Please go take a gander at our offensive caps. <br>
<br>
In the 50+ world two handers will do more damage than one handers. Monks know this as well. And in attempt to try to make shields more attractive they upped the bash damage. Makes sense, bashing for 10 with a 50+ AC shield? <br>
<br>
Granted its a fun and diverse class but what do we do in raids?<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
Each and every one of these gripes you mentioned about your SK  DO NOT HURT HIM in pvp.  Any halfway decent SK does most of his pvp damage with lifetaps, that I have seen.  They have no trouble channeling numerous lifetaps. Shadowstep helps them buy the time needed to get a lifetap off, even indoors.  I didn't mention how hybrids lifetaps and other spells now cast faster (reduced fasting time) than the pure classes, to help you channel them more reliably.  This reduced casting time makes a powerful class even much stronger in pvp.<br>
<br>
Your complaint about the advanced improvements to HT beyond the HT disc costing AA points. So what? Monks have to spend 9 CLASS POINTS in purify body, to give us a tool that also takes 72 minutes to recharge, to help us survive pvp.  They nerfed our dragon punch knockback (which also costs CLASS lvl points-5 points) from being unresistible to now being resisted about half the time (that's about how it is for me anyway, on rallos in pvp. Maybe more than half the time, and the knockback is often not far enough to interrupt any pc channeling-there is no &quot;channeling/interrupt check&quot; in the skill btw, the only interrupting that happens is if you luckily move the pc far enough from where he started casting the spell, and his channeling is low enough that it won't recover for a successful cast, which happens but rarely).<br>
<br>
Anyway none of your comments about sks confronted the point anyway, which was about your ability to stun with your bash, and do great bash damage, and how powerful this is in pvp. SK's can also spend just 6 points  in aaxp and get two hand bash, so you can bash with any 2 hander without a shield (assuming you are a small race and don't get that inherently already).<br>
<br>
Seriously, SK bash at 95 dm a bash, usually stunning the target, interupting them,  &quot;t-staff effect&quot;ing them again and again, more reliably than a monk's t-staff (I guarantee you that a sk gets many many more bashes off in an average fight than a t-staff procs in an average fight)....<br>
<br>
We should get this type of skill. We need it now more than ever, in pve and it will help us in pvp too. SK's were pvp gods before the dm was upped to 95 on their bashes, yet you gave them this bash upgrade without a second thought. Do warriors/pallys get this same upgrade? I bet they do, don't know for sure, but we need and deserve it even more than these classes given our lower hitpoints, generally inferior resists to the plate guys resists (leather based armor traditionally as a whole in EQ gives less resists than plate stuff, check it out).<br>
<br>
Inherent stun! It's about time. We need it and it's not too much to give us. The plate guys have it, give it to us too to help make up for the latest monk nerf.<br>

VI can ramp up or down what percent chance stun has of happening on a successful kick.

<br>
The plate classes just got an increase in this last patch to some of their defensive skill caps.<br>
<br>
In recent patches SK's got harmshield, all casters got better stacking potential of their dots on mobs, Plate classes got a vastly improved bash (95 damage is avg now, with interrupt/stun), Casters have steadily been given more and more and more goodies with focus items, great aaxp to cut down casting times, mana costs, do insanely more damage (60 wiz I know with 70 aaxp crits like every 3d cast, does 3551 dm on some of those crits of sunstrike, many many insane dm crits)<br>
<br>
Monks on the other hand, have gotten jack and sh$t.  The majority of the aa's VI offered the monk class to purchase are based on tanking/melee defense: Double riposte, return kick, etc,  and then they go and nerf our tanking role after setting us on an aa path with these aa's based on tanking.  <br>
<br>
Make it up to us , Verant. At the least give us a &quot;bash&quot; ability on our flying kicks. That would be one thing that could help alot and in the process give us a little hope on the pvp servers too that we might survive some of these encounters with the uber super powered casters ( seen the latest focus item for epic mage pet? in duel vs another epic mage pet without the effect, it chewed that pet up and still had 60% life, and regenned at 7 percent a tick. 7% !!! If you have ever had an epic mage pet on your ass in pvp, you know that they were serious, fatal trouble to begin with. And now this! Give the monks a bone! give us  stun!)<br>

<br>
My votes goes to:<br>
<br>
1) Chance of stun on flying kick (or any special attack)<br>
2) increased run (eg. run 4, 5)<br>
<br>
preference for first... The problem with just giving better AAXP skills is that MONKS BELOW LEVEL 50 ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY NERF!!! So by giving all monks a chance of a stun it would help all monks attacking ability... restricting any bonuses to solely &gt;50 means many monks have to put up with broken class for 50 levels!<br>
<br>
Others have made excellent arguments why stun on special attack would be great (and balanced since many other classes already get it...), so I won't add to it... Verant need to throw us a bone to placate us (even a little one) and this sounds as good as any. <br>
<br>
Increased run skill makes sense too...helps newly broken FD pull... we have a low weight limit so why shouldn't we be able to run faster than plate wearers? (at the risk of bringing reality check arguments in).<br>
<br>
Verant have stated we should be balanced more at offence than defence...yet we get defensive AA skills... well prove it Verant! Now is your chance...you have obviously completely stuffed up monk class design so far... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulaughingowl2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>laughingOwl2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 8:11:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Changes.</span><hr size=1> 1) My preferred.  Look at what they said they wanted, look at the results and change patch.<br>
<br>
Maxxed out gear monks are reporting little change (where the 'problem' was,  normal to low-end gear monks are reporting being slaughtered.  Perhaps somebody made a mistake in how the patch was applied?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2)  If they patch really needs to stand (especially as is), the look at increasing the offense of a monk. (especially for solo).<br>
<br>
My preferred is either through /disc's  or as natural check on our specials give them a low chance to have an 'effect'.<br>
<br>
Give tiger claw a small chance to have an attack debuff (as you strike their eyes?)<br>
<br>
Give Dragon punch a small chance to stun.<br>
<br>
Give us an attack that cripple a mob (chance to snare effect)<br>
<br>
Give us an attack the staggers a mob (slows).<br>
<br>
Now I would see all of these special be like ID, in that the effect lasts barely longer than the recycle timer.  No way that you could get more than one effect on the mob (especially with the occasional resist), but you could perhaps keep one on during half the fight (presuming 50/50 resists).<br>
<br>
Grouped it would unlikely change the monks role.  I would see these effects be far inferious then the 'spells' of other classes, and grouped a monk would not be doing them to avoid aggro (especialy post nerf).<br>
<br>
Solo however it might allow us (the normal monk) to continue to slowly eek out expierence.  As other have mentioned I solo for two reasons<br>
<br>
1)  a lot of my play time is for an hour here, 30 minutes there, very non-conducive to grouping.<br>
<br>
2) A lot of my group play is pulling for raids.  Well as puller, I die alot (no big deal and I will die before group) and am rarely in the expierence group (since alot of times I sit out of the fight lying FD some place.  So short story a lot of my group action I LOSE exp,  how do I regain.....  slowly pounding out the very low dark blues (which already have had exp nerfed) to rebuild (and or gain exp).<br>
<br>
Please give me a means (short of dedicating myself to an uber guild to become major puller, and so I get PL'd to 60 with a few score AAs, and then do nothing but pull for said guild 24/7  (with occasional time out of game for food).... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utibbil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tibbil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/18/02 5:52:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes.</span><hr size=1> You have a point about the lower monks feeling the nerf more then higher ones.

The only way to do what VI visions us as is to nerf our gear. Reduce our HP/Stam ration, reduce HP on our gear.  Geeze ive said this all before. Notice how these changes would nerf my ability to solo too. OMG a monk thinking outside his class, riot!<br>

 <br>
   -  Best Invis in the game<br>
   -  Evade (FD is as good or better imo on some mobs)<br>
   -  Pick Pocket (which btw, rocks, Ice Giants) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However, they do not solo and are definitely a group class.<br>
<br>
This is not a post stating anything should be nerfed, this <br>
is a post that indicates that Rogues have some fun utils.<br>
