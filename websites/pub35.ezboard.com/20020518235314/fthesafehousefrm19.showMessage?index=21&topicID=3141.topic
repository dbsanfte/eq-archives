<br>
I'm playing an infiltrator and I have to agree that nightshades dmg output is pretty sad. however..<br>
<br>
My specs are:<br>
<br>
CS: 42+6<br>
Thrust: 50+8<br>
<br>
My perf cap is around 670-690 (depending on weapons).<br>
<br>
I perf epic chain armor for ~ 380 with full enhance cleric buffs.<br>
Unbuffed I hit for ~ 300.<br>
<br>
<br>
Before you give up on your char, try finding a buff (nurture?) speced druid and RvR with good buffs.<br>
<br>
Yes, this doesn't change the fact that your class is underpowered, but at least you can have fun this way ;-)<br>
If it works out well, I'd level a buff druid (not sure about hibernia but in albion you need lvl 40, in mid around 37).<br>
<br>
I'd love to hear how buffs work for you.<br>

I just want that fixed, at modified 49 pierce and 50 CS, you would think that I would hit for higher then 45% all the time. <br>
<br>
I figured out the other issue with common damage though. NS's can't get the huge damage like SB's from 2handers, they dont spec CD like LA damage, and dont have the spec points like Inf's do to both train env and DW. NS's tend to spec heavy CS and Pierce, then are forced to pick either Env or CD. 99.99% go with Env. With some of my remaining points from 48 to 50, Im going to bring CD upto 25 and hope that increases alot of off-hand damage. <br>

<br>
&quot;Guess that's why it's Dark Ages of &quot;Camelot&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Give me a break.  Two months ago everyone was screaming that Midgard was Mythic's baby.  Quit being so immature.  Game balance goes in cycles.  Quit being a follower and jumping on the &quot;Mythic loves Albion&quot; bandwagon.  Albion has its own problems, and it's QUITE CLEAR that Albion is in no way dominating the game.  In fact, Midgard owns more relics than any other realm on the server totals.  Go look at it if you don't believe me.<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Now about nightshades.  I agree with you that you guys need some help.  Even back at level 35 I was hitting for 180 with garrote and hitting shadowblades for 550 with PA with my trusty bastard sword.  Every time I ever tangled with a nightshade, I walk away with most of life left.  Most I've ever been hit for by a styling nightshade is 90, I think.  But hey, if you don't use the right tool for the job (I'm in leather, use a sword on me), you can't really complain.  My thrusting infiltrator colleagues don't hit as hard as I do vs other assassins either.<br>
<br>
How much of that is because nightshades choose pierce and I'm a slasher?  Probably a lot.  I don't know.  But I do know that nightshades are fairly easy to one-shot with a sword.  Shadowblades aren't so easy.  I hear a lot of nightshades say that they must use pierce because they have low strength.  Let me tell you, by the time you reach 50 you can have any of your stats capped that you wish.  You can get the right stats to use swords even as a nightshade.  Try it, you might like it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unandurius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nandurius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/13/02 3:57:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3141.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Very close to retiring my NS. </span><hr size=1> No reason to turn this into a Slash vs Thrust thread. I'm using thrusting quite succesfully on my infiltrator against tanks (great bonus damage) and other assassins (stun). I don't think the small advantage slashing gives you [.2 slower sword and bonus vs 1 other class] is worth losing the advantages thrusting gives you.<br>
<br>
Kosmaul, <br>
What kind of standing yellows are you talking about?<br>
<br>
I've tested perf on a lvl 50 warrior [epic armor] and I did about 380 buffed, 300 unbuffed. My cap is around 690.<br>
<br>
I don't remeber any exact numbers of cloth perfs (never had a chance to test this) but it's around 400.<br>
<br>
I get pretty close to caping my perf damage on standing blue players. That is, when I'm fully buffed with 1300 weapon skill.<br>
<br>
Your numbers are actually pretty close to what I hit for, and if you could get buffs you should do pretty well in rvr.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, crit strike damage should really be calculated independent of weapon speed/skill so all classes with equal CS spec hit for similar damage, but I doubt mythic is ever going to implement CS in that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unandurius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nandurius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/13/02 4:15:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3141.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Very close to retiring my NS. </span><hr size=1> &quot;With some of my remaining points from 48 to 50, Im going to bring CD upto 25 and hope that increases alot of off-hand damage.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wouldn't do that if I were you, especially with 2.2 spec points. You have to be able to use lifebane at level 50 [with realm rank 3-4].<br>
<br>
Poisons are simply incredible, and there should be no assassin wihtout them ;-)<br>
Lifebane = 80*6 = 480 damage. <br>
How much dualwield do you think you're going to need to do that kind of damage? *Maybe* if you swing both weapons at the same time for every round your offhand will equal that of lifebane,  but that'd take 50+ spec in DW.<br>
<br>
My infiltrator has a total of 5 points in DW. I've some extra points in stealth/envenom that I could respec, but DW really isn't that important compared to your other skills.<br>
<br>
Most other players I can just perf, lifebane, cd. Then I walk away as lifebane slowly eats them up. By the time I restealth, the last tick of lifebane is going to kill them ... and if not, turn around and perf [you're hidden now, so you don't even reveal for the killshot.]<br>
<br>
Tough targets are easily taken down with lifebane perf, crippling poison [snare], then sprint away. Restealth, repoison your weapons, and go back for round 2. With snare there's really not much an armsman/warrior can do to hurt you (or even get away) and you can kill him with only a few rounds of melee and most of the damage done by lifebane.<br>
<br>
Not having good poisons really hurts your char, not having dual wield doesn't really matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3141.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3141.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3141.topic&index=25><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3141.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3141.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3141.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3141.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
