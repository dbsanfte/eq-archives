If you look at your map, you can go through the castle, just go straight through tunnel past Observer spawn until you come to area with bridges. Or, the other way which I think is a bit easier, go past the castle towards the exit of zone, and you see a tunnel up on the wall just before the exit tunnel. You need Levitate to get there. In tunnel there are your usual Chardok mobs, a bit higher level then at entrance/exit area, both undead and live so you can't just invis down. They usually spawn in 2s, so you can either have a higher level single pull them or a chanter mez, there isn't much room to FD split them I think. Just follow the main tunnel, until there is a T-shaped fork. You are now close to the Captain room. That room has 3 mobs in it, one of them Captain (can't remember name) or PH, which is lvl 55 or so. My main is a chanter and not a monk, so if you need to split them you have to work it out yourself. They can't be single pulled by lvl 60 from what I know, so we have usually just pulled all, I mez 2 adds while others take the capt/ph. If you have a good chanter I recommend this, they don't have too high resists or anything.<br><br>Now you can set up camp in Captain room, I can't remember exact spawn time but I know that captain/ph is on a different timer, he takes a bit longer to spawn then the 2 other spawns in room. Then you can pull the spawns from the bridge area, just more sarnaks and then Bridge keeper/Ancient guardian (ph). I'm not sure if Iksar betrayer has any PH, I have seen him spawn 2 times but as I wasn't pulling I don't know the exact spot. If you camp the captain room and pull mobs from bridge area you should see him when he pops. I don't recommend camping bridge area unless your group is very good and can kill mobs fast, as the spawn time is fast (19-20 mins I think) and there are more spawns there then in captain room.<br><br>If you need to evac you come out at exit, not entrance area. You will probably agro the spawns at exit so be ready to zone, it's close. There are no traps on your way to that camp, only one I know around there is outside Korocust room which is close to the bridge area, but you don't have to go there.<br><br>Hope this helps and good luck with the camp, it's nice exp anyway even if you don't get lucky the first time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>-Cerara 60th enchanter<br>Fizzra 34th monk <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uharbromme.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Harbromme</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 365<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/1/02 7:52:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32616.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chardok Break in to Hold IB camp, need some advise pleas</span><hr size=1> Hmm, we usually go through fort and drop off first bridge into safe room.<br>Then we start pulling from there toward captain/bk or go deeper if we head toward herbalist or mines.<br>Camping on bridge might be better if you have trouble keeping up with the spawns but a group 55+ with a monk or a level 60 to split shouldnt have too much trouble.<br>I can pull the area almost blindfolded myself and get 3 mobs max on captain pull depending on what is in the room.<br>With captain and 2 dragoons i get all of them, if its a doggie or 2 i get captain single usually as they are pretty low level compared to the rest.<br>We have done the camp without a cleric/enchanter before with druid/necro as healer/mezzer but both were 60 at the time but was before the new heals went into game.<br>Its a fun camp and still good exp at 60. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65418>Gnomb Goodbasher level 60 troll warrior</a><a href=http://www.divinelegend.com>Divine Legend - Terris Thule</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxyphircyclonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xyphir Cyclonis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/1/02 7:54:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32616.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chardok Break in to Hold IB camp, need some advise pleas</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The number of Mobs that I may encounter getting to the spawn point<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>That depends on the route you take, and if another group is camping along the way.  Assuming no other groups, if you go through the fort area, you'll have about six there.  Then another four just past the first door.  There is a small bridge just after this and the observer camp is just past.  There are about eight more mobs on the bridge and in the Observer room.  As you make your way to the ledge, you'll encounter about 8 more mobs.  The ledge before the BK is not one of my favorite spots to camp.  I've been trained there 'mysteriously' before.  Once you cross the first bridge from the ledge, if you go right 90 degrees you'll end up near the Capt. room.<br><br>If you take the Levi-Tunnel down, there are about 10-12 mobs to the Capt. Room.

Group was me (54 at the time) a 60 Ranger and a 60 Shaman.  He kept primal on me since both of them had primal weapons and I owned stuff hehe.  Although I really couldnt compete with his damage with Tolans Longsword.  Also this was before their guild had done VT or Emperor so gear was NToV.  Im sure it would even be easier now.  Just root parked adds and epic DoT'd, rerooted till they were dead.  Didnt even come close to dieing and 1300 AC ranger and shaman did all the tanking so I didnt get hit much.  <br><br>Clearing down the tunnel was easy I think we made it to camp site in like 10 mins.  Although this was back when all the wizzie Sarnaks did was cast G-flux (resist) and the necro/sks just did there little darkness spells (resist).  Havent been back with my new monk yet but I remember seeing a good amount of casters in the Tunnel of Love but maybe it was just a bad spawn set.<br><br>Also I previously tried this camp with a 52 warrior, 54 warrior, 55 cleric, 52 chanter, and a 52 druid and we got wiped out 2 times.
