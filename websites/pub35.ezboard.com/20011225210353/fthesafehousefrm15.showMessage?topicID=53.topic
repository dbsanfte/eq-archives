I'm looking for some insight into what each of the PvP servers is like, and for some clarification on what PvP teams means to me as a new player who still has to chose a server.<br>
<br>
Also I realize this is a rogue board, but how survivable is an enchanter on PvP a server?

<br>
Also on the subject of servers, you might want to choose the type of PvP you want to play i.e... Teams (Tallon and Vallon-Zek) or Free for all (Rallos-Zek).<br>
<br>
Personally, I think enchanters are great PvP'ers you have a lot of weapons at thier disposal, charm, darkeness, de-buffs... the list goes on for quite a while <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I know for a fact my rogue skills are not up to par at all. I just started playing my rogue, and I have much to learn. The question is, what exactly is teams PvP? For instance what is the difference between Rallos Zek and Vallon Zek? I like the idea of one item and coin loot. I assume they can't loot what's in bags or loot your bags, but they can loot anything that is not no drop on your regular equipment inventory.<br>
<br>
I like to group of course (what chanter wouldn't?) so I guess I would have to find a PvP server where I could group. It seems like teams would be more my style, but I'm confused on the Rallos Zek FFA principle. How does anyone level or get items, or for that matter, accomplish anything if all they do is kill eachother mercilessly?<br>
<br>
Well, my intentions in PvP would be to play just as if it was a normal server untill someone made me angry. Then rather than having to rely upon a /duel command from both parties, I could just lay into them, win or lose... The idea of having guild wars and race wars is also very intriguing. I'd like to find one I could roleplay on as well. Is teams the way to go? VZ? I'm not too into the flagrant killing of anyone I see with good equipment just for the sake of said gear. <p>Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.<BR>Sun Tzu - The Art of War<BR><BR>

<br>
Vallon and Talon Zek are team servers.  There are four teams, human (humans, erudites and barbarians), elves (including half-elves), shorties (dwarves, halflings, and gnomes), and evil (dark elves, iksar, ogres and trolls).  You may not kill people on your team unless you duel them. <br>
<br>
The reward for killing opponents is coin only (all the money they have on them).  Item loot was taken from both servers.  The level range is 8 levels (you may attack, or be attacked, anyone within 8 levels of you).<br>
<br>
Rallos is very different.  Anyone may attack anyone else within a four level range.  There are no teams.  When you kill your opponent you may loot all their money and one item that is not bagged and not in a melee slot.<br>
<br>
The etiquette on these servers differs by server so I can only speak intelligently about Vallon, although Tallon is similar.  Basically most people play it as good vs. evil and frown upon humans attacking elves, or dwarves attacking erudites, etc...  <br>
<br>
If you're going to play it as a regular server unless you're mad at someone you're in for a shock.  You'll get attacked out of the blue for no apparant reason (especially on Rallos in the early levels).  If you think this will make you angry then you shouldn't play pvp.  It can get pretty brutal at times, but at the same time it spices up EQ like nothing else.  <br>
<br>
As far as enchanters are concerned, they used to be viscious before they nerfed charming players, but they're still very dangerous to fight against.  For a slightly easier road go with the enchanter over a rogue, especially on Rallos.  <br>

I taught myself how to play EQ on a chanter. I learned 95% of the things I know from my own mistakes or lucky shots. let's put it this way: I've got over 135 days played on my chanter and am only 57. I spent a LONG time between levels 12 and 30 learning what being a chanter was all about. Somewhere around 32 or so something clicked and I shot up very fast.

What I lack is PvP caster skill. Sure I can duel like no one's business, but that's ideal situation full mana full buffs and I pick the place and terrain and oponents. Let's face it I know nothing about PvP. I do like to roleplay though and a racewar server sounds awesome.<br>

I only have one problem. Picking a race. I'll play a male enchanter on Vallon, but I'm not sure what to go for.

If you get jumped by...<br>

Warriors: Probably easiest to deal with because of lack of mobility, color flux, tash, then do your bidding.. watch for bash and try to joust the 2 handers.<br>

Monks: no hide or invis so it's hard to get snuck up on, although tremendous damage dealers, and they will most likely be hitting you fast and hard, again, to to stun in between attacks so you don't get interrupted, they can't use most items so they should have lower magic resist..<br>

When I earn a surname for him I'll let you all know who he is.<br>
<br>
P.S. At about the point I earn a surname I will begin searching for a guild. What guild focuses the most on roleplay for the blue team? Ideally I would find a guild for myself similar to the Shanks, but not a racially exclusive one.

what you do? Wait for the elf to die, then kill the ogre <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Someone called my name?<br>
Ah, a potential recruit - excellent.<br>
<br>
I know you've already chosen your class, but a worn of warning - at higher levels, enchanters become seriously weak in solo or small group pvp as most of the tougher enemies you may be fighting will have a seriously high MR. However, enchanters are very much in demand in larger groups, both for buffs and also the tashan line of spells.<br>
<br>
Guilds you could join:<br>
<br>
Mine (Of course =) ): We're a small, pure erudite guild and level of pvp involvement is up to the individual guildmember<br>
<br>
Combine Resurrection: Fairly new (but with quite a few mid-high level members) human-team-only guild trying to drive the subhumans from the lands of the Combine Empire.<br>
<br>
Global Menace: Human only pvp-orientated guild with what appears to be (at least, in my eyes) an unfair reputation as kewlios.<br>
<br>
Guilds to avoid at all costs: KotAO, Order of Vallon, Ethereal Wrath, Immortal Dragons, (and to a certain extent) Amazons. Do not join these if you want to have any kind of reputation as a decent person on VZ.<br>
<br>
(I'm sure I'm missing at least one of the xteamer 'light team' guilds who don't play fair, but I can't remember. Any shanks or OBR want to add to this list?)<br>
<br>
