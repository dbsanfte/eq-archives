Most SB's (myself included) would gladly trade our WHOPPING 50 more hp, not to mention my tent pole 2H, for 2.5x and the chance to spec a diff weapon, any weapon. Hell, I'd be happy to be able to spec in handbag swinging. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure where the misconception was brought about that SB's want crush. Yah, it would be nice, but it's not tangible. All we want is the &quot;choice&quot; (keyword there) to spec a thrust/pierce that makes use of our god awful high dex. But wait, that's a selfish request, right?<br>

Twigy is the type of person that doesn't want equality, after all it is that type of person that created this problem in the first place.<br>
<br>
Apparently, it is way too much to ask to be equal. 2.2 specs were fine before the nerfs, they don't stack up now. Nightshades and SBs need 2.5 specs to compete.

<br>
Crush would be nice, but if we get 2.3 - 2.4 spec points and the Left Axe damage &amp; CS styles get looked at, I would be more than happy with that.<br>
<br>
I would doubt Mythic will add anything drastic like another spec line (Hammer, whatever) for SBs.. the most likely change I could see them making would be to give us the option to use Slash or Thrust swords, which would be fine as long as the Thrust version takes DEX into account.<br>
<br>
I think 2.4 spec points would be the sweet spot for SBs and NSs. It would be very nice to be able to spec medium-to-high in EVERY spec line like some of the absurdly high Infil templates I've seen on this board recently.<br>
<br>
Primarily, though, LA needs to be fixed (not nerfed again, which they keep doing every patch), and the 44/50 CS styles need to be looked at to keep Critblades viable. I am not a CB but I feel for them -- the one-shot stealth nerf made their whole template into a lame duck. A lot of people specced high in CS purely for the highest front-loaded damage they could get, which was made useless in one patch. Basically they've been reduced to kamikazes now.<br>

why should SB get 2.5 per level PLUS all the stuff they get over Infil ?   I'm wondering how you think that is fair to Infil ?<br>
<br>
If you have really read my other post on the subject you would know I think SB need some help . Just that 2.5 is not the answer .There is other ways to balance without cutting into  what is Infil's only thing to call their own and sets them apart for the other assassin class. I do want class balance its you that don't . <br>
<br>
Lets think this 2.5 per level through for SB .<br>
 <br>
they get all the points all the other assassins gets.<br>
DF with 44 spec LA does close to  same(or from what I hear)damage as it did before it was nerfed . even it does not it still has the best style damage any assassin can use . <br>
you get more hp <br>
you get the use of free two hand weapon <br>
they get to pick from different weapon types .<br>
<br>
NS would get <br>
shouts and spells they don't have to spec in . <br>
all the skill points that all the other assassins get.  <br>
they get to pick from different weapon types . <br>
<br>
Infil get the same points as all the other assassin<br>
get to pick from two weapon types . <br>
<br>
How does that = balance for Infil ? All infil are is a watered down version of of the other two classes then . <br>
Please forgive me if I want to fight for balance  and  something to call our own as a Infil in the face of SB looking to have the flat out advantage over us . <br>

<br>
No matter how you slice it though, the only way to solve it is with a boost to spec points. Take away my extra hit points and give them to Infs and NS to compensate, I wouldn't miss 'em. As for the so called 2H advantage, everyone knows post 35 it's more of a liability than an asset. But, that doesn't detract from the fact we CAN still use it. So maybe only spec point boost of 2.4x?<br>
<br>
I'd be happy with even a mild boost to spec points and the option to make use of a DEX based weapon that is more attune to my lithe frame. As it is, I'm forced into mediocracy because I chose to 5-spec......Having to put THAT many points into LA to make it viable, hurts.<br>

Everyone is 100% right that SBs and Nightshades should not get 2.5 spec points without Infiltrators getting some other sort of advantage. The problem is that giving one realm's version of the same class more spec points than the other two was plain stupid to begin with. All other advantages are situational or hard to quantify. Spec points are very visible, and have a large effect on what can be done with a character. SBs and nightshades are very right to want the same number of spec points as infiltrators. Mythic needs to come up with a better way to make the classes &quot;different but equal&quot;. They can start with paying attention to all the good ideas on this board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubaym.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baym</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 8:00:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Smokin</span><hr size=1> Kraka is right. There are so many things you are leaving out Tiwgy that are significant differences. First, your 2.5 spec pts mean more than a SB's because they have to spec LA and you don't need to spec DW/CD nearly as high. Infiltrators can be buffed beyond 550AF whereas SB's and NS's cannot except with a realm ability or a charged item. Your weapon choices allow a greater selection of targets than a SB. Your realm abilities are greater than a SBs.<br>
<br>
Kraka is right though. The real crux of the matter is infiltrators should never have been given 2.5 pts to begin with. Unlike many of the infiltrators on this board, I don't believe in nerfing anyone. Since that rules out reducing infiltrators 2.5 specs to something more appropriate, the only equitable solution is to increase all assassins to 2.5.<br>
<br>
You are wrong on Doublefrost btw. I play a 50 zerk from time to time and the damage is still considerably less. I guess you ignored all those posts from Old Mill saying the same thing (he has 47 LA skill). What is it with you infiltrators and Doublefrost? All bummed out because someone has a skill that can kill you? Take a hard look in the mirror and think how those tanks feel when you unleash Dragonfang on them.<br>
<br>
It is OK Tiwgy, I am getting bored with this game anyways. I grow weery of all the Albs trying to tell everyone else how their class should not get this and that. I guess if you cannot win on the battlefield, you win in the Nerf War. No worries, let's see how much fun you have when there is nobody left to fight. Keep up the good work Tiwgy. Really keep it up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ukraq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KraQ</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 11:13:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Assassin Balance Revisted:</span><hr size=1> sorry im a bit confused you mean 3 targets agains alb right? cuz chain (or scale) is the most common armor type in the game.<br>

IF Shadowblades had Pierce, they would have 3 targets to choose from that have a +15% penalty (Mercs, Clerics, Minstrels) so your numbers should look more like.<br>
<br>
Damage Type / Style Bank / Non-Style Perks<br>
Infiltrator:<br>
Slash / Slash / 3 targets /duel wield (level based)<br>
Thrust / Thrust / 8 targets /duel wield (level based)<br>
Nightshade:<br>
Blades / Slash / 3 targets /duel wield (level based)<br>
Pierce / Thrust / 8 targets /duel wield (level based)<br>
Shadowblade:<br>
Sword / Slash / 4 targets / 2-h option<br>
Axes / Slash / 4 targets / 2-h option<br>
Iff:<br>
Hammer/ Crush / 10 targets / 2-h option<br>
<br>
Now the reason i added duel  wield is because duel wield is because it gets better as you gain more levels (without the use of spec points) unlike Left axe. <p>----------<BR>

Funny, when I asked in another post whether SB's would be willing to lose LA, in it's current state, and get CD/DW, I had only 2 responses.  Yet, when asked whether LA needs to be returned to pre-1.5, the bandwagon comes out fully loaded.

One for SBs, one for Infs.<br>
<br>
SB<br>
36 Stealth<br>
39 Axe<br>
34 Crit<br>
44 LA<br>
20 Env<br>
<br>
Inf<br>
36 Stealth<br>
50 Thrust<br>
34 Crit<br>
28 DW<br>
38 Env<br>
<br>
Although markedly different at points, these specs are actually very similar.  The SB will get Doublefrost (34)--his best non CS style--and his LA skill is high enough to be &quot;satisfacory.&quot;  The Infil gets his best non-CS style with Dragonfang (50), and his DW spec is good.  The difference between these two assassins is the poison ability, which is much higher in the Inf, thus allowing him access to Lifebane.  The Shadowblade, although he has a lower envenom  spec, will still have access to decent poisons, easily accessing Lesser Lethal Venom, attaining Major Lethal Venom at about realm rank 5 or 6 (lot of hard work for that), and theoretically eventually having access to Greater Lethal Venom (unlikely at best for most Shadowblades).<br>
<br>
Additionally, the Inf will probably have a slightly higher Weaponskill due to the ability to use str/dex based weapons.  The SB will have slightly higher hitpoints (again, admittedly, ~1 HP/Level is not enough).<br>
<br>
In this scenario, we will call the ability to choose between slash and thrust, and the inherent ability to use a 2h weapon &quot;balanced&quot;--neither of the above assassins has really specialized to exercise these options.  Note, however, that if the above Inf decides to use slash even though he has not trained it, and the SB uses a 2h weapon, the SB will be far more effective in combat.<br>
<br>
One of the points I wanted to make was that some SBs constantly mention how wonderful Dragonfang is and how powerful 2.5x and its resulting 453 spec points is.  What doesn't seem to be considered very often is that to raise the thrust spec from a solid (yet style-starved) 39 to 50 eats up 495 spec points.<br>
<br>

<br>
If you trained DW to 10, you would have roughly 350 spec pts to put into other places. There was several tests done by Elaa and someone else whose name I forgot (I think Drunkenkay maybe) showed that 10 DW/CD was better than 34 LA as far as base damage goes. Of course, LA style damage is better but then again that probably evens out the style damage and benefits of 50 Thrust (versus 34 or 39 slash for the SB). Those 350 spec pts turn into quicker access to higher level poisons, more stealth, allowing more items that boost CS or more CS.<br>
<br>
Please explain to me how this does not show that infiltrators are not only more flexible, but also more powerful. In your analysis, you even point out that the SB will get those poisons at realm rank 5, 6 or 7. Are you saying that a Realm rank 7 SB is = Realm Rank 1 Infiltrator? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lakeb>Lakeb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 12:41:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> balance vs. quality</span><hr size=1> I don't really think the classes will ever be balanced.  I do think they are all viable and I presume they are all fun to play.  I would like the NS spell to do 2x the damage it does now, but that might make us pass both of the other assassins.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if the shout just did 2x damage, since it is on a 10 second timer and is fairly short range, it would not be unbalancing.  One problem is that I have to break stealth to use the spell so it will only be useful if my enemy is running away from me.<br>

<br>
Shadowblades should have a more mellee feel to them.  Maybee giving them a shield spec line or the ability to spec hammers.<br>
<br>
Now of corse that leaves infintrators.  I say give them a traps spec line much like envenom thats basicly a true false check to see if they could use a given trap.<br>
<br>
but thats just my crazy idea for the moment.  and if you dont like it .. then wait a few minutes. <p>----------<BR>

What i'm saying is if you give them everything a Infil has PLUS the stuff SB have that Infil have ,then you are right back where you started from but with SB/NS on top with Infil on the bottom. <br>
<br>
If it would stop this stuff i'm all for give all assassins 2.5 per level , the same weapon sytles and DW. Lets take LA ,the hit points and use of two handed weapons for SBs. The spells away for NS.  and make everyone Infil . <br>
<br>
That from now is my vote how to balacne the assassin classes . Lets make them totally cookie cutter . Would that work for you Baym ?<br>
