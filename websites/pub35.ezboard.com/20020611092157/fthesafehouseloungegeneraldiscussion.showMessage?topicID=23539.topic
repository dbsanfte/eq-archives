<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Purpose: To demonstrate the design flaws and over-consolidation of functions on raids to a select few classes (sometimes referred to as “The Holy Trinity”), and the adverse impact this has on player morale and game balance.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Assumptions</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
We must make several assumptions before proceeding. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Firstly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, that the game EverQuest is unbalanced at the high-end. Balance means that each class should have a meaningful and productive way to contribute to a group, or raid. Many classes do not, or their methods of contributing are not in the same league as the other classes’ methods, or are extremely situational.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Secondly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, that Verant Interactive has a desire to fix these balance issues.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Thirdly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, that the players have a desire to see these issues fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Summary of Argument</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
The extremely specialized classes, namely Cleric, Wizard, and Warrior have too much going for them. They are too specialized, the cleric especially. The drawbacks that these classes have in a group situation do not balance out their extreme necessity and utility in a raid setting, where these drawbacks are rendered moot. You therefore have a few classes holding all the cards, with the other classes left to fill out auxiliary roles, minor utility functions, or in extreme cases, give their mana away outright to classes who can use it better.<br>
<br>
Some of these abilities must be distributed out to other classes, for the sake of balance at the high end. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Protection of the Glades (Druid) should be given a Hitpoint boost to bring it in line with Group Aegolism. Clerics have enough going for them already, they already have the best heal and resurrection in the game, they do not also need the best hp buffs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Druids and Shamans should see a moderate increase in their healing power to help balance out the massive dependency on Complete Healing seen in the end-game. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Druids should receive a resurrection spell at level 60 giving 90% of experience back at a relatively high mana cost (1000 sounds right). Call it Tunare’s Rebirth, it is to allow druids to resurrect in situations where clerics are unavailable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paladins and Shadowknights should be given a defensive discipline in the 50s to compensate for over-reliance on the Warrior’s /disc defensive in the end-game. <br>
<br>
There is no reason a Paladin or Shadowknight should not be able to fill in for a Warrior in an emergency without expending all the clerics’ mana keeping them alive. They are defensive tanks after all, as defined by Verant themselves. A discipline to allow them to mitigate 30% of all incoming melee damage, or giving them the warrior’s /disc evasive would help enormously.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Magicians cannot realize their full potential as a class until Pet issues are addressed, and their role as nukers on raids is defined. <br>
<br>
Right now, far too many raid-level mobs resist magician direct damage spells to allow them to be a viable damage-dealing class, so they are forced to summon mod rods over and over to give to Wizards and Clerics. Any class that is forced to give their mana away to other classes is severely unbalanced and needs immediate attention. Are they nukers? Are they primarily a pet class? Are they a utility class? These questions must be answered decisively and a real answer brought forth to address this class’ concerns. Already Magicians have one of the highest attrition rates in the game. They feel worthless on raids, not because they are, but because they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> percieve</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> themselves to be. Much the same as Necromancers, this is the result of creating a class whose purpose is to be a mana whore. It is not fun to have other people play the game for you, which is what giving your mana away amounts to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wizards are out damaging Necromancers over long (10 minute+) fights. This simply should not be the case, regardless of DoT stacking issues. Necromancers should see a moderate (20%) increase in their damage over time to compensate.<br>
<br>
A wizard’s strength lies in their ability to deal out massive damage quickly, and a necromancer’s to deal out massive damage if given enough time. With their epic’s Rune effect, a stack of peridots, and a modrod2 magician (since they have no other role on a raid), the Wizard’s mana regeneration is much higher than a Necromancer’s, allowing them to keep up a relatively obscene damage output in excess of the Necromancer stacking all his best DoTs. Add to this the proliferation of wizard right-click nuke items (Rend robe from Xygoz, Conflag robe from Velketor, etc) and you begin to see the wizard’s encroachment on the Necromancer’s mainstay – sustained damage over time. The Wizard epic rune should be changed not to absorb modrod2 damage to prevent mudflation in this area.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Necromancers remain a class whose role is ill defined in the raid situation. They are relatively balanced in normal, grouping play, but suffer somewhat in raid situations, in part because of the lack of direction in the class.<br>
<br>
It has been said by Abashi that the Necromancer class was a mistake, due to their inability to balance it properly. It had no concrete defined role like the Cleric or Wizard, and no necessary utility in a group such as an Enchanter. Part of fixing Necromancers involves fixing technical issues, such as DoT stacking among multiple necromancers, pet pathing and aggro issues, and mobs who resist lifetaps outright; but it also requires giving the class a concrete foundation to build upon. Are necromancers a pet class? Are they a DoT class? Are they a utility class? These questions are mutually exclusive for the necromancer – currently it is a mix of all three, which lead to this problem in the first place. The raiding game is about specilization, and the obvious course for the necromancer should be specialization in damage over time. To that end, their DoT lines should be enhanced as outlined above, and the spells Infusion and Trucidation should have their component cost reduced or eliminated altogether.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enchanters should have the amount of hate induced by the Tashan line lowered extensively. This serves no purpose but to aggravate them, in that they often end up dying for casting this one spell. The spell must be cast anyway, and is unresistable, so there is no harm in letting them live to actually see the fight. Letting them die only serves to increase downtime needlessly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rogues, Rangers, Shamans, Bards, and Monks are all relatively balanced classes now, so no fixes are suggested for them, though that is not to say they do not have issues worth addressing. Beastlords are not finished, so any suggestions will have to wait to see what Verant has in mind for the class.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Closing</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
EverQuest was designed, from the beginning, around the idea of a small group setting, and were balanced as such. This provided for dungeon crawls, social interaction among a small group, and easy adventuring. Unfortunately, the small group setting of six people does not scale well to a raid setting of 30 or more.<br>
<br>
Raiding was not planned for EverQuest, that much is obvious. It was tacked on as an afterthought. More attention was given to this aspect of the game with the Kunark and Velious expansions, but it was never truly balanced. As the primary melee classes became more and more powerful with each expansion, and support classes beefed up to keep them alive, the caster and auxiliary classes remained relatively static. <br>
<br>
Verant has not yet recognized the core design flaw of EverQuest: Namely, putting most of the required functions for a raid into the hands of a few classes, usually three or four. Which three or four has changed over the past few years, but the problem remains. Distributing raiding power out to more classes, and fixing the classes who need to be fixed, will only improve the game as a whole in the long run, and will actually reduce the dependency on the “Main Tank” system which Verant says it wants to steer players away from.  <br>
<br>
To balance this game may indeed require a rebuilding of the foundation upon which it was laid. Yes, that may mean (gasp) nerfs, and some mudflation, but in the end, fixing this game requires addressing its core problems, and gently trotting around trying not to step on anyone’s toes is only going to lead to a false sense of accomplishment. Verant has not yet begun to scratch the surface of game balance, and it can only get uglier from here on in. It must, though, because this game is worth fixing, and worth being enjoyably played by all classes, not just the three or four favorites of the year.<br>

You hit on many problems for the level 60 game.  Most classes are ok to 55.  Its 55+ and mainly level 60 where things go wrong.<br>
<br>
Things that make eq broken:<br>
1. Complete Heal, should have NEVER been in the game.  Makes the need for warrior/cleric combo with NO substitute at the high end.<br>
<br>
2. Pets, classes rely on these to do damage(necro,mage,bl) .   Problem is that the pets now are still tuned to RoK/Norrath level.  Pets have not gotten any stronger in 2 years, while melee have grown 20x as tough. Pets may have been overpowered before RoK, but they are WAY underpowered now.  Necros at 55+ often go without a pet, which is just sad.  <br>
<br>
3.  Wizards at 60.  The wizard class is tough to 60.  The problem is, it goes from average to INSANE real fast.  A wizzy at 60 with good aa (manaburn/crits) is too powerful.  The items and spells they can get just make them hard/impossible to outdamage OVER TIME for many classes that are considered damage dealers(mage/necro).<br>
<br>
4. Dot stacking.  Would this be unbalancing in any way?  Nukes stack and do close to the  damage a dot does instantly.  Most mobs don't live long enough for a dot to even do its damage.  Bring more then one necro to the raidand he will be giving mana to classes that can actually do something.(not like the necros pet is gonna do anything).<br>
<br>
5. Hybrids.  If you can't do something the best in the end game, then step aside.<br>
Warriors=tank best=needed<br>
Clerics=Heal best=needed<br>
Enchanters=Buff/Crowd Control best=Needed<br>
Shamans=Slow/Buff best=Needed<br>
Rogues=Damage best(starting to be questioned)=Needed<br>
Monks=Pull best/good damage=Needed<br>
Wizzys=Fast damage/evac best=Needed<br>
<br>
Others:<br>
*Bards=Good in situations/good resists songs=Needed sometimes<br>
*Druids=Not great heals/not best buffs(cleric)/not best damage=No needed, but possibel useful<br>
*Pallys=Average damage(not horrible now), Average tanking, poor buffs/heals=Not needed<br>

*Beastlord=Broken to all hell.  Pets die fast to aoe and suck, melee damage is weak, buffs are not useful=NO Way needed.

*Necro=Dots are ok, but most mobs either resist or die too fast.  More then one necro=waste of space.  Pets die easy to aoe and aren't wanted most times,  only need to log one on if summons is needed for CR.=Not needed.<br>
*Mages=CoH is very nice for many raids.  Epic pet is good and nukes are good if they don't get resisted.  Normal pets stink raidwise and they need a lure type spell.  Mod Rods really help=Maybe needed<br>

<br>
druids are versatile.  clerics are linear/one-dimensional.  clerics are built around that one spell, CH.  It's the best heal in the game, but in return clerics are weak in almost all other aspects of the game.<br>
<br>
You want to give druids equal buffing power, increase healing power AND an exp res?<br>
so basically they'd be a cleric that can kite/nuke/DS/port/evac/DoT/SoW, and solo up to 50's.<br>
<br>
please try playing a cleric to 60, and see if you still think they're overpowered.<br>
<br>
worst solo class in EQ.  arguably the only class that is incapable of soloing.<br>
you can be the best cleric in the game, but the productivity of your group can only be measured by the abilities of your melee because you have no direct effect over the mob.<br>
worst nuke mana efficiency.<br>
many grind groups will take shammies/druids over cleric for healer now because while having enough healing power, they can also do a @#%$ of other stuff.<br>
ONLY caster with no invis (not counting ITU).  every other caster/hybrid can atleast self-invis.  even warriors get invis thru click legs.  rogues get hide.  not sure about monks.<br>
no utility spells like sow, ports, etc.<br>
no pets to play with (not counting the hammer pet with like 100hp)<br>
in the high end game all they do is spread aego around, then press CH every x seconds.  gets really old.<br>
<br>
so really clerics are the best healers, but that's ALL they do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxitix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xitix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 7:15:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23539.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Essay: Where did they go wrong?</span><hr size=1> Most of this may have been true in the past but these days it's allmost all untrue.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaxterixenobelix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Axterix EnObelix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 7:16:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23539.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Agreed.

<br>
Druid + paladin gets you buffage that's sort of close to Aeg, just takes more buff slots.  Clerical buffage isn't that big of a deal though, since it's primary impact is hps... which primarily matter due to CH.  Druids don't need to rez, they've got a ton of crap they can do already.  Unless of course they want clerics to have a SoW (barely worse), snare, and ports<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Want a non-cleric resser, 90%?  Get a paladin.<br>
<br>
Paladins and SKs don't need defensive.  That's the one real thing warriors have going for them.  They could use a minimal defensive type discipline.  Say, riposte.  Nothing overly awesome, but would let them last a few seconds.  However, your guild determines the need for warrior defensive.  LoS lets their bard tank certain boss mobs.  Furor is kept alive through a 30 minute fight.  That's a bit past the duration of defensive.  Defensive lets you fight the mob earlier than you could have otherwise.  That's all.<br>
<br>
I would like to see druids get a 10 second casting, 400 mana, 3k heal that consumes a pearl to peridot level jewel.  Would provide a bit of an alternative to clerics on raids, but be pricy to use for xp'ing.  Clerics are really the only class you needed a ton of.  That's actually less of an issue now due to mod rod 2.  Cleric mod rods, druid heals cleric, cleric CHs tank.  Lots of funky things to figure in.<br>
<br>
However, biggest thing I'd like to see is a balancing of caster damage.  Damage is the only thing that stacks infinitely and stacks well.  Everything else, you reach a point of diminishing returns.  For tanking, you need 1 tank, as long as you don't let him die.  You need enough healing to keep that tank alive until the mob is dead.  And a few peeps to buff everyone, typically easily accomplished by 1 of the appropriate buffing class.  Then all that's left is DPS.<br>
<br>
By using a similar ranking to what melees have (wizards&gt;mages&gt;druids at the same ratios that rogues&gt;monks&gt;warriors).  Bit harder to do for casters than melee, of course.  Melee is pretty easy, weapon ratios + haste tend to be static.  For casters, you've got to figure in resist rates, aggro, damage types, pets, their value before diminishing returns hit on non-damage, and mana regen.  Much messier equation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulurik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 7:58:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23539.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Although I like the way you layed everything out nicely to be read.

Being a mage I can say at level 60 I rarely get outright resists and often hit for full, even on raid-level encounters -- so what if there are some encounters where I get resists, it's called variety, variety that should be in the game.<br>
<br>
Are there things wrong with my class?  Sure, pets definitely need to be looked at and the scale of dd power needs to be reconsidered.<br>
<br>
Most people are too short-sighted to see a classes potential.  Take the mage, most people feel we're a mana-giving class.  No one can argue to the negative the postives of Mod2, but in encounters where a magician can land DD's and position a pet they can put out serious damage, behind a wizard but more than a druid/necro.<br>

EQ is too far along to worry about some of things you've said, essentially wide-sweeping changes will kill the game and make too many people unhappy.<br>

<br>
Does the Paladin have a role in high-end encounters?  Yes, often positioning and timely LHs on a MT.  The group heal alone is valued in many encounters greatly.  Defensive to tank?  My lord that would be a kick in the nuts to Warriors.  They certainly solo well for AA and get useful skills from it generally.<br>
<br>
Ok, next the Shadowknight.  A little tougher here, they can sometimes be needed to split specific areas (rarely) and can be excellent transition tanks due to extremely good aggro gathering techniques.  They are amazing TMers on the way to a site and can also provide nice functions in exp groups.  Defensive would again massively overbalance them and yet perhaps they could use a little more raid functionality.  Again though, they can solo well at points in their careers and pay for it to some degree.<br>
<br>
Hrm, Rangers?  Just about set at 60 in my book.  They are behind Monks and Rogues in damage from melee but not so far behind that they are not contributers.  Buffs alone make it nice to have one but stacking issues limit it somewhat.  Perhaps archery changes will overpower them in times to come.  Excellent AA gatherers also.<br>
<br>
Monks?  Well, they are needed in many situations and rarely unliked in any.  Good damage, excellent skillset and relatively unreliant on maintenance.  Excellent AA soloers and good group contributers make them a favorite all round.  /shrug Stonestance and the best aggro control makes them a good choice on any raid, even if not performing pulls.<br>
<br>
Rogues?  Well, frankly I am biased of course.  We contribute damage, much like a willful DoT.  We do it in good quantities and we can, if well played, do so in a variety of circumstances.  We do need upkeep in terms of AE healing, Rampage avoidance and solid emergency healing/rezzes but we do provide more punch per player than any other melee class.  Poisons and trap disarming/ door duty add some utility.  Poison especially has potential, although it is pretty weak at the moment.  We are, of course, pretty poor AA soloers but still do well in duos and trios so I can ignore that.  Our actual class AA is awfully weak though.<br>
<br>
Warriors.  They have troubles of their own.  Although a myriad of casting items are in the game, they still need to deal with basic day-to-day needs.  In the right arena, they are the gods we all love them as.  The suckers of damage, attention and still good offensive powerhouses.  Now, there is a world between the MAIN TANK of a guild (well, hopefully several) and the average attendant Warrior.  The former often is a golden child (and rightly so for a guild that likes to win) and the latter is a poor damage add in many scenerios.  Well, in ring events and such the latter shines sometimes and in exp groups both are great to have.  AA soloing is a cakewalk for GTMs and is generally still possible for offtank warriors.  They are all well-liked folks I've found.<br>
<br>
The rest.  Well, class balance outside of melees is a long and involved thing and frankly, I'm running out of steam.  Suffice it to say that we far too often think in terms of just power in situ.  That Necromancer who can move mana to where it is needed on the fly is the military equivalent of a troop transport; the most important part of any engagement.  Pick another two clerics or a Mage and Necro?  I'd take a smart Necro and Mage anytime for the flexability.  The Mage role of pre-summoning focus items is still silly though as any guild will have access to Mage_mule_031 if needed.  That isn't class balance.  Err, as to AA gathering and utility... well some casters AE and the rest solo/duo well.<br>
<br>
Actual transport is the other often overlooked need.  Druids are a second rate nuker, second rate debuffer, second rate healer (although often crucial) but they are the mobility that allows firedrills to happen and makes raids that span worlds go somewhat smoothly.  Wizards can provide more transport on the back-end (I think Druids should get reverse TLs along a summon line) but Druids are still a backbone of a good raiding force, imho.<br>
<br>
Anyone thinking that Shaman or Bards do not have a place is not paying attention I think, so I won't spend time there.  Enchanters are somewhat unique, more as their power varies vastly from fight to fight.  Sometimes they are lynchpins, sometimes buff-whores.  /shrug they still do ok in my book though.<br>
<br>
Gnomes however are pretty useless. <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Assassin of The Nameless<br>

<br>
There is simply not enough useful things for 30-50 people to do against one mob.  If you look at the people who are really essential to any given raid, you will come up with a half-dozen key components or so.  Everyone else is nearly interchangable on a mass scale.<br>
<br>
Things like the ROF are a good step in the right direction, because they really need to break the focus of high-end encounters from one single mob, to be 5, 6, 7, 8 or more mobs at one time.  This allows for alot more neccesary positions on a raid, as you need actually groups that can accomplish specific tasks, and leaves less room for filler.<br>
<br>
Things like giving Druids rez will have no effect on the high end game or make classes more desirable.  You think the 4th warrior on a raid is any more satisfied than a druid on the same raid?  Yeah he is sitting there doing damage, but it is not that satisfying.<br>
<br>
They need to give more for everyone to do, and make more classes essential.<br>
<br>
Nothing wrong with having large-scale encounters, they just need to challenge the players in a different manner.<br>

Its been ranted about in these forums before.  They are almost always buggy as hell.  You have to fit too many people in a room that is too small for them.  Clown car anyone?  If you accidentally step out, you either get DTed or ported into a lava pool.  Did I mention every single RoF out there is buggy, but VI still thinks its a great idea to keep putting them in the game.  If you do ring war in GD and another guild failed the ring war previosly, you will get 2x the giants.  3 failures means 3x the giants, and this has never been fixed.  My guild has sent in countless screen shots of this in to our GM and the only response we got was &quot;working as intended&quot;.  Also, how many people here have had the RoF in Acrylia poof on them even  if there were around 5 people in the ring?  AND, anyone seen Vulak?  I know BoTs finished that almost impossible ring and the script just stopped.  As long as VI dosent implement ring encounters correctly, they are just a waste of time.   <p><p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=87546"><B>Ombra Darkstrider</B></A><br> Assassin of Sol Invictus<p>

There are however, several flaws as well.<br>
<br>
As a druid I must profess that I cackled with glee at your suggestions for the druid class.  I for one am of the mind that druids *are* very, very broken end-game.  I can do lots of stuff soloing duoing, trioing and grouping.  But end-game, I'm pretty useless.<br>
<br>
I think POTG should be raised to something like 1600 or so mana and the HP should be raised to give somewhere between 700 and 800.  This woul not challenge clerics  for their slot as the best HP buffers, but would actually make using POTG on many people viable (Since you aren't trading off as many HPs for mana regen).<br>
<br>
The idea of a rez, however tickled it does leave me, is ridiculous.  Perhaps making it 1000 mana or 1500 mana and leaving it at 60 with perhaps... 60-75% would happen.  If hell froze over.  <br>
<br>
Clerics will never be challenged for their spot as the rez-o-matics.  Paladins aside since they are part of that parent class.  Maybe, just MAYBE an AAXP Ability that is self-only or has a reuse time of 72m and costs something obscene.... maybe self only with longer lasting rez effects and/or higher rez effect penalties.<br>
<br>
At any rate the HP buff idea is nice but a rez... pfft is all I can really say.<br>
<br>
Forgive me for hilighting the druid class section of the essay, but I feel it is probably the one that I can truly do and do well given my experience.<br>
<br>
My two cents is that any class that can group with 4 others and take down a Kunark dragon (Read: Wizards) is a tad over powered.  EVEN considering the amount of AA it takes to make that a possibility.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=23539.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=23539.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=23539.topic&start=61&stop=65>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=23539.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=23539.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23539.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=23539.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=23539.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23539.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23539.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
