<br>
<br>
Ok, I'm not really a Nightshade.  I'm a healer who WANTS to play a Nightshade, because of the completely different play style.  I figured I'd play my healer when I was in a good mood, and my shade when I wanted to vent some frustration in a virtual world <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I started an elf, and he is 6th level, and I plan to take him higher, but it's pretty discouraging.  As a healer, it's quite a shock to play a class that has nothing to contribute to a group but hassles.  I know well how it works.  Nice group, Tank, me, some other damage dealers etc.  We invite a Shadowblade, and he either doesn't backstab (I use this term generically for the high damage hidden styles), or he does, and I end up having to 'emergency heal' him, which causes me to get the aggro myself.  I remember once thanking a Shadowblade for not getting aggro, and I realize now that I was thanking him for not using the defining ability of his class!<br>
<br>
It's probably been discussed to death, and doesn't matter much until Mythic hears an idea and thinks &quot;Oh, we can do that without screwing up class balance!&quot;.  But here are my ideas in any case.  Maybe some of them are new enough to catch somebody's attention.  I envisioned these for a Nightshade, but similar abilities, with a priestly/illusion/Loki theme could be given to Shadowblades, and disguise/door breaking abilities for infiltrators.<br>
<br>
Numb Blow - Used to anesthetize your next attack, so it causes less Aggro.  Lower level spells would reduce the aggro maybe 50%, while higher levels would eliminate it.  Like Bladeturn, it lasts indefinitely until you strike.  Higher level variations would last for more attacks ( 2, 3 and 4 strikes in a row for those Style Chains), a version castable on others (eldritches etc?), as level increases.  Note that this spell would not be useful in a 'group' version, as nobody would get aggro.  Obviously PVE only, as players don't have Aggro Lists.  Would help make Nightshades more popular in groups, as one of the annoying things about having them is that they get aggro and require much more healing than a tank would require.<br>
<br>
Illusory Attack - a false attack that occurs just before your real attack.  The purpose of this is to take down a bladeturn so your real attack strikes home, and as such, it works much like bladeturn... it's active on you indefinitely, until you attack, after which it is canceled.  At higher levels, just like bladeturn, you get a version castable on others, group, and eventually a pulsing group version to counter bladeturn.  Obviously RvR only, unless there are mobs that use Bladeturn?  Or maybe have it give your real attack a higher chance of success in PVE, since the target was suckered by the first false attack?<br>
<br>
Charge Blade - A spell that charges your weapon with energy (Darkness, perhaps?).  Like the previous two, it is of indefinite duration, and is only canceled after it 'goes off'.  This makes it much like a DD Poison, but I see this potential spell line as an alternative way to spec, most likely at the cost of envenom.  If you pulsed this one, though, it'd be too similar to a normal damage add spell.  I envision it as more of a powerful &quot;First Strike&quot;, so if you charged the whole group's weapons, the monster would take a real hard initial hit, but after that you'd have to rely on a warden or other class' damage add spells for higher damage.<br>
<br>
Possibly, for balance purpose, the above 3 spells could be configured so they don't stack... you'd have to choose how to magically prepare your next strike.  Do you want it to get through a bladeturn?  Are you in a group, and you want it to go unnoticed, and not get aggro?  Or do you just want to do more damage?<br>
<br>
Those are my most 'balanced' group friendly ideas.  Here is my coolest <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Summon Shade - Summons a Shade, a 'pet' like a theurgist's.  For those of you who don't know how Theurgist's pets work, they're not true pets.  You target the mob you want to take down, and cast your pet spell.  The pet is summoned, runs up to the target, and attacks until it's short lifespan (20 seconds, perhaps?) comes to an end, or it is killed.  It can't be commanded, it's useless to buff it or heal it.  A Theurgist can summon LOTS of pets, and have a whole army pounding on his target, but the Nightshade would just have one.  Make it a spraggon/wildling shape, but with an absolute solid BLACK texture.  Basically a DoT that looks cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and keeps the mob in place long enough to set up and execute a backstab.  Higher level pets would get bigger, and maybe have ranged attacks that look like the existing nightshade DD.  The shadowblade's illusion version could be of any creature (a wolf, or perhaps a simulacrum of yourself?) but it's a pure illusion.  This could be coded to be a pet with HUGE AF, so the attacker always misses, but with 0 damage, so it's main purpose would be to distract, and could be used to a limited extent as crowd control.<br>
<br>
Confusion - The standard spell that clears the mob's aggro list and causes it to run around attacking randomly for a short time.  Since it's main purpose would be to get the aggro off of the NS, this would only be useful as a shout, but would be group friendly as it could also be used to save the healer/caster.  Yes, this shouldn't be needed if you get Numb Blow, but two aggro controlling spells hardly seem out of line.  A nightshade is sneaky and should be able to confuse the enemy, as well as hit them hard.  They should be able to go unnoticed, but are often the most noticed in a group!<br>
<br>
Blur Mind - This would be cast on a mob so it, in effect, goes from aggressive to neutral for a short time.  This would allow the shadowblade and his group to walk by a tough, aggressive mob without provoking a fight.  Could be used in dungeons (or outside zones through gates and other chokepoints), to get to a better spot.  Note that this is pretty much a group spell, because the NS alone could just sneak by.<br>
<br>
Shadow Speed - a running speed increase that works only while stealthed.  At high levels, this spell should make a nightshade with decent stealth ALMOST as fast as running unstealthed, so he can keep up with a running victim, at least enough to keep him in sight, and catch up (and strike!) if they stopped for a bit.<br>
<br>
Gather Shadows - A true invisibility, no chance of detection at any range, but you can't move without canceling it.  You are sneaking around, in a keep, see a high level enemy coming down a narrow hallway, so you duck around a corner, cast this spell (become visible for the casting duration), and then just stand very very still.  Give it a duration of a minute or so, and a recast timer of 10 minutes, so it can't be used for indefinite, risk free scouting.<br>
<br>
Elude Pursuit - In RvR, whoever has you targeted loses you, and has no target.  In PVE, it allows you to hide after running away from something without it automatically uncovering you.<br>
<br>
Feign Death - Ok, I considered giving it a different name, so you might not realize I'd stolen this from another game, but hey, it's a good idea, so why NOT steal it?  This is an alternative to Elude Pursuit, and would be a instant 'shout' type spell that would make the nightshade appear to be dead.  Enemy RvRers might not believe it, if he just dropped dead for no reason, of course, but if he did this in combat when he was almost dead, they probably would.  Maybe give this to Shadowblades, and Elude Pursuit to Nightshades?<br>
<br>
Steal Essence - a DoT Lifedrain... each tick, it does damage to the target, and gives the HPs (or maybe converts them to Endurance?) to the Nightshade.<br>
<br>
Blinding Light - one of the few spells I'd want to have a bright, noticeable spell effect.  This would be a shout that would effectively stun (maybe mezz is the more correct description?) the target until it was attacked again.  The Nightshade could stop attacking, cast this (shout, so not interrupted), strafe around to the side or back for styles that require that (not enough time to hide, only non-hidden styles).  I'm thinking of this mainly so that we can use some of those non-frontal styles solo, without giving us a true stun.<br>
<br>
A note on spell effects in general... silent, no flashing lights.  Hand gestures with maybe some dark swirling around the caster and target.  It'd be spooky, and have people checking to make sure their speakers were on.<br>
<br>
Finally, get rid of those dang DDs... when I learned I could get 2-3 DD casts in before a mob got to me, just like a wizard etc, and do as much damage as with my backstab (remember, I'm just 6th), I was pretty disappointed.  What is that, some sort of bone thrown to an unfinished class?<br>
<br>
So, I'm looking for comments on these from you more experienced Nightshades, Infiltrators, and Shadowblades, and then will want to bring these to the attention of Mythic.  Can you do that, Squink, if these prove to be popular and realistic?<br>

It's not amazing, certainly, but it's quite handy at times.  I wouldn't get rid of it.<br>
<br>
I also don't want to get rid of my spell animations... that's one of the things that annoys me about champions.  I want to look just like a spellcaster when I'm casting spells, because that has uses too.<br>
<br>
I have no particularly affiliation with death or souls, so Feign Death and Lifedrain don't seem to really fit.  Feign Death wouldn't work very well unless it stopped people from swinging at you (broke auto-attack).  The day that people found out we could Feign Death, they'd be stabbing every rogue-looking corpse that they see.<br>
<br>
I have weapon styles to control aggro, I don't really need a spell for it.<br>
<br>
I also don't need an illusory attack to take down bladeturn, my PA opening does that just fine.<br>
<br>
I like the Charged Blade idea... I think a one-time magical bonus to damage would be very handy, especially if we could cast it between fights on multi-pulls when I don't have enough time to apply a poison.<br>
<br>
I don't want a pet, but I like the short duration &quot;illusory me&quot; distraction castable on a ground target.<br>
<br>
Blur Mind allows bypassing of content, and would require a change to how places are designed.  I don't want it, and I doubt we ever see anything even remotely like it.  The class that gets this becomes &quot;necessary&quot; for any travelling group, regardless of what else they can do.<br>
<br>
Gather Shadows, Elude Pursuit... that's why I have Stealth.  No need for them.<br>
<br>
Shadow Speed would be awesome.<br>
<br>
I want Confusion in a bad way.  In the right circumstances it's very powerful, and I think it fits well with the Nightshade theme.<br>
<br>
Blinding Light... heh, rogues with mesmerize.  If it had even a 10 second duration, we'd be freakishly more powerful than we are now.  Not going to happen, and probably just as well. <p><b>Ciardha Sidhe</b>, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br><small>Explorer 93% | Killer 60% | Socializer 40% | Achiever 6%</small><br><i>"You killed a little dwarf.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Veil Step</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - A spell that puts you into stealth regardless of enemies around you or combat timer. Casting time less than 2 seconds. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Glamour of the Fey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - A very short stun (duration ~3 seconds), instant casting that doesn't break stealth, long timer. It's primary use is to keep things from walking away right when we strike, but obviously useful other times as well.  (Changes to stun functionality make this unwanted in RvR, and it lessens the power of Creeping Death so no longer such a useful thing.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Will o' the Wisp</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - A very long range bolt spell (approximately twice our DD range), appears as a small bobbing light, hits target for negligible damage, casting time 1 second. Used to break opponent stealth, disrupt spellcasting, disrupt archers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Wail of the Baensidhe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Point blank AE stun, small radius (melee distance), instant casting, very long timer (no chain-stunning). This would be our getaway spell, no need for a sprint-like spell. (Obsolete now that a single add doesn't guarantee death.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Brighid's Gift</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Ranged spell, targets enemy players, AE effect. Lights all of their torches.  Can be cast on ground target. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Annwyn's Blessing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Self-only buff. Doubles chance of getting a critical hit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uphaelondaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phaelon DAoC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2085.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshade Spell Ideas (Long)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As a healer, it's quite a shock to play a class that has nothing to contribute to a group but hassles.

Shame you started the thread like this.  You have some real good ideas, but Im going to dwell on what you wrote first for a second....<br>
<br>
What idiot Sb are you grouping with?  I thought most NS, SBs or Infs knew enough not to open with PA early.  Also dont like the fact that you came to a rogue board and said we offer nothing to a group, hehe, I have no trouble pulling agro off healers just as well as any tank and personally, I think we do enough damage to warrant havingg us in a group.  /shrug, I might be biased.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I don't want to get rid of spell animations... I want to get rid of spell SOUNDS.  I'm all for body movements, gestures, etc.  What I want to change about the graphics is the bright swirling, attention getting lights.  The current DD spell is actually pretty good in this respect.<br>
<br>
You say your PA opening takes down a bladeturn... but doesn't the bladeturn stop the damage of this attack?  True, your followups will get through, but letting that first one get through was my intent.<br>
<br>
The theurgist pet's are not true pets.  I can't really add much to my description of them... but it's more of a DoT that has a physical form and can be targeted and take damage.  Try a theurgist to level 5 sometime, it's a very 'different' class.  Your idea of being able to cast it at a ground target is good... it'd just stand there, maybe for a longer period than if it's cast at a target?<br>
<br>
Blur Mind... you're probably right.  Stealthers can already bypass content, but allowing diverse groups to do it would be a bit much.<br>
<br>
My intention for Blinding Light was more for a stun duration mezz... 3 seconds, just long enough for you to strafe around to the back or side and hit a style.  It's just for soloing, to allow you to put those side/back styles to use.  Probably not a concern, because there are so many styles available to you that you don't need to use those.  A normal stun is more straightforward, but I was trying to balance it by making you trade something off... if you want to use it, you have to stop attacking for a time.<br>
<br>

Hidden Critical Strikes cannot be blocked, parried, evaded, or bladeturned.  PA does damage and kills bladeturn.<br>
