Said tunic has magical properties that those of my kind find irresistable. <BR>  <BR> I crept through the tunnels and hallways - the goblin guardians oblivious to my presence - to see how this small band was faring. <BR>  <BR> I would have been within my rights to fool a great band of the goblins into following me right to the thieving interlopers, but my companion for the evening, the minstrel Vates, urged restraint and mercy. <BR>  <BR> I came upon the trespessers engaged in a furious and bloody battle near the breakroom the foreman is known to frequent. <BR>  <BR> I found myself strangely pleased at the slaughter of the goblins that have been my unknowing hosts these many moons.  <BR>  <BR> After the battle and as the heroes were resting and binding their wounds, I stepped out of the shadows and revealed myself to them.  Such a motley crew was this band, two thieves, a dark elven warrior lass, a wood elven druidess, a cleric of Innoruuk, and a medicine woman of the trolls.   <BR>  <BR> As we were exchaning pleasantries, I heard the unmistakable howl of a kobold hunter, come up from deeper in the pits to pull goblins down to their doom.  Gilligan and Snag raced forward to combat this critter, hoping perhaps that it had acquired some trinket that might be useful to them. <BR>  <BR> Unbeknownst to me and to the others, a goblin from the previous fight had escaped and alerted its foes.  As the kobold fought for its life, a host of goblins and the fire drake I know as Singe descended upon the group. <BR>  <BR> Never before had I seen such an angry mob of goblins.  The bloodlust was unmistable in their eyes as they tore into the small band.  Gilligan and Snag continued to battle with the kobold, oblivious to the drooling goblins surrounding them.   <BR>  <BR> I entered the fray with a well placed shiv between Singe's shoulderblades.  I watched as the cleric, druid, and shaman fell in rapid succession.   <BR>  <BR> Soon after, the dark elven blademistress fell, her blood staining the hot stone floors.  Only myself, Gilligan and Snag still stood.  I was locked in mortal combat with the drake, and the others with the kobold.   <BR>  <BR> It seemed that fate was against the rogues, however, as they too fell beneath the masses.  Not before they slew the kobold, however. <BR>  <BR> Singe fell shortly thereafter, and then, as soon as they had come, the goblins retreated from the battle. <BR>  <BR> One or two stayed behind to finish me, but I have studied them long and hard.  I know their strengths and their weaknesses.  Much to their surprise, I turned out to be the stronger, and sent their spirits back to Solusek Ro.   <BR>  <BR> As I stepped into the shadows, I paused on the scene.  The entire band of bright eyed adventurers had come to this place with dreams of gems, jewels, wealth and magic, and had paid for it with their lives. <BR>  <BR> It is true that great treasures may be found in the Eye of Solusek, but as this tale shows, be very wary when entering my domain. <BR>  <BR> --Latro Abiectus, vile rogue of test <p><a href=http://www.allgaming.com/latro/EQ000000.jpg >Grrrr.

I'll be in sol a tonight (Wednesday) getting that stout one way or the other.  Tried picking with a druid GG as backup, which hasn't worked out yet.  I have no reason to kill the clockwork.<br>
<br>
Strangely, I want to get the oil stout myself =)  I've put so much time into this quest, I might as well keep it pure.<br>
