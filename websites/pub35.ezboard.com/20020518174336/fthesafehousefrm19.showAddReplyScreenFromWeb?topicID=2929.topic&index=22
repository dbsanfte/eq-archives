<br>
I get killed by Infiltrators and Nightshades as often as i kill them. In my opinion<br>
the three classes are very balanced when we only take a look at the assassins.<br>
<br>
The situation totally defines who will win a fight. If i get my PA off first and uncover<br>
the other assassin i am several hundred damage points ahead of him. If he gets his<br>
PA off first i am the one to die. The HP bonus the SBs get is not that big<br>
that it unbalances the other classes. This bonus is not bigger than the damage<br>
a shade can do with his shouts over an combat. And a Infiltrator<br>
with superior skills can dish out damage very fast, especially with that fast <br>
weapons.<br>
<br>
It seems that most of the people here have a trauma since they got killed <br>
several times by a SB/NS/INF.  <br>
<br>
!! I find it horrible how people whine about other classes here. Its much more<br>
 constructive to post your problems you have with YOUR class. Define Issues<br>
 which should be addressed. And not whine postings like &quot;That NS are soo uber,<br>
 they kill us all, they do to much damage, they ... they ... they ...&quot; !!<br>

I'm not saying they can't be beat, but in a toe to toe battle EVEN with getting in the PA, we just don't live long enough. We're talking even con, toe to toe. This is what shades get pissy about. We don't like watching some ass emote spam us when the battle wasn't even close, and we got the PA in. Yeah WAA it's not fair, I want my wubby. Poison also takes time to work. They hit haaaard, relative to the HP availible at that level. And strategy? Please! You hit them, they hit stick, you die.  <br>

I find that hard to believe unless you had an extraordinarily crappy set of rolls. With just three ticks of lifebane is 240 damage right there. Add in about 7 to 8 rounds of combat from your fast thrust strikes, I find it very hard to believe. I don't disagree that some critblades can land high damage garrotes, but any Inf worth his salt can give as good as he gets, AND know when he needs to hit the deck runnin', and let his LB tick away. <br>
<br>
As the above poster mentioned, you need to stop whining about other classes, and look into what you can do to improve your own class. And, maybe possibly work on your own skills? Doesn't take a rocket scientist to know he shouldn't be standing toe to toe when he can easily score 480 damage running in the opposite direction. <br>
<br>
We were created differently for the sake of diversity. We are a melee oriented REALM. We are a melee oriented CLASS. We have these advantages for a reason. But, by no stretch of the imagination are we unbeatable. If this game was created with the original theme, no class counterpart should beat Midgard's classes in terms of melee. And, to counterbalance, our casters and healers should be fairly weak. Is that the case? I dunno, tha's in Mythic's court.<br>
<br>
If I were to look at my assassin counterparts, I try not to think in the &quot;grass is greener&quot; attitude, and I think it helps that I tend not to think as assassins as supposed to being equal, they are three different classes with similar abilities. I don't think at all that they should be equal in ability. When thinking about the original realm theme, do I do more melee damage than my counterparts? Yep. Do I do more magic damage than my counterparts? Nope. Do I do more poison damage than my counterparts? Nope. Am I able to have more abilities higher specced than my counterparts? Nope. <br>
<br>
When I face off, I tend to think on, now what could have swayed the battle in either direction, besides who got the first shot in. I think Nightshades should have a good bump in their shout damage. I could see a NS nuking somebody down from a distance with the cast spells, being from the magical realm, they should be like stealthy mages. I believe that was the intention of NS having those spells, is to create the theme of Hibernia being the realm of magic, I just think they were too tentative with NS thinking that they'd be overpowerful. <br>
<br>
Make those spells sting, for god's sake! I'd be much more afraid of a NS that could shout for 100, then cast a DD that tagged my silly ass for 200. How would this affect your current strategies now? As I see it, NS are attempting to act and play like their brethren, and are just coming up short. And really, you can't blame them, because they have no other options available to them in terms of strategy. If giving you this consistent damage on your shouts/DDs, would that change your view on your killing ability?<br>
<br>
Infiltrators...I'm sorry guys, if there are two classes I worry about when I leave home, that is Infs and Minstrels. Whenever I face off against you guys, I get hit with top of the line poisons, and slash Infs hurt me pretty darn bad. Thrusters, well, you chose your weapon, not me. Still your puncture combo does a fair bit of damage quite fast. As a SB, it is very hard for me to have much compassion for you and your x.3spec. I fully understand that in the later game, it evens out due to gear, but I always feel going head to head with Infs, that their templates are much more matured than mine, and to me, I feel that is what causes an Inf to defeat me. <br>
<br>
I sympathize for Infs in that their realm strength is class diversity and having the most complete class diversity to handle any situation, their realm is made to work together to accomplish their goals (and their natural propensity to zerg everything =). Albions strength is in their numbers, and infs for the most part are solo critters. So, how do we improve the Infs, farther than their x.3 spec where they'll be happy with their potential to kill without nerfing or stepping on the toes of his two counterparts? How can we make a solo player in a group oriented realm stronger without unbalancing the realm theory?<br>
<br>
While I feel both our brethren have room to discuss means of improving their class, I really don't believe they should be attempting to measure their success and abilities to our melee capabilities. And we do, in fact, sacrifice spec in other areas of our template in order to attain high melee spec. While some of you speak of the top 1% of SBs on your server who can do some amazing things, as the above poster mentioned, these few individuals are not who we should judge an entire class upon. We really need to focus on the majority instead of the exception.  <p><center><b><u><font color=red>Black Widower<BR>X</u></b></font><BR><b>&lt;Shadow's Edge&gt;</b><BR>Norse SoulBlade<BR>Tristan/Midgard<BR>"If you don't agree with me, then <a href="http://gbg.bonet.se/ivil/you.html">click here</a>"</c></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugalium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/25/02 1:46:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2929.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: f</span><hr size=1> Thanks Widower for the well thought out post. One thought I had on the comment you made about thrust weapons and how it was my choice over slash. While I agree this is 100% correct, things were different when that decision was made, atleast for me.  <br>
<br>
Number one is that our top CS styles were not an evade chain at that time. When I looked at the styles I didnt see the redundancy that there is now between the two sets of styles.<br>
<br>
Second, there wasnt the same amount of thrust resist items in the game. I would be interested in hearing from the other two realms, but in Albion it seems there is way more thrust and crush resist items then there is slash resist, atleast for what I can wear. Is this true for you guys as well? Is there a lean a different way?<br>
<br>
All in all I dont regret thrust other then the completely redunant weapon styles, if I get another evade style in my character history I will scream! Thrust works way better against the majority of the people I fight, just not great against fellow assassins, which is more then fair trade off for me.<br>

If I am vulnerable enough to have a spell cast on me (with the exception of Minstrel/NS shouts) I should be dead, resists or not. If I am banking my victories on having enough resist, whether melee or magic, then I shouldn't be in that fight. Might it have swayed a battle here or there? Possibly, but I'd never bank my character's template on the comparison of other realm's resistance to slash or thrust. <br>
<br>
I look at what does the most damage in the quickest amount of time. I'd be looking at the damage comparison between the puncture combo, dragonfang (apologies, don't remember the exact names) and AmeSlash. My entire being is focused on damage output, I win fights because I deal mortal damage in as short a time as possible. My focus is dealing mortal damage before the other guy does. I find it easier for me to rely on my own damage potential than worrying about having the right resists to others' damage. <br>
<br>

<br>
I PA'd a ranger the other day for 210 or something rediculas like that, a week before I was PAing him for in the 300's. He indicated in PM he had upped his thrust resist. Doing quick fast damage is the goal, but if resist items are the Mythic way of implimenting a hidden reduction in combat damage, then it is going to have an impact on you regardless of how you template. If the realms resists are not balanced then it could unbalance the assassins in their effectiveness specifically in the speed we can kill, which you have so rightfully pointed out is key to survival much of the time.<br>

I don't think too many assassins really think on their resists. Others, yeah, I can see. But, most of the time I personally am fighting other stealthers. Just in the way I choose to RvR, I don't go to realm gates, I don't go running into the middle of groups. If I was fighting others, then I might possibly worry about that. But, even if I was any other class, in choosing my gear, what would be my priority in items? <br>
<br>
I know for my Bard, I upped my resistance as much as I could, because I had no need for any other stats besides charisma. I never fought, so I didn't need AF, enhanced skill in music, or any other spec I have did not increase effectiveness of any of them. I didn't use weapons, so didn't need bonus spec there either. As a result, he had nearly all resistances (before they combined them) near 20%+. <br>
<br>
Now, for a Skald, it would be different. I know I'd be in the thick of things, but also need my power too. But, I know in most fights, I'd be in the mix, so...AF first, STR/CON/DEX bonuses, melee bonuses, then CHA, then lastly resists.<br>
<br>
Let's look at a caster, say a Wizard. In RvR, I'd rarely run out of power in a session where I couldn't sit down before either I was dead, or everybody else was. So, INT is not needed in RVR for a Wizard. Survivability tho, CON/HPs, AF is pretty much a joke anyway, so second in my concern is resists. <br>
<br>
Just depends on who and what class you play and how NOT important the rest of the stats are for a certain class in RvR, for resists to even become a concern to them. <br>
<br>
It does pose an interesting question, tho. If we can look at all the level 50 gear (standard par) what are the resists on that gear? We can take a pretty fair gauge by looking at the epic armor, as most people who hit 50 will be wearing most if not all of their epic armor. I guess by looking at those, you'd know who not to go head to head with at 50 if they have a high resistance to what you're bringing to the table. That also being said, the only people you might see out there with 26% resist to slash or thrust would be pure Casters and Bards.  <p><center><b><u><font color=red>Black Widower<BR>X</u></b></font><BR><b>&lt;Shadow's Edge&gt;</b><BR>Norse SoulBlade<BR>Tristan/Midgard<BR>"If you don't agree with me, then <a href="http://gbg.bonet.se/ivil/you.html">click here</a>"</c></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nazir11>Nazir11</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/25/02 4:43:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2929.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> f</span><hr size=1> I use a 3 dly weapon that drops off prince.

<br>
&quot;no class counterpart should beat Midgard's classes in terms of melee&quot;<br>
<br>
This is whats totally flawed about your argument because its simply false. Mythic have said that is not what they implied when they said Midguard was the melee realm, all they meant was Midguard would have more classes with a melee focus. Your healers are perhaps the best all-round class in the entire game, and a runemaster holds the serverwide RP lead. If Midguard melee clases were meant to beat there hib/alb counterparts then simply no-one would play hib/alb melee classes unless they had a penchant for s&amp;m.<br>
<br>
I havent said that SB must be nerfed, ive just pointed out that infs/ns make vastly inferior assasins, not only are SB alot better at &quot;assasinating&quot; but they also are alot better at pure melee. <br>
<br>
If SB do significantly larger PA's and have superior melee then infs/ns need some form of compensation to make them equally as attractive and no crappy shots and pathetic xbows are not what i mean by compensation. Boosting the effectiveness of DW/CDW would go significantly toward this and im sure there are many ways that the class imbalance can be addressed.<br>
<br>
SB's have both 2handed PA, and Left Axe all im asking is that inf/ns get something to compensate.<br>

<br>
I beg you, since the sleeper nerf, please play a Healer, and then decide if they are the best all around classes to play, ooh, and fun too! =P. Really take a look at them, and their x1.0spec, and decide how you would spend your points. Then look at what skills/abilities you have or don't have. I agree, they are good at their job, but hardly the best around. <br>
<br>
And in argument to &quot;nobody would play hib/alb melee then&quot; well, they do, but they know what they're getting into. If you chose Merc/BM over Zerker, you know you ain't gonna match up in damage. Everybody knows that. Should they be equal? I don't think so, personally. And neither does Mythic, or they would have fixed their damage output instead of giving them dirty tricks, and the third sword abilities. Fact of the matter is, yes, we are the deadliest assassins out there, everybody knows that. If you choose Inf, or NS, tha's your choice, but you know how it's gonna be from the get go. You guys STILL seem to do just fine, matching up RPs with SBs. Why is that? You seem to have this notion that we should be equal no matter what Realm you choose. I say, thank Mythic for not making us all equal because I'd be bored out of my gourd by now if I didn't have the option to try something new in another Realm. <br>

<br>
The assasin classes do have to be relatively balanced and relatively equal, purely because assasins are the only counter to other assasins. <br>
<br>
If theres a SB camping mf1 another assasin is the only counter to taking him out. ATM thou we have a situation whereby inf/ns are gettin off a full PA chain on SB's and still losing. We are just not effective counters.<br>
<br>
Im not saying we should be equal, i don't mind if SB have a slight melee advantage providing that infs/ns get something in return to make them equally competitive.   <br>
<br>
I mean you can see how they have tried to balance the classes, For instance with minstrels and skalds, Skalds get superior melee skills and snares while minstrels get stealth to compensate, Clerics get Smite, healers get superior mez/stuns etc. <br>
<br>
SB get 2h Pa and Left Axe but inf/ns get nothing decent in the way of balance. You get to PA for 1050 dmg and also have superior melee skills. We PA for much less and DW is no answer to leftaxe.<br>
<br>
Quite simply theres no reason at all to choose a inf/ns over a SB. You assasinate better and you melee better and with leftaxe you also make vastly superior poisoners.<br>

And for a serious reply .. I really don't think infils nor SB's have any room to complain about balance. I think nightshades do for sure. Every single infil, EVERYONE I've fought against has had lifebane. There really are very few mids who have this. In our SB top 25 list there is 2 that have lifebane on Galahad.<br>
<br>
Doublefrost is nice, one of the best skills IMO. If you give this to infils you have more of a balance issue. You can't say that 2H makes it all even, because a 2H sb will almost always lose to a NS/Infil if the NS/Infil has good equip and a decent spec. <br>
<br>
The infils on my server do not have a problem killing any SB besides me .. mostly because I usually get first attack and I have Doublefrost/best possible equip available to me. I also get buffs quite frequently. Every day I hear &quot;Level_50_critblade was just killed by level_45_infil&quot; (no joke)<br>

Honestly, I kill people pretty well. I have heard that a critblade generally stays away from the true tanks, probably because they are facing another 2 handed tank.<br>
<br>
Last night, wandering out to Crau, and my group got ahead of me as I was checking AMF. Everything was clear at AMF, and the group was already heading to Crau, so I figured why not, broke stealth and ran to catch up to them.<br>
<br>
As I hit the thimble there is some big ol' troll with a huge axe slung on his back. He cons yellow. Being most tanks travel in groups, I slide to one side, and turn around still no other enemies. <br>
<br>
Without any hesitation, I walk up to him and very quickly dispatch him. Was never at all concerned or nervous about engaging him. I am a pierce shade, and I know I generally have the advantage against slow swinging tanks. <br>
<br>
Now, if what the shadowblades say is true, that is something they would rarely, if ever, consider. Also, so many of the statements about shadowblades revolve around the weapon type being slash. Which is why my friend is making a blade shade to travel with me. Will be nice to have a partner anyhow.<br>

The assassin classes aren't all that out of whack, but I do think 2H weapons should have a significant penalty to hit a fellow assassin. Personally, I think they go against the whole assassin concept. Big, slow, and clumsy- YET so effective. It doesn't jive. I don't care what anyone says, when two assassins meet and one uses his most lethal single attack on the other- he should win. It's like two scorpions fighting. If neither get that attack off- it should be a fight not a foregone conclusion either way. Period.<br>
<br>
 For example, going back to the first paragraph- we (thrust) get a neg while they get (slash) a positive due to armortypes vs weapon typea. OK, but how about this? Where's my + for being that much more nimble in my leather? I'm not seeing it on the battlefield. I might hit more often at a huge minus vs their armor type, but that doesn't matter when I'm dead in 4 of their swings. Don't stand toe to toe you say? Um ok whatever. I'll just poison them with my crippling poison and ....NOT defeat them and probably die anyway. Anyway, this seems to even out much more later on when there are more HP to go around. I'm in the low 30's now and am just sick of dying like a fly while c00l duD3 SB dances on my body. SB's aren't really even close to my biggest gripe. Insta mez and stun, now that's something that's really out of whack. <br>
