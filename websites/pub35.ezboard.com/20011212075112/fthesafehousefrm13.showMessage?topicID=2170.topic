I can't wait to get my grimy mits on the 'ol RB, and sitting around waiting for a Hate raid to invite me along so I can get my book wasn't working.<br>
<br>
I decided to take the plunge and devise a plan whereby I could just get up there and take it - with the encouraging knowledge that I would not be the first to accomplish this task.  Aye, it has been done before, and more than a few times I am guessing.  Now I am going to tell you how I did it, because I really believe I have found a great route to the book, and a good overall method for being prepared to steal the Book of Souls right out from under the noses of a packed house in Hate.<br>
<br>
First, if you are not strongly familiar with the outlay of hate, as I wasn't (having only been on two previous raids), study the main floor map, and the great explainations of it here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/oc/guides/ipren2.htm">www.drawmjil.fakta.se/oc/...ipren2.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Second, get yourself a zone explorer here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.everlore.com/LoreFiles/fileinfo.asp?ID=377137&sortby=4#Comments">www.everlore.com/LoreFile...4#Comments</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Study the map and use the zone explorer to familiarize yourself with the place, so you know like the back of your hand where the zone-in is, and where the nighstand where the book will be in-game is.  <br>
<br>
After some good study of each house on the main floor of hate<br>
and a review of the zone patrol that wanders between the houses and such, I believe I have worked out the safest route from zone-in house to nightstand:<br>
<br>
Immediately after zone in, hide/sneak and run out, take a right, and climb the east wall halfway up.  Do not go all the way up, or you may aggro a scorn or lich from above.  Along the east wall there are 8 houses, including the zone-in house.  Run just past the 4th house (including the zone-in house) , and take a left heading straight west.   When you see the fountain ahead you know you are doing well.  Run right over the fountain and keep heading straight untill you see the 2 clerics of Inny standing at the entrance to Maestro - go right past them into Maestro, hang an extreme right and go up the stairs.  Before you reach the top, though, be sure there is not a Scorn too close to the stairs, as she is one possible mob that can wander near the top.  When I went up she was spawned, but I saw that she had wandered very far from the stairs - so far in fact that the odds of her being close to the top I think will be very slim.  Now just run to the nightstand, grab your book, and gate out - done )  If you have used the zone explorer to practice this route, the travel from zone-in to gate-out should take less than 2 minutes.  I believe I was alone in Hate for all of a minute and a half.<br>
<br>
How to gate out cheap:<br>
Get a Leatherfoot Raider's Skullcap.  The hardest part is the alligator skin, but take it from someone who has owned 5 caps in his career (I always get one if I think I will need to gate out of someplace dangerous) the skin is best found on a bull alligator that spawns near the tower, but closer to the boathouse in Innothule ).  Get your shark skin in EFP far to right of the docks (merchant-bought ones won't work)  The Ring of Commons effect on it is INSTA-PORT -- no waiting around for the spell graphics, just BAM: LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.  And yes the cap is halfling only, but the effect will work for anyone.  A gate potion costs over 1kpp, which might not be much for some, but I don't spend a K on something if I don't have to.<br>
<br>
Don't forget - go naked, heh.  Guess I didn't have to say that, but oh well.  That goes for the porting Wiz too.  And the Wiz gates out immediately on zone-in, of course.  All you need to have when you go up is a sow and your Cap.<br>
<br>
I was scared to death when I went up, as you might guess.  What you might not guess is that what really had my heart pounding was the idea that I might fail after I put so much effort into casing the joint, charting a great path, and getting the fink outa there.  I was pumped to see my plan in action, and it went perfectly.  I'll bet my future Ragebringer it'll work for you too.  Ok that's pushing it, but you get my point P<br>
<br>
PS - thnx to Soldaris, 51 Wiz, who had the cahunas to port me up to a raidless hate, after a lvl 60 Wiz refused, calling me a nutcase.<br>

I'm eteranlly amazed at some of the people who can make level 60.<br>
<br>
Nice guide, Slyy - that's the same route I posted for the original Ragebringer spoiler. I'm just going to add one or two things:<br>
When on the fountain, you are safe from any of the wanderers...take a pause there to check no Lichs are near the stretch between you and the Maestro's house.<br>
Always pass behind all mobs just to insure they don't see you (very rarely a mob that normally can't see you, may see you)<br>
Stick to the inside edge of the ramp up in the Maestro's house - it is possible to aggro a North Patrol Lich from that ramp allthough rare.<br>
<br>
All this should be standard stuff for most rogues who had done many a Hate raid before the epic quests came along, but in these days of level60 Hate pullers etc, how many rogues get good experience of scouting hate etc. Shame. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubruke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bruke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/01 1:17:46 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your Book of Souls - solo</span><hr size=1> Glad to finally see some other rogues doing this the cool way.....sounds like your doing a heist not a raid to walk up and grab something after you clear all the mobs which is im sure closer to what kendrick had in mind for this part.<br>
<br>
Not saying the other way is &quot;wrong&quot; but come on we have the best quest in the game it is the most thought out and actually uses some rogue skills.  Unless i am wrong you dont see the rangers haveing to use a bow to get their epic the closest i know of is enchanters haveing to charm certain mobs and give them a stone to get a dif stone back which sounds real exciting and blood pounding but id still rather our quest where you have to pickpocket not one but 2 guild masters of your craft with a very real chance of dying if you fail, sneaking into a place and stealing the loot without getting caught, tricking the general into spawning so you can kill him.....or double cross stanos kill him spawn the general and get a mask its just so roguish that i feel sorry for other classes.  Yes our quest is easier then some others but its the one thing we can do in game that doesnt require a group + to do any of it.  Only thing that could have been better was to require a no drop poison to be made that needed like 150 skill in make poison and maybe some pottery.<br>

I actually found the Lizard Blood potion the easiest to get and it's instant.  It saved my butt in Hate on my first attempt to get the book solo.<br>
<br>
FYI:  I had to keep logging in to Hate to check on book (about every 2 hours).  I camped up on the ramp right by Maestro's house.  I just made sure I was high enough to not agro the two wandering Liches that were pathing below but low enough to not agro anything on the second floor.  <br>
I logged in 3 times and each time I also proc'd the mask so I could see better.  Never got an agro.<br>
Then you just watch the Liches pathing below you and wait for a window in the pathing to jump off the ramp towards Maestro's house.<br>
<br>
Worked better than my first attempt when I would camp on the West wall.  Lich pathing is harder to avoid coming from that direction and, the third time I logged in, I ended up agro'ing another see invis mob that brought the whole damn area at me, lol.  Good thing lizard potion is instant.<br>
The only good thing about having done the West wall experiment first is that I learned more about Hate pathing in that area than I had known before and it was a rush be sneaking between houses with a full spawn around you.  <br>

Most rogues should already have the pottery skill to do it, I am guessing.<br>
As far as a casting time on the Thurg potion - is there really a casting time?  Can it be interrupted then?  If not, well heck this is as good as the cap I reckon - insta-port will save you some XP if you get in trouble.<br>
<br>
I think I will always prefer the cap anyway, though, because ending up in commons is a bit more convenient, usually - at least for me.  Also, the difficulty of attaining an aligator skin for the cap is terribly exaggerated - and that is the ONLY difficult part of the quest.  Most time I ever camped the skin was one hour, ever since I discovered that the bull aligator by the tower seems to have it about 1 in 6 or so spawns (once, I strolled in there an he had it first kill.)  In running through Innothule on the way to Guk, I have often heard lvl 20ish people begging for a skin in auction or in shout.  I always send them a tell, telling them where to hang out, and on more than one occasion I have gotten a tell back within and hour, saying, &quot;OMG thnx! I got my skin!&quot;  Whatever you do for this skin do NOT go running all around the swamp killing stuff trying to get bulls to spawn, it is a pointless endeavor.<br>

<br>
1) Duel someone to create a corpse for you and your wizard(want to go up naked anyway).<br>
<br>
2) Have a cleric friend target the wizard corpse.<br>
<br>
3) Wizard ports you up and cleric instantly revives the wizard (you can time the wizard zoning if you really want to be safe and the cleric can start a few seconds before he zones in).<br>
<br>
4) You sneak to Maestro's room and grab your book.<br>
<br>
5) Cleric revives you out.<br>
<br>
I assume the 10 minute timer on dueled corpses stills stands so you only have time for the wizard to med up for the one port.  Unless you have an enchanter for clarity or a necro to feed him.  This insures the most safety for the rogue and wizard.<br>
<br>

<br>
note - why on earth would a rogue EVER use invisi in hate? I have been to hate um lets see like 500 times and never once have i NOT been able to hit sneak hide before getting aggro.  Hide/sneak also being both invisi AND invisi undead are FAR superior to any invisi potion.<br>
<br>
note2 - i really dont think you would have time to zone in run across hate sneak up and get the book and still be revived out.  I mean sure it may be possible but would it not suck a$$ if you had to wait for a few roaming liches finally get up there pause a second look see the book and BAM res at the last second heh thanks but id leave a xp corpse and fix that prob.<br>
<br>
note3 - if you dont have gate potion just wait for a raid to come rescue you or the wiz can stay on the safewall.  I have seen many a wizard that has no prob doing this.  Also if you can talk a high lvl necro with a circlet of shadow into going up with you he can drag res the wiz <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uceylin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceylin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/01 11:38:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your Book of Souls - solo</span><hr size=1> The roamers don't pick up the book anymore?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's been a while and thinking about doing the high elf mask quest... or at least think I could be able too~. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uparved.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Parved</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.edslovacekcpa.com/jay/sig_dot.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/01 12:33:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your Book of Souls - solo</span><hr size=1> Had to bump this, awsome way to get your book solo.<br>

I really like the idea of that program that lets you choose which zone the Tutorial starts you out in.  I would *love* to be able to use this to familiarize myself with the Planes, among other zones, but I'm really concerned about getting my account cancelled for altering my files.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=2170.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=2170.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=2170.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=2170.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=2170.topic&start=101&stop=109>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3448.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3459.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=2170.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=2170.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2170.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2170.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
