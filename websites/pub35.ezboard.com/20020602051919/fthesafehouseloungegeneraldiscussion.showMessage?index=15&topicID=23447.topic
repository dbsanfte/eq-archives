<br>
Some HP buffs will leave you &quot;wounded&quot; after they are cast, such as the shielding line for casters (or Dain hammer click.)<br>
Other HP buffs will &quot;fill in&quot; those gained HP, such as the cleric line of hero, reso, etc... this set of buffs can actually be used for healing since refreshing them adds the HP back each time.<br>
<br>
It's that first set, from my observations, that causes the problem. Any time you zone with damage into those HP you appear to lose all buffs. As a ranger, this buff loss problem never once happened to me proir to the addition of the &quot;Strength of Nature&quot; spell being added. Those 75hp fall into that first catagory, and I've noticed this buff loss issue happen when zoning that low.<br>
<br>
I disagree with the &quot;the mob hit you after the LOADING PLEASE WAIT thus resulting in your death&quot; theory. I've had it happen without any mobs around, simply being ported after having manastoned too far.<br>
<br>
To test, duel someone while standing next to a zone line... Let them get you down to single digit hp, then zone. Do this once totally unbuffed (in terms of added hp.. use SoW, resist whatever, haste, etc to know if any buffs were lost.)  Do this a second time with a shielding style spell as a HP buff (and toss on a few &quot;junk buffs&quot; so you can see if you lost everything.) Repeat again with a second catagory buff (reso, hero, skin like anything-but-wood.)  To verify is +hp gear factors in, can repeat this test with and without +hp gear.<br>
<br>
(skin like wood falls into first group, a shielding style buff... i suppose it was &quot;too good&quot; of a heal for lower characters.)<br>
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't totally rule out +hp gear, but leveling my monk I never noticed it occur and I'd had probably 200-250hp in items. (+stam might be the problem though)<br>

<br>
the game strips you of all your equipment when you zone, then build it back up again on the other side.<br>
<br>
Suppose you have<br>
1000hp base<br>
100hp from equipment bonuses<br>
<br>
You zone with 150hp.  <br>
The game strips your equipment and their bonuses.  <br>
You zone naked with 50hp safely.  <br>
The game builds your gear back up, and you end up on other side with 150hp, untouched.<br>
<br>
You zone with 50hp.  <br>
The game strips your equipment and their bonuses.<br>
You zone naked with -50hp.<br>
You die while zoning, and lose all buffs.<br>
As a design feature to prevent people coming up as a corpse after zoning, the game adjusts your hp so it's +ve and you don't die.<br>
The game builds your gear back up, and you end up on other side with some amount of hp left, but your buffs were lost from dying.<br>
<br>
just my guess.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uabsolutemaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Absolute Master</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/25/02 9:39:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23447.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://stuwww.kub.nl/~s338419/everquest/gohan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loosing buffs when you zone low on life - TEST + HYPOTHE</span><hr size=1> The no buffs thing can actually be used to your advantage.

Features are not always put there on purpose, nor are bugs.<br>
Regardless... &lt;Fill in what ever you want to call it&gt; was put there on purpose.<br>

If they removed it from the game, you'd be dieing a lot more.  Which would you rather have? Dieing or Still being alive w/o buffs?<br>
<br>
Granted, the original code needs to be re-done so that the game actually recognizes that you are indeed alive w/o stripping your buffs.  But I'll take the work around, since it rarely happens.  There's more important things in the game that need to be fixed, besides zoneing code. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=23447.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=23447.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23447.topic&index=25><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=23447.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=23447.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23447.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23447.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
