It was then, that I noticed I'd received Putrid Breath, or some other spell, that prevented me from regaining hp. So I lay on the ground for 10 minutes or so, while my group asked where I was, and I couldn't reply, nor die. <br>

With enchanter: Was once knocked unconscious, but "regained concentration" and got gate off. Also, lots of "moved to zone safe spot" while zoning and near death. <br>

Well, with that I ran off to train multiple gnolls on myself.  It worked, and I watched in glee as each gnoll was burned for 25 points of damage when they hit me.  My hp was going down as well, but I wasn't worried; there was only a burly gnoll left.  Well, it hit me several times, got burned several times, and kept at it.  Suddenly, I fell to the ground, unconscious.  I was bleeding to death!!!  I was down to about one bubble in the purple, when that gnoll bashed me for one point of damage.  <br>

I can't remember if it was a multiple pull or what, but our fight got nasty, and we both ended up running for the zone with a pixel or so of health left. We had both been poisoned in the course of the fight, so the first thing that happened was both us being knocked unconscious right after zoning... then watching our health slowly tick away as the poison worked.<br>
<br>
Then, with less than a purple bubble left, his poison broke and he regained consciousness and I followed him back to the land of the living soon after. <br>

The other time I was soloing in crushbone (level 9 or so) and I came upon a weaken lego.

<br>
I was lvl36, grouped with a lvl35 rogue. We were killing clockworks, the foreman, and the pred in sol a. I tanked 100% of the time because of my ability to heal myself, and evade. I did all of the pulling, of course.<br>
<br>
Eventually I decided to check on the goblin bartender, since when we met I had been soloing the bar area (it's great for 1 person, but it doesn't support two people 35+)<br>
<br>
I ran in, and the bartender wasn't up. But the drunkard was. He was green, and his common drop is *very* nice, so I decided 'What the hell?' and pulled him from his spawn point, to the secret hallway behind the foreman.<br>
<br>
Anyone who knows sol a knows that there's about 15 goblins between the two places :)<br>
<br>
I ended up at 1 bubble when the pull was over. My partner said that he would tank it while I bandaged up, since the drunkard was green to both of us.<br>
<br>
His pet, his 150+ dmg nukes, and his 15pt dmg shield made us realize the errors of our ways. I called for us to zone, but it took too long for us to get going.<br>
<br>
We burst through the secret wall, 5 seconds from the zone.<br>
<br>
A young goblin backstabs YOU for 110 points of dmg<br>
A fire goblin hits YOU for 63 points of dmg.<br>
You are unconcious!<br>
<br>
At this point, I stared down at my body in shock, unable to believe that I was about to die.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the drunkard+pet, and the 3 goblins in the room LEFT ME ALONE! In about 1 second, I regenned a single hp and feigned.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, when the goblins decided to leave me alone, they went for my partner and cut him down 2 seconds from the solb zone.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know why they went after him instead of killing me, since when you get really low on hp, even lvl1 mobs will aggro on you.<br>
<br>
He got a lvl56 rez, though :)<br>
<br>
For anyone who knows the drunkard's common drop (which he had, since he wasn't wielding the staff), you will understand the irony of what happened. :( <p><font size="2"><font color="ashen"><center>

<br>
30th level hunting in CT still trying to get my damned RS arms. Running around in the CY helping out the lowbie groups while I'm waiting for some friends. Someone shouts train so I get myself set up to derail it. Low and behold theres the AOF and all his cronies. I'm hidden at the time so I figure, what the hell, I can't take em all down, but this is my first chance to get a poke or two in on AOF. So I sneak up to the zone and wait a bit for a good opportunity and WHAM, backstab the sob, he turns, stupidly I stand there to see what kind of melee he can do. Takes me down to half right quick so I dash out the zone. Loading please wait.,... Get to feerrott and start laughing my ass off. At the same time someone was training AOF inside, someone else was training Bouncer Hurd outside!!! HAHAHAH I look around and theres this HUGE pile of bodies of all these poor fools who had run from AOF only to get smashed by Hurd. I get hit a few times and manage to zone again. Get back into CT, got about a bub of health now, AOF still there, he hates me (go figure) and lays into me again. Get hit a couple and zone again. Back in feerrott, 25 hp left, zone before hurd hits me, (he's still there). End up zoning 7 times to evade the bastards. Finally its over, I got 12 hp left, counted 37 bodies between the 2 sides of the zone line that night.<br>

I kill it and have the 5 or so frogs spawned in the disco tunnel beating on me, I hit defensive and go running back for my group screaming, I got nocked unconcious with 5 frogs beating on me just as my CH kicked in, that was fun... <br>
<br>
Also way back before Kunark (february 2000) fighting in MM (long before they put in the code of a max of 3 mobs beating on you) I died with around neg 1500 hp. Nuked 7 times, was getting beat on by about 20 other DE's, and HT'ed by the SK for the soulfire, it really hurt... <p><font face="arial">Lousy chanters...

A couple stories to add...<br>
<br>
My girlfriend (cleric) got pummeled by a frenzied griffon in eastern wastes.  I had a CH'ing missionary on my hands along with a dire wolf.<br>
<br>
She fell to the ground just as I killed the griffon with Dimentia.  She had cast Superior heal on herself, got interrupted, fell to the ground and was bleading to death.  She was at 2 purple bubbles when she regained concentration and healed herself while laying on the ground!  I've never seen this happen in 2 years of play.  This happened 2 months ago or so.<br>
<br>
A second time a level 2 enchantress was fighting outside Felwithe.  I had an eye on her as I have a soft spot for newbie enchanters (until I find them wearing a siren scale anyways).<br>
<br>
She, of course, met an angry Orc Pawn that was quickly slain by the guards as she trained them.  The Orc though did get his wacks in and dropped her unconscious to the ground.  Playing an enchanter at the time, I could only try to save her life by using bandaids.  I applied one bandage to her as she lay on the ground and next thing, POP!  She stands up and is completly healed =)<br>
<br>
My eyes watered I was laughing so hard...<br>

Well after a few mishaps and a small misunderstanding with a minotaur I was able to get to the ass room. Well after waiting around a bit I was able to get my mask and started to sneak out. I jumped into the water by the bed room and took sneak off to get up the ledge. Well sadly their were a few undead froglocks who didnt like my sense of fashion I geuss who and decided to attack. Well they had to jump in the water and swim across to get me so I had a bit of a lead and decided to run. Well wouldnt you know it but the words "OMFG TRAIN!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!!!" flash across my screen. Well I thought I'd be fine but the train came from the other direction and I ran right through it. Turning around the corner to get to the zone I was attacked by a sonic bat, which slowed me down enough for the Undead froglocks to catch up to me. Well I made one final dash for the zone as I watcheed my health steadily drop down...until I jump for the zone...and I get rooted. I try and jump suspecting it would be futile but as luck would have it the froglock knocked me across the zone line! I zoned through and was rooted right at the line with a meager 14hp left to spare. A single more hit and I would have been toast. <p><img src=http://home.pacbell.net/dsantos/babykick.gif>The sexy kung fu baby.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=liron>Liron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/01 1:14:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Close, but no luck for him...</span><hr size=1> http://www.geocities.com/vsanthos/neardeath.jpg<br>

Was in LOIO, and the damned goblin had me down a couple times before I whacked him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukarak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/01 3:25:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Close, but no luck for him...</span><hr size=1> I can think of two decent times I've been CH'd while unconscious recently.<br>
<br>
The first time I was level 56, pulling in the crypt area in sebilis.  Well, the cleric's aegolism wore off just as I ate two tasty harm touches from a couple krup ghoul knights.  Needless to say, I arrived at the party's feet at well under a bubble of health, and the cleric had the audacity to begin casting 'complete heal.'<br>
<br>
Thinking quickly, i hit /disc nimble, but I'd spent that discipline in an encounter involving a few skeletal guards in front of the emperor, so I knew I was dead.  My pull comes to the party, and the enchanter gets a good ae stun off, buying the CH another second or three; but one krup woke up while she was busy mezzing the other one, and he promptly knocked me unconscious with one hit.<br>
<br>
Four hits later, as the frog swings, I had managed to riposte, dodge, and get missed twice, and the cleric's CH went off.<br>
<br>
The second time was in an AE group.  There is one thing about AE groups that you must know if you've never been in one.  The puller must have a deathwish; I have found no upper limit on the number of targets that can be AE stun/PBae'd to death at once, excepting the usual resists.  And I really did try.  On one pull, I managed to get absolutely every frog in a straight line path between the disco room and the bar room, with one quick detour into the exit to collect some golems, simultaneously. <br>
<br>
Naturally, when I get back to the group with half of sebilis on my heels, the Cleric (the SAME cleric as the previous crypt group) decides now's a good time to Make the Rogue Sweat (tm).  You guessed it; twenty or so frogs, four golems, and a pox scarab having me for lunch simultaneously, and I get the complete heal.  I did go unconscious first.  Amazingly, I survived, and so did the enchanter 11 seconds later when it was his turn for the HP bar to go purple.<br>
