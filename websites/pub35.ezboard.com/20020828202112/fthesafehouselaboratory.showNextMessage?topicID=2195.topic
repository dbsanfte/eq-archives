Results aren't good.  I have 250 make and 200 apply poison.  Every time I get a poison to land on them it only lasts for a few seconds before wearing off, even if it has a 3 min duration.  Tests were with paralyze 3 and dizzy 4 on sontalak, yelinak, aaryonar, derekor the vindicator, statue of rallos zek and cazic thule.  Cazic resists everything I throw at him so that's pretty straight forward, sucks.  Even though I've been told CT can be slowed by us he's resisted all of about 20 paralyze 3's, all after malo.  On the rest of the mobs I listed, poison sticks though.  I've personally slowed them all and even though it's supposed to last 102 seconds it only lasts for about 3-5 seconds, no dispells or other debuffs cast that would cancel it.  I've used dizzy 4 on sontalak and yelinak.  Funny thing happened on sont, it said my spell didn't take hold.  No other debuffs cast on him that would block it.  It took hold on yelinak but again lasted only 3 seconds.  Testing on pc's, I used paralyze 1 on a 60 pally in guild and supposed to last 42 seconds, lasted 3 seconds.  Used paralyze 3 on a 60 war in guild and it lasted around the full 102 seconds, didnt' track time on that one but lasted a while.  Used dizzy 4 on a 60 ranger in guild and it lasted the full 3 min duration exactly.  The ranger lowered his pr really low for the test, the others were at normal pr levels.  I've been speculating that they made rogue poisons get checked for resist every few seconds and not just the initial proc.  This really blows for us and I think we should speak up about this and find out what is really going on. <p>Crillan Kidneypoker<BR>60 Human Rogue of Valon<BR>Terris Thule</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umorchaint.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morchaint</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/01 9:49:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2005.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poison duration on npc's</span><hr size=1> I have a feeling that our poisons check for resists every 'tick'. I've used snare poisons on glimmer drakes in ToV and while the poison will land, it never lasts anywhere near the full duration, so it's not a reliable snare in the least. (Usually it just delays the mob a bit so it can't run *quite* as far). Is it possible that we have the durations wrong? Either that or big mobs all carry cure poison potions on them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>If a resistance check MUST be made for 'balance' reasons, the mob should have a severe penalty once the poison has taken hold and higher level poisons should be harder to resist. This would give some kind of incentive to work up past a skill of 30. After all, a harder to make poison should be more toxic.<br><br>Morchaint Poisonblade<br>&lt;Looking Glass&gt;<br>Ayonae Ro <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucrillan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crillan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/13/01 5:05:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2005.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0MgAAABIRF7ddMGbLmK6nXDlaCTN5Byei0osLS85Q8l!O0SN3*berQl1ZGEhJaytdp7Wd!OoQjIOmRaXFEJ1dYg/sig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poison duration on npc's</span><hr size=1> The effects and durations are taken straight from the spdat file so they are correct. <p>Crillan Kidneypoker<BR>60 Human Rogue of Valon<BR>Terris Thule</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uorthaanc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orthaanc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/01 6:47:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2005.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poison duration on npc's</span><hr size=1> Haven't multiple Verant employees commented on how the spdat file may not be completely correct?<br><br>just wondering<br>Orthaanc<br>lvl38 Wood Elf Rogue Rodcet Nife <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucrillan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crillan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/01 11:27:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2005.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0MgAAABIRF7ddMGbLmK6nXDlaCTN5Byei0osLS85Q8l!O0SN3*berQl1ZGEhJaytdp7Wd!OoQjIOmRaXFEJ1dYg/sig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poison duration on npc's</span><hr size=1> Considering that I've tested them in a controlled environment on PC's and they've done exactly what the spdat says, I'd say it's right.

That seems pretty ridiculous to me, and unacceptable.  Think of it from a RL perspective:  if someone poisons me with arsenic and it's a significant enough dose to affect me, I'm not suddenly going to 'get better' 6 seconds later for no apparent reason.  It would be a little more understandable that a huge mystical creature like a dragon could purge its system of the poison, but this happens with every mob.  Don't tell me some retarded werewolf on steroids guarding ol VS should be able to purge its system of dire poisons on command.. that is ridiculous.<br><br>Also, AA skill poison mastery should, imo, make poisons that the player with this skill makes either last 150% as long, or be 150% more effective while they do last.  (decision as to which one needs to be made, not either effect randomly) This would make this skill much more desirable and be more in line with having to spend that many AA pts to get.  Right now it's a joke imo.<br><br>I really like the clues that I've seen that poison might be made into a 'proc-buff'.  Then it would be worth using.

Hell, I believe since Rogues are not exactly meant to fight a mob head-on, the intentions for poisons are either to escape alive or to catch a mob off guard with it so that its death is possible.<br><br>However, the problems that I've seen with poisons have been either duration, resists, and/or the application factor.  There are NO SET FACTORS that determine what will insure full duration of the poison.  I've heard that the Apply Poison skill is supposed to be the determinin' factor in whether a poison lands at full duration or not.  Verant nor anyone else in the EQ staff has determined this to be true, so we can only assume that it's merely for the success/failure of the poison coatin' the weapon.<br><br>This makes the world of poisonin' unreliable and very sporadic, causin' many Rogues to rely solely on damage distribution.  If the tick check continues, there's no way to determine how long the poison duration is supposed to be with certain mobs.  Why bother usin' them if a poison like Lethargic Bliss (Snare for 5secs a tick with each tick per level you are) when it isn't gonna last?  Same for any DoT.  The only &quot;fullproof&quot; poison seems to be the DD ones and there's a 50/50 chance for that.  You either hit or don't, haven't seen any partial damage for that.<br><br>If that isn't worse, there's the Apply Poison factor.  It's a joke to work.  I've been fail free since 80 and apparently you can apply poison with a skill of 80 for a poison that's gonna take 200+ to make.  I'm not a genius or anythin' but wouldn't it be harder to poison a weapon with a poison that's very hard and thus very toxic?  Plus, Poison Mastery is goin' to serious waste.  See, it takes you a lot of points to get to Poison Mastery 3, the epitome of poison application with applies takin' 2.5-3 seconds, and yet, you have to SIT?  I don't think it takes sittin' to apply, whatever.  But I firmly believe that at Poison Mastery 3 you should be able to apply by just standin'.  That would make it SOMEWHAT worthwhile at this current state.<br><br>Thin's they can do to make poisonin' better?  Well the first is removin' the tick situation.  What they should do is perform one check that will take place durin' half the poison's duration or somethin'.  And they should make the resist take place with REALLY high poisonin'.  I think it's rather messed up that someone with 50 resist and is a few levels lower than me can resist my poison and hit me full flush with a spell e'en though I have 100+ MR.<br><br>Another thin', make Apply Poison a factor.  Sometimes I think the resists and the short durations stem from the fact that I haven't coated it enough.  Might start applyin' 2 doses of the same poison just to be certain.  There was a game that determined whether poisons would hit or not based on the application skill.  The equation was poisoned food or drinks were equal to the percent of the skill.  Like if my poisonin' was at 70, then I had a 70% chance of success.  Poisoned weapons had a 1/4 chance of that percentage.  So if I was a 100% poisoner, my weapon had 25% chance of landin'.  Now that would be a bit ridiculous with the poison-buff thin's goin' on, but sometihin' similar that would increase it to a 5% chance when maxed out and a 10% chance per hit with Poison Mastery, it would be lovely.<br><br>And one more thin', poison is supposed to be subtle and a gradual decrease in the person's life.  It disturbs me when I see a poisoned mob jump at me the moment I poison it when it's my first touch.<br><br>Ishkur Leroux<br>&quot;The True Meanin' of Poisonin' is still missin'.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showPrevMessage?topicID=2005.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showNextMessage?topicID=2005.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2005.topic&index=11><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.emailToFriend?topicID=2005.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.threadControl?topicID=2005.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2005.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2005.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory>Laboratory</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
