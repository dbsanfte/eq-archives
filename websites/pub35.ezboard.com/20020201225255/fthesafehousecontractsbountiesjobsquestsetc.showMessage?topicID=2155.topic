Summary here:<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> impatiens<br>Station Member   posted 03-18-2001 02:14 AM            <br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I have just finished reading aradune's (Brad McQuaid's) thread and saw this little tidbit:<br>BEGIN QUOTE<br>We've not only responded to this, I'm even pretty sure it's in the FAQ. The answer is, no one can agree on what an 'RP' server would be, or what we'd enforce or change to make it (or EQ in general) more of an RP game. I can tell you what I'd do to make EQ more of an RP game, but I'm sure many of you would respond quite negatively to my ideas.<br><br>But, hey, here are just a few:<br><br>1. Implement Trivial Combat code everywhere<br>2. Eliminate the common tongue<br>3. Allow only one character per server<br>4. Disallow Paladins grouping with Shadow Knights, etc.<br>5. Make it so evil races cannot communicate with good, and vice versa.<br><br>Anyway, those are just off the top of my head. Those would make EQ more of a role-playing game in my opinion. But I bet a lot of people will really disagree with me, and of course I need to type in a big disclaimer here: these are just my opinions and are NOT changes coming to an EQ near you.<br><br>END QUOTE<br><br>All I can write is, make it so!<br><br>I would love a -new- server that had these restrictions, especially if the language restrictions applied to npc's. There should also be some minor faction changes depending on how fluently the character addressed the npc in the npc's native tongue. <br><br>Also, off the top of my head, maybe implement a common tongue for each continent. Thus, the dwarves and the elves can speak to each other, but not the trolls and the gnomes.<br><br>I would emigrate or start a new main character on such a server in a heartbeat.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->And now, Aradune's (Brad's) response.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;1. Implement Trivial Combat code everywhere&quot;<br>&quot;What the heck does this have to do with Roleplay? Yes, if you re-configured the loot tables for the whole game it *might* work, but it has absolutely nothing to do with roleplaying. No role-playing game ever had the loot &quot;disapear&quot; if the person who killed it was too poweful.&quot;<br><br>See, people disagree on what RP is, and isn't.<br><br>In any case, I'll explain why I think removing bottom feeding has a LOT to do with RP. When I'm in a dungeon adventuring and I encounter farmers and other characters too high level, it abruptly and forcefully removes me from suspension of disbelief -- it severely damagers the immersiveness of the game. And I think that's directly tied to RP, just as some guy using d00d speak hurts an RP environment, or seeing a Troll ally with a Paladin.<br><br>In D&amp;D, it just wouldn't be allowed. No DM worth his salt would allow a group of level 8 players to slaughter through a level 2 module... and even worse, to allow another low level group in the module simultaneously.<br><br>Or how about from fantasy literature... how 'RP' would it have been if, as the hobbits were fighting against goblins and wolves, they rounded a bend in the forest to find a group of Valar slaugtering the evil denziens with blinks of their eyes?<br><br>&quot;4. Disallow Paladins grouping with Shadow Knights, etc.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well there are some RP +S and -s to this. For one thing, clerics are both good and evil, why not paladins? The 'sks are anti-paladins' are ok I guess, but the point is, if the @#%$ allows clerics to heal - why wouldn't he have his own &quot;paladin-type&quot; of healing warriors? Also, some gods seem to be neutral (they have both good and evil followers), I'm not sure its paladins wouldn't be &quot;ok&quot; with grouping with SKs. Overall its an ok idea though.&quot;<br><br>The paladin/sk bit was just an example... I'd also apply it to clerics who follow opposing gods, etc.<br><br><br>&quot;Your opinion Mr.Programer is yours, no doubt about it. If they are/were well thought out and prepared for I would like those changes, but several of them have nothing to do with &quot;role-playing&quot;. Don't kid yourself.&quot;<br><br>I disagree, and I think that even though we disagree, both of our opinions are valid, and neither of us are 'kidding' ourselves.<br><br>By the way, I'll hereby slightly adjust our opinion as it relates to an RP server...<br><br>Now that we have so many servers, perhaps it wouldn't be so dangerous to set up a server with a slightly different ruleset and call it an RP server... even though many, many would disagree with the ruleset (whether it was fair, or truly RP, or whatever), there are perhaps enough people now who play this game that we could fill the server...<br><br>Anyway, just some thoughts... We'll think on it.<br><br>-Brad<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I can't say if it'll work out in the form he's talking about.  Not sure about some of those ideas.  But considering how much Verant has reversed itself of late - changing around a formerly 'frozen' xp system, giving wizards IU, mages DoTs, and too many other things to name, perhaps there's a proverbial snowball's chance for this to happen too.  I would surely give it a try.<br><br>Only problems I see:<br>1) The trivial combat thing would eliminate pharming.  But I can be sure that you'd pay the price somewhere along the line.  Now, if you want to do a quest that involves killing a green mob... you're screwed!  You have to find someone else to kill the mob!<br><br>2) Crowding.  When people hear about this server, it will be JAM PACKED.  Any rules change like that would cause an enormous influx of people who only have a faint idea what RP is.  Maybe some would leave, but many would stay even if not RPers, because they're tired of pharmers.<br><br>3) Making totally unbreakable rules about evil and good associating are OK... but I don't have much experience with that, I've never played on a race war server.  Sounds like it would help most of the time, but might still interfere with RP in a lot of instances.  Good and evil are kinda arbitrary.  I guess that's what comes with a D&amp;D-based game, though.<br><br>4) Like that guy later on said, eliminate common, but implement continental common languages, not just racial ones.  Makes sense.  Good would outnumber evil, but evil would have a common language... interesting. <p>Raxee L'Noamuth, 46th season Roguess of Old Fennin</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uraxee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raxee</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 3/19/01 6:33:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uflapjax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flapjax</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/01 4:24:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2155.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/humblebee/eq/quipy.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is there still hope?

Quasi RP server on Flameplay</span><hr size=1> What I meant is that there are still plenty of good (RP) reasons that, say, an SK and a pally actually would group.  Like to defend a common home (Freeport anyone?), to take out a common threat, etc.  In the end, I think that even the suggested setup would be for the better, and it would be beat the current setup of absolutely no rules at all - but I'd really like to see a better idea.<br><br>The current Good vs. Evil thing is so utterly simplistic that it's almost juvenile.  Yes, there's some mature content, but for the most part Everquest is PG-rated.  Hence, going for the lowest common denominator (as must be done in any successful MMO game, IMO) means going for the easiest definition.  So I doubt it'll change.<br><br>But the race war servers bring up a good point - if a dwarf can fight at the side of a high elf, is it *that* much of a stretch to have them fighting at the side of anyone else?  Of course, letting this happen more or less opens a floodgate, and soon you have people of all kinds grouping up regardless of alignment - e.g. what we have now.<br><br>It's kind of a kuldge, but one I could live with.  I'd really like to see a somewhat more mature definition of alignments than good and evil.  Even law vs. chaos was in D&D, and while it, too, isn't perfect, it's a lot more accurate than the former.  But this is EQ and good vs. evil is built right into the game; oh well.  I guess I'm hoping for too much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/01 7:05:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2155.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is there still hope?

A lvl 1 could walk around that cave without being afraid she would die.<br><br>Personally I would also choose such a new server for those changes over the fact it would be called Roleplaying. To get a real roleplaying server many more changes have to be made, pvp-unconsious, pvp-kill, quest redesigns, remove camp spots, more diety items and diety based spells (you could not heal some people with contradict diety), player consider system (paladin considering a shadow knight would get 'aggressive'-con), alignment system with penalties for not following you alignment (a paladin gone bad would lose it's spells etc.), more all/all cloths items flagpoles horses carts etc,etc,etc,...<br><br>Ofcourse you can roleplay everywhere and in any game, but it is the encouragement that is needed to have more and more people roleplay and have it as the only playstyle on a server. When a RP server will come, their should also come a Race Server, a Kewl Dude Server, a Hardcore Server, etc, for all the playstyles.<br><br> <p>----<BR>    <b><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=2550">Kendolin Spiderbite</A></b><br>    <i>"Keep your cloths, I have enough already!"</i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukarlek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karlek</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/21/01 6:25:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2155.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.main-rheiner.de/homepage/julius.makanec/karl/skarsaur12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is there still hope?

Grrr...."<br><br>Similar thingies were implemented in UO, and that was FUN!<br><br>UO anecdote: I remember when we got attacked by vile murderer (sorta standing of a player, denoted red for this) that quickly dispatched our overloaded, tired, unarmed miner characters (one used to mine rare secretive colored ore strains in remote caves). Then my ghost followed him through the portal he created and watched where he hauled the piles of our precious, stolen ore. Next we got 4-5 friends, layed an ambush and killed the guy even on the stairs of his home so he had no time to lock it - we could plunder back all his possesions. He was still whining as to how he lost 15% of his battle stats - which was the penalty for a vile murderer once he got PvP executed. Still, evil players were accepting this risk and punishment for the fear and benefits of their 'profession'.<br><br>To reach the balance here, is extremely tuff.<br>But the game engine of EQ is all set in place and it takes just a little imagination, creativity and will to do it.

Quasi RP server on Flameplay</span><hr size=1> RP elitists don't last long.  They tend to sneer and whatnot at the people who do anything other than RP, you know, the ones who do stuff like hunt, gain levels, and occasionally trade, etc.  However, they soon 'grow frustrated' and 'quit due to a game that claims to be a role-playing game, but simply doesn't support it'.  And so on.<br><br>Even on an RP server there will be lots of non-RP stuff.  But that's EQ.  RP is one aspect of it, one you can ignore.<br><br>The reason I'm looking forward to it is I know lots of people with RP potential will come to this server.  Even if lots of people come because they don't like farming, lots of true newbies show up - the server will be green and all - and what have you, there still will be a larger number of RPers than before.<br><br>Coordinating such an enormous RP community is a task I do not envy anyone.  With that large a potential number of RPers, there's quite a possibility of total chaos, nobody knowing what everyone else is doing or wants.  But I'm sure it would work out, somehow, if people are willing to try it out.  There are plenty of potential solutions.<br><br>I've been in a fair-sized EQ RP community for a while.  We've had elitists, we've had bad RPers, we've had RPers that take WAAAAY too many liberties in the GM-less RP system EQ uses, we've had ones that I vehemently dislike in an OOC context, we've had ones whom everybody hated both in and out of character, and all that.  But it's still been good.<br><br>The aggregate still works out for the best.  The large number of RPers who stick around are responsible enough to enjoy the game and let others do it too.  The rest do one of two things; either they quit RP entirely (and blame something like the game or other RPers) or they join a guild of like players.  Just avoid said guild in the second case.<br><br>Of course, this is all pending that this server actually comes into existence.  It may not happen.  Brad only said they were considering it. <p>Raxee L'Noamuth, 46th season Roguess of Old Fennin</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umildaene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mildaene</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.multimania.com/mildaene/whiterose2.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/01 4:00:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2155.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.multimania.com/mildaene/rose.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is there still hope?
