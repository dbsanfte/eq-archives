<br>
Our group rotates games every month.<br>
<br>
Played just about every RPG out there.<br>
<br>
If you are talking 3rd edition d&amp;d I am running a game so got no characters myself, but three guys playing have a cleric (they got a HUGE upgrade in third edition), a rogue (they did them nicely as well IMO) and a monk (spell resists...neat)<br>
<br>
They also have a barbarian they can use sort of like a figurine of wondrous power cause otherwise theyd be screwed.<br>

Stephen, Half-elf: 21 fighter, 26 cleric. Retired quite a while ago. Played him since level 1. (GM didn't have class / race restrictions and ran a really good dual / multi class system.)<br>
<br>
3rd Ed:<br>
Ardeth Bey, 20th level Monk, 8th level Ninja of the Crescent Moon. He was actually supposed to be a semi-priest / temple guardian of Anubis. (Egyptian god of death, not evil, but a protector of souls in the underworld) Still not retired, raised from level 1 in a couple of campaings. My friends would do a sort of round-robin DM'ing, and we'd recycle characters quite a bit. Last campaign was Ravenloft, with a rather sadistic DM that made us fight his version of a vampire god. That specific campaign was rather munchkinish, other characters in the campaign were about my level (19 to 30th or so) and the DM really wasn't clear on my full abilities. Really fun to suprise a DM with creative uses of your abilities instead of the amount of items a character has.<br>
<br>
Oh, two points if anybody can catch my Monk's name reference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujeters.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeters</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/19/02 1:05:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What are your current characters?</span><hr size=1> glip:<br>

I agree with you completely Glip. Whats the fun of playing a character with a manufactured background? You have to build them up to build their story!<br>
<br>
But then at the same time, some people just play to roll dice. We've got a couple at our table like that.<br>

we DO have to submit fully realized 15 or so page backgrounds =/ and as I say, although actually playing from 1 to 18 would rock it would take time than no one has.<br>
<br>
if we realize that being so uber isnt fun, the campaign stops. However, so far people are really loving the freedom to create any character they want--prestige classes etc, as well as the funds to create weapons and armor.<br>

Matt (DM): 50, that means i go first. so Soltare (that's me), you see this pink fluffy bunny hops up to you and blinks. suddenly it lunges for your throat... (rolls d20). does a 157 hit? yes? oh good. take... (rolls a sh*tload of dice) 542 damage and make a save vs. poison, DC 69. <br>
<br>
Spicer (Soltare): drek, didn't even last 5 seconds... oh well, time to make another character!<br>
<br>
hehe, i'm really exaggerating right now, but our DM is a powergamer who had a lvl 8 psion that singlehandedly took out an entire party of 5 lvl 7 - 8 pcs without taking a scratch. not to mention the fact that he managed to toast a lvl 20 wizard in 1 turn... problem was the DMs didn't know what the fek they were doing in that game.. long story. :-/ however, now from watching him play that character, 4 of the players in this new campaign are playing psions. lol. this is going to be interesting...<br>

If you roll under 25%, you get the thing you were rolling for, although in what amount is determined differently. If you make a roll you don't want, you can turn it in to re-roll on a different one.<br>

Basically, there is a standing agreement in our campaign that as long as we don't have psionic characters, the gamemaster wont use psionic adversaries. Except perhaps in rare instances or as plot points.<br>

<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
right now, besides getting ready to play a lvl 18 half-machine barbarian (who thinks he's the Avatar of Kord) in the aforementioned Uber-Campaign my friend is going to run, i'm also getting ready to play... myself... in another friend's Mage: The Ascention game. should be twisted and a real mindfek<br>
<br>
also, I have two characters in two different LARPs (not pen and paper, but i count 'em anyway) - a dark elf rogue who leads a small mercenary company and a raging barbarian warrior that has the small problem of dying repeatedly each event i play him. <br>
<br>
lastly, until recently, i was playing a kickass halfling monk who met his tragic end in a very brutal, awful, evil meat-grinder of a fight at the hands of a construct of the aforementioned twink psion my friend played. bitter much? hellz yes. :<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> out:: hehe, jk.<br>

But the other thing I was thinking was, in the 3rd Ed. GM's guide, it talks somewhere about making higher then 1st level characters, and somewhere in there it tells you how much GP in resources a certain level character should have. That's why 440k gp seemed kinda low. I'm not sure how my monk stacks up to what the GM's guide says he should have at 28th level, but I don't think it's very high at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujeters.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeters</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/22/02 2:37:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What are your current characters?</span><hr size=1> 440k, used for items only:<br>

Githzerai (+1 level)<br>

roll two 18s hopefully, put them in Dex / Wis. +6 dex, +2 wis, -2cha, -2 str. Four ability increases, would put your dex at something like 26, and wis at 22. You'd get three passive psionic powers, usually the ac bonus, the suprise modifyer, and a third that I usually didn't care about too much.<br>
<br>
So basically:<br>
AC = 10 (base) + 2 (class bonus) + 8 (dex bonus) + 6 (wis bonus) + 2 (passive psi bonus) = 28ac, nekkid.<br>
<br>
Plus: You've got permanent +2 magic weapons, a spell resistance of SR:27, immunity to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> poisons, immunity to all non-magic diseases, can slow fall, have a base 70ft movement, can jump higher then you're normally allowed, and you can a) phase through walls, and b) &quot;mend&quot; 34 points of damage a day.<br>
<br>
I don't have the fighter's and monk's book nearby, but you get some kickarsed stuff from being a Ninja, too. If your DM did screw you over on all your items, you'd still have 28ac, +2 magic items, a base attack of +12/+9/+6/+3, and if you took the correct feats, you could trip every other attack, never be tripped yourself, and when an enemy falls, get an additional +12 base attack, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it would be a coup-de-gras.<br>
