I thought I’d share my experience with you since I was involved with the pulling.<br><br>First a few notes about Kithicor.  Kith is a low-level zone during the day 7am-7pm, but become a higher level zone at night when undead spawn all over the place.  Much of the undead was green or light blue to me at 52 though, so if you’re here to kill the General you shouldn’t have any problems keeping the undead at bay.  Just make sure your raid party is aware.<br><br>The way we set up was to have the main raid party at the Crossroads near the stone sign pillar, directly east from the High Hold Pass zone (approx 900, 3200).  This is not very far from the house that contains the General’s cohorts.  It’s important to be close enough that the puller(s) have a chance of surviving long enough to get the mobs back to the main party.<br><br>The target of the raid is a house located at (900,2200).  There are 8 Dark Elves that spawn in this house and they are on an 8 hour real life timer.  If done correctly you can kill 7 of them pretty quickly and have ample time for 10 or more rogues to do their hand in and spawn the general.<br><br>The 8 Dark Elves are of various classes and are between levels 58-60.  It is important that you do not kill ALL of these elves as one of them is required to be living in order for the rogue to do his/her turn in.  The sealed box can be given to any of them and this will spawn the General.  I recommend leaving the Brigadier as the turn in mob since he is not a caster and will make pulling and killing the General much easier.<br><br>My pulling party consisted of 1 level 60 SK, 1 level 54 monk and me (level 52 monk).  We also had a cleric in our group but she stayed with the main party and only ran to heal us if a pull went bad and we had to FD and abort.  FD is a must to pull these and the SK should be as high as possible in order that there is a chance for snare to work.<br><br>Method for single pulling the DEs that are up.<br><br>We set up near the house, both monks FDed and the SK would cast a snare on the targeted mob.  All of the DEs would then agro and run towards him.  The SK would move away from the house as far as possible and FD.  If snare hit, the targeting mob would walk back to the house much slower than the rest.  Once the rest of the DEs are back in the house, a monk stands up and tags the snared mob and pulls back to the main tank at the crossroads.  The second monk will stand up a little time later and trail the mob in case the first monk dies on the pull.  He will then tag the DE and bring to the group.<br><br>Once the mob is back at the party normal guidelines are followed.  Allow the main tank to build up agro, all the druids and shammies will cast heals on the main tank as soon as he engages to reduce agro on the clerics who will be doing a CH cycle.  Main tank calls assist at approximately 90 Percent.  Then it’s crash and bash time.<br><br>This procedure will work for all of the DEs except the general.  Once there is only 1 DE left in the hut, the Brigadier if you followed my advice, the rogue can sneak/hide, do their turn in, hide and run away back to the main group.  As soon as the turn in is done the General will spawn right inside the hut.  We had 5 rogues do the  turn in and none of them agroed the general, they were quick enough on the hide button.<br><br>Note:  Depending on whether it is day or not, there will be ‘guards’ outside the hut.  Zombies, skeletons and ghouls if during the day… Kithicor undead if at night.  It’s important to clear all of this lawn trash before doing the hand in, you do NOT want anything nearby that may agro when the rogue unhide to hand in the box.  Our pulling team just took care of the lawn trash ourselves, normal FD pulling works fine.  This is why having the non-casting Brigadier is important as you may agro him while pulling the lawn trash but he will return to his static point after each FD.<br><br>Now it’s time to pull the general.  He is level 63, has a 500 point aoe and hits hard and fast.  The good part is that he will not return to the house after being agroed like the rest of the DEs will.  The way we did it was for the SK to nail the Brig with some sort of non-dot spell, this will agro both of them.  The SK FDs.  Now it’s just a waiting game, once the Brig returns to the hut, one of the monks stands up, agros the general and runs back to the group.  The second monk is again there in case the first dies.  I was the first pulling monk and of the 5 times we pulled the General, I died 3 of them.  He is a Shadowknight so can fear as well as a big Harm-touch.<br><br>Once the General is back at the main raid party it’s go time.  He cannot be hurt by magic-based spells so you can’t slow him, but with 2 or 3 clerics, a 60 main tank and a lot of supporting melees we handled him pretty well.<br><br>NOTE:  The first time we pulled the general we also pulled the Brigadier by accident, this resulted basically in a wipe out.  The General got killed but we could not kill the Brigadier otherwise no more rogues could do their hand in, so people zoned or died to get him to return to his spawn point.<br><br>I hope this helps.<br> <p><center><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204257"> Sleeman </a> 51 Iksar Drunk Disciple <br><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=301305"> Skoti</a> 52 Gnome Champion<br><br><a href = "http://unseen.wonderhost.com"> Unseen Defenders </a><br>The Rathe<br><b><i>"As God is my witness, I thought Turkeys could fly!"</i></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upikkanmasterdg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PikkanMasterDG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/1/02 9:22:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1022.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to pulling the General in Kithicor</span><hr size=1> With a high enough druid 58+ you can easily harmony the mobs and solo pull them unless you happen to pull a mob thru another which you will get 2. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udalninilvenorsh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalninil Venorsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/1/02 11:23:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1022.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to pulling the General in Kithicor</span><hr size=1> Yep druid harmony nuff said of course I'm all for letting an sk die on snare pulls at least this one had deathpace,  you'd be ammused at what happens if they don't <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uchenkovcalgar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chenkov Calgar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/2/02 12:17:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1022.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to pulling the General in Kithicor</span><hr size=1> To get the General solo without having troubles with the trigger NPC you left over: let the rogue stay hidden somewhere farther away from the hut. Pull the trigger NPC towards the rogue and FD close to him. As soon as the trigger starts walking back, the rogue drops hide (but not sneak) and turns in the trigger to the NPC. I'm not sure if the rogue needs sow to be able to follow the NPC fast enough with sneak on, but sow never hurts anyway...<br>As soon as the General spawns pull him out of the hut, puller should be away and gone with the General way before the trigger NPC arrives at the hut again.
