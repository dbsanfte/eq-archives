I can tell you that most Mobs when your doing the first on the server..   are done by one way and one way alone..  Trial and Error..    you go.. you die..  you come back the next night and try not to @#%$ up the same way..  I can say many of my guilds best victories were done this way..   Zlandicar, Velkator, Dain, Tormax, Yelniak, Vyemm, AoW, High Priest of Ssra, Shei Vitras, Emp Ssra..  at each one we, just like guilds across eq had time invested and kept showing up until we found a way to win.<br>
<br>
If you sit around waiting for spoilers and strats to be handed out to you on a silver platter..    your gonna be waiting around till targets are just about passe'.   Farmers go after the safe target..  the one they KNOW they can kill..  not the one where they have a better than average chance of wiping out to.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufeamirinsertsurnamehere.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feamir InsertSurnameHere</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 2:35:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vyzh'dra the Cursed tactics</span><hr size=1> The best encounter for farmers is in West Karana.<br>

Just watch out for the scarecrows, and that necromancer for the Qeynos Badge quests.  Oh yeah, and if you see an ogre named Tiny Miller, he's your friend, don't kill him.  (Unless you're evil, but then you might not be able to complete your farming.)<br>

This whole thread is kind of silly.  People shouldn't be asking for other people to tell them how to kill a mob.  Go fight it, pay attention to what attacks it has, study the area you fight it in for best places to position and hide from any AEs, and then work out a strat for killing it.<br>
<br>
Are a lot of the strats similar from server to server?  Yup, by necessity.  Only so many solutions possible when you add 2+2 if you catch my drift.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, some guilds just aren't capable of developing a working strategy on their own.  They'll fight a mob over and over and over for weeks and months on end (believe it, cuz I've seen it happen, lol) and still never get a kill.  Then someone will come post a spoiler on this board about how to kill it (thanks go out to that jacka$$ from Afterlife or whatever), and all of a sudden mobs start dying to guilds that wouldn't have a chance on em otherwise.<br>
<br>
As for the whole, second tier guilds don't have time to figure things out on their own like the first tier guilds did argument...  that's an unfortunate fact of life.  Want it to be different?  Motivate your guild so they aren't laggers anymore.  But have some self respect and don't come begging to this board or any other for a hand out on the strat.  Makes you look bad when you suddenly beat a mob you've never attempted on your first try, right after a strat was posted here.<br>
