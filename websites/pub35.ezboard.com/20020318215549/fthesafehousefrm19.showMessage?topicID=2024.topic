So, here it is, check out my specs...<br>
<br>
Level: 31&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Stl: 21-68%<br>
Crit: 21-68%<br>
Env: 10-32%<br>
LAxe:  21-68%<br>
Axe:  21-68%<br>
<br>
Any advice on which way to take my Shadowblade?  I really like the Shadowzerker idea, but I think I've gone too far to go that route.<br>
<br>
I've worked out a path that allows both my Axe and Left Axe to stay above 66% all the way to 40, but I'd only have 21 CS  and 31 STL at that point.  Is that enough?  All these are non enhanced numbers.<br>
<br>
Just really indecisive, and even the 2-3 time I've daily rearranged my path I haven't settled on anything.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
Thanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufandangodarkdance.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fandango Darkdance</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/4/02 11:54:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2024.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New member rules</span><hr size=1> Hello,<br>
  noticed your template and had a question for you. What kind of damage are you doing when dual wielding? I was thinking of going something close to your template tho have not raised LA yet. As I am not sure if it would help my damage out put that much. I am mainly an enven assasin. Ending template if I can recall it correctly will be as follows<br>
<br>
Stealth 40<br>
Sword 20<br>
LA 20<br>
Enven 42<br>
CS 39<br>
<br>
Unfortuantly the latest nerf has really hurt my template so am trying to redecide. Good luck to you, look forward to hearing about damage out put. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwytecube.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wytecube</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/4/02 10:31:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2024.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Logs?</span><hr size=1> How do I get logs of combat?

I'm using 2 garou axes, orange to me at 31 (11 dps/3.3 spd).  Left axe 21, Axe 27 (+items), Crit 24 (+items).  Do I need to add anymore info?<br>
<br>
Yellow, blue, and gray cons.  In that order.  Is this good, bad, avg?  <br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

  Thanks for posting the logs. When I get killed ill have to check what kind of damage I am doing. As to weather what you are doing is good or bad, I honestly have no clue. Right now my weapon skills are rather low was going to train them the next 2 lvls and thats where I am having the problem. Trying to figure out the way to go that will allow me to have the best chance to make a kill and live through it.<br>
<br>
Maybe some one who understands how the weapon system works can shed some more light on it for us. I actually thought the damage would be a bit higher with the left axe with that spec tho could be I just havent a clue on how it works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/02 1:36:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2024.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~bdemong/valaface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here are a few logs...</span><hr size=1> Edit that post and uncheck the &quot;Emoticons&quot; box to get rid of the dumb aliens and sunglasses smileys.
