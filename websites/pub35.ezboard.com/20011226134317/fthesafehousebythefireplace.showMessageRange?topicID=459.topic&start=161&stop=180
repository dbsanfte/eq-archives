But when you expose your stupidity, you give yourself the chance to have it caught, corrected, and and replaced by wisdom.

Time is more like a fog on his consciousness then a measurement of sand grains falling. It is infinite in the future, infinite in the past, and infinite in the present - a monotonous continuum of painful infinity. The invisible cage around him draws tighter everyday. Insanity, if it were not already present, looms like a constant, ominous thundercloud. <br>
His days are spent planning revenge with intermittent bouts of paranoia and hysteria. His fits of rage only further waste his energy. He injured himself several times, although he saw no mark once his fits died down the pain did not seem to subside. Even if he woke from this nightmare-ridden comma, his muscles by now were no doubt suffering from atrophy and the elements as dust and worms took their toll. This was the pain he felt, however small, magnified by his lack of wits that plagued him and fed his paranoia. The worms were small and took a long time to reach his marrow; they caused him the greatest pain. Although most of his flesh had already rotted from long past necromatic accidents and spells, what remained tortured him in his old age and tormented circumstances. It is possible, however incredible, that dead and live flesh can remain together on a well trained necromancer's body. This is the immortality they boast, but even it is not indomitable.  Usually lack of food, disease, worms, and injury destroys much of a necromancer's few living cells as immortality wears on.<br>
His fits are soon forgotten, keeping the realization of what his cell actually is just out of his reach. He couldn't escape because he thought he was escaping a physical cell, but all he was doing was living in dreams and nightmares. On occasion memory would also flood his senses, an overbearing touch of the past. He had managed enough of a fit to create a demon in the physical world by somehow regaining control of his lips long enough to manifest the spell, which is why the demon was so weak. His spell was barely a whisper, unchanneled, and unaided by his mana reservoirs creating a very weak model of his power. Daro's fits would usually end with a spell cast, always very weak, mostly unnoticeable to the naked eye or unaided ear. Despite their weak nature it took most of his mental capacity to create them, but as he did, each time he hammered a little bit off of the cell. Each time he almost opened his eyes he grew closer and closer to escaping. As his paranoia and radical nightmares reached more terrifying extremes his eyelids twitched more. His face gained control sometimes and became contorted in horror and pain. But the tedious routine of torture and boredom was soon to end…<br>
--------------------------<br>
Magnatic surveyed the darker side of Faydark. The trees obscured some of the view to the orcan outlying forts, but the pillars of smoke helped pinpoint their location.<br>
Serhan looked very concerned as she leaned over the platform observing the brewing situation. <br>
Magnatic leaned on the railing of the Kelethin post next to her. <br>
&quot;Lugiver knows how to manipulate the orcs, the orcs are no more then overgrown children.&quot;<br>
Serhan looked out thoughtfully into the distance. &quot;Ever since I was a little girl I was taught how horrible their actions have been in the past. I was told about how they've raped, pillaged, looted, burnt, killed, lynched, tortured and destroyed. But noone ever wondered why. They never thought about what we did to them. We never took serious thought to that we intruded on the land they had kept fair care over for centuries. We never thought that maybe we're as much to blame as they are…&quot; She paused, thinking about Magnatic's comment. &quot;How does Lugiver control them?&quot;<br>
&quot;With fear, Serhan, with fear. He fails to realize…&quot;<br>
&quot;Realize what?&quot;<br>
&quot;That respect is the only practical bond between people, or orcs. Love is to capricious, hate too contentious, materials too superficial and fear… Fear is the simple breeder of dangerous ignorance, unnecessary timidness, and the resentful rebellion that destroys empires. But at the same time, regretfully, fear provides the framework for the perfect shortsighted autocracy. Once that leader dies however, the entire empire is thrown into disarray. But he was smarter then that, the orcs don't know who Lugiver really is. If that orc who is Lugiver's decoy dies he simply finds another. In this way, the orcs will think him an immortal god. He has the heart of a coward, but a clever coward.&quot;<br>
Serhan nodded, she was having a lot of trouble not hating Lugiver.<br>
&quot;Respect is the necessary unifier and realistic equalizer that still provides the proper amount of latitude for the essential diversity to keep the empire strong. When this is lost, all is lost.&quot;<br>
Serhan looked to Magnatic whose eyes were closed as if remembering something distressing.<br>
&quot;We have a diplomatic meeting with our neighbors from Butcher Blok tonight.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Serhan awoke from her thoughts and turned to Magnatic. &quot;About what? I hadn't received notice of it.&quot;<br>
&quot;About Lugiver, and a possible alliance. We should go get prepared.&quot;<br>
Serhan nodded. They had been in Kelethin for a week now, going to various diplomatic meetings and checking the legions.<br>
Serhan had grown used to Magnatic's enigmatic and sometimes cold personality, and the recent haircut, but she still felt rather outclassed. His manners were completely cultivated and courtly, his looks were dashing but he always seemed elsewhere. She believed she knew the reason for his distance, there are some battles that are not fought on any battlefield but the mind alone. Although he claimed he felt no significant affection towards his people and that his actions were more governed by duty and logic then fairness and care she was somewhat skeptical. He did cast a gentle smile on the land when alone, and was kind to the men on the streets as he passed, often generously giving them money. Magnatic played on his peoples needs as Lugiver did, but instead of using this skill selfishly, he helped them uphold a fair standard of living.<br>
But without sounding didactic or tiresome he taught them how to aid themselves. Through grants to artisans and writers he kept a good record of history and promoted the respect of literacy and artistic ability. Endorsing wisdom as virtue and priority as much as he could. But several obstacles lay in his way. First of all the official government was a monarchy, and he was not king. And despite the lack of real authority the king had, he was subject to frivolous whims and fickle regard to his friends. Often taking the head of anyone who he felt was taking too much of his power, ironic, but indefiable since he claimed to be given the mandate of authority from Tunare herself. Magnatic believed this was ridiculous, and that Tunare would never choose such an imbecilic man. Though all elves claim to be descendents of Tunare, the High Elves allege that they should rule since they were the pure breed of elves. Magnatic also believes this to be asinine but can't deny that the high elves would probably defeat the wood elves if a civil conflict erupted.<br>
Besides, what leader could ignore an innate advantage to power? Even one as virtuous as Magnatic knew this could not be denied. High elves were a noble and prestigious race, described widely as beautiful and delicate yet elegant and pure. Most high elves had white hair like his, but his dark brown eyes did stand out, most high elves had blue or green. High elves were usually tall, lean, and made more for the arts of magic rather then war. But the elite few of the high elf warriors were adroit generals and soldiers due to their rareness. Magnatic's long hair was also unusual, most high elves had shorn short hair so it would not catch their hands while they cast. Even the warriors had it short for a similar reason that it might catch in battle and stop them from delivering the final blow. Which was part of the reason why he cut it before battle, but not the reason he let it grow in times of peace. As his hair grew longer it took much more effort to keep groomed, a symbol of the frailty and difficulty of peace and how easy it was to return to war for the sake of traditional simplicity. You curse, declare, fight, die, loose, win, curse, declare, fight, die, loose, win, an unending cycle carried on by all of the races. Evolving independently, yet a shared trait - on-going chaos, on-going war. Revealing the tendency to fight, and the need of peace realized only after peace is missed in times of strife, peace is always taken for granted in regretful ways.<br>
But, is Dacrin right? Are worthless people only good for fighting; are people only good for fighting?<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
Striding down the marbled halls of the Felwithe castle Serhan nearly jogged to keep up. The short yet bumpy carriage ride had left her somewhat sore and numb and she felt embaressed limping alongside. Magnatic had to stifle a chuckle at Serhan's flimsy gait.<br>
The entered the impressive great hall of the castle where the chairs of the great table had been fitted with steps for the dwarfs. Although this was a polite gesture, several dwarfs had found it offensive and had torn the steps off and thrown them in the fire.<br>
Magnatic smiled at this, the dwarves were a proud, strong race, not always bright but their sense of heroism was in the right direction.<br>
The meeting was a long one, sometimes angry, sometimes calm voices echoing off the pristine walls of the great hall.<br>
By the end however, a treaty was signed by and in the name of the elves and dwarves to ensure a strong, fair alliance.<br>
The dwarves and elves often relied on eachother's help during times of war. They had a long standing relationship as amicable neighbors. Some conflict occasionally arose over the boundaries of each kingdom and petty matters of pride, but those were few and far between. <br>
The next step was to ally with the humans so the elves would have better naval support. Humans, being piggish and insidious, were still strong and ambitious, worthy of alliance. Their navy could wipe out almost anything, and although most of Freeport's harbor had been destroyed during the 7th Orc War between All vs. the Deathfist, most ships had been rebuilt or sent in from other harbors.<br>
With this support the plan was to blockade any coastal support or communication between the Deathfist and Crushbone and then starve them or out flank them.<br>
Magnatic, and the respective allies had agreed this was the best way to do it. In fact they were confident, considering the sanitation and isolation that the orcs would be vulnerable to plague. Reassured by the seeming easy victory over the orcs Magnatic and Serhan retreated to bed...<br>

Xvar's Saga - Chapter 20 - The Black Wolf Orc and the Troubadour Troublemaker<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
Dacrin, adorned in his sloppy mess of fur robes and threadbare leather sat on the roof of the blacksmith shop. His sword and menagerie of other weapons, daggers, spears, blade breakers and so on were all being repaired. He sat right next to the chimney, inhaling the blackish smoke, chuckling in morbid delight.<br>
His scratched the itch on his arm, some sort of disease had been getting to him ever since he had his arm injured when he met Xvar. The infection was unnoticeable at first; the symptoms were implacable and seemingly benign. He barely detected the slight tug at his mind, a growing madness as he regressed into the mentality of an animal.<br>
His days were filled with training exercises and sadistic rituals. In the morning, a casual routine of killing nearly the first recruit who made a mistake during warm-ups. During lunch, some unfortunate animal, usually boar was captured and eaten -- sometimes raw and not quite dead. Dacrin relished such things, for the orcs saw him as an equal. Equally as indifferent to the suffering of death, disease, and his own pestilence. He almost smirked at the thought. Soot, and various other elements contained in the smog settled on any exposed skin, making it black and gritty.<br>
Kurt, although equally as indifferent about death, was far neater. He was insipid and nearly melodical in speech. The sort of annoying, uppity tone that crawls under your skin and drives you to your wit's end.<br>
His face was clean, except for the typical tribal markings and scars that gave an orcish appearance. His armor was in far better order then was Dacrin's. His breastplate, made of pure bronze, was painted over with orc emblems and colors, as was the rest of his armor. On the elbow joints a spear point protruded out. So that when he charged towards his enemy he could spike them on one of the points or slash them to bits.<br>
Kurt was self indulgent and selfish to the extremes. Anything he wanted he expected to get, and get it fast.<br>
He organized a forthright and simple system to do this:<br>
Get it for me, or die.<br>
As even orcs are more inclined to do petty favors then die, he always got his way. And those stupid enough to challenge him, or be tardy, were ensured a gravestone.<br>
Both were model soldiers for the orcs, and served Lugiver accordingly. Of course, there was no reason not to. He gave them power, blood, coins and a lofty castle in which to hide from the law. They required, and in fact desired no more and knew if they suddenly did they'd probably see evidence of Lugiver's sometimes-short temper.<br>
Kurt scowled at Dacrin's complete lack of hygiene and with the help of a few volunteer orcs they snuck up on Dacrin and soaked him with water. Stripping all of the black off his skin, while a rather large ecosystem of insects spilled out of his furs and hair.<br>
Dacrin of course killed the orcs involved and jumped back on the roof of the smith shop. Leaning over he could put his head in the pillar of smoke. Smirking malevolently at Kurt he was disgusting within minutes. <br>
Dacrin eventually leapt down from the rooftop, of course leaving a trail of black footprints, to the center of the city. It was not organized like a typical city.<br>
The center had several ritualistic temples, shops, and firepots, but not much else. The castle loomed in the background, an ever-present reminder of Lugiver's, or &quot;Granaric's&quot; power. <br>
The rest was mostly farmland, hunting ground and roads winding around the scattered buildings and houses that dotted the area. <br>
The roads were not paved, more like large paths, carved and recarved into the ground over generations of orcs who had lived in the area.<br>
They were dusty, rugged, bumpy and inefficient, and Lugiver meant to change this. He wished to change the dusty, rugged orcs into a formidable empire. Which had never before been truly attempted since the orcs have a rather severe lack of intelligence.<br>
He had ordered that the smartest orcs would become scribes to record economic matters, such as taxes. He reasoned that a great army fit to conquer the world must have the following things:<br>
1.Money<br>
2.War-accepting, War-loving background<br>
3.Illiterate soldiers who won't think for themselves or will be easily swept up by false promises…<br>
And 4. A strong leader.<br>
He had 2,3, and 4, but needed a better way to organize the orcs so he could revive the nearly non-existent economy.<br>
And so he devised a system of ranking.<br>
At the top are the Uracs, then the Yilracs, then the Defdefs, then and the Shen.<br>
The Uracs can ride horses, use the best weapons and wear plate armor. The Yilracs can't ride on horses, but can use nearly the best weapons and wear plate armor. The Defdefs use mediocre weapons and chain armor. And last, and least, the Shen wear rusty chain or leather using any weapons they can scrounge up. The Shen would be mostly used as the expendable frontline, taking the edge off the attackers. In time, if the Shen survived they could be promoted, but often most Shen never lived to see more then one battle. The Defdefs are commonly from the merchant families who can provide better equipment. Defdefs are the second to go into battle, and most survive since the Defdef is the largest group of soldiers. Defdefs must survive 6 battles to be given the chance for promotion. Once they have the chance they must fight with the Shen during a battle and if they survive, they are promoted the Yilrac. The only way you become a Yilrac is to either be a poor noble or a promoted Defdef. Yilracs charge right ahead of the Uracs with long pikes to knock off the soldiers from the enemy's cavalry. So the Uracs will have a tactical advantage when they finally get to fight. Although the Defdefs and Shen fight the majority of the battle, it's the Uracs that get all and any of the glory. Uracs are purely from noble families, and rarely promoted Yilracs. They are rich, arrogant and stubborn, but often have been trained as fighters from birth. Whereas most of the others are broke farmers, merchants, or jobless poor. <br>
Since slaves are bought or stolen from the neighboring races, most remedial work that the poor would do is done cheaper and easier by slaves. Completely undermining the entire social system. Slave drivers had the easiest life in orc society. Simply whipping and shouting, doing otherwise not much work and getting paid quite the reasonable sum, they lived an enviable life compared the beggars and slaves.<br>
Kurt in his spare time loved being a slave driver. He wouldn't even whip the slaves; he'd have a slave do it for him while he held a knife close.<br>
His punishments were always over cruel and sometimes fatal or crippling. But all the time he would smile and watch with a darker, eerie kind of glee.<br>
Dacrin took no part in the slave driving, he more interested in hunting.<br>
He hunted any game he could possible find. His senses recently had become more acute and his shagged appearance resembled that of a wolf or some other gnarled beast.<br>
The orcs never used the name he gave, which was Ekul Mekon. But instead called him &quot;Racracfar&quot; which was eventually contorted into Racrac, and in some cases Racfar. Literally translated into &quot;Black Wolf Orc&quot;.<br>
Since his skin was always black, and he looked like a fur-covered orc, it seemed appropriate and intimidating. In fact, since the civilians of the Crushbone so rarely saw him, he was described as a terrible monster that would eat young orcs' eyeballs if they were disobedient. <br>
Dacrin had grown into an incredibly limber yet strong warrior and although he had had some background in fighting before, now his skills were superb, maybe even enough to match Lugiver's.<br>
As Dacrin continued his daily ritual he went into the forest. Sniffing the air and scanning the trail for tracks he spotted those of a deer, several in fact.<br>
Tentatively putting his hand on the track feeling how moist it was he knew it was fresh. Standing he drew his sword and ran through the thick undergrowth. <br>
His pace became faster as he knew he was getting closer. Then slowed as he neared a clearing. From his position in the bush he could see the tail of one of the deer. Leaping out from the shrub he pounced on the deer. The deer, being a somewhat frail animal collapsed under his weight with a disgust sound of broken limbs. The other two deer had scurried off into the opaque foliage as fast as he has leapt out of it. Giving the deer a stern kick in the neck, and hearing a satisfying crunch he picked it up and dragged it back to the city center, putting it near a firepot as he sat and ate. His teeth made small gnaw marks on the bones as he cracked one open on the edge of the firepot, eagerly sucking up the marrow. Kurt was appalled by Dacrin's disgusting manners watching from afar he felt almost sick. Kurt could kill 10 men, 10 good men without a second thought, but the site of Dacrin eating made him ill.<br>
Kurt went to Lugiver in the castle and Lugiver sat him down and they began to discuss battle plans.<br>
Lugiver had a large map tacked onto the thick wooden table in the room. There were various models and figures symbolic of armies strewn on the thin leather diagram.<br>
&quot;I believe if we station camps here and here and here.&quot; He said while he pointed to various locations near Kelethin. &quot;That we can take Kelethin quickly.&quot;<br>
Kurt nodded. &quot;Did you manage to find any of those explosive experts Aftar had? The uh, what was it, Gariks?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, but I have assembled my own team, and in honor of the late, great annoyance, Aftar, they'll be named Gariks.&quot;<br>
Kurt nodded and chuckled at Lugiver's sarcasm.<br>
&quot;Shall we burn it down then?&quot;<br>
Lugiver smiled and tossed the plan with all the vulnerable spots of the platform supports marked.<br>
&quot;Let's shall.&quot; Kurt said in his melodiously insipid tone, much like that of a drunken troubadour or bard.<br>
Grazing his hand against the plan gently he whispered in a darker, crueler tone. &quot;Let's shall…&quot;<br>
<br>

In the website you made with the different chapters to the story, the numbers for the chapters are messed up. When you click on chapter 3, it says chapter 4, but it really is chapter 3. Just thought to help, none of the links on the website you provided work either. <br>
