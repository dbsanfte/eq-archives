<br>
Edited and finished quest: Faction adjustments and story alignments made. (Check out the story behind hanns/circle of unseen hands/stanos/highpass and you’ll find that it’s better then a soap opera)<br>
<br>
Stanos’s Test of the Initiate<br>
Level Required: 50<br>
(Must be lvl 50 to do any of the turn ins, like Ragebringer quest)<br>
<br>
You say, “I need to see Stanos”<br>
<br>
Anson Mcbale says “This better be important”<br>
<br>
(Stanos Harkenor spawns)<br>
<br>
You say, “I wish to become a member of your ranks”<br>
<br>
Stanos says, “Hrmmm, very well, you look a bit scrawny but perhaps you’ll toughen up. At any rate you’re in good standing with me and I will give you a [chance]”<br>
<br>
You say, “What chance will you give me?”<br>
<br>
Stanos says “Ahh well that’s up to Jaxin De`Arn, he’s in charge of keeping an eye over the Circle of Unseen Hands in Qeynos and usually has a job for anyone I send to him. Go and find him in Qeynos, tell him Stanos sent you. If he needs more proof, give him this.”<br>
<br>
You receive “a broken neriak insignia”. (Lore, No drop, Magic)<br>
Jaxin De`Arn is a dark elf in Qeynos hills, 2 hour spawn time at the lake, he despawns after 40 minutes.<br>
<br>
You say, “Stanos sent me”<br>
<br>
Jaxin De`Arn says “Hah, Stanos eh? Stanos is dead, and I regret working for him in the first place. If you’ve come to collect his debts, or perhaps revenge, you’ll be sorely disappointed. One of the Bounty Hunters killed him several moons ago”<br>
<br>
Give Jaxin “a broken neriak insignia”<br>
<br>
Jaxin De`Arn says “Ahhh, this is my insignia that I took with me when I left my homeland. It seems Stanos really did send you. The story was a necessary cover; many of Hann’s men have been looking for Stanos and his operatives lately. I can’t just go telling everyone who says Stanos sent them that I’m one of his allies or Hanns &lt;I&gt;really&lt;/I&gt; would want to kill me. Well now, down to business. There’s a beggar in South Qeynos that is an undercover operative of Hanns. He’s been feeding him everything he finds out about Stanos and his operation. Go to South Qeynos and find him, but beware, he might have some of the guards on his side. Bring me back his tongue. Oh, I believe he goes by the name of Nasin Sly`tor<br>
<br>
You gain experience (1 blue at 50)<br>
Your faction standing with the Circle of Unseen Hands has gotten worse.<br>
Your faction standing with Highpass guards has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Freeport Militia has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Carson McCabe has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Coalition of Tradefolk Ill has gotten better.<br>
(Jaxin despawns)<br>
<br>
Find Nasin Sly`tor in the Fish’s Ale (I think) bar in S.Qeynos. He is guarded by one lvl 46 guard.<br>
<br>
You say “Hail, a shady guard”<br>
<br>
A shady guard says, “Bah, what do you want? Calling in another job from Ha- err my superiors? Just leave me alone unless you’re here to buy the drinks. I’m partial to Elven Wine myself, havn’t had some of that since I joined the Protectors of this wretched city.<br>
<br>
Hand a shady guard 4 Elven Wine<br>
<br>
A shady guard says, “Ahhh thank you, this is the best. Glug glug glug. He burps at you loudly. I owe ya one Blackitty, but I think I need to lay down for a minute, this stuff is stronger then I remembered. <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with the Circle of Unseen Hands has gotten worse.<br>
(A shady guard despawns)<br>
<br>
Nasin Sly`tor mumbles to himself “Useless fool, I must report his insolence to Hanns and find another guard”<br>
<br>
Nasin walks off past the docks (He walks under the docks at one point), through the merchant area, and down to the warrior guild. He despawns when he gets to the warrior guild entrance. Kill him before he gets there, it must be fast, use a root/snare poison and backstab quickly. If it takes longer then 20 seconds the nearby guards spawn and aggro (coded). He is approx level 15. Drops “a snitch's tongue”. Lore No drop.<br>
<br>
Give “a snitch’s tongue” to Jaxin De`Arn<br>
<br>
Jaxin De`Arn says, “Good work Blackitty, you’re not as weak as I first suspected. I have another job for you to complete however. I once had a tussle with one of Hann’s guards and he managed to take something that I valued greatly. Go to the Circle’s hideout and bring back my waist pouch from their treasure horde, it should be in some sort of box. Give it to me along with this earring and I’ll give you the next assignment. You’ll have to do some stealing, which I’m sure you know nothing about being the upstanding citizen you are, right Blackitty? Jaxin De`Arn winks at you<br>
<br>
You receive Earring of Assassination (2ac 3sta 3str 3int 10hp, Magic Lore No drop)<br>
You gain experience (2 blues at 50)<br>
Your faction standing with the Circle of Unseen Hands has gotten worse.<br>
Your faction standing with Highpass guards has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Freeport Militia has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Carson McCabe has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Coalition of Tradefolk Ill has gotten better.<br>
(Jaxin despawns)<br>
<br>
Head to the rogue guild in Qeynos (located under Crow’s bar if I remember correctly) and pick the locked door (204 skill). There’s a mob there named “A Locked Chest” (looks like those haunted chests in PoH) which is level 1 but cannot be hit by melee or spells (Remember “A Storm” when Luclin first came out in DL? Or A mystic voice in DL?). You must pick pocket it until it gives you “A tattered leather pouch”. It respawns every 15 minutes and doesn’t always have the pouch, but it does have about 5plat every spawn.<br>
<br>
Give Jaxin De`Arn “A tattered leather pouch” and your Earring of Assassination.<br>
<br>
Jaxin De`Arn says “Thank you very much Blackitty, may Bristlebane never steal from your pockets!” Jaxin De`Arn looks inside the pouch and gasps. “It’s gone! The bastards must have used it!” Jaxin De`Arn quivers in rage, then in a barely audible whisper gives you your instructions. “Go find Kaeyarn in the Circle’s hideout, it is rumored he is in charge of most of the Circle’s financial issues. Slip the contents of this vial to him as stealthily as you can. If you sneak up behind him he will never even notice the poison pores seeping into his skin. Oh, I will need another poison to replace the one you will use to kill Kaeyarn. It was a [gift] to me and I’ve no idea how to make another one.”<br>
You receive Earring of Thievery (4ac 5dex 5str 5wis 20hp, 5 charges of Levitate, Magic Lore No drop)<br>
You receive a vial of dark liquid (Lore No Drop)<br>
You gain experience (1 blue at 50)<br>
Your faction standing with the Circle of Unseen Hands has gotten worse.<br>
Your faction standing with Highpass guards has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Freeport Militia has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Carson McCabe has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Coalition of Tradefolk Ill has gotten better.<br>
<br>
You say “What gift?”<br>
<br>
Jaxin De`Arn says “Yes, a gift from an old friend and renowned poison maker, I believe he lives in the sewers of Freeport now, selling supplies and information to anyone who pays the right price. Seek out Toxdil and ask him how to make a vial of deathly pores. Bring me back the empty vial you used to kill Kaelyarn, the new poison, and your earring and I shall reward you well.”<br>
<br>
(Jaxin despawns)<br>
<br>
Kaeyarn is a 5 hour spawn and he sits in his own room (another locked door). If you just hand him the poison he will give you the vial of dark liquid back and attack you, aggroing the entire rogue guild (he is dubious to everyone, no matter what your faction). You must sneak behind him and give him the vial of dark liquid. <br>
<br>
Kaeyarn appears not to notice you.<br>
<br>
You receive “an empty vial” lore no drop<br>
<br>
If you hang around several minutes, you will see this text message<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Kaeyarn stops what he is doing and jumps up, yelping in pain. His skin has taken a green hue and small holes start to appear on his body. Slowly his flesh begins to rot, filling the room with an unbearable stench along with more screams of pain. In one last blood-chilling scream, his body crumples to the floor, dead with a confused and pained expression on his face.<br>
 <br>
Hanns looks up from his business and says, “What the hell was that?”<br>
Renux Harkanor grins and says “I’m sure it was just one of the local drunks having his bar tab beat out of him by Crow and his cronies”<br>
<br>
Head to West Freeport and find Toxdil behind a hidden wall.<br>
<br>
You say, “How might I make a vial of deathly pores?”<br>
Toxdil says, “I will doing nothing to aid beings like you”<br>
You begin to sneak..<br>
You are as quiet as cat stalking its prey.<br>
You say, “How might I make a vial of deathly pores?”<br>
Toxdil says “A vial of deathly pores? That’s one poison I havn’t made in a long time. Well the best I can do is give you the recipe and the means to combine it, but it will [cost you].<br>
You say, “What will it cost me?”<br>
Toxdil chuckles and says, “I have a bit of a weak spot for alcohol. I will need 2 Gnomish Spirits, a bottle of Ogre Swirl, and a shot of whiskey. Oh and 400 platinum pieces, business has been a bit slow lately.<br>
<br>
You can find the alcohol at various bars about norrath, some can only be found in certain cities.<br>
<br>
Give him what he asks for.<br>
Toxdil says, “Good good, I will enjoy this immensely. Here is my end of the bargain. You will need to make the poison yourself, so I hope you are a master at it, although a perfection at the craft is not required. Combine a Sealed Poison Vial, A thunderhoof mushroom, a patch of Zombie Skin, Whore’s Bane, and A vile substance in this special mortar and pestle. Bring me 4 of these and I will pool them into a usable vial.<br>
<br>
You receive a Unique Mortar and Pestle (Magic Lore No drop 6 slot container +1 to Make Poison)<br>
A Thunderhoof Mushroom (Foraged in SK, buy from other players or forage yourself if you are a wood elf)<br>
A Sealed Poison Vial (Bought off of any poison vendor)<br>
A patch of Zombie Skin (Regular stackable Zombie skin off zombies)<br>
Whore’s Bane (Drops off Magicians in Najena)<br>
A Vile Substance (Drops off a Goblin Janitor in Runnyeye)<br>
<br>
Combine in the Unique Mortar and Pestle  (not confirmed if a regular mortar and pestle works or not) to make A small vial of deathly pores. Make 4 of them with the same recipe and hand all 4 to Toxdil. Trivial at 179 Make Poison<br>
<br>
Toxdil says, “Ahhh you indeed are a trained toxicologist, let me make these into a usable poison.” He pours all 4 vials into a larger vial and adds a white powder to the mix. “There you go, good luck with it, I do not envy the person who receives that poison. I put my special touch to the mix”<br>
<br>
You receive “A new vial of Deathly Pores” (Lore No Drop)<br>
<br>
Hand “an empty vial”, “A new vial of Deathly Pores” and your Earring of Thievery to Jaxin De`Arn.<br>
<br>
Jaxin De`Arn says, “It took you long enough Blackitty, but at least you returned. I wasn’t quite sure you were skilled enough to complete the task but you have eliminated my doubts. Tell me, did Kaeyarn die painfully? I hope Hanns finds his rotting corpse a week from now, smelling up their foul guildhouse. Well you have proven your worth to me and this organization several times now, and I think you are worthy enough to wear the earring of Stanos’s Initiate. Bring Stanos this note and he shall decide whether to initiate into our ranks or not. That is all the reward you should require. Oh, and in case Toxdil made you make the poison yourself, which isn’t below the lazy drow, here’s a bit of cash to cover the costs. You shall always have my thanks for this deed.<br>
<br>
You receive 500 platinum pieces.<br>
You receive a letter of recommendation (Magic Lore No drop)<br>
You gain experience (2 blues at 50)<br>
Your faction standing with the Circle of Unseen Hands has gotten worse.<br>
Your faction standing with Highpass guards has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Freeport Militia has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Carson McCabe has gotten better.<br>
Your faction standing with Coalition of Tradefolk Ill has gotten better.<br>
<br>
Find Stanos back in Highpass and give him the letter.<br>
<br>
Stanos reads through the letter, a smile appearing on his face. “Very well Blackitty, it appears Jaxin thinks highly of you and your deeds seemed enough of a challenge. Welcome to my ranks. I trust you will not disappoint me.”<br>
<br>
You receive Stanos’s Earring of the Initiate (7ac 8sta 5int 5svm 50hp +5 to Make poison effect: Levitate, unlimited charges, insta cast, Magic Lore No drop)<br>

<br>
I really do wish that they would impliment quests like this, where you have to test your true skills as a rogue. The rope-walking idea was a cool idea IMO, maybe more things where you don't have to use your rogue &quot;skills&quot; but your rogue skills (like walking on a narrow bridge, escaping without using hide .etc)<br>
