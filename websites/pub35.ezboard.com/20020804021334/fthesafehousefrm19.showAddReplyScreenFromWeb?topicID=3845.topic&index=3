<br>
+: +15% bonus<br>
=: 0% change<br>
-: -15% penalty<br>
<br>
Pierce Nightshades:<br>
<br>
- Albion Plate (2)<br>
+ Albion Chain (3) [2 are instamez]<br>
+ Midgard Chain (5) [2 are instamez]<br>
+ Albion Studded (1)<br>
- Midgard Studded (2)<br>
- Albion Leather (2)<br>
- Midgard Leather (1)<br>
<br>
As far as Pierce Nightshade changes are concerned, their vulnerable targets increased by +1 from the last patch, which is the Scout. All other classes are kept at full resistance, and none of which went to neutral. 4 of the 8 vulnerable chain targets are also instamez classes. There are no neutral armor types other than Cloth, everything about Hibernian Piercing is an extreme, including full resistance by all other Assassins, which other Assassin spec lines will not have it as bad as you will see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blade Nightshades:<br>
<br>
= Albion Plate (2)<br>
= Albion Chain (3) [2 are instamez]<br>
- Midgard Chain (5) [2 are instamez]<br>
= Albion Studded (1)<br>
+ Midgard Studded (2)<br>
= Albion Leather (2)<br>
+ Midgard Leather (1)<br>
<br>
Bladeshades got a general increase in targets, which they were severely lacking before. Most of the Slash targets went from being resistant to neutral, which is a general boon, however their vulnerable targets actually did not increase, as Albion Leather became neutral and Midgard Studded became vulnerable. Bladeshades have the potential of being diverse, and aside from inherent class bonuses of other Assassins, seems to have the best anti-assassin specline potential by having no penalties versus leather.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thrust Infiltrators:<br>
<br>
+ Midgard Chain (5) [2 are isntamez]<br>
= Hibernian Scale (4)<br>
- Midgard Studded (2)<br>
= Hibernian Reinforced (3) [1 is instamez]<br>
- Midgard Leather (1)<br>
= Hibernian Leather (1)<br>
<br>
Thrust Infiltrators have less non-instamez vulnerable targets by 2 than the Pierce Nightshade. The major difference though is that there are many Neutrals by +8, where the rest of the Pierce Nightshade targets are fully resistant. This will restore the flexibility that was lost to Thrust Infiltrators since the last pendragon patch and give them a wider variety of targets to choose from.<br>
<br>
<br>
Slash Infiltrators:<br>
<br>
- Midgard Chain (5) [2 are isntamez]<br>
+ Hibernian Scale (4)<br>
+ Midgard Studded (2)<br>
- Hibernian Reinforced (3) [1 is instamez]<br>
+ Midgard Leather (1)<br>
- Hibernian Leather (1)<br>
<br>
Similar to Pierce Nightshades, Slash Infiltrators are always at an extreme. The major difference is that none of the 8 vulnerable targets are instamez classes. It is no longer a pure Assassin hunting specline as well, since it is 50/50 whether it has a bonus/resist against another Assassin, but the Studded targets added 2 more vulnerable targets since the last patch, a nice addition.<br>
<br>
<br>
All Shadowblades:<br>
<br>
= Albion Plate (2)<br>
= Albion Chain (3) [2 are instamez]<br>
+ Hibernian Scale (4)<br>
= Albion Studded (1)<br>
- Hibernian Reinforced (3) [1 is instamez]<br>
= Albion Leather (2)<br>
- Hibernian Leather (1)<br>
<br>
<br>
Shadowblades over time will see this as a general boon against all classes, despite the pure Assassin hunting aspect does not apply. Previous resistances to Albion Plate, Chain, and Studded just went to Neutral, and Scale retains the bonus. There is only a penalty to 4 classes total. Assassin hunting just went out the door, but 6 more targets just became neutral since last patch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note to Nightshades: From the conclusive nature of this patch as was presented in the opening paragraphs, it is safe to say that this IS what piercing will be, whether we like it or not. I hate to say it, but Bladeshades seem the only way to go, which is not bad for the specline minus the part about our strength, but I hate to see piercing get hosed like this. <br>

As for the armour resistance changes.. /shrug  My leather just went resistant to a Shadowzerker who can still hit me for 314(-47) with 18% resist to Slash (not pulling random numbers, have the screenshot).  <br>
<br>
Doublefrost is still a ***** .  No, I'm not calling for a nerf.  It used to hit harder than that, at least with 314 that's 3 hits now I can live through and hopefully get an evade off to diamond back their arse.  If i can get a diamond back off in a fight, whoever i'm up against is going to feel the pain.  Evade combo bumps up defense considerably.<br>

But that is utter horse**** that they have to do at the cost to the shadowblades. <br>

I was very much excited that we were going to get a wider spread of targets, but now we get a wider spread at a heavy cost. The targets I typically hunt such as infilts, nightshades, &amp; rangers, now get a bonus against me. Does this make sense?<br>
<br>
But look on the brightside I can always use an axe! Errr wait a sword! Oh I know! I will bust out a staff that I cant spec in because other realms leather is vunerable to crush. Brilliant, just F'ing brilliant.<br>
