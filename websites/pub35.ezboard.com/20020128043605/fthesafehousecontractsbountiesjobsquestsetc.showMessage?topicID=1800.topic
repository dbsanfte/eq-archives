Anytime you are dealing with these beings (NPC) many things can and usually go wrong.<br><br>Poisons are a trademark of the rogues, and I have only one request on the topic, this being that no blindness poisons are applied and used against each other. This is to ensure that the matches are based on true skill and trickery, not a false trickery granted by a poison.<br><br>Pick Locks, while a needed skill in some of the greatest dungeons in the realm, are far away from the Arena that we hold the events in. This also holds true for Sense and Disarm traps, which are hundreds of miles from the arena zone.<br><br>Instill Doubt has been requested to be disallowed by a council of rogues that met in the Arena this past week. After showing that a single success of this skill results in an undoubted win, it was outlawed from the event. This skill should not be considered “useless” by any means, just too strong to be using against each other in this duel.<br><br>Disarm, on the other hand, will be allowed in the event. It will take a quick hand to disarm a rogue in motion, and an even quicker hand to pull out another dagger from a nearby sheath. This skill cannot be ignored and will remain in the event.<br><br>Activateable items will be disallowed. Needless to say those bringing earrings that can lifetap, potions that can heal or negate poisons will negate damage done to them not out of skill, but out of the wealth of a rogue that can afford such luxuries. Items that have these abilities can still be worn, just not used.<br><br>Hide and Sneak is a no-win situation for the judges, contestants, and participants. If we allow hide and sneak, everyone who enters the ring will have see invis gear on so they can engage their opponent at all times. The only thing hide and sneak will accomplish is to take away the event from the crowd who has come to see the greatest rogues fight each other. <br><br>Therefore we are going to disallow hide and sneak in this event so that the rogues can wear items that will allow them to increase their combat efficiency and allow everyone to see the great action.<br><br>Backstabbing is allowed and encouraged. Since this is normally the most damage that a rogue can do to an opponent, of course it will be allowed.<br><br>The use of ranged weapons for the rogues is another profession defining ability. I must state that the bow is not allowed, but other weapons of ranged attacks will be granted. Also be advised that ‘kiting’ will not be allowed. <br><br>This leaves a lot of room for interpretation of this statement, so I will make an all encompassing rule that states you can only attack via range once, then reengage with melee. Now if you wish to throw a dagger, melee once, back off, throw another dagger, that is allowed. As long as there is melee between the ranged attacks, you may engage as much as you desire.<br><br>There was a rule with the warriors, which stated they must face each other at all times in combat, therefore not allowing for “Constructive Fleeing”. If you wish to turn your back on a fellow rogue, knowing full well their capabilities of attacks from the back, both melee and ranged, you may do so. I expect low life expectancy for those who turn their backs to a rogue, and highly advise against it.<br><br>(OOC) The rule of Link-Death has been reviewed, and it was determined to modify the standing of this rule. If you go Link-Dead and are losing, you forfeit the match. If you go Link-Dead and are winning the match, the battle will be reviewed by the GM for a rematch. The option of disqualifying the Link-Dead player is still given to the judge, even if winning, but the Judge has the option to call for a rematch now.<br><br>These are the current rules of the event, and I assure you that they are still open for discussion and revision up to the point of the first match (Prexus – Wed at 5pm). I have worked with many rogues to try to find another event that will fit within time restraints so all servers can run them, that spectators can watch the glorious event, and that are fair to the profession that is involved.<br><br>Good luck to the Rogues, we shall see you at the event!<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Event Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive<br>9/20 at 5pm - Prexus<br>9/21 at 5pm - Erollisi Marr<br>9/21 at 5pm - Torvonnilious <br>9/21 at 6pm - Luclin<br>9/22 at 5pm - The Rathe<br>9/22 at 6pm - Povar<br><br>9/23 at 3pm - Vallon Zek<br>9/23 at 4pm - Mithaniel Marr <br>9/23 at 5pm - Xegony <br>9/23 at 6pm - Lanys <br>9/23 at 8pm - Innoruuk<br><br>9/24 at 3pm - Tarew Marr<br>9/24 at 5pm - Cazic Thule <br>9/24 at 6pm - Fennin Ro <br>9/24 at 6pm - E'ci <br>9/24 at 6pm - Brell<br><br>9/25 at 4pm - Solusek Ro<br>9/25 at 5pm - Veeshan <br><br>9/26 at 5pm - Terris Thule<br><br>9/27 at 4pm - Karana <br>9/27 at 5pm - Rallos Zek<br><br>9/28 at 2pm - Tallon Zek<br>9/28 at 6pm - Druzzil<br><br>9/29 at 6pm - Quellious<br>9/29 at 6pm - 7th Hammer <br>9/29 at 6pm - Sayryn <br>9/29 at 6pm - Morel <br>9/29 at 6pm - Nameless <br><br>9/30 at 6pm - Bristlebane<br>9/30 at 6pm - Tunare <br>9/30 at 6pm - Bertox <br>9/30 at 6pm - Rodcet <br>9/30 at 6pm - Tribunal<br><br>10/01 at Noon - Final on Test<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/18/00 8:05:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;King of Thieves&quot; Competition - Rules Announce</span><hr size=1> If they are looking for a test of skills in combat, then both contestants should enter the arena naked, given 5 minutes to chose their weapons and poison components from a vendor selection, and 5 minutes to prepare for the fight. <p>Majestyk, <a href="http://Server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse">Rogue</a>, Leader, <a href="http://galaxy.apropos.org/shanks">Shanks</a>, <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5034">Vallon Zek!</a>We as Shanks, have chosen the hard path.

That skill is backstab. Its like a forced crit on the warriors perspective and i for one will not participate in this "test of skills". This competition is all about whos got the best stuff. And wait... its not even that because someones decided that weapons earned from the hardest parts of the game are not allowable! (bloodpoint).

Considering we have the same skill cap as a ranger i would say disallowing archery is like disallowing us to use 1hb weapons, It may not fit the most popular vision of a rogue but it in no way invalidates it either (need I mention Robin Hood?).  This ruling displeases me greatly, all rogues have had a choice and option to train themselves in the uses of all weapons available to them, and none should be restricted. it is up to personal preferance.  To me Thrown weapons will never be more than a nice toy to play with until they decide to put in decent items that are usable by the majority of rogue races and are stackable.<br><br>No Hide/Sneak?  hmm.. rogues arent toe-to-toe fighters, there may even be a official quote to that effect somewhere.  The use of subterfuge and distraction is paramount to a rogues concept and strategy.  I ask what is the difference between the disparity of a rbb and a dual wielding blood point rogue and that of a non-hasted dual SBD wielding rogue?  Obviously the rules dont account for the obvious advantage the first rogue would have.  But yet there is a distinction made with hide/sneak?  Whats fair after all, if the rules allowed activatable items, once selected a rogues location could be verified via item casting or ranged weapon.  It is up to the individual rogue to plan for strategies that may be used against him/her and to plan so that any advantages may be negated or turned against their attacker.  One could even play the possum so to speak in luring an opponent into thinking they didnt see them until an opportunity arose.  <br><br>well thats my 2 cents on the rules. <p>Machieaveli Shadowstalker  lvl 49 Rogue on Rallos Zek</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uoldsalt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldsalt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/19/00 4:01:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;King of Thieves&quot; Competition - Rules Announce</span><hr size=1>  I can understand some of the rules but some of it is just plain stupid.
