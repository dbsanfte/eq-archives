Contributors are listed in a post at the end of the thread.<br><br>Some mobs may be way under your level, and there may be some that can still stomp you. <br>Most of you will want to hunt blue, light blue /con mobs (slightly below your current level).<br><br>============================================================================<br><B><U>LEVELS 1 - 5 </U></B><br><br>For these levels you want to stick to your 'newbie' zones.  There is virtually no penalty for death other than the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT ... message, and that is still faster than trying to sit waiting to heal yourself.  So kill everything you see.  At first everything will /con white/black, yellow, and red.  Go for the white/blacks and yellows.  Rats, bats, snakes, scaled wolf pups, & scorpions at first, and then move up to orc pawns, fire beetles, emerald scarabs, carrion beetles, decayed skeletons, and scaled wolf cubs.<br><br>Mash the mend button everytime it comes up.  Do the curscale quest if you are an Iksar and get your armor quickly.  Humans will probably have to wait unless we get lucky and get some usable cloth off the orc pawns.  Hint:  If you go fishing, you can usually get a 1AC tattered sandal as your first piece of armor.  You probably can't afford them, but if you can, go ahead and get bandages to practice bandaging.  You can buy summoned bandages at a greatly reduced rate from magicians (they disappear if you camp out though).<br><br><B>East Freeport</B> - outside the gates<br><B>West Freeport</B> - outside the gates<br><B>North Qeynos</B> - outside the gates<br><B>Kunark - Field of Bones</B> - Between the gates and the edge of the desert area and the trees.<br><B>Kunark - East Calibis</B> - Not really good for newbies solo.  Best to run to zone until you reach level 5 unless you are grouped.  Froglok slaves will triple-time you. There are barracuda in the water.  And one of the water tunnels leads to a series of rooms & corridors with low-level mosquitoes, skellies, leeches, and scorpions but many passageways are one-way, and these monsters are a little high for 1-5 solo, but probably really fun in a group.<br>Once you stop getting experience from fire beetles/scaled wolf pups, then you can move out to the next zones.<br><B>Qeynos Hills</B> - from zone border to just before the hills start.<br><B>East Commonlands</B> - from zone border to just before the forest starts.<br><B>Northern Desert of Ro</B> - from zone border to just before the sand dunes start.<br><B>Kunark - Field of Bones</B> - Between the edge of the desert area out to the reservoir.<br><B>Kunark - Lake of Ill Omen</B> - groups might be able to take on sarneks, sabertooth cubs, and some goblins, along with decaying skeletons.<br><B>Kunark - Warslilk Woods</B> - don't go there.<br><B>Kunark - Swamp of No Hope</B> - don't go there either.<br><br>==============================================================================<br><B><U>LEVELS 5 - 10</U></B><br><br>First, there is no XP penalty for dying below level 11.  So until then, just keep killing and don't worry about dying.  Best part is that if you get poisoned or diseased the fastest cure is death.<br><br>Second, this is where you really need to start playing <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fmmrpgdiscussionguidestactics.showMessage?topicID=17.topic>The /CON Game.</a><br>Soloists should stick with light blue & blues.  You 'might' be able to do a black/white or yellow if you have mend handy (and it works!), but don't count on it.<br><br><B>Befallen</B> - At levels 7 & above you might try the top floor of befallen. The skeletons are pretty<br>easy and have a moderately fast respawn rate.  Be careful of the putrid rats, they like to move between your legs where they can be difficult to hit at times. Great way to practice your bandaging too when you are healing just outside the zone point.   The loot is good for this level and several vendors are a very short walk outside the door in West Commonlands. <br><br><B>Qeynos Hills</B> - Wolves and bears, this is the place to begin tailoring and you can make a nice, if heavy, set of patchwork/tattered for yourself.  Unlike the East Commonlands, there are two wandering eco-freaks here who will kill you if you hurt the bears or wolves, even if they are rabid or attack you first.  <br><br>Do the rabid animal quest; kill rabid wolfs and bears, each one drops a putrid pelt. When you have a full inventory of these go to the "Flying saucer" by the Temple of Light in North Qeynos. (you need to step through the blue teleport at the end of the ramp to get in) Once inside give the pelts to the priestess with the all leather look (Cauldra?).  Give her a putrid wolf pelt, and she will cure you of any disease you have and give you between nothing to 2pp plus a scroll which can be sold.  If you bring back a bear pelt she'll just give you the spell.  XP is outstanding.  Make sure you work all your skills the the maximum for your level as much as possible.<br><br><B>Qeynos Catacombs</B> - You can go from level 4 to level 12+ in here solo: 4 - 6 kill Fire Beetles, Large Spiders, Rats, Cubert, etc., 7 - 8 kill Frogloks, the Injured Brigand behind the Cubert area, and the skeletons at the entrance to the Necro/SK Guild area, 9 - 10 kill Thugs.  If you group, you can kill smugglers then try to do the sharks.  The frogloks in the Qeynos Catacombs are conveniently close, but there are only 3 of them, so it might take a long time to get a pair of gloves to drop.  Troll Swamp and Ogre Forest are better places for netted gloves.<br><br><B>East Commonlands</B> - Wolves and bears, this is the place to begin tailoring and you can make a nice, if heavy, set of patchwork/tattered for yourself.  Orc pawns do good for faction.  You can try getting into a group at the orc camps.  Wandering skeletons, zombies, griffons, and air elementals can all wipe you out.<br><br><B>Innothule Swamp and Feerrott Forest</B> - Level 5 is a turning point.  This is probably the best time to  get a pair of netted gloves, allowing you to hit creatures that can only be hit by magic weapons.  I ran/sneaked to the Innothule Swamp and the Feerrott and hunted froglok tads.  By the time I was done, I had almost a complete set of netted armor to go with the gloves (same AC as cloth, but lighter)  In the forest, beware of Ogre Guards, and in the Swamp watch out for Troll Slayers, and Kobolds.<br><br><B>Misty Thicket</B> - It's great XP even up to level 12 or 13, very safe, and you can work on getting a squad ring (one charge of an 80-point heal).  Added benefit is you 'might' get a chance to loot the goblin alchemist for part of the Treant Fist quest.  It can be a bit dangerous to run there, so if you have equipment you want to keep, bank it and pick it up in Rivervale (Iksar need not apply).  Get bound in Rivervale when you reach the area.<br><br><B>Northern Desert of Ro</B> - jackels, giant beetles, orc raiders and work up to a dervish group.  Watch out for the mummies, ghouls, madman casters, Dorn at first dervish camp, and the sand giants.  People often pull mummies, ghouls, dervishes, madmen and Dorn to the zone line, so you might run into them wandering back to their spawn points.<br><br><B>Kunark - Field of Bones</B> - Between the edge of the desert area out to the reservoir, and start close to the edge inside the northern end of the reservior. <br><B>Kunark - Lake of Ill Omen</B> - you can start soloing small sarneks, sabertooth cubs, and some goblins (like scouts), along with decaying skeletons.  Watch for wanderers!<br><B>Kunark - Warslilk Woods</B> - you 'might' be able to do small goblin scouts here.  Don't go too far out though.<br><B>Kunark - Swamp of No Hope</B> - tough, but you can pick off some blue /conned skelly types, maybe some frogs, and the lowest carnivorous plants.  Again, watch for wanderers.<br><br>==============================================================================<br><B><U>LEVELS 10 - 15</U></B><br><br><B>Blackburrow</B> - It's a great place to solo at level 12-19.  For Level 12-14: Gnoll guardsmen.  For Level 14-17: Elite gnoll guards.<br><br><B>Erud's Crossing</B> - good money hunting Wisps, collect the lightstones and greater lightstones, and make yourself some good money. Be careful to only pull one wisp at a time.  Be sure to bring bandages - this is good soloing at around level 12 or so. Don't mess with spiders - they have a nasty poison and aren't worth the trouble.  Around the back of the island (from the dock) you'll see a shipwreck out in the ocean - don't swim too close as three Undead Sailors spawn near it and they will make short work of you at these levels.  Watch out for Island madmen; and Fire Elementals, which have damage shield which you can kill yourself on.  Greater Lightstones can be handed in to the North Karana Gypsy ?Myrsilla? for a research tome which can be sold for 8-9pp depending on your Charisma, and good experience.  Also, the dark elf female vendor in Southern Desert of Ro will take them, AND give you good dark elf faction.<br><br><B>Qeynos Catacombs</B> -  Solo 11 - 12+ kill smugglers, for the adventurous, you could then try to do the sharks. <br><br><B>Misty Thicket</B> -  It's still good XP, even up to  level 12 or 13, very safe; and you can work on getting a squad ring (one charge of an 80-point heal).  Added benefit is you 'might' get a chance to loot the goblin alchemist for part of the Treant Fist quest.<br><br><B>East Commonlands</B> - Singles of air elementals (magic only), Skeletons, Zombies, Giant Scarabs, Young Kodiaks, Giant Spiders, and Wisps (magic only) can be done  (barely) solo at level 10. Much better at level 12 and up until they turn low green. Group the orc camps. Avoid the ghouls (magic only?) and lesser mummies unless grouped with casters who can unroot and undisease you. Also, the darksomething<br>snakes and asps are good xp if you have someone to unpoison you. Several vendors in the zone to sell to and buy food, water, and bandages. Beware of the Griffons! <br><br><B>West Commonlands</B> - Again single Young Kodiaks, Giant Spiders, Wisps can be done  (barely) solo at level 10. Much better at level 12 and up until they turn low green. Some Skeletons are high green and net some xp. Group the orc and dervish camps. Avoid the ghouls (magic only?) and lesser mummies unless grouped with casters who can unroot and undisease you. And again, darksomething snakes are good xp if you have someone to unpoison you. Several vendors around the lake to sell to and buy food, water, and bandages. Beware of the Griffons, Giants (Hill & Nightfall), Kodiaks, Dragoon Gix & Zytle (esp around the lake), and Shadowmen (southern desert area). You can start doing Kodiaks at about level 15 though.<br><br><B>Northern Desert of Ro</B> - Sand Scarabs are the cat's meow here. The ruins have some Skeletons and zombies that are high green and net some xp. Desert tarantulas are good xp for 10-12 before they start going low green, but weak poison can occasionally be a problem. Dune tarantulas are good once the desert tarantulas are too low. Madmen are good xp, but watch out as some are casters and will really ruin your day. Giant rattlesnakes are good xp if you have someone to unpoison you.  Avoid ghouls (magic only?), crypt mummies, shriveled mummies unless grouped with casters to unroot & undisease you. Group the dervish camps. However, camp one has the infamous Dorrn B'Dinn (sp) who is impossible at your level and occasionally is dragged off to the Freeport Zone by fleeing players. A couple of vendors you can buy food, water, and bandages from. Beware of Sand Giants and Rathotep!<br><br><B>Oasis of Marr</B> - Do OOM in a group at these levels.  Desert Madmen may look green, but if they are casters you may have trouble keeping up with them. Stay clear of Lockjaw and hunt crocks, caimans, and even go to the orc camp.  If you plan on solo'ing head to Nro or Ecommons.<br><br><B>Faydwer: Steamfont Mountains</B> - Minotaur caves near Ak'Anon are good for groups at this level. Get bound in Akkon and work the entrance of the cave with some friends. At the higher level one can pull from the left tunnel, out into the entranceway. <br><br><B>Faydwer - Unrest:</B> great, awsome exp at Level 14/15<br><br><B>Kunark: Lake of Ill Omen</B>  - Try moving a little farther out or grouping the goblins in the nearer ruins.<br><br><B>Kunark: Field of Bones</B> - You can group most of the things in FoB in the reservoir.  The stuff on the other side of the reservoir near the Kaesora entrance will probably be a little tough though.<br><br><b>Kunark - Kurn's Tower:</b> Level 12 to 16, first floor apart from Greater Scalebones (which just about beat you), so at level 20 most of these will be green, as the only whites are the GSB. <br> <br>==============================================================================<br><B><U>LEVELS 15 - 20 </U></B><br><br><B>Blackburrow</B> - It's a great place to solo at level 12-19.  From 15 - 17: Guardsmen.  From 17 - 20: Guardsmen, Elites, Brewer, Commanders, and Shaman.  Plus you can take the gnoll teeth back and forth from BB to Halas via Everfrost zone.<br><br><B>East Karana</B> - I don't recommend this place solo until you get feign death at level 17 and have it trained up to 50 in skill.  However, East Karanas offers lots of opportunities. Gnoll reavers for the lower levels and Undead reavers for the 20's.  A group can switch from hunting Undead's at night to gorge hounds in day.  Carrion spiders drop good amount of silk (usually).  Lots of places to sell and not too far from a zone in case of emergencies. <br><br><B>Everfrost</B> - At 17:  Woolly Mammoth Calves are awesome experience. I do about 3 in a row and the bind/mend/rest to max hp before doing it again. Roughly 1 bubble per 45 to 60 minutes.  Orc Mountainers are also good, if you can find enough.  Orc Shamans are okay (make sure you swap the Rusty Shoulderpads off and put a Cured Silk Mantle on or their spells will freeze you solid.<br><br><B>Oasis of Marr</B> - Bind in East Freeport and run down the coast to Oasis. If you are at lower levels (15 to 17) group and take on any caimans or crocodiles even those of the deep water variety.  18 is good solo, and at 19 group with a level 15 or 16 healer type  (Druid or Cleric) for very high turnover low downtime (1.5 bubbles XP per hour).  Watch out for Sand Giants, Specters, and Lockjaw.  Can be heavily camped, loot is poor.   Other good spot in OOM is  just west of gypsy camp, along the shore of the lake, the orc highway.  As you head west from gypsies you are following the coast of the lake, when the lake turns south, keep heading west.  After a large pillar on your left the orc highway begins. Get in a good group at level 15-17 and stay on the edge pulling orc warriors and priests. With a good group there is very little downtime and the orcs spawn almost constantly.  I've seen 3-4 groups camped there and sharing without going hungry for some kills.  At the higher end, levels 18-20.  There is an orc temple at the north end of the orc highway, it spawns 5 orcs plus all the orcs walking north & south on the highway.  Warning: they will pile up on you if you're not killing fast enough on the highway.  Several vendors in zone to sell to.<br><br><b>Lake Rathetear:</b>  You can solo the hermit in the corner<br><br><B>Faydwer: Crushbone</B> - Get into a throne room group and kill Legionnaires, emissary's, royal guards etc. Good XP and by the time you get to 17 you can solo to 18 very quickly.  If you can get into a good group of 17/18's you can camp the tower for Crush, The Prophet and D'Vinn.  Gather all the Legionnaire shoulder pads and Crushbone belts you can find and put them in the bank for use in the Kaladim warrior guild quest (good bonus XP and coin).  Watch out for the Orc Warlord if you see him kill him and hope and pray he has the Bracer of Battle (Rare drop).  If he does auction for the tunic Emperor Crush drops, and make yourself a Screaming Mace (quest), and sell it for about 100pp (or keep it yourself for 1-H Blunt practice).<br><br><B>Kunark: Kurn's Tower</B>  Group the first floor.  Stick to the simple skellies here.  And avoid the desire to wander!<br><br>============================================================================<br><B><U>LEVELS 20 - 25</U></B><br><br><B>East Karana</B> - Solo gorge hounds still good XP but no loot, Lion Patri/Matriarchs, Gnoll/Undead<br>Gnoll Reavers and even blue /con Griffawns, if you can get some buffs.  They're vendors here selling muffins and water. <br><br><B>Gorge of King Xorbb</B> - about level 22 and up, you can solo muddite elders and gorge minotaurs while waiting for the Gorge Alchemist for the Treant Fist Quest.  Speaking of which...<br><br><B><U>TREANT FISTS</U></B> - Now is the time to do the Gorge and Misty Alchemists.  You can solo both of these at this level.  The Cube and the Captain are not very soloable at these levels, although at 26 I was able to do them without too much trouble, so you may be able to take them at 25.<br><br><B>High Keep</B> - Great place to get good XP and cash.  Group with others and concentrate on the Lookout room just down the stairs from the Bank. This is a great spot with a bind, the bank, vendors, and guards handily in one place.<br><br><B>North Karana</B> - Griffawns (mederately tough solo), occasional Wisps, and Pincer (easy), Borer (easy), and Scythe (hard if less than level 22)(excellent xp).<br><br><B>Ocean of Tears</B> - For levels 23-25+: solo gargoyles in OOT.  Fantastic XP at 23 (if a little slow because of the down-time) and great loot. Takes about 60-65 kills to go from 23 to 24.  Though the island gets a bit busy during peak times, you can gain good XP and great loot during your stay there.  Gargoyles drop an eye roughly every two gargs, and sell for 9pp+ each.<br><br><B>Runnyeye</B> - If you group, you get decent XP feign pulling. You can camp the Warlord room or the BIBS with a group, or even solo (rather hard at 25 and down). Pull Guards outside of Warlord room at the lower levels, then later Elites and Dazeds, just be wary of the casters (Guards & Elites are occasionally casters too - you have been warned!).  You can solo the Cube at 23, with good Cleric buffs and Enduring breathe, but only if you can split Sludge the Aqua goblin away from it. <br><br><B>Solusek A</B> - Good spot if grouped; roughly 3 bubbles of XP in 4 hours, plus 30pp and bags full of fine steel weapons & some monk-usable armor (Ring of the Goblin Lords - AC4, +3 STR, +3 INT).<br><br><B>South Karana</B> - For levels 21-23: Aviak village. If you can, fall into a group in the penthouse. When not in a group, since everyone else will be camping the ground points, suggest running the loop up the ramp to find and pull darters and rooks.  Also, always pull to the outside of the village, avoiding those resting, KS-ers, and other spawns which might complicate the battle. <br><br><B>Faydwer: Castle Mistmoore</B> - Reportedly solo??? Gargoyles.  Note: MM is a rather dangerous place to try soloing at these levels, try grouping first until you are absolutely certain you want to go it alone.<br><br><B>Faydwer: Unrest</B> You can go from 20 or so to 24 in Unrest and have an absolute blast. Start pulling (and learning!) ghouls, lesser mummies (?), and dark bone skeletons from the first floor of the house.  Recommend standing near the fountains and pulling out the front door. Be careful pulling from the ballroom or the room that's "behind" the ballroom (that is, the long room that's towards the back of the house, under the stairs to the 2nd floor), as you can aggro about 3 full rooms of MOBs and get a real nasty train.  Once you get up to 21 or 22, you can expect to move up into the Hand room, which is on the second floor, or the Ghoul Magi room, also on the second floor.  Hand room seems easier, as the ghoul magi room can get trained easily by trains from the bar & knight rooms that have chased a group to the zone and are returning.   If you are outside the house at these levels, move around to the side (along the wall across from the big deck) or kitty-corner along the wall to that deck and pull from the 2nd floor. That porch is a great spot to feign split.<br><br><B>Odus: Toxullia Forest</B> - The Hole patch in late June 2000 added a bunch of earth elementals to the southern part of this zone.  Area runs roughly on a line from the north side of bridge to the docks all the way to the southern zone wall. These elementals range in levels from about 15/17 to 22/23, possibly 24.  They are fairly plentiful, and yield good XP and loot. They drop from a dozen copper to 5 plat, and occasional FS weapons (Now you know why that weight reducing bag quest is in the Kerra zone!) Average is about 5gp to 1pp each, so they will at least keep you in bandages, unlike gorge hounds in EK. They DO show up in the water, so watch out when swimming over to Kerra Isle/Ridge. <br><br><B>Kunark: Lake of Ill Omen</B> - Incredible XP with the goblins, whether you're at the ruins or the goblin hole, all is great XP.  Reportedly you can solo them (Battlemasters and Skirmishers?) at level 25 (NOT the Warriors or Warlords unless grouped).  Also, lower level Sarnaks (again, NOT Recruits unless grouped) are great XP.  You can also try sabertooth tigers, although they're harder than goblins.  Not to be repetitious, but don't try sabertooth grimlakin unless grouped.<br><br><B>Kunark: The Overthere</B> -  Very good for levels 20-24 (BTW, can start as low as level 18) ...lots of blues and good XPs...most you can solo just fine..just be sure to stay on the Warslilk Woods side, between the WW zone entrance and the beach, and stay away from the Sarnak camps.  Rhinos, stoneglints, stonepeeps, succubants (barbed, thorny, prickly) all great XPs.

At these levels, group and focus on the mobs down the stairs (i.e. Pickclaw goblins in the basement of HK). A group can progress from the warrior room to the raider room. The big advantages are that you can get bound in the zone, there are guards nearby, there is a merchant who will turn things into cash, and there is a bank right around the corner. <br><br><B>Lower Guk</B> - Grouped, the zone entrance to the live is an excellent place to gain XP in a hurry. You will need a way to invis in and somebody to snare (bring a friend), but the XP just keeps flying in.<br><br><B>Lost Temple of Cazic Thule</B> - Get your feign death skill up fast, start a group in a dead end (not the first chinsie one to the left of the door, the one further down) to facilitate better splitting of the mobs. You can rock the pulling here.   Have a couple tanks, Druid, cleric, and an enchanter. Pull it to group, don't over aggro. Once it is at half, run, get another, wash/rinse/repeat. <br><br><B>Runnyeye</B> - King and Captain rooms.. This dungeon also has the advantage of having merchants and a banker right there. You don't have to be able to hold the rooms, just FD pull the Elite guards out one at a time (and of course the King and Captain when they spawn). It's even doable if one or both rooms are camped. If camped, just ask if you can join - if they say no, then ask if you can pull an occasional one from them. Most are cool about it - even if they say no you can sometimes "borrow" an occasional one (Pull from the opposite side . Loot is pretty good too - the Elite's drop Blackened Iron pieces. At level 27, almost nothing aggros except the Elite's, King and Captain (occasional guard, but easily to FD hop away). Also, the Gelatinous Cube still gives XP at 27 as does Sludge Dankmire. One drawback: Watch out for Lord Borxx! He spawns in King room and will take you out in no time flat (red at level 27).<br><br><B>Solusek A</B> - Wonderful place for this level range. Don't suggest going to the king area until you have a couple level 30+ people in your group personally but with an enchanter and maybe a monk for pulling it would be doable at around 28 or so. Best place to outfit mid-level monk: Foreman's Tunic, Drakehide Arms, Drakehide Leggings, Drakehide Belt, Ring of the Goblin Lords, Turquois Eyepatch, Obsidian Bead Earring, Kobold Boots, Glowing Stone Band, Momento Box, Runed Lava Pendant, Impskin Gloves.<br>The goblin difficulty is as follows. Easiest to hardest: <br>                      - Young Goblins (Start going green at around 25) <br>                      - Cinder Goblins (Start going green at around 25-28) <br>                      - Flame Goblins (Start going green at 30+) <br>                      - Fire Goblins (Start going green 35+) <br>                      - Inferno Goblins (All still blue at 35) <br>                      - Solusek Goblins (All still blue at 35) <br>                      - Solusek Champions (All still blue at 35) <br><br><B>Faydwer: Mistmoore</B> - Reportedly is a great place to be level 25+. Easy grouping and everyone there loves monks! <br><br><B>Faydwer: Unrest</B> - great place for XP and loot in this lvl range, and soloable. With a little work, you can pull singles out of the house where others get awful Trains, you can camp the rooms in the house. At high 20s you can also go for a  basement group and start to hunt Hags and maybe the ghost (in a good group). <br><br><B>Kunark: Dalnir</B> - Not really soloable at 25-26, although you might be able to take down some coerced minions. Nibblers and Goos are real tough, and Kly are out of the question unless buffed and grouped. Frequently see a mix of high-twenties to low-thirties in the dungeon, so it's more like a 28-35 dungeon. Both the 1st and 2nd floor are great for levels 28-33 or so, and if you get in over your head it is very easy to escape. As a note, unless the Kly is camped you CAN NOT "flop" your way to the zone on the third floor; as The Kly, and his placeholder, The Kly Overseer, proc 500+ ice damage with their melee attacks. They'll see through your Sneak too. (Probably get 2 hits and maybe 3, so were talking 1500+ possible damage here.) Ergo, one round equals instant death for those below the 40's. Also, the goo hit for around 300 to 600 with spells (toned down from the murderers that Verant accidently turned them into).<br><br><B>Kunark: Lake of Ill Omen</B> - Sarnak Recruits! Easy to go from 25 to 30 in less than a week of playing (and mid 27 to 30 in a two days, but who's counting). They still give decent XP at 30 solo (find a shaman buddy 29+ and hell level will fly), are easily doable by a group of 22+, and drop good coin and sarnak loot.<br>                      ============================================================================<br><br><B><u>LEVELS 30 - 35</u></B><br><br><B>Cazic Thule</B><br><br><B>Highkeep</B><br><br><B>Lower Guk </B>- Dead side (grouped)<br><br><B>Runneye</B> - King Room<br><br><B>Solusek A</B> - Goblins<br><br><B>Solusek B</B> - the Pool area (Grouped)<br><br><B>Faydwer: Level 32-34, solo: Lesser Faydark</B> - Faeries and faerie guards OR undead sprite horrors  and undead sprite guards if zone is in undead mode. Mushroom town at 900-1100 by 3600 or so. Ranger buildings in the south-central part of the zone for buying supplies and selling loot in L Fay hands down is the best place.<br>1. You can solo them (although Gearheart is tough) - and get all of them individually<br>2. 6 minute spawn time on 5 of the spawn, about 30 minutes on the Princess<br>3. The XPs ROCK - almost a bubble per hour.<br>4. They're not camped often<br>5. Bring a friend - doesn't matter class, healer a bonus, but you can clear all spawn with a magician with only bandaging in between kills.<br>6. Tower is nearby if you want to kill brownies.<br>7. Watch out for brownie outcasts. They are sure killers 2/3rds of the time to solo monks.<br><br><B>Kunark: Dalnir's</B> - in a full, or close to full, group. Only hunt on the first or second floor, and be sure to time spawns (13 minute respawn time), ANY two casters can be tough, three is practically death. Casters are coerced necros and clerics, and Kly Invokers and Evokers.<br><br><B>Kunark: Firiona Vie</B> - Drachnids, they are casters, so get in a group. Follow the coast out of the Elven Outpost, go around the edge of the coast by the waterfall and giant statue, and you can sit on one of the sand peninsulas and pull forever.<br><br><B>Kunark: Frontier Mountains</B> - Giant outpost, get a partner or go with three and you can guarantee constant pulling.   Need to feign split them, of course, if there are not many groups pulling from there.<br><br><B>Kunark: Lake of Ill Omen</B> - Solo sarnak recruits, as you go in through the gate of the fortress, head to the right and feign on the slope there. This is a safe spot to rest and pull to. It is easy to pick off singles, you don't even need to feign pull (but it is sometimes useful). Fight them right in the corner, if they run, the wall confuses them and gives you time to kill them before they get too far. A pumice will also be handy incase one of the shaman types are around sowing the regular recruits. Bring bandages!<br><br><B>Kunark: Warslik's Woods</B> - Solo giants at the fort. Every 100 to 200 drop a Forest Loop and XP is good. Bit of a run for humans back to FV for selling loot and buying bandages,shuriken, food & drink; plus it's often camped. <br><br>==============================================================================<br><br><B><U>LEVELS 35 - 40</U></B><br><br><b>West Commonlands:</B> Shadowmen are blue & high green - split & kill for xp.<br><br><B>Cazic Thule</B> - Fairly easy. The gators are pretty good from 38-40.  There are 3 gators down a well which you can find by climbing up one of the ladders in the main courtyard.   There is also a gator heaven called the blue pool and the green pool. To get there pull a U-turn at the courtyard entrance and go up the ladder through the door and down the stairs to a well. This will lead you to the blue pool. All but one of these gators will be green at 38 and it is normally the 1st one you will find. Pull it back up the well and kill it. Swim to the top of the blue pool and you will find a tunnel; which leads to the green pool. There are 3 gators in this tunnel which are normally 30 to 33 so they can be hard to split sometimes. Pull one at a time back up the well if you have to cause they will roam up and down the hall and join in.  When you kill the 1st one start your clock because it will spawn in 20 mins again.  If you have time to spare you can pull blue gators out of the green pool and fear them down the hall to the blue pool. When fear runs out run back to the green pool and repeat so you have some land to chase them on.  At 40 all but 1 or 2 of the green pool gators were green but the 3 gators in the hall were normally blue.  Be careful.  At the bottom of the green pool can sometimes be a steel golem. It is about 35 and hits rather hard. Other times it can be a judicator lizzy or a champion.<br><br><B>High Keep</B> - Raider Room<br><br><B>Innothule Swamp</B> - Shadowmen are blue & high green - split & kill for xp.<br><br><B>Kithicor Forest</B> - Shadowmen are blue & high green - split & kill for xp.<br><br><B>Lower Guk</B><br><br><B>Mistmoore Castle</B> - levels 35 and 36 go fast here.  Solo in the Grave Yard. Grouped in the Secret Room / Torture Room or Fully Grouped in the Tower(Garton). You can also solo Enynti at level 35 for the Rune of Fortune needed for the Incandescent Mask (good monk-usable Int/Cha item); but it'll take several feigns to get there, full health and ready mend, and waiting for various anticilles to be out of aggro range in order to kill her and feign off her guardian gargoyles<br><br><B>Nagafen's Lair</B> AKA Sol B<br><br><B>Najena</B> (easy) -  have no idea what kind of XP you can get there at these levels.<br><br><B>Permafrost</B><br><br><B>Solusek's Eye</B> AKA Sol A - soloing is fast in the barroom for levels 35 and 36.  Clockworks are good from 39-41 if you don't mind the bad faction hits.  Another good spot in SolA is the goblin merchant room, if you fight behind the counter the goblins would stay and fight to the death most of the times instead of fleeing. Besides there are no other mobs in that room so I even feel safe to go AFK in there.<br><br><B>South Karana</B> - Shadowmen are blue & high green - split & kill for xp.<br><br><B>Southern Desert of Ro</B> - Sand Giants.  Looks like all the vendors got upgraded into the usual guard death machines.  Watch out for things conning lower than they really are.  Terrorantula conned white at 37, but hard to loot because it's so big - use levitate or turn Run off and nudge back and forth until you hit it.  Do the Ancient Cyclops with a group to beat the Free-for-allers and get your Journeyman Boots.<br><br><B>Splitpaw Lair</B><br><br><B>Steamfont Mtns</B> - Minotaur Lords are blue at lvl 35 and can be soloed fairly easily.  They spawn relatively quickly, but share a place holder (a minotaur slaver, which really slows down XP), and usually have a Mino Axe, if you want loot.  2 spawn points, 6 minutes each. Just be careful of people training Meldrath on you.  If you wish to solo both spawns, your ID will need to be high, and you will need to know how to use it to fear kite and you will need Jboots/SoW, cause those cows are fast. <br><br><B>Kunark: Dalnir's</B> 2nd floor you can solo.  Or group as you like. 3rd floor you'd better group.  You 'might' be able to solo if you bring a tink bag each for invis potions, pumice, and bandages (But who can afford 3 tink bags at 35?)<br><br><B>Kunark: Warslik's Woods </B> Only some evergreen forest giants, and some skulking brutes will /con blue.  Everything else is green.  Except for the Goblin Graknist (sp) who is too high to solo at this point.<br>==============================================================================<br><B><U>LEVELS 40 - 45</U></B><br><br><B>Cazic Thule</B>, the Pyramid - All fanatics, Zealots and Judiciars conned blue, even some protectors. Very easy blues, good XP & loot.  Ground level of pyramid has at least 12 static spawns and 3 wanderers. Each level of the pyramid had at least 2 wandering mobs with the top having 3 plus a crusader (also blue). All the mobs fell for FD every time and have very small aggro radious at this level. Bring 2 full bags of bandages if possible and lots of food, I was able to do this as I am the lucky owner of some tink bags but I would gladly have gone overweight to have been able to stay there.<br><br><B>Cities</B>:  Guards (May be suicide due to recent modifications - don't try solo)<br> - Freeport: the bard gm outside the guildhouse in North Freeport, pull across the street and watch out for guards.<br><B>Erud's Crossing</B> - Killer Sharks (not good solo)<br><B>Kedge Keep</B> (tough)<br><B>Kithicor Forest</B><br><B>Lower Guk</B><br><B>Mistmoore Castle</B><br><B>Nagafen's Lair (Sol B)</B> (tough) - kobolds<br><B>Permafrost</B> (easy?)<br><B>Sol A</B> - Clockworks <br>Classification of Clockworks:<br>- A is a standard warrior<br>- B has a force back module which will push you back into lava if you a silly enough to fight with you back to the lava<br>- C has a frost module which is a weak cold base spell they are normally the easiest<br>Then they are ranked on toughness:<br>- C is the easiest up to 28 to 30<br>- M is harder at 30 to 32<br>- X is the hardest at 32 to 34 - These are the ones you'll probably be getting XP from.<br><B>Splitpaw Lair</B> (easy)<br><B>Steamfont Mts</B> - Mino Lords (One at a time, using ID, will need Jboots/SoW to keep up)<br><br><br>==============================================================================<br><B>LEVELS 45 - 50</B><br><br><B>Guards</B> everywhere (Recently upgraded and probably too tough for soloists) <br><B>Kedge Keep</B><br><B>Kithicor Forest</B> (easy)<br><B>Lower Guk</B> (at 46 able to solo & control the entire Elder room & got xp there until 48th)<br><B>Mistmoore Castle</B><br><B>Nagafen's Lair (Sol B)</B><br><B>Ocean Of Tears</B> - sea furies<br><B>Plane of Fear</B> (tough)<br><B>Plane of Hate</B> (tough)<br><B>Plane of Air</B> (tough)<br><B>Sol A</B> - Pretty much green although some xp<br><B>Rathe Mountains</B> - Hill Giants<br><br><B>Kunark - Dreadlands</B> - near Karnor's Castle zone has many wandering mobs blue at 45<br><B>Kunark - Lake of Ill Omen</B> - Underwater Goblins<br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uzinj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zinj</A> at: 3/21/02 9:48:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tanuki>Tanuki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/7/00 5:19:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> more very useful places..</span><hr size=1> 35-40<br><br>Kunark Overthere:<br>Grouping at the ledge near zone to FM.. or soloing blues using ID along the edges of the zone.

Loot is not that great but tons of mobs to kill, lots of open areas to set up in.  Also there are no wanderers just statics so a breeze to pull.  Plus you are often the only ones in the dungeon so no figthing over mobs or dealing with other peoples mistakes (a big plus in my book).  Although we did not go there till too late, droga would also be good around those levels (just a tad higher perhaps).  All of the goblins you would ever want to kill (and then some) and better loot than Nurga.  Level 40-45 the library in Kaesora is great.

There are level 1 things right near the outlying buildings, and work their way up, as you move away, until you're hunting around the northern edge of the Lake itself at around 14 to 18.<br><br>Once you have feign death, practice it up to full, or close to it, and you can then move to the happy hunting grounds, on the eastern Lake side, between the stream, and the Windmill.  Avoid going near the buildings near the Lake, and hunt the wanderers.  Pick your targets carefully, and be ready to feign at any time, even if it means losing the kill, but it was easy exp up until around 25 to 28, when most things there turn green and you have to run around a bit to find the blues.  The trick is to pick on the low blues, not the high blues, during this time, and you'll do well.<br><br>At this point, you can move on to the south side.  There's a nice little goblin building with a four spawn in it.  With FD, you can break it up and get a nice spot going, or you can just pick off the wanderers if a Warlord spawns in the building, or it's taken.  Sarnak recruits go nearly all green at 30, but Goblin Warlords are low blue still.<br><br>The other places you can go to at around 27 to 30 are:<br>The goblin tunnels on the north side of the zone.  Lots of things you can pull out and FD, then pick off the remaining on.<br>A group of buildings south of the Goblin tunnels, which has a 4 spawn of warriors.<br>The area around the Sarnak fort, between the buildings and the windmill, generally have wandering Recruits, Warlords, various skeletons and the occasional Grimalkin.  I avoided those last two, though.  Too much damage, for too little return, unless I was full, and had a mend ready (i.e. desperate).<br><br>I've hardly ever done the fort itself, in a group or not, and I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br><br>Ainjel<br>Level 31 monk, moving out of Lake for greener pastures.<br>The Rathe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usnoogins47.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snoogins47</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(12/30/00 3:41:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Places to Hunt from Level 1 to 60</span><hr size=1> What a great post!  Finally somebody has sung the praises of sol A!!  I love that zone!  Virtually got 23-42 there (with 34-36 in dalnir getting my crescent)  <br><br>At 29 or 30 you can solo the Foreman/Predator and get hella exp and hella loot too (watch for flame wizzies, they'll hurt)  Easy to feign split if you make sure you take the hidden tunnels<br><br>(I'll try to explain the best way to get to the foreman here)<br><br>Zone in from lava, go down the stairs.  Through the crack.  And straight through one room.  You should be on a ledge.  Down the ledge is the door to the king/bar area.  To the right is what i've dubbed the &quot;rug room&quot; and zone to sol b.  The small bridge to your RIGHT (made out of stone, torch at one end) is nearly completely safe.  No wanderers, and most trains won't aggro onto you if you stay right by the torch.)  <br><br>Okay now through the crack, and to your left, there will be a threeway intersection.  To your left is a bridge, with some spawns.  Go across, and make a quick right.  Here's the hard part to describe, and I'm sorry I'm doing this all from memory.  After the right, keep your eye on the left wall.  Shortly after the turn there is a wall that you can walk through.  Feign off the gobbos you picked up, and walk straight.  <br><br>You'll pass one right turn (leads to gnomes/bots) but keep going straight.  Eventually there will be stairs, and above them a corner.  Stand in the corner and turn left.  You will see a wall, and a turn to your right.  Straight through the wall ahead of you is the foreman room (square with three gobbos and a well.)  Split them, and try to fight them on the stairs.  Through the other door in the foreman room is a big ledge with stairs up it.  The kobold predator spawns on top of the ledge, and two goblins down below.  You can split these guys to the same spot, or to the foreman room.<br><br>Now heres an important thing to remember.  From the corner where you can split to, facing the foreman room, there is a small turn ahead and to the right.  In a pinch, you can turn there, follow the hall around, and go through the wall to a room with three doors.  Singe spawns here, but some tougher goblins do as well.  Take the door on your left and follow the tunnel to another zone to sol b.  <br><br>Okay sorry if that was hard to follow, but I figured I should try to share my methods with others, because I've heard people who don't even know what Sol A is, and it is by far my favorite zone.<br><br>BTW:<br>Foreman drops Foremans Tunic (nice) as common, and obsidian scimitar as his rare<br><br>Kobold Predator drops Kobold Boots as his common, and obsidian shard as his rare<br><br>Singe drops obsidian bead hoop as his common, and drakescale belt as his rare (both are decent for us, and nice if you can pick em up while you're hunting for exp)<br><br>Also if you can find the goblin merchant (he's hard to get to, but it's doable) you can sneak behind him and buy bandages.  <br><br>Take care fellow monks, and happy gobbo slaying <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Breuce Campbell<br>46th Monk<br>Innoruuk <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzenordxintel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zenor DXintel</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(1/1/01 3:03:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Places to Hunt from Level 1 to 60</span><hr size=1> Well, as a 53 monk, I'm able to solo in lower guk rather easily. i get good exp off of kor wizards and Dars., Solb is awesome exp but they have mobs that can dot you.

Most orcs were blue to me at 36-37 and I was able to easily take them down with very little down time for sick solo experience. There are plenty of safe spots to sit. Too hard to describe...explore it a bit and you'll see.<br>Also possible to solo snow cougars in Iceclad and Eastern Wastes (with the possibility of nice earring drops), though they hit pretty hard and their friends tend join in, which is bad. The Snow Dervishes don't seem to be worth the trouble -- they hit too hard and drop nothing but an occasional snowball.<br>Tizmaks in Great Divide are great (especially the wanderers, since it's tough to split the ones that stand at the mouth of the caves). They don't drop any coin, which is sort of nice, and the dwarf city is about 30 seconds away so it's easy to unload the armor and weapons once you're overloaded. ID sticks pretty well on them, but it can be tough to follow them if they run up/down the hillside, and with three cave entrances it's possible for them to stumble close to their buddies and train you. You can also feign-flop the guards off and enter the tunnels where there are plenty of good places to sit safely. <br>Also in GD, the giant wolves are quite doable, and there's a spot near the obelisk (on the way to EW zone and near the city) where you can sit/bandage without fear of wanderers. Giants are blue, but nasty -- avoid them.<br>It's easy to find a pickup group in any of the above zones (Iceclad is worst of three, as everyone seems to sit around tower and igloo area farming cougar loots). GD is especially nice since high levels come to zone to fight the wurms, which means SoW-potion-capable shaman and ex-rez clerics if things go really bad. <br>Haven't tried soloing the bears in GD yet (many yellows among the blues), but they can be done easily with a group. Watch out for the wurms, which con blue but hit red.<br>The mines in the dwarf city are good, though rather twisty and narrow and hard to run in if you need to back out and feign split a pair. Haven't explored them much but plan to -- so close to the bank you'll think you're in Highpass again, but without all the whining, bickering and waiting lists.<br>Side note: The only merchant I found in Thurg that sells bandages is the guy to your right as you walk into the big warrior's guild thing. <br>Cheers<br>Zenfoo<br>38<br>Norrathian Legion -- Bristlebane<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uruadhin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruadhin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(1/30/01 7:51:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> fighting from 23-31 for chaotic neutral monks</span><hr size=1> I found that the best exp by far for 23-31 is treants in S. Karana and druids in E. Karana.  Yes, you take some major faction hits with the druids, but IMO it's well worth it.  Most all druid evacs are going to be to WC or DL, and there are no druids there to harass you when you evac from a bad pull.  Also, at about 35 or so, it's pretty easy to solo the unkempt druids in Rathe Mtns to get that faction back up.  The unnamed druids should all be green, so they won't jump in to help and the named unkempts were warmly to me because of all the good druids I'd killed.  You'll get your druid faction up to at least dubious before your unkempt faction will drop to KoS.
