A look ahead...</span><hr size=1> Well well, here we are again. Training camps are firing up all over the country. People are starting to settle in at new locker rooms, or getting used to the new additions in thier own. This year's re-organization swaps some teams around and adds one, bringing the total to 32 total teams. Here's my division-by-division breakdown, and some *highly subject to change* predictions. <br><br>AFC East: <br>Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, NYJets. <br>Buffalo has made some good moves in the off-season, like signing Drew Bledsoe. Mid-par year while the core players get used to each other. Miami has finally picked up a decent running back in Ricky Williams, too bad they still need a real quarterback. New England played hard last year and took the whole shebang, now they're betting on Tom Brady to keep it together against defenses that have spent six months studying him on the tape. The Jets are betting on Vinny T, and will ride Curtis Martin into the postseason. Division will be won by Miami or New England with about a 9/7 or 10/6 record. <br><br>AFC North: <br>Baltimore Ravens. Cincinnati Bengals. Cleveland Browns. Pittsburg Steelers. <br>The Ravens got &quot;pwned&quot; this offseason. They lost most of their starting lineup to free agency and cap squirming. Cinci and Cleveland bad to mediocre offseasons, without changes to the front offices, where it was needed most. Basically 2/3rds of the Pittsburg team could get replaced by nursing home standins and they'd still win the division. <br><br>AFC South: <br>Houston Texans. Indianapolis Colts. Jacksonville Jaguars. Tennessee Titans. <br>Houston is using the tried and true method of buying a trip to the Super Bowl, only to let the franchise wither and die from cap problems in 3 years. Indy will do well under Tony Dungy in a couple years, but not this one. Jacksonville...they'll win one game for every game Fred Taylor manages to hit 100 yards and NOT dislocate something wiping his ass in the shower. Ditto with the Titans and Eddie George. <br><br>AFC West: <br>Denver Broncos. Kansas City. Oakland Raiders. San Diego. <br>If Brian Griese gets his crap together, and Eddie Mac stays healthy, the Broncos will be a force to be reconed with. If not, well you get the idea. Kansas City = Priest Holmes and Tony Gonzalas carrying Trent Green. Somewhere around .500 this year. Unless Doug Flutie gets VERY lucky or Drew Brees wins the lotto, Oakland steamrolls the division while letting the local girl scouts play in their places most of the year. <br><br>NFC East: <br>Dallas Cowboys. NYGiants. Philadelphia Eagles. Washington Redskins. <br>Dallas will win a couple games, and hope to god Emmit doesn't get hurt too early in the season. Tiki Barber and Michael Strahan keep pissing and moaning at each other and hold morale down, to maybe .500 or so for the year. Philly will play strong on McNabb's shoulders and choke early in the playoffs. Still better than Spurrier's new toys, AKA Washington, but watch for them in a seasoin or three. <br><br>NFC North: <br>Chicago Bears. Detroit Lions. Green Bay Packers. Minnesota Vikings. <br>The Black and Blue division will live up to it's name, as probably the most hotly contested division in football. Minnesota is banking on Culpepper's arm and piped-in noise from the dome to win games, and their daunting wet-paper-towel defense will assist their humiliating season. Detroit, last year's best playing crap-record team, made some good offseason moves, so look for the M&amp;M club to surprise some people and finish around .500. Chicago is solid and will fight tooth and nail with Green Bay, hoping their staunch defense can win the day. Green Bay's bold yet confusing (to some) offseason acquisitions are a gamble for Mike Sherman, and will either pay off big or lose big. Look for Green Bay to finsih 11/5 or 10/6, with da Bears one game (or less) behind. <br><br>NFC South: <br>Atlanta Falcons. Carolina Panthers. New Orleans Saints. Tampa Bay Buccaneers.. <br>The yawningist devision in football, with a slight lead over the AFC north. Atlanta needs new leadership in the front office...sign HUGE for Warrick Dunn then draft a first round running back. Rigggghhhhhtttt. Carolina *snore* Chris Weinke is proving he's as fast a QB study as a student in Florida. New Orleans has occasional glimpses of greatness that they seem determined to trade away every offseason. Tampa will get interesting now with Chucky....erm John Gruden at the helm, and will win the division at 8/8 or 9/6. <br><br>NFC West: <br>Arizona Cardinals. St. Louis Rams. San Fransisco 49ers. Seattle Seahawks. <br>Arizona is battling Seattle for the &quot;worst....leadership...EVAHR!&quot; title out west. That leaves San Fran and St. Louis to fight it out for the division. Both lost some key players in the offseason but have solid teams. Marshall Faulk is the deciding factor here, with the Rams taking the division by two games from SanFran, with 13/3 or 12/4 finishing. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udemeoquell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DemeoQuell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 694<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/8/02 1:12:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NFL Football. A look ahead...</span><hr size=1> OK, before i start let me say that ive been a Bucs fan since, well since i can remember.<br><br>Here are some things that are so godawful wrong with the Bucs (who have a team good enough to win a Super Bowl):<br><br>1) They are a DEFENSIVE TEAM, always have been, always will be. John Gruden is the absolute WRONG coach for them, period. Shoulda stuck with Dungy guys. They didnt need a coach, they need a off. cord. and a f***ing QB who will actually LEAD THE GOD D*** TEAM. Get Dilfer back jackasses, he was the guy you needed all along (and yes, i do hate brad and rob johnson, thx)<br><br>2) Where in the holy hell do you get off signing ROB JOHNSON? He sucked in Buffalo, hes going to suck in Tampa, end of story. Youd have better luck signing some waste of space like Grbac or something.<br><br>3) This BS between Sapp and KJ needs to stop. I hate to break it to you overpaid slackasses, neither one of you can lead that team. John Lynch has lead the team since he was signed, and i sure as hell hope hes not going anywhere. Get over both your egos and follow instructions for once.<br><br>4) Alstott at TB? Good god man, he weighs like 250, hes going to be out of gas faster than a 79' Deville. Shoulda either kept Dunn or traded for a back a little bigger, but not as big as Alstott. Remember, hes good for those short gains or putting a linebacker in his place. Hes not good for screens like Warrick.<br><br>5) Your playbook is so predictable its rediculous. Run run run run run run run short pass run! Its getting old guys. Wonder why your not getting firsts? THROW THE F***ING BALL! Youve gotta score some TDs, Gramattica cant win every game for you.<br><br>I dont expect them to win the division, i dont even expect them to go 8-8. To many changes to quick guys. <p><center><b><u><a href="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi/yoda.jpg" width="285" height="123" border="0"><br>:: how jedi are you? ::</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uverdigrisrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Verdigris Rex</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/9/02 3:16:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NFL Football.

Anyways, Raiders are going to be a force again this year, I don't understand why people keep talking about age.. their 2 picks this year should learn a freakin tonne from all the veterans, add in all the knowledge Jerry Porter and Markus Knight have been getting from Tim and Jerry, and they'll have 2 more HOF wideouts on their hands!  Wow, I could probably make this several pages long, but I'll stop now.  My play off picks are looking something like this:<br><br>AFC East Division Crown:  Miami Dolphins  -  Even tho Fielder (or whatever his name is) isn't that good of a QB, he is a leader, and he leads his troops very well, add in Ricky and they are a force.  Defence is very solid too.<br><br>AFC North: Pittsburg Steelers  -  The men of steel, as long as Kordel and the Bus play like last year, nothing to worry about<br><br>AFC South:  Indianapolis Colts  -  This is a pretty crappy division, only picking the Colts kuz I love Dungy, great coach, Raiders shoulda made a move for him!<br><br>AFC West:  Raiders  -  Heh, kind of a biased guess tho :P<br><br>NFC East:  Philidelphia Eagles  -  Why didn't they get a Running back?  If they had a good back they'd have a chance at beating St. Louis<br><br>NFC North:  Green Bay Packers  -  Farve is in my mind the best QB ever to play the game, got some talented WRs, Defense is always solid<br><br>NFC South:  New Orleans Saints  -  I honestly don't think Jon Gruden is the answer for Tampa, a QB maybe, but a coach can only do so much with the talent provided, and Tampa has no talent at the QB position.
