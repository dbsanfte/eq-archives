<br>
Upon returning home one day, opening the door, and finding his parents slain, he saw no note, and knew no reason. It seemed that in his familys time of need, that no one had come to help, nor was anyone there now to offer any kind words. <br>
<br>
Now without family or home, his heart gone black from the hurt and the anger, feeling betrayed by those with whom he had shared meal with. He threw off the veil of one that communed with nature, and began down a path filled with thievery and corruption. <br>
<br>
Unbeknownst to him, he began following the path of the rogue, sneaking around corners, fighting any monsters that plagued the land as well as his own accursed memorys that plagued his soul. Attempting to rid himself of the feelings of his lost childhood, stealing what he needed to live. And by following this path, he had lost any ability to summon the power of nature, and only lived by his wit and his blade. <br>
<br>
During a dark hour two dwarves, one cleric and on a noble Paladin, did spot this young wood elf and saw something in him that none other had, and offered a brotherhood to him that he hesitantly accepted, with the haunting thoughts of his past, his parents slain, his name forgotten for he had given up his birth right. <br>
<br>
Upon him a new name was bestowed, he was to be known as Fiae Soulmender. Upon his acceptance to what would become his new family, gifts were granted to him so that me may travel safer, weapons delivered that with he could fight more powerfull and even magical creatures. As he fought he learned of the art of the backstab, and with that he had learned the most defining skill of the Rogue. <br>
<br>
He grew more competant and powerfull, his new found family saw in him an undying need to be on the move, to constantly fight, and to not be idle in his activities. There were oft times mentioned that he seemed to be a gnomish invention, never stopping, always moving. Seemingly bereft of the need for sleep, a name was dubbed upon him that would forever be his calling. After the non sleeping souless creations the gnomes built, he would be known as &quot;The Machine&quot;. <br>
<br>
The Machine now fights along side his brother Soulmenders, his path always moving forward. His weapons always singing their mournfull song. His reasoning is simple. When not moving, one thinks about the past, and thoughts of his past bring pain. A pain that not even the most powerfull cleric can heal, as the pain of battle can be sweet. An anguish the most talented enchanter with his art of controlling the mind cannot erase.<br>

The story of the Kerrans is far from happy, but a fine tale none the less.<br>
<br>
(Obsession with pretending to be an NPC off now)<br>
<br>
 I liked it though, it really was good. I hate 'happy' Disney-movie endings any way.<br>
