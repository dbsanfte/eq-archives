On Vallon, it could be pretty ugly when one team or another pushes ahead of any of the others and potentially keeps opposing teams from catching up. If the progression is totally linear, I can see this causing some problems for the weaker guilds/teams.<br>
<br>
On a different but related note, being on a red server, there seems to be less competition for end game mobs. That's probably due to the fact that the server evolution is considerably slower given the barriers of a PVP environment and a lower server population than most blue servers. That said, there's still quite a bit of conflict concerning certain mobs at certain points on the curve (NTOV, ST key mobs, etc.). While I'd expect the points of conflict to shift up the curve as the server continues to evolve and more guilds/alliances move into the ST/post-ST arenas, there does always seem to be a PVP resolution when it comes to these competitions. So in essence, the blue servers have conflicts at the AOW, Burrower, Tunare, Emporer levels, while red servers (well, ours anyway) tends to have more conflicts earlier on.<br>
<br>
As an FYI, 3 teamers (lights) Defiant and their &quot;Euro&quot;partner Ancient Orden are well ahead of pretty much every other guild or alliance on the server. They are the only guilds really into the post-ST area. Trailing them by a few months are Iron Tower (3 team light), the HECK alliance (3 team light comprised of 3 guilds) and X'anit Kven (dark). Ebon Dawn (dark) and Wrath and Vengeance (4 team) spun out of the other major dark guild on the server, the primarily Euro-timed Draconic Tribe. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usvenuce.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Svenuce</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://svenuce.homestead.com/files/blinky.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/30/02 9:15:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uabatoirredux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AbatoirRedux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 9:19:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11109.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &gt;&lt;</span><hr size=1> ok, so now that we've established that some servers have VASTLY different levels of demand for high level content, what are the odds of getting some kind of dynamicly set spawn times based on subscribed accounts?  average loged in accounts?  Average level of characters?  Played time? Average life span of the mob?  Level of the mob? <br>
<br>
I dunno, just throwing out potential variables to base a spawn time continuoum on.  Point is there should be some way to guage the server demand for content and compensate for it.<br>
<br>
Failing that there are a few servers that just cry out for a split.  While I've always personaly been dubious how effective those are, the fact remains that Tunare is at or near the top of the population list night after night in spite of the split with Drinal 18 months ago.  (Can you imagine what it would be like if all those people had stayed!!!, Ironic that many didnt go because they heard Cats n Hats was going and going to &quot;be like Afterlife&quot; and now there are at least 5 guilds on Tunare of Cats+ level)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll hush but I do hope Verant can come up with some way to dilute these populations other than simply rolling out eq2 and Star Wars and saying &quot;go play that instead&quot;<br>

Los Angeles - 24 May 2002 – Ubi Soft® Entertainment, one of the world’s largest video game publishers, announced today that it has signed a major new European publishing and support agreement with Sony Online Entertainment Inc., to launch localized versions of EverQuest® – the world’s most successful massively multiplayer online game. <br>
<br>
From fall 2002 onwards, European fans will discover brand new European-based servers, with fully localized game versions in French, German and English. The European EverQuest experience will be enhanced, with European-based customer services, both in-game and offline, provided by local teams at European times in English, German and French. The agreement will result in improved connectivity to brand new EverQuest worlds and easier subscription with local payment methods offered. While Sony Online Entertainment continues to operate the infrastructure, ubi.com, the online arm of Ubi Soft, will provide local Customer Service to European players. Ubi Soft and Sony Online Entertainment will be sharing the online revenues that are generated.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xandrax>Xandrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 4:04:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11109.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> New Euro/Asian servers would be effective only if you forced all Euro/Asian players to go to those servers.  No way would a established guild volunteer to leave a server that they hold such an advantage over.  <br>
Personally, I think they should.  The only reason that Euro/Asian people would want to stay is because of friends (most of whom would be in the guild already) and because they like the significant timezone advantage they have.   Too bad, so sad I say.  <br>
Hell, they'd even be able to race for mobs when they logged on, instead of them being dead already.   What would they have to bitch about?  That they now have to play on even footing with other guilds on a server instead of having a mob buffet set up for when they log in?   I'd really try to be sympathetic, but I don't think I'd do a good job.<br>

Blood of the Spider, Tindi Losi, Noble Blade, and Spirit of Tunare pretty much dominate everything.  The only one that I'm not SURE has done AoW is Tindi, but they're on par with the others, so I imagine they have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usulaspsychoblades.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sulas Psychoblades</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 4:36:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11109.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Server Competition</span><hr size=1> Ayonae Ro<br>

I'm sorry, but when &quot;enemy guilds&quot; start killing 10th coldain heros in the middle of the war, training you nonstop, etc., the fun just goes out the window.<br>
<br>
It's sad to see that you have to petition a GM to come watch some rival guild members if they are in the same zone as your guild while you are killing something, just to be sure that they dont try to pull anything.<br>
