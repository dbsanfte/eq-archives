Yet today I was called a liar because I made the statement that Evade only works on a 180 degree radius instead of the 360 degree radius that people were claiming on a dev board thread. <br>
<br>
So my question is has anyone here ever evaded an attack from behind at any time? I know in 40+ days I never have and this would lead anyone to believe that my above statement is true. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulandril77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Landril77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 2:53:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3775.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Evading radius</span><hr size=1> I cannot think of a single time I have evaded an attack from behind.<br>
<br>
It is a pretty wide radius, bt must be from the front.  From my experiences your 180 degree arc seems pretty accurate.  This also holds true for parry and block as well.<br>
<br>
For an examle of this try fighting an uber bom whick parrys a lot.  If you attack them from the front they will parry 50=60% of attacks, but if you attack them from behind they will not parry you at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzarlaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zarlaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 5:25:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3775.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Evade</span><hr size=1> You're correct.  Evade/block/parry will only work in a 180 degree radius infront of the person.  This can easily be tested.  Just simply find a gray con mob and get him to attack you.  You will notice that when ever you turn around more then 180 deg. you will never ever evade a swing.. but soon as you turn back towards the mob you'll evade like crazy.<br>

Wouldn't it have been easier, instead of making a whole bunch of special code that says: evade, block, or parry unless attacker is an assassin and using the perforate artery skill.<br>

I thought it was interesting at the time.  I will start to watch for more.<br>

Perhaps it's far more likely if it's from the front and far less likely from the back.<br>
