<br>
And so, on with the story.....<br>
<br>
Tilnoom’s life began in Kelethin - her mothers homeland. Born from her Wood elf Druid mother and a Human Warrior father, Tilnoom was caught in the middle. She would never be properly welcome in Kelethin because there was human blood running through her veins. Shortly after her 3rd birthday, her father was called back to Freeport for guard duties. The orcs had begun creeping closer towards Freeport, and were becoming more and more of a pain. Her mother was torn. Should she move the family to Freeport or stay at home in Kelethin? In the end, she decided to move to Freeport to remain close to her husband. Tomiam - Tilnoom’s elder brother - remained in Kelethin to pursue his musical talents. Freeport, would be the place Tilnoom called home.<br>
<br>
By the age of 5, she would run around outside the Freeport Gates keeping a watchful eye on the rats. One of the guards had kindly made her a wooden sword. She’d chase rats around and play little war games with the guards when they were off duty. She soon turned 6, then 7 and by her 10th birthday, her father picked up on her natural ability to fight. She was given a small short sword. Her face beaming, she ran to the guards to show them her new toy. They too had a gift for her - some leather armour. In time she grew into the armour and her father began to teach her the ways of the Warrior.<br>
<br>
“Always attack from the front. Let your enemies see your face and determination.” he told her. “Attacking from behind is the cowards way. Are you afraid of being hit?”. Tilnoom thought for a moment then began to stalk a rat that was passing nearby. “No, no, no!!” boomed her father. “Attack from the front! Don’t prance about behind it!”. Over the next two years, she strived to become the Warrior her father wanted her to be. After a heated argument in a duel weilding lesson, she threw her swords to the ground. “Enough!” she screamed. “I’m never gonna be as strong as you are so stop pushing me so hard!!”. She ran towards the docks in East Freeport with tears streaming from her face.<br>
<br>
She jumped beneath the docks and into the shadows so noone would see her. After being there for about half an hour sobbing, she felt something tug at her pocket. She swiftly stood up, but no-one was there. It was silent apart from the sound of the water lapping against the docks. A little frightened, she scuttled back to West Freeport. Once she got home, she found a small tattered note in her left pocket. It read ‘Don’t be afraid little one, come back to the shadows. There is another way to fight’. She began to wonder how on Norrath the note would have come to arrive in her pocket - then remembered the tug at her tunic under the docks.<br>
<br>
Tilnoom and her father made up and he agreed to give her some space - maybe he was pushing her too hard after all. With 2 Fine Steel swords in her bag, Tilnoom set off for East Commonlands to have a little fun with the Spiderlings. She charged at the spiders waving her swords in the air. “Aaaaaaiiiiiiiii!!!!” Whack! She landed a critical hit, but in her haste dropped the other weapon. Cursing herself for being so clumsy, she hacked the spider using one weapon. 30 seconds later and Tilnoom was victorious. 3 hours later and she started to become frustrated with herself. Nearly every other fight she had dropped a weapon. “Arrgghh! I give up!” she shouted. She sat down, head in hands and wondered what to do next. She wasn’t strong enough to use a 2 handed weapon, yet too clumsy to slash swords around. After much pondering, she grabbed her swords, threw them in the bag and headed home.<br>
<br>
She rushed into her room and to her small bedside cabinet. She pulled out the tattered note, reread it and headed towards the docks again. She sat in the shadows, wondering what she has let herself in for. She began to talk to herself “What am I doing here? I mean, trusting a stranger who puts something in your pocket? I must be going mad”. The fisherman on the end of the dock looked around at her and she realised she was talking to herself and blushed. Several hours passed and Tilnoom started to drift off to sleep. Suddenly, someone whispered “So are you ready now?” She sat bolt upright and looked towards the fisherman - who was no longer there. “I say again, are you ready now?” the voice asked. “For what? I… I don’t understand!” she stammered. “Its alright, take my hand and follow me”. A small blue-grey hand appeared from the shadows and took her towards a door at the back.<br>
<br>
Inside, she was greeted by two female Dark Elves and one male - all holding small daggers in each hand. “Heh, funny lookin’ swords”. The dark elves smiled at her and said they would educate her. One they think would suit her better. They explained that they had been watching her for sometime now, they have seen the tears, the arguments and the frustration that she had. “But how? When have to been watching me?! I haven’t seen you before!”. Again, the Dark Elves smiled and one by one, they disappeared in front of her. “Ok, now I’m scared”. “No need to be” whispered a male voice, and magically the male Dark Elf reappeared. Tilnoom grinned and the four of them sat down around a small lantern and she began to learn the ways of the Rogue. They handed her 2 small daggers. Tilnoom smiled as one of the female Dark Elves showed her how to weild them. She didn’t drop them once. Just as she is about to leave, the other female Dark Elf grabbed her arm. “Remember, you no nothing about us. If the guards ask you where we are or who we are, you know nothing”. Tilnoom nodded and quietly slipped out back up to the docks.<br>
<br>
Several days later, Tilnoom returned to the East Commonlands to practice her fighting skills. Again, she was dismayed. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't weild the swords comfortably without making mistakes and dropping one. She pulled out the daggers from her bag. What her father didn't know, wouldn't hurt him right? For hours she practiced sneaking behind spiderlings, hiding behind trees and scaring willowisps. Slowly, she began to master the skills. Several weeks later, she ventured further into the Commanlands to battle with the Young Kodiaks. Battered and bruised, she remained victorious, still weilding the 2 daggers in her hands. <br>
<br>
Within 2 years, she had nearly perfected her skills and she returned to the West Commonlands again, but in her haste to gain knowledge and experience, she met a much more powerful creature. Whilst fighting with the Young Kodiaks, a Griffin decided to join in the battle. Realising she could not defeat the Griffin on her own, she ran toward the Guard Toll Booth. She stopped inches from the hut and the guards attacked the beast that was chasing her. Tilnoom fell to the ground but was swiftly picked up by two strong arms. She lifted her head up and smiled at the man who was there - her father. His face however, was not smiling.&quot;What on Norrath are you holding in your hands??!&quot; he shouted. Tilnoom realised, she was clutching the daggers, instead of the swords her father expected. Her face dropped, realising she had unintentionally let her secret out. She was sent home to await her fathers arrival.<br>
<br>
Hiding in her room, she heard the front door slam shut, then the sound of her angry father echoed throughout the house. This went on for several hours, her mother and father arguing about Tilnoom and her chosen style of battle. That night, her father summoned Tomiam from Kelethin, to inform him of his decision on Tilnoom's actions and fate. &quot;I will not have a coward in my family and in my house. Take her away!&quot; Tomiam was ordered to take Tilnoom to the island of Kunark the next morning. Her mother cried all night, hugging Tilnoom and fearing the dangers that were ahead of her. She gave her daughter a set of lockpicks. Forcing a smile, she said &quot;To help you out of difficult situations&quot;.<br>
<br>
That morning, Tilnoom grabbed what few possessions would fit into her bag and ran off following Tomiam to the Freeport docks. Tomiam usually sang songs of happiness, but today there was no song to be heard. Instead, they talked all the way to Firona Vie. Tom was worried for his sister, but wanted to prepare her for what lay ahead. He gave her food, water and some money to help her along the way. Two hours later, the boat docked at Firona Vie. Tilnoom began to cry, knowing that she would never see any of her family again. She stood at the docks, with tears falling into the ocean. She watched the boat depart and move away until it became nothing but a dot in the distance.<br>
<br>
Realising she knew nothing of this new place, she set out to find people to talk to. She talked with the Pilgrims of Firona and admired the butterflies and their grace that floated just outside the enterance to the city. In time, she lost faith in herself. She sunk into a deeper, darker mood - one she had never felt before. She had never been alone and far away from her family for so long and the loneliness was begining to take its toll. She would sit by trees in the Firona forest, wishing the spiders would come for her. They never did. The pilgrims would push the spiders deeper into the forest. Wandering without a cause, she walked up stream and along the edge of the forest. She eventually came across a giant lake, with creatures she had never seen before.<br>
<br>
Wandering around the lake, she found some mountains. a large giant fortress stood before her. She sat on a hill and watched as people invaded the fort, toppling the mighty giants. She knew she could not fight the giants alone, but also knew that the people fighting them would not accept her the way she was. In her mind, she thought everyone was like her father. Everyone should attack from the front. Depressed and with no purpose, she walked deeper into the mountains, where she would remain for the next few months. She soon ran out of food and water and took to stealing from the people fighting the giants. They were so busy they didn't notice one or two pieces of bread missing from their bags. The giants were rich too. She would sneak behind one, hidden from view and take their money. These were the only times she ventured from her recluse in the mountains.<br>
<br>
Little did TIlnoom know, that both her mother and brother were looking for her all over Kunark. The moved from place to place, Firona Vie, Lake of Omen, The Overthere, Dreadlands and Frontier Mountains. They even searched in the dungoens of Dalnir. Eventually, after several months, they return to home with sad faces.<br>
<br>
After nearly a year in the mountains, Tilnoom returned to Firona Vie in need of a decent meal and a good night sleep. She bargains with the merchants for food and finds an empty hut with a worn bed in it. Its much better than the hard rock of the mountains. She felt refreshed and ready to tackle what may lie ahead. A couple of days later, she crossed the Frontier Mountains and discovered The Overthere. A new, wonderous place with so many different types of people. She walked down a valley, to see at least two dozen people stood around chatting. THey instantly invite her into the conversation and they quickly became friends. Several of them are holding daggers like hers! Finally, she believed she wasn't alone any more and smiled. Several weeks then passed and she stayed with this group of people, moving around The Overthere.<br>
<br>
One day, after a long battle, she saw a blur fly past her. Not knowing what it was, she thought no more of it. It was however, her brother - Tomiam. He glanced across at the group and out the corner of his eye, he thought he saw his sister. He stopped, turned around and headed towards the group.&quot;Tils?&quot;. Tilnoom looked up after hearing her name. Eyes wide she couldn't believe what she saw. &quot;Tom!?!&quot;. Tears began to run down her face. They hugged for what seemed like an eternity. She excused herself from the group and ran with Tomiam to the edge of Skyfire. They sat down and caught up with what had happened in each others lives since they had been apart. <br>
<br>
Tomiam was amazed at what she had become and told her of a new family he was a part of - the Healers of Norrath. As much as Tilnoom loved her friends, she knew she could never return to her blood family in Freeport. She still had the longing for a family and Tomiams family sounded so full of life. He told her that she would be welcome to join this family - but first she must improve her skills and knowledge of the land of Norrath. Tilnoom was inspired, she finally had a purpose, a goal, something to live for. She put all her energy into learning and developing her skills. She even dabbled with a bit of poison making. Tomiam told her that the Healers were planning on going to the City of Mist. Eager to meet and talk to the other members of this family, she instantly asked if she could go.<br>
<br>
Upon arriving, she saw at least 30 smiling faces. All sharing stories and experiences of the land. Through the waves of people, she spotted someone holding a magestic dagger, with green poison dripping from the tip. Nervously, she approached him, to ask him if he was too a member of this family. He said his name was Hoblet and he was a part of the family. He said that many people at joined the Healers and they had the most fun when they were together.. Before they could really begin to talk properly, a druid shouted the plan of action and how they were going to slay the creatures inside the gates. Tilnoom bounced with excitement, eager to learn and show off her skills.<br>
<br>
Several hours later the beasts were slain. She sat down to earn a well deserved rest. Then, a man stood in front of her. He seemed huge, clutching a spear in one hand and a sheild in the other. He introduced himself as Hootmon. Worried that she might have done something wrong, she quickly got to her feet. It was however, quite the reverse. He invited her into the family as a full member. Tilnoom cried with happiness. Finally, she was part of a family again. FInally, she was at peace with herself.<br>
<br>
Now I, Tilnoom Lanrete have bonded with many menbers of Healers. The family has grown and I am doing what I am good at. As a part of Healers, there is no need to battle against other members. We all strive to better ourselves, but not to live up to other peoples expectations. There is one thing I have always remembered, one thing that makes Healers as good as it is. Everyone is different, with skills and knowledge which better us as a whole. No two people in HoN are the same.<br>
<br>
Thats what makes us all speical. <br>
