I'm at 38, and haven't soloed for any length of time since my teens.  If you have people complaining that your's a mana-sink because you always steal agro and get the crap beat out of you....WHY ARE YOU STEALING AGRO?????  You don't have to steal agro from the tanks, heck, you've got a detaunt style in your weapon spec, you don't have to steal agro from a caster if you don't want to.  You must learn agro management if you want to be not only accepted in groups, but actively sought after in groups for PvE.  You don't have to use your CS styles every time, they're big agro builders, and if you'll check, most of the anytime styles have a negative to your defensive bonus, which means you will get hit more often, for more damage.  Let your tank get his taunt style off, then hit your PA, or BSII, or whatever, then just swing away for a bit while your tank keeps up the Taunt, every once in a while, throw in a Garrote/Achilles Heel, and you'll be fine.  If you want to style the entire fight, set up a Quick bar with your Spec Weapon styles on it.  I know at least with swords, there's a decent damage chain, a good side-positional chain, and a good detaunt to use if you actually end up with the agro.  <br>   Practice good agro management, and you'll soon get a reputation for it.  Very rarely am I ever refused for a group, and then, only by strangers.  Never have I been refused a group if theres a least one person in there I've grouped with before.  They know I know how to manage agro, and that I can get a mob off of a Healer faster than any Tank out there.  <br>    Unfortunately, SBs have gotten a bad rap from people who didn't know how to manage agro, ended up getting chain healed by the Healer, then dieing anyway, and causing the party wipeout because the Healer had no power left.  You have to make your own reputation for groups in PvE, but once you do, you won't have to worry about getting a group again.<br><br>   This is just my opinion, and observations, take them for what they're worth.<br><br>Gliling Ghostwalker<br>Shadowblade<br>Guinevere <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufiae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fiae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.evercrack.net/sigpics/ribbon_small.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rogue News Hound</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 10:00:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/sigpics/ribbon_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yup </span><hr size=1> This falls back on Pre-Evade EQ Rogues.

I play smart and do my damage without gaining agro, I am not a mana sink.  However, I still don't get into groups.  Why?  Easy.  There is nothing -- NOTHING -- that I can do in a group that cannot be done better by some other class.<br><br>What do assassins offer a PvE group?  Melee damage.  OK, so you want melee damage in your group.  Fine.  Who are you going to invite?  One of the 6 assassins with 700 HPs wearing leather who can't take any hits who are standing around begging to be let into groups?  Or one of the armsmen who are standing around who not only do more damage than the assassin, but have twice the HPs and armor?  Or perhaps one of the dozen paladins who can not only take hits, but can manage agro extremely well and have dmg add chants, etc.?<br><br>Groups don't not let me in because I am a mana sink and gain agro.  The don't let me in because there are bunches of other players standing around LFG who can do my job, only better.  Yes, it's a fact of life as an assassin...  which explains why I have several alts that I play a ton more than my assassin.  He's not necessarily retired, but he's pretty much on the back burner, because leveling is nigh-impossible anymore.  Sucks.  Try to get yourself a good guild or a bunch of friends to work with or something, because most pick-up group players nowadays realize that assassins basically have nothing to offer PvE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morinn>Morinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 11:28:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ya</span><hr size=1> I know how to control aggro in combat. <br><br>I am just stating what folks said in an alliance channel.

If that doesn't help, then a nice little guilt trip from time to time helps as your alliance mates realize on their RvR trip that they have no decent level rogues in their midst to be able to help protect against enemy assassins.<br><br><br>Larlana Lavode<br>Mistress of Assassins<br>Einherjar<br>Midgard/Percival <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufgnn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fgnn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 6:42:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: detaunt</span><hr size=1> I also have no problems in groups. I'll first wait for the tank to get it first hit in (Or if he misses wait for the second), then perf, hoarfrost(detaunt), and pincer the rest of the fight. Pincer is great, becuase a: Higher chance to hit, b: half the endurance use. The couple damage less damage you do per hit is made up for when you hit them every time, and have enough endurance for 2 fights.<br><br>If you have a good tank at least your level then it is real easy to not get hit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeepoelfkiller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>meepo elfkiller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 8:25:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pincer vs Assault Ice Storm</span><hr size=1> My question is I see alot of people advocating the use of pimcer, which is cool. What I'm wondering is how does pincer stack against the Assault Ice Storm combo that you get from sword skill. I am a crit blade and thus at lvl 37 have a 34 crit 33 sword 28 stealth. The assault/ice storm is what I use since it can be used from any position (which helps when the mob changes targets frequently)Since I use a 2 hander and assault doesn't use much end. I usually can go 2 fights or so before needing to sit (I almost never get aggro with this combo btw, unless I taunt to pull aggro form the healer) Also if anyone with a 34 sword could tell me if the 34 use anytime sword style is worth it ? Just curious as to how the assault/ice storm and lvl 34 use anytime sword styles stack up against pincer in group PvE. Well anyone with any thoughts or opinions is encouraged to post, just tryin to play the most group friendly blade I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeleth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>meleth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 3:13:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Not getting into any groups</span><hr size=1> I had the same problems up until level 25. Then i started organizing my own groups. Instead of trying to join one i use /who like a madman and send the people i want to join the group msgs. This way i will also be able to handpick the classes i want in the group so i get a good group. And when you have a good group going people will come back. Add the ppl that you like to group with to your friends list so you can see if they're on.  I'm 40 now and i get tells all the time asking if i have a group going and if there are any slots in it. Now i even get invited into groups cause they will have ppl in them who has grouped with me before and done good.<br><br>Sure we don't have it as easy as all the other classes to get groups, but it is doable if we put some work into it. Also sending out a msg saying something like 'Hi, i'm a 29Infiltrator want to group?' is probably not that smart. Start with something like 'Hey, we're pulling together a group to kill gobs (Or whatever you're hunting) and we got a spot open for a &lt;insert class&gt; if you're interested.'<br><br>Try it, you'll be amazed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=2804.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=2804.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2804.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=2804.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=2804.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2804.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2804.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
