So this new thread will begin with a total summary of the posts in the other thread that directly concern this quest series.<br><br>--- Summary of the Vah Shir Rogue quest series so far ---<br><br>You must complete the Shar Vahl Citizenship quest first, because you will need the acrylia slate at many different stages.  Also you will need your Initiate's cloak.<br><br>--- part 1 ---<br><br>Hand your acrylia slate to Harbin (-403, 76). He's to the right of the registar's front door.<br><br>Harbin Gernawl says 'Ahh, Artfull, I was told you'd be coming. I am Harbin, and I will oversee the next bit of your progress in the Taruun. You have bravely chosen a path that will put your every skill to the test. May your abilities be honed in the service of the noble Vah Shir. To begin, bring me the soft chitin of three of the Rhinobeetles that dwell in the crater surrounding our city. <br><br>Collect 3 chitins from rhino beetles in the pit.  Hand these to Harbin.<br><br>Harbin Gernawl takes the chitin and deftly fashions a buckler as he speaks, 'Your progress will be reported, Artfull. For your effort thus far I present you with this buckler. It will help to protect you until you become adept enough to wield a weapon in each of your hands. Meanwhile, it is time for you to practice the skill that Shar Vahl relies on to feed it's people. Following this recipe, deliver four boiled rockhopper eggs to Sergeant Tylah in Hollowshade moor. Return to me with the acrylia he will pay you. <br><br>You receive a lore/no drop buckler ac3 for your efforts.<br><br>--- part 2 ---<br><br>Trivial baking skill required is between 35 and 80. Combine a flask of water, packet of spices, and a rockhopper egg in a spit or oven to make a boiled rockhopper egg. The eggs come only from young rockhoppers in the newbie pit. Hand 4 boiled rockhopper eggs to Seargent Tylah in Hollowshade Moor (1012, 1923).<br><br>Seargent Tylah devours all 4 eggs in the blink of an eye, 'Delicious! May the spirits bless you! Here are a few acrylia flakes for your trouble. I'll be happy to pay you for more should you find yourself with any extra!'<br><br>Hand the acrylia flaks to Harbin.<br><br>Harbin Gernawl says 'Your progress will be rewarded, Artfull. Soon all will recognize you as a recruit of the cunning Taruun! Speak with Merchant Rytan. When he is through with you return to me with his seal, your buckler, your initiate's cloak and this seal.<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Rytan'<br><br>Rytan says 'Hello Artfull, I trust all is well with you today. Come in and have a look around, just let me know if you see anything you like. By the way, I am in need of the assistance of an official Shar Vahl citizen. If you know of any please send them my way. <br><br>Hand your acrylia slate to Rytan.<br><br>Rytan says 'Here's my dilemma, I am low on darts to sell and I need to replenish my supply. I simply cannot break away from the store so I require your help. Fill this bag with xakra teeth and return the sealed bag to me. With those teeth I can make six darts and I'll give you three. <br><br>Fill the bag with 6 xykra teeth from the larva worms in the pit. Hand the combined bag to Rytan.<br><br>Rytan says 'Here are the three darts I promised you and a seal of mine. I need more darts desperately, so show me your acrylia slate to take another bag and fill it as you are able. Collect four of my seals and show them to me. I will reward you by revealing my method of dart construction. <br><br>Hand Rytan's seal, Initiate's cloak, Harbin's seal, and your buckler to Harbin.<br><br>Harbin Gernawl says 'Your hard work is pleasing to the Taruun, Artfull, which now accepts you as an official recruit. Wear this cloak with pride. Your buckler has been treated with a special epoxy and should protect you more effectively now. Show the buckler to Taruun Joharr and he will continue to guide you on your sacred path. I sense a strong spirit in you, young one. May it guide you to greatness! <br><br>Harbin Gernawl shouts 'Citizens of glorious Shar Vahl, lend me your ears. On this day your fellow citizen, Artfull, has become an official recruit of the Taruun. He has pledged an oath to hone his skills to perfection that he may better serve us all. Please join me now in celebrating his commitment to the mighty Vah Shir! <br><br>You receive a drop buckler ac5 and a new cloak ac5 +1dex +5hp +1% baking skill.<br><br>--- part 3 ---<br><br>Hand new bucker to Taruun Joharr (404, -559).<br><br>Taruun Joharr takes the buckler and spins it in his hand for a moment. Eventually he says, 'I suppose assumin' you were sent here by Harbin isn't too far from the reality of things.  I'll try to think of a few things for you to do, but in the meantime, take these daggers and practice until you can use both of them.  You need to get out of the habit of toting this shield around.  If your enemy is gettin' close enough to hit you on it, you ain't doin' your job right anyway.  I'll do what I can to train you from here, but I'm going to need to eat first.  It's been a while since my last meal.  Take this meal voucher to Cook Yalkiin.  Once they fill the order bring it back and we'll start your lesson. Now scoot.' <br><br>You receieve a pair of daggers that are meant to be dual wielded.  They are a definite improvement over the beginner's dagger.<br><br>Hand meal voucher to Cook Yalkiin (-155, 447).<br><br>Cook Yalkiin says 'I'd love to fill this order, but we're out of the meat that he likes.  We've been very busy today, so I doubt that any of us will be able to get out to gather more of it.  If you could go out and grab us a few slabs, we could not only fill the order, I could put some away for anyone else that may come through today.  This sounds like a perfect task for a young Taruun recruit.  Fill this bag with the fatty meat from a young Owlbear and bring it back to me right away.  I'll get Joharr's sandwiches as soon as you return with the meat. <br><br>Collect and combine 6 fatty owlbear meats from owlbear cubs in Hollowshade Moor in the container.  Turn this in to Yalkiin.<br><br>Cook Yalkiin opens the bag and immediately begins to slice the meat into thin sheets.  He throws the meat on a few slices of bread and wraps the whole thing up with a hand full of vegetables.  'Here you go, friend!' He says as he hands you what appears to be a lunch bag.  'Joharr should love these sandwiches! The meat that you brought us was great.  If you ever need a job as a butcher, just let us know.  Take care and tell Joharr I said hello.' <br><br>Hand the lunch bag to Joharr.<br><br>Taruun Joharr takes the bag and takes a huge bite of the sandwich.  'This sandwich is almost worth the wait.' He says as he rubs the crumbs from his mouth.  'I hope that you've been practicin' with those daggers.  Elder Ternq came by while you were away.  He stated that I, well... you... need to go scout the caves around the thicket.  Gather the skulls of any Shak Dratha that you may... um... run into while you scout.  Once you've filled this backpack, return it to me and I'll fill out a report for Ternq. <br><br>By killing shak dratha raiders, assassins and invaders you can get all the skulls you need.  Most of these are found in the caves in Shadeweaver's Thicket, however some may be found wandering the hilly areas.  Put 6 skulls and combine them in the backpack and hand it back to Joharr.<br><br>Taruun Jaharr says 'Very good, Artfull! Elder Ternq will be very pleased with the results of your patrol. Take this regional status report to him and see if he has anything else for you to do. Your skill as a hunter is really starting to show. You can keep the daggers that I gave you. Make good use of them. I'm sure that you're going to be too busy to come back this way for a bit. Take care.'<br><br>Hand the status report to Elder Taruun Ternq (-482, 175), the 2nd rogue trainer, upstairs near the registar.<br><br>Elder Taruun Ternq says 'I see that Joharr introduced you to our cavern dwelling friends.  This report shows that you were very successful on your last patrol.  Your progress as a Taruun is most pleasing.  You have shown us that you are ready to advance to the level of apprentice.  I will send someone for your new cloak in a moment.  While I am doing that, please use this bowl to prepare some spicy fish stew and take it to Kerr Tiparr in the Hollowshade outpost.  It's not often that they get good food out there.  If you don't remember the recipe, just ask cook Mylis.  When you are done, please return with your old cloak and the empty pot.  Always remember... Service to the community should always precede any thoughts personal advancement. <br><br>Go find Cook Mylis (-143, 449) next to Cook Yalkiin.<br><br>You say, 'what is spicy fish stew?'<br><br>Cook Mylis says 'Ohhh, I love fish stew and it's fairly simple to make.  If you're looking to make a large pot of it, you'll want to be sure that you have enough ingredients ready from the start.  Gather up a flask of water, a jug of sauce, some spices and two wetfang steaks.  Cook them in an oven in a large stewing pot. For being so foul, those wetfangs sure taste good.  Throw all of that in to simmer for a bit and you're ready to go! <br><br>Trivial baking skill required is less than 105. Combine the lore pot, spices, jug of sauce, flask of water, and 2 wetfang steaks to create the pot of spicey fish stew. Wetfang steaks drop off of large wetfangs from Paludal Caverns about 1 out of 5 times.  Hand the results to Kerr Tiparr (1094, 1926) in Hollowshade Moor.<br><br>Kerr Tiparr grabs the pot and pours the contents into several clay containers.  'That should keep the stew warm until the next patrol comes by.  I'm sure that they'll be glad to see it.  It smells really great.  Thank you for the kind meal.  I hope your good character helps you in your endeavors as a member of the Taruun.  It is always good to see a young citizen succeed.  May the spirits guide you! <br><br>Hand the empty pot and your first cloak to Elder Taruun Ternq.<br><br>Elder Taruun Ternq says 'Very well done, Artfull.  Take this cloak and wear it with pride.  May it keep your silhouette hidden from our enemies and keep you safe from those things that may walk in shadows darker than ours.  Your work is being noticed, young Taruun.  Please keep a clear eye on the path that lies before you.  Speak to Elam Arruk when you are ready to continue your training.  You will need only to show him the cloak that I just gave you.  He will know how to instruct you from there.  Be well. <br><br>Elder Taruun Ternq shouts 'Hear me fellow Vah Shir! The Taruun have seen fit to escalate citizen Artfull to the rank of apprentice. He grows in strength and wisdom daily. We are proud as should you all be. May this student of our ways continue to progress and live worthy of our noble heritage. <br><br>You receive a new cloak: Cloak of the Taruun Apprentice, lore/no drop, 6ac +1str +2dex +5hp +2% pottery skill, wt 5.0.<br><br>--- part 4 ---<br><br>Hand your cloak to Elam Arruk (231, -325).  He's in the rogue guildhall.<br><br>Elam Arruk says 'I see that you have experienced some training from Elder Ternq.  He is an amazing scout and very exciting to watch in combat.  Years prior to being commissioned to act in this role, I served with the young Scout Ternq.  Of course we were both much younger and more agile back in those days.  Much like you are now.  Ah well, enough with this chatter.  Take this bag and stow it somewhere safe.  I have a task for you. <br><br>You say, 'what task?'<br><br>Elam Arruk says 'You will need to begin familiarizing yourself with the moor and its inhabitants.  As a scout, there is one creature that roams the moor that you are going to need to focus on in particular.  These creatures are wolf-like in their appearance, but have no need for sight and show absolutely no fear of the tactics that we usually use to scare off animals.  They move in packs and attack swiftly.  To learn their behavior, you will need to track a few down.  Fill that bag with a few of their tongues and bring it back to me.  Once you have seen them, I will be able to teach you more.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujedwyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jedwyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/14/01 4:39:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3507.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vah Shir Rogue quest series</span><hr size=1> I'm missing some details:<br><br>- what is the name and weight of the 2nd cloak you receive... the one with +1% baking skill?<br><br>- what is the name and weight of the 1st and 2nd buckler that you receive?<br><br>- does anyone know if we need to hang on to the no drop recipe for boiled rockhopper eggs?<br><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Artfull Dodger, Vah Shir Rogue of Ayonae Ro <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udokomo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dokomo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/14/01 9:08:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3507.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vah Shir Rogue quest series</span><hr size=1> 1st cloak is the Cloak of the Taruun Recruit.

Good question. The reward for the 1st phase of quests is a fairly weak weapon made by combining the 5 class specific sub quest pieces. However, there is more to this quest that apparently hasn't yet been implemented.<br><br>These quests are reminiscent of the trade skills oriented progressive Coldain Rings/Shawl quests that just get bigger and better. At each stage of the quest you get a bonus of an improved item. For example, the current series of quests for Bards leaves you with, I beleive, a Jouneyman's Cloak with lowish stats. But the fact that it changed from a recruit to an apprentice to a journeyman's cloak infers that there will eventually be a master's cloak. I'm not sure what the progressive Rogue reward is, but I bet it also leaves a lot of room for improvement.<br><br>Look for successive quests to get far more complicated and the numbers of ppl necessary to complete subsequest steps to increase. However, look for the rewards to also increase.<br><br>Plus, for me, it has been alot of fun to get this far. Whether or not it is worth it to do the quests is, I guess, up to the individual player. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugeppen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geppen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 1:14:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3507.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vah Shir Rogue quest series</span><hr size=1> I completely agree, since this has not been gone through till the total end, I am trying to get to that point.

I personally have been having a lot of fun so far, and want to finish it.  I just am asking for any logs past the tongues.  I currently have one tongue, and will post my own logs after I get them all, just was hoping someone else has them.  Personal opinions are fine, but does anyone have the logs heh.<br>Geppen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3676.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3507.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3507.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=3507.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3507.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3507.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
