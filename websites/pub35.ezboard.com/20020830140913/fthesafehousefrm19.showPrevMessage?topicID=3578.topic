What exactly are we supposed to be now?<br>
<br>
The other night, there was a group of Hibs camping our PK in emain.  I worked my way around back praying that no archer had True Sight activated.  I hung around for a few minutes until an injured caster ran about 25 yards behind the rest of the group and sat down to med.  I ran over while everyone else had their backs turned and oneshotted her.  Then I hauled ass up the hill after popping stealth.  I resisted the first mez, then got held by the second one.  About 4 Hibs run up and make short work of me.<br>
<br>
This now is the life of the &quot;assassin&quot;....<br>
Assassin is NOT the correct name for us anymore.<br>

<br>
As long as you pick your own fights via stealth (i.e. kill who you want in a large situation), you are an assassin.   There is still nobody better at taking out 1 important person than Inf/SB/NS cause they get to pick when to engage, as opposed to an rp cow tank that will instantly get ganked by 10 other people who see him charging.  Only difference now is that you can't go picking out blue and green sitting casters out of a group of 30 with relative impunity when there is nobody to group with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubernardrazorleaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bernard Razorleaf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~eddytaylor/data/leaves.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 12:11:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3565.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~eddytaylor/data/deadbernie.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When is an assassin not an assassin?

<br>
The term Assassin is a derivation of hashashin (roughly translates to those who use hashish.)  The hashashin were a cult of fanatical killers based in what is now Lebanon and Syria during the late middle ages.  They formed as a kind of counter-Islamic, counter-Crusader economic-political faction (think the Mafia, but with faith-based overtones) and spent several centuries as a hidden but feared faction in middle eastern politics.  They were finally destroyed by the Ottoman Turks as part of the consolidation process that led to the Ottoman Empire.<br>
<br>
In any case, the reason that the Assassins were so feared was their fanatical devotion to the the deaths of their targets.  We envision a sneaky black-garbed character who kills his target and then escapes.  In fact, most of the Assassins died alongside their targets, trading their insignificant lives for the lives of the wealthy and powerful.<br>
<br>
So technically speaking I think the end of 1 shots makes us all more realistic Assassins.<br>
<br>
But that's just my take. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ushadowerbdc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowerBDC</A> at: 6/18/02 8:36:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 8:38:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3565.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When is an assassin not an assassin?

Yeah, but I LIKE picking on sitting casters.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And grouping can be a pain for a stealther.  Not impossible, but still kinda a pain.<br>

Bernard,<br>
I'm NOT that mad.  Only mildly annoyed.  And while I've considered a trip into Hib Homeland, if I did get in, I don't think I'd be killing people.  At least not lowbies.  That's griefing and that ain't my MO. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Shadower,<br>
Reading your post, that doesn't make us more realistic assassins, as assassin is a term DERIVED from hashashin.  In my eyes (and I don't think I'm alone here), an assassination is a kill and an escape.  What you describe is more akin to a suicide bomber, and that just doesn't sound like much fun. <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/usvarth4u.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Svarth4u</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 9:44:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3565.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When is an assassin not an assassin?

Remaining stealthed is like say okie Im hiding in the house where i just killed someone and no one can see me so I will just wait here yeah right dogs and guards would be crawling all over the place.  <br>
<br>
and Shadower is correct a true assassin most times died right along with their target if they got away bonus they get to take out another on the long list.  But they do not do so by remaining hidden thats a Sniper not an assasin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 11:03:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3565.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theblackwatch.biz/Balor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When is an assassin not an assassin?

<br>
Gee thanks.<br>
<br>
The Assassin role in DAoC has changed more over the last 8 months than any other character in the game.  We are NOT assassin's.  We are light tanks with leather armour and front loaded damage who can poison our weapons.  Thanks.   I'm a blademaster with leather and poison.  God forbid I choose piercing weapons.  &lt;sighs&gt; Str/Dex?  WHY????<br>
<br>
Gone are the days when that one caster sitting down 50 yards from the battlefield had to fear for his life.  Gone are the days of the assassin making that caster PAY with his life for such blatant disregard of our skills.<br>
<br>
Now it is a matter of, <br>
<br>
&quot;Which target shall I suicide for.  Who will I take with me that will hinder the other group more than mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
That my friends is not an assassin.  That is &gt;shivers&lt; a suicide bomber.  Yes, I am taking you with me.<br>
<br>
I do hate to use that term, but realisticly that's what we are.<br>
<br>
Sure, we still get to choose our target, great.  How about a chance at getting away too?<br>

(mild rant)</span><hr size=1> I still think that Assassins have the potential to be a key character in RvR (vs PvP).  The fact that we have mostly chosen to play them as we would a melee, trying to kill targets of opportunity, and then survive to continue the battle, doesn't necessarily mean that Assassins are most effective when played this way.<br>
<br>
I can think of very few pitched RvR battles that I've been in against Midgard that wouldn't have swung strongly to my side's advantage if a couple of Healers were suddenly removed from the equation.<br>
<br>
And I can think of no healers at all that would survive a pair of equal level Infiltrators attacking simultaneously, without regard for their own survival, in a coordinated attack.<br>
<br>
Granted it's very hard to setup this type of coordination in the heat of the moment but I bet a small squad of well-trained Assassins would turn the course of any battle they were in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uoldmill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Old Mill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 1:55:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3565.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sover.net/~danmad/images/bigbeer.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When is an assassin not an assassin?

basically I have to try and wait, bide my time and see if can find mage or archer strays. Tanks of any kind, clerics, are totally out of the question.<br>

<br>
I still have fun. I just need to bottom feed is all.  Hell blue archers hit me as hard as I can perf them, seems to me the assasins are nothing of the sort. We just scare peeps.<br>

Although, keep fighting is fun as hell as an assasin, we dont matter too much, but it is fun.<br>

<br>
I am forced to get into melee range to use my front loaded damage.  HOW ELSE SHALL I PA ?<br>
<br>
We are melee.  That's a fact.  Straight and simple, so therefore, the situation still at hand is this.<br>
<br>
A) Subpar hitpoints<br>
B) Subpar Armour<br>
<br>
=<br>
1) Stealth<br>
2) Frontloaded First Attack<br>
<br>
After the PA, we are a melee class.  We have no range.  We have no &quot;buffer&quot; to keep us safe from harm.  We have to fight HAND TO HAND. How else do you suggest we apply our frontal attacks?  There is no way for me to get in 3 shots before the enemy realizes I'm there.  PA/CD/SS just don't do the damage that three shots from an bow will.<br>
<br>
My &quot;uber&quot; 35 point DD Shout that gets resisted 40% of the time?<br>
<br>
My &quot;uber&quot; 40 point DD 1500 Range spell that gets resisted 40% of the time?<br>
<br>
At least I can stand on a keep wall and guard climb points.<br>

<br>
Yes, after 8 months of this class I have finally become disenchanted, frustrated, and I really feel the futility of playing this class starting to sink in.<br>
<br>
Of course, like some nightshades love to say,  &quot;Shoulda went blades&quot;  &quot;Why didn't you Fully spec weapons?&quot;<br>
<br>
To you,<br>
<br>
Mythic said a 50 spec was gimping yourself<br>
Since when did you hear of a RP Rogue using a longsword?<br>
Why should I have to spec a certain cookie cutter mold to be effective?  I &quot;WANT&quot; to use piercing weapons.  Why can't they be viable?  Oh, dex/str based.  Wow.  Glad I put 10 str in at creation.  We all know how strong elves are..<br>

I coudl 3 hit a 50 caster...if I don't fail my PA because of the various bugs...and i manage to get my CD off before he can quickcast a stun on me(happened once in the last 2 months).

(mild rant)</span><hr size=1> Just a short opinion about the removal of one-shoting.<br>
<br>
I don't get it. I mean they say they removed it because we could one-shot gray peeps without them having a chance of uncovering us and some assessins used it for griefing.<br>
<br>
Well, if I kill gray peeps, it does not matter if they uncover me or not. I just run up, and start pounding them into little red pools of blood. It does not matter if there are 5 or 8 or 12 ... you resist their spells all the time and they are missing/fumbling all the time when they attack you. If one happens to hit you it is for like 5 dmg! OMG!<br>
<br>
So, the only thing that the removal of one-shot brings is that gray peeps in groups of highlevels don't have to fear anything anymore. Well, but honestly, would you attack a gray caster in the middle of blue/yellow/orange companions!? and for griefing?<br>
<br>
Perhaps someone can explain to me where my logic is wrong here ...<br>

(mild rant)</span><hr size=1> Sorry, Shadower, I'd have to completely disagree with your philosophy on how an assassination should be conducted. And, on the abilities of an assassin. <br>
Granted, the name assassin is a derivative of hashashin(no argument from me there). But, that does not mean that is how *all* assassins and assassinations should function. It's just a generic word that was created to roughly describe people who are sudden killers, if you think about it.<br>
If low percentage survivability kills were the hashashins M.O., that's fine. I'm sure other killers for hire of that era were happy to let them have it. <br>
There are other groups of swift, deadly killers, who were not trained to specifically suicide into a target. <br>
Ninjas readily pop into mind. <br>
If we were all called Ninjassins, would that change anyone's point of view? I hope not. Or, they didn't fundamentally grasp the concept of covert killings from the start. <br>
And, yes, sometimes an assassin died with his target, no matter how he was trained. But, that works in reverse, also. I am sure that some hashashins even lived after killing their targets. <br>
Our toons should not be confined and forced to be exposed 100% of the time after killing our targets. <br>
I would be more than happy with at least, a decent % of my assassinations being accomplished without me being totally unstealthed and in the open. <br>
Mythic has screwed up by absolutely taking that chance away. <br>
If Mythic intended that my char be some type of medievel suicide bomber; then fine. Give me a 10,000hp of dmg insta-cast PBAoE DD, skald speed and stealth. <br>

I've hung around in the BG for hours before I actually go for a kill, I sit and wait like a sniper, waiting for that one opening.  Maybe someone's gonna run out and escort someone, maybe someone's going to a &quot;safe place&quot; to heal or med, or you catch another person going to go scout, etc. Anything that gets someone seperated from a group.  The one catch in real life assassins is that they can be anyone and look like anyone in a crowd, and that's the element that's being worked on by Mythic, hopefully they do it right. <p>Ishy Squishy-22nd Lurikeen Nightshade<br>
