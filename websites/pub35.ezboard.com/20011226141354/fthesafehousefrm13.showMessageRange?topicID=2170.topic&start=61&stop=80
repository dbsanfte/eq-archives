I got my brother to buff me and the wiz and got his sub 46 Druid in the group to invis me and the wiz, he was of course left behind on Norra Firma.<br>
<br>
There was a guild in Hate at the time but no Rogues were there, I kept my eyes open and went for it. To be honest I didnt expect the book to be up since I had heard a guild up there a few hours earlier had gone after it. I was expecting a terrifying waiting game but there it was!<br>
<br>
Heard mobs casting and singing and gated out, not sure if I was agroed or not.<br>
<br>
I am actually wielding the book at the moment (not for combat of course) it has that really cool open book thing going on. Confused the hell outta some Noob who wanted to know what Class I was, I told him I was a Lvl 50 Book Warrior. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Unfortunately my wizard friend ate two 700 point HT's just as I grabbed the book (i assume they were HT's anyways - if anything up there short of Innoruk hits for 700's, i'm never going back!).  He had cast bind sight on me so he could stay up there and watch the run through my eyes.  <br>
<br>
One note for people trying this - If you have not been to Hate before (I hadn't), plan on it taking more than the 60-90 seconds that many people have mentioned.  Navigating via a map will get you there, but not quickly, as it is dark and somewhat confusing.  Not to mention always having to worry about a lich being around the next corner.  I suppose you can practice with the zone explorer program, but when I tried the screen was way too dark to even move.<br>
<br>
And oh yeah -  The first time all that 'Praise Innoruk' shouting happened, I freaked out thinking I just got aggroed by half the plane.  Be ready for that if you go up!<br>

I saw a friend in Hate who was getting a book for a guildie (raid), she let me know when it was going to respawn. I waltzed in while the zone was repopping and camped next to the nightstand. Woke up the next morning, logged in, hit hide and sneak, grabbed the book, Said hi the scorn banshee facing the bed next to me !! Eased into the corner and prayed while my thurg gate potion went off.

So if they gate out quickly (or delete the hate file on their PC perhaps as somone suggested) it should be mostly safe for them.   As it was, the wizard who took me told me he was actually within a second of getting a gate off when the second HT took him down, and almost escaped even after aggro.  He didn't really seem to care anyways, as apparently the xp loss was easily repaired with 30 minutes of quad kiting later (/rude wizards =).<br>

At that point you are still in windowed mode, and can do other tasks (like disabling your virus checker if you forgot to). <br>

Get your shark skin in EFP far to right of the docks (merchant-bought ones won't work) The Ring of Commons effect on it is INSTA-PORT</i><br>
<br>
I researched the quest, and found the NPC with my rogue in Rivervale.  (He had Indifferent faction).  When I said the quest trigger ("I am from Rivervale.") The quest NPC replied to me, "You have proved yourself to the Leatherfoot Deputies.  Please continue your work, and we can talk some more". (something close to that).  I thought it was my faction, so I tried to turn in goblin beads, and got the same message w/o improving my faction.  Just for kicks, I made a halfling warrior, and conned the quest NPC, amiable.  Tryed the quest phrase again, still same message.  So it seemed that the quest wasn't based on my faction.<br>
I didn't give up, I went and hunted Halflings, and got a Leatherfoot Raider's Skullcap, (but it doens't have the +CHA as indicated by Allakazams').  I've killed dorn 25 times'ish, and no dragoon dirk.  I'm gonna get one from a friend and hand in the skullcap just to see what happens.  <br>
I'm curious if this item still drops? Has anyone done the quest with in the past 3 days?  Possibly anything I'm missing?<br>

In order to turn in beads from MT goblins, you must be amiable.  <br>
<br>
If you are running low on cash for bandages for whatever reason, you can get to amiable by killing many, many goblins, or by doing the stew quest in Rivervale. <br>

I have not done the quest lately, but I suppose it is possible that warmly is the faction required.  Whether or not it is just simply broken, I cannot say, though I would be emmensly surprised if it were.<br>

Going to spend some time tonight getting to Warmly or higher faction, and see if that makes a difference.  (Also have a side test I'm going to do with a dragoon dirk and a leatherfoot skull cap, Just to see if this cap I looted off the halfings will still get me the same end quest item)<br>
