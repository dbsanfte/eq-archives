<br>
I choose SB for other reasons than 2 handers, but from reading this board, it sounds like I should be using one?  I'm only 10th, so maybe things change, but my Bastard Sword and Left Axe seem to work better.  My Build?  Approximately:<br>
<br>
6 LA<br>
7 Sword<br>
7 CA<br>
3 Stealth (auto-trained)<br>
<br>
Am I doing something wrong?  Do 2 handers only work better if you DON'T train LA?  Or do they only help with higher level styles?  What's the deal?  I don't want to miss out on what may be an advantage in an already difficult-enough class.<br>
<br>
Oh, and while I'm asking questions... I was planning on going completely without envenom.  It doesn't sound that great, and I personally don't like messing with &quot;Ammunition&quot; (I'd NEVER play an archer), or having to reapply poisons between every fight.  If I have any ability, I want to be able to use it.  Anyway, am I really gimping myself, or will I be ok if I can last without Envenom until a certain level?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your answers,<br>
<br>

<br>
2h provides a higher base damage for opening CS styles (the bonus remains the same) and has a higher cap (due to being slower and 2h's 30% cap bonus).  To optimally take advantage of that front loaded damage, you'd want very high weapon and CS spec.<br>
<br>
At low levels, you're really best off focusing on 2 skills.  Either weapon + CS with 2h backstabs or else weapon + left axe with left axe styles.  You can dabble a bit in a 3rd skill, but focusing on keeping 2 near level will help you the most in early PvE.  Eventually, you'll want to up stealth more than just letting it auto-train, but early on, it works fine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueigerdaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eiger DAOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 5:53:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Two-Handed Weapon Benefit?</span><hr size=1> Ahh, great, thank you for the helpful reply.<br>
<br>
Ok, so the 2-Hander only helps with Damage CAP, that makes sense.  And I haven't seen a difference, because I'm not near the cap.<br>
<br>
And yes, as well as going with no Envenom, I had planned to give LA a rest for a while, now that I've got the Ravager Style.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

This is currently not applicable as 2handed weapon is massively reduced and opening strikes overall now pretty much suck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwoodydarogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WoodyDaRogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 7:08:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE</span><hr size=1> 2h weapons suck in my opinion.<br>
<br>
the only case i ever use a 2h weapon is if im going for a 1 shot kill<br>
<br>
otherwise its always 1h/la<br>
<br>
i find the 2h nearly useless when trying to take out opposing archers (most notably rangers because of speed spell) as they often hit that spell before my CD lands because of the long delay.<br>
<br>
there has been a very big discussion about this over on the VN boards, i just dont see the &quot;huge advantage&quot; of a 2h weapon overall, with the exception of the 1 shot kills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=4><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22>Stealth Training</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
