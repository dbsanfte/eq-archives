This will be my first duel ever.  Sorry if the title was misleading, I'm not going to be fighting ten people at the same time hehe.  I will be fighting a total of ten, or maybe a couple more, individually at different times.  Here's my magelo profile so you can see where I'm at equipment wise.<br><br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112237">www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112237</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br><br>I will be purchasing the proper resist gear (2x BD Bracers, 2x BD Earrings, 2x Vel Diamond Rings, RBF, Frog Crown) as well as several pumice stones.  I've read up on the pvp information in the library and memorized alot of the important tips and strategies to be used.  I am Lvl 60 and will be dueling against (* means he/she has an epic) a 55 druid*, 55 pally*, 54 bard*, 54 shaman*, 53 enchanter, 53 warrior, 53 pally, 55 enchanter, 52 druid, 55 necro.  Please be aware that they are from a roleplaying guild so their equipment isn't uber.  The 55 druid* and the 55 pally* are the only two of the bunch that I am worried about because they are on more than the others and thus have more exprience in playing their class.  The 55 druid* however, hates to kite and never has kited anything much so I'm thinking that's a good thing<br><br>The library gave me basic information about how to duel.  What I want is to hear the knowledge other rogues may have gained from dueling one or more of these classes.  My friend informed me that because I was 60 and they were 55 and lower, they will have some difficulty landing their spells on me, especially if my mr is 100+ unbuffed.  I am definitely going to get Chaotic Stab before I begin the duels to give myself a bigger punch against the melees.<br><br>The duels will be one on one as I mentioned earlier and should be done in the Arena in the Bazaar or the Arena in Lake Rathe, not quite sure yet.  But I assure you it won't be in some random zone, it will definitely be in some arena.  Know that pretty much all ten people, like me, have never been in a serious duel like this so we are all inexperienced. <br><br>So, if other rogues could post the experiences they've had at fighting these different classes, or add in more words of wisdom for me to keep in mind, or even strategies and tactics you found helpful, please do.  Thanks again.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EDIT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Forgot to mention.  I won't be dueling them in any particular order.  I'll just be picking one and killing him.  This isn't a competition, it's actually a roleplaying event, one which they are only slightly aware of.  I will be calling them one at a time to wherever I want to do the duel and when they come in, I'll already be s/h and begin from there.  I only have to kill each of them once, get a screen shot of their corpse and that's that.  My goal is to kill them all once, then that's that.   <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112237">Veteran Tamador</a></b> the Feir'Dal Assassin<br><b>60th Seasoned Rogue</b> - Innoruuk<br></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/utamadortheassassin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tamador the Assassin</A> at: 7/1/02 6:00:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ukuspin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kuspin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 9:17:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=695.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Rogue vs Ten People, Share experiences?</span><hr size=1> Well due to the level difference, using something like the snare 4 poison (sloth) which is makable with bought components in Firiona vie will probably guarentee you a number of easy kills, and probably would be handy to reapply in the fight against the bard who might spend alot of time running out of reach.  Though it might have trouble sticking on the necro if he's floating.  A good shaman damage shield potion can also be handy for killing off pets very fast if your being led around while it beats on you, and of course sow potions always give the important mobility edge.

If they tag you and start to cast they will still connect, but if they dont see it comming, you can strip alot of buffs away. Also, NPCs have the best tracking in the game, so hide/sneak wont work if they get a pet on you.<br><br>DD spells only do 66% damage in PvP, so nukes wont be your problem really. Get your MR, FR and PR (i think tash is PR based. Also do not know if druids have any good cold based spells at that level) Necro might be a problem due to taps and such.<br><br>With most casters, just get on them and stay there, if you can, hide so that they lose target (and cant cast another spell on you right away) and get behind them to BS them. Unless they have rune on, you will see a nice chunk of HP leave.

As far as necro goes...hmmm 55...Any dot he puts on you that are magic based, make sure you dispell them. His lifetaps will be what kills you if hedoes...just try and stay as close as possible, and by all means, IGNORE the pet. <br><br>Far as enchanter...if he knows what he's doing, good luck. Heh I pvp all the time and have still yet to find a good way to kill an enchanter as a mage besides to catch them offguard. <br><br>Paladin, Warrior, and stuff, you're gonna have to learn how to joust real quick. If they don't joust you, you will have a better chances, just run behind and BS...if they joust, throw off the timing, turn around and bs them as they run past.<br><br>Druids are tough sometimes, just stay as close as possible and hit as much as bossible...once again, if they WD, dispell it. <br>Bards I don't want to even get into....they run like the wind and won't get hit..if you do hit them, they'll just run around and heal while you chase like a fool. Best way to kill a bard is to be a caster and Malo, Tash, and root heh. Good luck with that!<br>As far as shaman, he's 54. Which means...no Pox, no BoN. Ebolt is easily resisted if you have close to 100 pr...keep those BD earrings. CR will be your toughest if he has a JBB and stuff...once again, he can heal himself, so stay close. You're only gonna lose by DD I would imagine...Disease dots take 2 and a half mins...the fight will probably be over by then. <br><br>I also want to mention this...I noticed that you said as soon as they step in they will be attacked....I know I was in bazaar the other day...I stepped into arena, and my pet poofed....in this case, if you do it here, you will have no problems with pets, and will make your life much easier.<br><br>One more thing to boot....alot of people here have said &quot;just use sneak/hide and lose them before they start casting&quot;...if any of these people know what they are doing, they will have a see invis item on them, or at least have the buff on them...you will have to dispell. So don't count on sneak/hide doing much for you, sorry. <br><br>Hope this helps, just some of my experiences in PvP and the such.<br><br>Arwenn Evenstar <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukeliur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>K e l i u r</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/15/02 3:44:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=695.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Rogue vs Ten People, Share experiences?</span><hr size=1> I am Lvl 60 and will be dueling against (* means he/she has an epic) a 55 druid*, 55 pally*, 54 bard*, 54 shaman*, 53 enchanter, 53 warrior, 53 pally, 55 enchanter, 52 druid, 55 necro.<br><br>   You beeing lvl 60 should be enough to kill all of them 1 by 1.<br><br>   Druids are not that hard to kill, you need to kill them fast, real fast, dont let the dots do the dmg so they can refresh. Use poisons ... spirit of sloth or spine break or something... pop the disc once you snare them. <br><br>   Bards ... well unless bard is in a very uber guild- has great gear ( like those nuke boots ) or something, they are same as druids. I had a 60 bard run around &amp; hit me with his song for 15 dmg . This went on for about 15 mins, then I landed sos on him &amp; he died fast. Just snare him and he will die. They dont have the ac / dodge skills to save them. <br><br>   Paly - all I can tell you is this, they will heal ALOT and wont do much dmg from the duels I had ... unless he has a very good 2hander. So use a manadrain to drop some of their mana. Get some resists up ... all you need is mr up to a 100 or so and you are fine. You can use a snare poison, then use manadrain and beat him down real fast. <br><br>   Shaman - Get your resists to about 100 or so, focus on desease, poison, mr . Try to land a snare on him, dont bother with disspell if he has black furr boots. Just try to snare him and dont let him cast if you cant land it. Again you got an advantage, you are 60 and you have backstab, you can do alot of dmg fast which he wont live through. <br><br>   Chanter - He will die if you get 120 + mr. Just beat him down while he tries to mez / slow you . If he puts up elemental illusion, dont use low dlay weapon. You dont really need snare here since with 120 mr and 90 + in other resists you can easily kill him. <br><br>   Warrior - Just joyst around him for a bit and he will die, try to snare him ... and he will die faster, this shouldnt be much of a problem ... since he is not even 55 + . <br><br>   Necro - Dont bother with poison here ... if he uses dmf, you wont land it on him. Dont let him cast, he will have around 1600 hp or so, just beat it out of him while he tries to dot you. Necros are same as druids dont let him live to long. Dont pay att to the pet, just got for him and beat him down. If he uses shadow step you could have problems. Just try not to let him cast it.<br><br> <br>   You will win all of these duels, its not hard, just think about every single thing they can do and be aware, then again ... they are not 60 so you have the + since you will resist alot of spells just because you are higher. <br>    Use disspell before you land your poison, keep a few stacks of bandages in your bags and use poisons if you can. Even the easiest poison - spine break will make a big diff in those duels since the targets are lower lvl and the poison will stick for full time. <br><br>  Veteran Keliur T'Soul<br>   Ec'I <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufilash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filash</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/15/02 8:35:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=695.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Rogue vs Ten People, Share experiences?</span><hr size=1> For the love of all that is good don't use a mana drain on a 55 paladin.

At lvl 60 he should tear all of them up, not get beat by them. <br>Only class I can think of that could put up a good fight is a necro, thats about it. Dont forget casters dont have that much hp, they go down fast thinking they can cast thru the hits. <br><br>Dots will hurt but you can live through them, just get some sow potions or something, learn how to get behind them when they are casting... duel alot and you will learn. Dont depend on poison or your weapon procs or anything like that, only thing you can depend on is your backstab button, it will win you the duel if you use it right, ask a friend of yours to help you practice, learn how to beat them loosing less hp every time... duel alot of people, everyone has a diff way to duel, learn those moves and think what you can do to beat your target. <br><br>Best experience you can get is from dueling yourself, reading what other people think will not help you that much. <br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a
