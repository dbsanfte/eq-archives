Then read.&lt;Long&gt;</span><hr size=1> Hmm.<br><br>I started with A worn dagger. I think it was.<br><br>It was an amazing weapon. &lt;The best I could steal at the time&gt; Little did i know it was magic. I would lose a fight and amazingly it would return with me to North Qeynos. On my back a dirty old shirt. Given to me by a Master thief.<br><br>I lost the dagger sadly in my travels. &lt;Sniff&gt; I miss my first lil dagger. The Shirt was taken away by some gnoll in the depths of Paw<br><br>I Had died in the depths of Infected paw, before the invasion of the Ishva Mal. And For the longest time I could not return to the land of Norrath. Not as a thief in any matter.<br><br>When I returned finally, after almost 12 months. I saw I was outside the bank of Halas. Naked at the day I stole that first dagger. &lt;Oh I wished I had that dagger then.&gt; I was of the 19th rank, and Didnt have a coin to my name but some copper I had in the bank.<br><br>So Being an old hand in Halas, I went outside to where the gnoll pups and feeble undead roamed. After Choking the life out of a few pups, and clubbing the undead with thier own femurs I had enough coin to purchase a rusty dagger. Ahh the memories it brought back, the little pock marked pitted and worn dagger reminded me of my youth.<br><br>Seems that the days passed rapidly then. I had found that the training of new thieves had greatly improved. They found ways to teach people to sneak and hide so to be almost invisable. &lt;Simply amazing&gt; I learned that distracting a foe with a gesture could afford me enough time to duck away from the combat and line up for a sneak attack.<br><br>So I went to work with my rusty dagger. And a splintering club I found off a rotted skeleton. I quickly amassed a fourtune in silver and purchased some leather to protect me from the cold. I had found someone had sold a beetle eye to a vendor so I would have light to get through blackburrow. <br><br>My human eyes were not up to the task of seeing through the darkness like many others.<br><br>I Rapidly advanced in my slaughter, in blackburrow I was like unto a goddess. With my skills long unused coming back to me and my new found skills allowing me to attack from the rear with much greater effect I realized I once again was enjoying myself. Unlike the times of old when I would go many combats without ever landing a telling blow, I now could hit with an easy confidence. My rusty dagger poked many a spleen that day I tell you.<br><br>A passing shaman saw my laying waste to Elite gnolls and asked what I was doing killing things that were so beneath me in stregth. I told her that after a long absence I was once again going to carve a name for myself, that I would reclaim the name I took for myself. Feather Silverthorn.<br><br>She blessed me with a spirit of the wolf and handed me a weapon I knew quite quite well. She gave it to me with a blessing. It was the stinger from a creature found only in the land of elves. It had the wonderous ability to poisen.<br><br>It was called a Crookstinger. &lt;What a wonderful weapon&gt;<br><br>I had one long ago before my demise in Infected paw. Amazing! Could this be the same weapon I wondered<br><br>I took it and thanked her for her kindness and promised to pass it on to another worthy person, when I had stolen myself better weapons.<br><br>From there after the slaughter of many a will o the wisp. I found myself garbed in comfortable leather, and robbing and pillaging in the south karanas. The Avaiks were hard pressed to keep thier coin from me, and the centaurs fell to the crookstinger as well.<br><br>That was when I heard of the Lands of kunark. Adventure calling me I packed my bags &lt;a sewing kit, and 6 backpacks&gt; With my trusty beetle eye hanging from my belt and a whole 2 more levels since my recovery I went to kunark to adventure....<br><br>Dragons and gods have fallen to my blades. And the blood of millions it seems but I am the same as I was many years before. Starting in qeynos looking for adventure. &lt;and lots and lots of gold&gt;<br><br>Now I am Level 59. A few steps from the coveted pinnacle of thievly abilities. I use a Ragebringer, that I paid for in my own blood and the blood of my friends, and a bloodpoint. <br><br>I can Summon daggers to entice creatures away from thier fellows, for me and my friends to murder. Use a cantrip placed into my helm to allow my poor human eyes to see. I have a bracer of heros on my wrist, protecting me from the blows of the creatures we kill. The Fangs of a couple large Velious orcs adorn my ears. I wear a dragon skin mask to cover my face, Some say they have never seen its match.<br><br>And a Necklace of dragon teeth about my neck, glistening in the shadows.<br><br>My Arms are covored in black metal said to be once worn by the great thief Myroklar. They give me the stregth of earth when I feel weak.<br><br>My Legs are protected from the elements by woven shadow from the plane of hate. My Feet in Boots made from a great turtle named Lozdal. My gloves are of the supple scale of a long dead sebilite.<br><br>I have a belt of black bat fur, and my shoulders bear the ravenscale mantle.<br><br>Yet many days I still miss my Crookstinger. Long passed down to a young thief. I miss the times of trouble when all thieves were kin, and you would give the shirt off your back to a brother. &lt;You could always steal it back when he was sleeping.&gt;<br><br>And most of All I miss the innocence of people going out into the grand world. With thier cloth shirt worn proudly With the Wizards in red robes, and The Erudite enchanter running about in yellow. The days when adventure was a word spoke in hushed tones, and the frogloks of guk were not to be trifled with. <br><br>The days of heros are long passed now, with children walking about in the plate of the Fallen. Weilding the weapons of the gods before learning to tie thier own shoes. <br><br>Using maps to learn where the greatest treaures the world has ever seen. Then going there with no fear in thier heart.<br><br>I say this to any new thieves. It doesnt matter what you were in another life. The life of a thief is a chance to start anew. To carve a path to infamy, to slip silently into the shadows, and go where few dare to walk. <br><br>Don't cheapen the journy with the spoils of another. Learn where you are strong and where you are weak. Then walk the path proud. Because you will not be beholden to another. A person brought up in the shadow of another. You will not owe anyone anything but a thanks and friendship. <br><br>You will be one of the old. A hero.<br><br>Feather Silverthorn Thief Eroslli Marr.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udrakinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drakinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/01 4:15:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thinking of starting a new thief.

I set out into the mighty heart of Misty Thicket with nothing but some food and milk, a slightly worn dagger, and a flimsy but well given tunic.<br><br>Since then I have encountered many foes. After a long stream of orcs I managed to bribe a infamous Stilleto of the Bloodclaw off a old battle worn kin. It was a great blessing to be wielding a weapon that someone so many adventures past had worn as well.<br><br>With that dagger many orcs and alligators fell to my mighty blows and I soon was able to sneak and hide at the same time, an ability previously unknown to the roguish kind. <br><br>One rainy night in the land known as East Commons a bizarre of some sort was taking place. I felt that I was strong, as my guild master told me I was of the 23rd Circle. <br><br>I challenged a slightly more experienced rogue to a duel for he was mocking my mighty Stiletto and Gnoll Hide Lariat. After a long fight of him trying to duel me face to face and me sneaking around to his ventral side we were both low on health and knew the next blow would be one of our last. <br><br>With a great cry of &quot;For Bristlbane&quot; I charged him, parried his blow, circled to his back and left a gaping hole in it.<br><br>The more experienced rogue was laying on the ground pleading for me to spare him.<br><br>Reluctantly I agreed, saying he was lucky he was one of mykind. After he got up he gave me the mighty spear he was using and told me to use it with pride.<br><br>I looked at what he gave me and I noticed it was the Slime Coated Harpoon.&lt;this was when they were worth 10K+&gt;<br><br>I gasped at him and wondered how he would ever replace such a fine weapon for himself but he said he had much finer weapons and had just come to the Commons to try adn sell it.<br><br>That is the tale of how I got my weapons, and I am now about to be embarking on the planes.<br><br>Therefor I beg of you young rogues, start anew on your own path. Do not let the rogues that think they are warriors vear you from your path.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usnowflower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snowflower</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/01 5:54:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thinking of starting a new thief.

The second made it to lvl 12 before I realized how stupid it was to have given that book to the Priest at the bottom of the lift.   But Silvana has been great fun. I still remember exploring around Feydwer. I was so nervous on my first trip to Steamfont mountains! Plus, my only map was the one in the box and as you all know, it isn't entirely accurate.  I met a few people and joined my first guild at lvl 13.

Sure, there's a good feeling you get when you pry some item out of the corpse of a ferocious beast, but for the most part, item camping sucks.  If you go to an area with the intent of getting an item, you will be disappointed and frustrated, and that feeling you get is more relief than fulfillment.<br><br>Instead, I have chosen the course of always going where the XPS are.  If it ain't good xps, I ain't camping it.   There are exceptions, but they're rather notable because of the no-drop nature of the items (Epics, planes armor, Jboots).  Any equipment I actually get is more coincidence than coordinated plan. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukelliv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelliv</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/01 10:39:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thinking of starting a new thief.

I had been around here (Safehouse for awhile) but then the hardship of the class got to me (this was about a year and a half ago... the &quot;old&quot; days).<br><br>I dabbled at many characters, never really getting any of them up very high. I enjoy the thrill of making a new character and exploring. <br><br>My very first adventure was with a secondary character I made- a Halfelf warrior. Some guy wanted to group up with me. I knew how to group and such but had not been out of the West Freeport zone... Beetles were my largest game to date.<br><br>So this guy says 'Let's go to West Commons- it's safe.'<br><br>Commons... Hmmm doesn't sound menacing... sure, let's go.<br><br>So the guy gets me out by Befallen and ditches me. <br><br>I was so scared and lost!<br><br>(how can you be so afraid... it's only a game. But when you're new you get wrapped up into things.)<br><br>I saw Hill gaints and almost had a heart attack. I saw the largest spider you could imagine.<br><br>I slowly inched my way back along the desert (a brand newbie level 3) to EC and back into the safety of my Home-Beloved Freeport. I felt like I had done something surely noone else in the game would dare try- travelling 3 whole zones at lvl 3 without dying!! (Oh how proud I was lol)<br><br><br>Thank you for the wonderful, eloquent post. It made me remember many fond fond memories of my babyhood within Norrath. Even though the guy had left me for dead I had puffed up with pride at having survived the ordeal, and it left a permanent impression on me: in this game, the best part is exploring a new zone without help, using only my wits and the luck of the Gods to keep me alive. Thanks for reminding me of that most valuable lesson I had learned so long ago.<br><br>/salute<br>/kneel<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=725.topic&start=21&stop=28>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showPrevMessage?topicID=725.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showNextMessage?topicID=725.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=20><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=725.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=725.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=725.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=725.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousefrm31">Official News<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm30">Lesser Classes<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
