<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sun hung low on the horizon in the crisp Autumn air, staining the skies delicate shades of amber and violet. The gentle wind had the slightest bite to it, precursor of the coming winter.  I would have never noticed it before, but now every scent, each facet of reality, was alive with importance.  When a bird chirped hesitantly from the north, my eyes leapt unerringly in its direction, making sure it was indeed a bird.  Bird calls, Thorfinn had told me, made some of the best coded signals in the world; easy to overlook, easy to imitate.  It took great concentration to remain aware of the call of every bird, the movement of every stone.  But it was a price I was willing to pay.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I noticed, too, that my teacher's eyes, like mine, never ceased their roaming; but neither did they miss any detail.  We glided through the dusk like twin shadows, leaving no mark of our passing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Do you think -&quot; I began, but a glare silenced me.  Thorfinn unlimbered one of his big, dirty hands and gestured, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Use the Cant.  You need more practice.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I nodded, moving my left hand through the sequence of coded movements.  It had been the slower of my two hands to learn thus far.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Do you think we have been followed?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn shook his head.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Not the way we've come,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he gestured back.  The surety of his gestures betrayed total certanity.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Even if we were tracked to the eastern regions, our trail would have gone cold in the canyons.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I replied silently, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I don't like leaving loose ends.  She might not be safe with Bayle's troops.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why didn't you leave one of your own men with her, then?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He raised one eyebrow, even as his little finger hooked in the question gesture.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I did,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I admitted.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Chemistrius is watching her.  And Zachton is close by, if there's any trouble.  But we know Kane has men in the tower.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And we know Linarius knows who they are,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he replied.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Even if he does not know who </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->you<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  are.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I nodded - I had thought it best that the fewer knew my identity, the better.  I had dealt with many old friends who still believed I was dead.  I ran my fingers through my white hair and sighed, but knew there was no help for it; it would be at least another year before I could walk as a human again without fear of being recognized.  Memories were still too fresh.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> It is still difficult to bear decieving those who were once my friends,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I signaled.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And even more difficult to convince them to trust a dark elf.  It is a good thing Kagato's faction has become so influential.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It would be unwise to trust in it too heavily, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->my teacher replied sternly.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Were it not for the letter from Ulrich, he would not have trusted either of us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And Ulrich would not have sent the letter were it not for your father's memory, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I reasoned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And yours.  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Thorfinn's gesture was sharp.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My hand went still, lapsing into silence as I continued to pace alongside the hulking barbarian.  His black armor, like mine, made no sound, even at a fast clip, and the plates bent like supple cloth when we moved.  Karadin had told me the armor was made of woven shadows, and did not quite obey the physical laws of Norrath as solid metal should.  The method of its construction was a closely guarded secret, never divulged on pain of death to any but the most trusted of mages.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A few months ago, Zarar had sought me out, wanting the shattered remnants of the abhorrent gargoyle that I had gathered up after its death.  Half the fragments had gone into the construction of the suits of armor we all wore now; the other half had disappeared without a trace.  I would have looked more closely at his doings, but the Militia and the Coalition had been closing too quickly; another day in Freeport and they would have found me.  I clenched my fist helplessly as I remembered Moro's dying words.....&quot;They have been my undoing, Arafein....do not let them be yours.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My teacher's eyes noticed my movement, small though it was.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What is it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just a stray memory, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I replied.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Moro told me that the power games in Freeport would kill me as they killed her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only if you let them.  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->His tone was dismissive.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Lucan is dead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Elsin is a powerful enemy, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I reminded him.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And we can be sure she knows much of what Nestral knew.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How much did Nestral know?  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->He seemed surprised.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I grimaced.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Too much.  She knew about the mark.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And about you?  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->His other hand closed around the hilt of his dagger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I shook my head.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Not enough to endanger either of us.  But enough to make Elsin suspicous.  We should have killed Nestral earlier.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why?  It wouldn't have mattered.  We're not the only ones the Coalition knows is looking for the mark.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The last thing we need is more attention, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I gestured vehemently.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nestral knew me too well; she might have been able to track us.  But that's not something she could have imparted to Elsin.  If House T`Gaza still existed, things would be even worse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And you still don't think we were followed?  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->His eyebrow rose again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I gritted my teeth in frustration.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> That's what I'm trying to tell you.  If she was still alive, we would have been.  I wouldn't have gone near Freeport in the first place except to be sure of her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And to be sure of Dushire's contract.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I grimaced, but I let it go.  Doubtless, Thorfinn still thought that had been a mistake on my part.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The flat land of the northern plains of Karana were fast giving way to the gentle rolling hills of the western region beneath our strides, and the sun dipped lower into the horizon as we moved toward it.   Before long, the settlement of Zek would be behind us, and the rendezvous point would be close.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We glided through the sparse brush covering the hills in absolute silence, always avoiding the fading beams of sunlight that lanced down through the branches.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Who is our contact? I signaled as we traveled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An outcast from the White Rose, the scout said, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->he replied easily.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Other than that, I have no idea.  Which is why you are here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The scout said to come alone? </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I guessed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn nodded.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> You'll have to watch my back, in case this is a trap.  Don't let the contact see you if you can help it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the backup plan?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He shrugged.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> A lie is more convincing when it's partially true - if something goes wrong, we'll just tell him it was part of your training.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I couldn't help but nod - it made perfect sense to me.  All I had to do was play the part of an inept beginner.  The fires of the Zek encampment flashed briefly past us, then were gone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The moon was just beginning to rise when the threadbare tents of the brigand camp melted out of the darkness before us.  I turned to Thorfinn, making the gesture for a general question.  At his nod, I fell back, letting him outpace me by at least fifteen strides, then began to follow him, slipping in and out of the shadows of the trees as though they were pools of water.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As my teacher approached the camp, he held his arms out in a gesture of defenselessness, looking about him curiously.  I wasn't fooled - once, he had set his weapons on the ground and placed a blanket over them, then asked me to attack him before he could disarm me.  Although my strike was perfect, my hand had arrived at its target totally empty; I had stared at it in shock for a moment before he had flipped up the blanket to reveal a blank patch of floor, then pointed to his belt.  Both his daggers had still been in their sheaths; he had disarmed me with a hidden knife up his sleeve.  But one thing didn't sit well with me - the camp was totally empty.  If our contact was nearby, I could not sense him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn's head turned slowly - first in one direction, then another.  Suddenly, he stopped, and sniffed the air curiously.  The instant he did so, I also became aware of the new scent; someone had arrived, and had most likely stepped into the airflow upwind from us on purpose to let us know.  I hoisted myself silently into the foliage of a particularly large spruce and crouched on one of the lower branches, peering intently into the camp as the newcomer strode boldly into the deserted camp.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He seemed at first glance to be an ordinairy barbarian, but as soon as he came within handshaking distance of Thorfinn I realized my error - he was only about five feet tall, unusually short for one of his race.  His beard and hair were streaked with gray, but he still looked very hale and alert.  I noted the daggers on his belt with more than a passing interest, even as I strained my ears to hear the conversation.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You sent a message for me?&quot;  Thorfinn asked, the picture of innocence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The small barbarian nodded.  &quot;McLanis knows who you are, and gave me your name a few years ago.  I thought we might be able to discuss some business matters.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hospitality before commerce,&quot; Thorfinn commented, &quot;seems to be a thing of the past these days.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The other looked baffled for a moment, then shrugged.  &quot;As you will.  I'm called Vilnius the Small, and I know who you are, Wayforger.  Your work has drawn great admiration in the eastern circles.&quot;  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn bowed, choosing to ignore the obvious falsity of the complement.  &quot;Very well, Mr. the Small....how can I aid you?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The shorter barbarian seemed to bristle a bit, but didn't take the bait.  Turning away, he gazed coldly out at the empty plains for a few moments before speaking again.  &quot;A courier of mine went to make an appraisal in Qeynos three days ago; I've had no word of her.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Then it is likely she is dead,&quot; reasoned my teacher blandly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vilnius shrugged.  &quot;Perhaps.  Or she may have gone to ground.  Either way, I'm in need of someone to find out.  You come very highly recommended.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn neither moved nor spoke.  After a few brief moments of silence, the smaller barbarian looked back over his shoulder at my teacher.  &quot;Well?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The taller barbarian shrugged.  &quot;You're going to need to be a bit more specific than that.  Unless you want to pay double the fee to cover my investigative expenses.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vilnius scowled for a moment, muttering under his breath.  I shifted my weight slightly to lean a bit closer, careful to keep the stress of my weight off the weaker parts of the branch; perhaps a fifty-fifty chance of the branch creaking.  If I made a sound, Vilnius would doubtlessly discern my presence instantly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The branch remained silent.  After a moment, he turned back to Thorfinn and hurled words at him like daggers.  &quot;Very well.  Her name is, or perhaps was, Malka Rale.  She was sent on an errand for me concerning the Circle of Unseen Hands.  What errand that may be, you don't need to know.&quot;  Thorfinn raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.  &quot;She was carrying an item that should have been returned to me.  If she is alive, obtain it from her - if she is dead, take it from her corpse.  But bring the item to me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn stayed still a moment longer, then nodded slowly.  &quot;All right - I'll take the job.  You know my fee, I assume?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vilnius grimaced, but nodded wordlessly.  At that, the meeting terminated as abruptly as a snapping branch;  Thorfinn turned on his heel and walked away without another word, and Vilnius turned away to study the night sky as though nothing of import had occurred.  I slipped away through the branches after Thorfinn's retreating back, running along through the treetops as easily as a squirrel.  Moonlight gleamed off my indigo skin whenever it stole through the foliage.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Within half an hour, we had traversed more than a league, and the forest had begun to thin out.  I dropped wordlessly to my teacher's side as he strode westward across the leaf-littered ground, matching his pace easily.  After a moment, his right hand flickered at me, You took an unecessary risk.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes, I did, I signaled back.  But I made no explanation or excuse.  After a few more moments, Thorfinn sighed and shook his head resignedly, but he let the matter drop.  My gaze roved over the horizons grimly, and I nodded to myself.  Sunrise would find us in the hills.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The lake had changed little since I had seen it last.  The early morning sun glinted off its pristene surface as though it were a great crescent-shaped sapphire, pressed rudely into the earth by some titanic thumb.  A small willow gave us enough cover from prying eyes to stop and rest for a moment, and I sank greatfully to the soft grass.  Thorfinn thumped down next to me easily, stretching his big, dirty hands out behind his head.  I glowered at the sunlight as I gently kneaded the muscles of my thighs and calves, trying to ensure they would not form kinks while I rested.  After a few moments, Thorfinn stirred, reaching into his pack for some provisions and water.  I accepted the food from him silently, flicking a dagger from my sleeve to cut and spear the tough, salted beef with.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn grunted.  &quot;You're still putting too much flourish into it.  The dagger should fall into your hand, not be thrown there.&quot;  To demonstrate, he flexed his arm idly, and a small throwing dagger appeared in his hand seemingly without transition.  I shrugged and continued eating my food, drawing a scowl from my teacher, but nothing more.  Mentally, though, I was rehearsing the movement of the dagger palm, making sure I could produce my own weapon as smoothly as I needed to, should the occasion arose.  It was a source of never-ending frustration to my teacher that I often pretended to ignore his lessons only to reproduce them later seemingly without effort.  We ate in silence for a while, then Thorfinn took a drink of water from his flask, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.  He gave a small sigh of relaxation, then reclined on the grass again.  From behind his head, one of his heads flicked at me, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> How much do you know about the Circle?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Very little, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->my free hand gestured as my other brought the knife to my teeth.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Only that they are based in Qeynos, with many of their operatives in the Highpass.  Carson has some affilation with them that I have not been able to discern.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn's thumb tapped the second knuckle of his index finger twice, indicating I should pay attention.  I took another bite of salted beef, then turned to face him.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Circle is more compact than the Coalition, not benefitting from any alliance with the city government as the organizations in Freeport do.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They have no connection to the Bloodsabers?  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I questioned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn shook his head.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> None that I know of, and certainly none official.  The only thing that they share is territory.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My eyes turned hard as agates.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The catacombs.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The thumb tapped the knuckle again, drawing my attention as a string draws a weight when pulled.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nevertheless, the Circle is very different from their eastern counterparts.  They bear a strong resemblance to the Ebon Mask in terms of operation and organization, if not efficiency.  They even have some ties to them, as well as to Miner's Guild 628.  Their leader is a man named Hanns Krieghor, and they have many influential persons in positions of power in the central areas.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I nodded.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Such as the Highpass, and perhaps other areas.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They had been expanding into the Rivervale area, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->my teacher continued, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> but Lendel was able to eliminate their scouts and inform me of the danger when we passed through there.  I don't know if you noticed when I recieved the letter -<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From the goblin you pretended to scare off, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I replied without any hesitation.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gunrich's face is more familiar to me than the Deeppockets know, it would seem.  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Thorfinn blinked, but betrayed no surprise.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What relevance does this have?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn frowned.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> You should know better than to ask that.  If we are detected, even after completing our task, we'll most likely make deadly enemies of the Unseen Hand.  You of all people should know how important it is to avoid that.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I could not help but shrug again.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I've made more than enough enemies already.  One more won't hurt.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn said no more through the rest of my meal; even his expression was bland and genial.  But I had seen him wear that same expression while unconcernedly mowing down a trio of aqua goblins - the same expression that he had worn while breaking the fingers of a captured emissary.  I assumed nothing.<br>
<br>
*  *  *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By far, the most noticable feature of the catacombs beneath the city of Qeynos is that you never see everything that you believe you should.  Torchlight fades at inconvenient distances, sounds are muffled just enough to prevent discerning of direction, and tunnels branch and curve at the precise intervals required to make every turn a blind one.  It is a trapmaker's dream come true; the simplest and most obvious of traps can be concealed nearly without effort by the most rudimentary effort of placement.  A swinging sword trap at neck level placed just beyond a blind corner would be nearly impossible to detect until after the recipient was already looking up at his own ankles.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn strode ahead of me by perhaps ten feet, to all appearances utterly unconcerned about the mere possibility of anything untoward happening.  I, on the other hand, took great care to avoid each potential trap as I saw it, weaving a drunken path all over the tunnel floor.  Irrationally, I found myself wishing the constructors of the catacombs had been better trapmakers - at least then I might feel a little more  justified making a fool of myself.  But, as Brin had been wont to say, whether the ten thousand sword blows that you parry would have missed anyway doesn't matter - it's the one you don't parry that ends up counting.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We had slept under the willow on the banks of the nameless lake in Qeynos Hills for the majority of the morning, and arisen just as dusk was beginning.  The sentries near the outskirts of the city had been trivial to elude, and we had slipped into the sewer entrance near the city walls without incident not long before moonrise.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a few hours of wandering in the catacombs, my sense of direction was beginning to fray a little, but I was still relatively sure where we were.  The tunnel where Lvarwen and I had felled Drosco the zombie were roughly a half-mile to the west of here, by my...estimate...<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Milady...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I shook the thought away quickly.  Any more of that and I would lose my concentration, and likely wind up stepping in a steel jaw trap or something equally embarassing.  Past failures were unimportant now.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thus far, nothing of interest had risen to hinder us; the many rats that inhabited the sewers had scuttled away at our approach, and the single skeleton that had crossed our path had shied away from my hate-filled glare.  Had the thing risen against us, I would have gladly destroyed it, but apparently it had wanted no part of me, and had shambled off down another tunnel without any prompting.  Somewhere behind us, the sound of steadily dripping water carried eerily through the dead, flat atmosphere.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When a sudden, near-indetectable thrum vibrated the ground under my bootsoles, I stopped and tapped the wall next to me gently with a fingernail.  Thorfinn, still looking sublimely unconcerned, turned and regarded me expectantly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Footsteps,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I signaled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn nodded.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Circle has their main base of operations several levels above this area.  I'm surprised you managed to sense it through that much stone and distance, though.  I don't think we'll find Vilnius' missing errand girl in this part of the catacombs.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He turned and continued walking, as I followed grimly.  The thought of a thieves' guild nearby brought forth many conflicting emotions in me, from  nostalgia to homesickness to self-loathing.  It is very strange to spend the first half of one's life despising thieves as cowards and scum, and the proceeding half learning to be one.  I followed my teacher silently.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Within three turns, I found us heading northward, back the way we had come.  The minute vibrations of footsteps faded for a little while, then returned, just as strong as before - I was vaguely irritated with myself that I had not noticed it on my first trip through the area.  Too much wasteful speculation.  I grimaced as I stepped over a pressure switch that had been rather hastily remortared, then grinned despite myself as I nearly put my foot on a much more carefully concealed pressure trigger - the exact distance beyond the initial one that an intruder would step to avoid it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Had me worried, for a moment,&quot; said Thorfinn conversationally.  I looked up to see him slide his dagger out of the path of the wire trap that I would have triggered if I had stepped on the second switch - if I had sprung the trap on myself, Thorfinn's blade would have severed the offending wire long before it had gotten a chance to entangle and lacerate me.  Of course, it would have been mortally embarrassing, just the same - just as he would have intended it to be.  When I did not respond, he merely shrugged and slid his dagger back into its sheath.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yard after yard of gray stone passed under my boot heels, flickering like chessboard squares in my mind's eye as I avoided trap after trigger, striving to stay focused.  The long-forgotten bustle and roar of the city where I had been born toiled silently and invisibly many yards above my head, drawing my thoughts like honey draws flies.  Somewhere above me, Crow was no doubt shoving a tankard under a drunken merchant's nose....Ton Firepride still pacing across his deck.  It had been nearly two years since I had last visited Qeynos, but I knew that little changed.  The ground beneath me sloped upward briefly, then leveled out again - we had gone up a level.  The footsteps that throbbed through the stone were much louder, now; I wondered why we were moving closer to the Circle's headquarters if Thorfinn had thought she would avoid them...it seemed odd to me.  But I knew better than to try to second-guess him.  I sighed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Without warning, a loud splash cut through the air with a whiplike crack, shattering the damp hush of the acqueducts in an instant.  Ahead of me, Thorfinn virtually disappeared without transition - one moment he was striding down the tunnel with ease, and the next he was gone, an untracable glimmer down a side tunnel.  Without thought, my fingers found a sure grasp on a stone to my right, and I was gone as well - a single step on my left took me up the walls of the tunnel without any difficulty.  Perched on an empty torch sconce and a jutting piece of rock from the upper part of the tunnel, I saw a stray flicker of torchlight glint off Thorfinn's dagger as he unsheathed it, blending perfectly into the shadows of the passageway as he pressed himself against the wall - his torch ground itself out silently and instantly against the floor.  All in all, it had taken us less than a second and a half to utterly remove our presences from the tunnel to any passerby.  Coarse laughter floated out of the tunnel ahead of us, mingled with more, smaller splashes and a distinctly unpleasant sound I knew to be the snapping of bones.  With crystal clarity, the faint pattern of water marks on the floor that I had overlooked before suddenly became visible to me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a few moments, Thorfinn melted back out of the darkness to my right, beckoning silently.  I dropped back down to the tunnel floor without a whisper and followed at his back, rounding the next corner cautiously.  Ahead of us, torchlight from sconces that had not yet been removed of their burdens picked out the unlovely sight of a filthy human thug and an equally unwashed ogre, laughing at something occurring in a pool of dank water in front of them.  Peering past them, I glimpsed splashes of water and the occasional flash of teeth or gray scales - a shark, then.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn tapped my shoulder softly.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Look above the pool.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I glanced upwards - a trapdoor, then.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> So that splash we heard was someone or something falling into the pool, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I signaled back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My teacher nodded.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> More likely a someone than anything.  I'd bet that's a particularly nasty trap that guards the main entrance to the Circle's headquarters.  We'd better take another route.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I nodded in acknowledgement and followed him as he silently turned around and headed back the way we had come, noting the change in his manner from before.  When we had first entered the catacombs, he had merely been walking; now, it was obvious to me that he was visually searching for something.  We passed by a false wall, opened and passed through a second, and continued on our way.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Do you think Vilnius was mistaken?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I pondered out loud, moving up to walk abreast with my mentor.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Perhaps Malka was never in these tunnels at all.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn shrugged.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> It's certainly possible.  But these tracks I'm following certainly belong to someone.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I blinked.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Tracks?  I haven't seen a footstep newer than a week since we've entered these tunnels.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn grunted very quietly, obviously displeased.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> That's because you were looking in the wrong places.  I saw a footstep on the top of a handrail nearly an hour ago, and I've seen three more in equally interesting locales since we moved up to this level.  But surely you've at least noticed the wetness trails.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Naturally, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I responded, a little humbled.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> But I had thought they belonged to the guards we saw - I couldn't tell if they led to or away from the pool.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, you couldn't, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->he responded calmly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> but I could.  I saw tracks towards the pool leading from the tunnel I ducked into earlier - human and ogre footsteps.  So, the wetness trails must be leading away from the pool, and must belong to a third party.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  His rekindled torch, relit without my ever noticing, flickered briefly as if in agreement.  I nodded and fell back, watching my step carefully.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wetness trails were few and far between, but not too old - most likely a day and a half at most, even down here in the damp.  Whoever had left them had been moving at great speed and with a lot of care; I tried to envision a shadowy figure, dripping from a near-fatal dip in the pool but not wounded (I would have noticed any blood), dancing determinedly down the passageway, always alert for a noise from every side.  We had been following the trails for nearly half an hour before they changed, becoming closer together and more pronounced.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> They slowed down here,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I signaled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn nodded.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And made less of an attempt to conceal themselves.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Most likely due to the two traps ahead of us,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I reasoned.  The well-hidden poisoned needle box tucked into the wall directly in front of the not-so-well-hidden bear trap hadn't left room for much in the way of guesswork.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My teacher crouched, inspecting the stones into which the traps had been set.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Looks like hasty work, and not very old either.  No mold or moss anywhere, and some of the dust from the chipped stones hasn't settled yet.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I looked over his shoulder, and nodded.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Six to eight hours, at a guess.  Whatever it is, we're close.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Too close,&quot; came the unexpected reply, out loud.  I glanced up to see a slender hand protruding from an unlit passage not far ahead on the other side of a small room, holding a dagger perfectly positioned for a throw.  &quot;Don't move,&quot; warned a quiet female voice.  &quot;I can put this through either of your eyes before you can blink.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;One of us, perhaps,&quot; commented Thorfinn, &quot;but the other will most certainly kill you long before you can draw another weapon.&quot;  He remained utterly still, crouched above the poisoned needle box trap, with one hand on the floor behind him and another behind his back.  Without moving, I let a dagger fall down my sleeve and into his palm, out of view of our assailant.  He gave no outward indication, but I saw his fingers clench around the hilt without any hesitation.  &quot;I presume that you are Malka Rale?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The slender hand holding the throwing dagger twitched, and I tensed, ready to dive and draw my weapon.  But, after a moment of indecision, the arm relaxed, and a half-elf woman stepped out of the tunnel and into the ring of our torchlight.  Thorfinn, still seeming totally unconcerned, stepped easily over the two traps into the room ahead, moving close to the woman.  I followed, careful to avoid triggering either trap or leaving any obvious footprint.  Thorfinn tossed my dagger to me without an overt movement, and I caught it and slid it back up into my sleeve, not caring if the woman saw me.  Thorfinn was only five feet away now; if she proved to be an impostor or enemy, she'd be dead long before she could threaten me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She was rather plain, for a half-elf; brown hair, brown eyes, unremarkable features.  The contrast between this earthy female and Daney's outlandish, elven beauty was startling, and painful.  I bit down on the memory hard and focused my concentration on Malka.  Five feet, four inches, give or take a handspan; unremarkable build, well-made chain armor.  The dagger I had seen before was now gone without a trace, but I remembered it clearly enough to sketch; it had been of exceptional quality.  Thorfinn bowed, smiling, but said nothing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For a tense moment, no one moved or spoke; then Malka sighed and sank to the floor of the tunnel, nodding.  &quot;Yes.  Did Vilnius send you?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn smiled.  &quot;Of course.  Although Mr. The Small was somewhat less than forthcoming about whatever it is you stole.&quot;  He bowed again.  &quot;Thorfinn Wayforger, at your service.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Malka laughed in return.  &quot;Well, he would be.  I'm sorry about before - I thought you were one of Hanns' goons.  These sewers certainly do keep you on your toes.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn nodded, relaxing against a nearby wall.  &quot;Aye, they do.  I assume you're not remaining here by choice.&quot;  I took no part in the conversation, watching and listening for signs of others down each tunnel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You'd be assuming correctly, Thorfinn,&quot; she responded with a sigh.  One finger ticked idly against a stone near her seat.  &quot;I would love to get out of this place, but I'm stuck until the heat dies down.  The Circle has all the exits covered, and they're looking for me in particular.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn grunted.  &quot;I can see how that would be trying.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Malka nodded.  &quot;Did Vilnius give you any hint at all what this was all about?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Only that you had an item which until recently belonged to the Circle of Unseen Hands,&quot; remarked Thorfinn easily, &quot;and that we were to find you or your mortal remains and recover said item.  I assume you have a somewhat clearer idea than we do.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The half-elf nodded again, then produced a smallish leather bag from somewhere I could not discern.  &quot;This is what Vilnius paid me to steal.  A bag of daggers, of some symbolic importance....I don't know what.  But whatever it is, it's worth enough to Vilnius that he was willing to pay me a fortune for getting it....and worth enough to the Circle to spare no expense to try to regain it.&quot;  She looked suspiciously in my direction.  &quot;I can believe that Vilnius sent you, Wayforger.  But what about your dark elf friend?  He hasn't made any introduction of himself, yet.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn blinked slowly, then turned to look at me, as if just remembering my presence.  After a calculated moment, he turned back to Malka, smiling again.  &quot;Oh, you mean my apprentice.  Sometimes, I forget he's with me.  His name is -&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;His name is Hunter, and he can speak for himself,&quot; I snapped.  &quot;We're wasting time.  What do you need us to do to get you out?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Malka blinked, taken aback.  &quot;Nothing really.  All you need to do is get the pouch out of Qeynos.&quot;  She hefted it, then tossed it to Thorfinn, who caught it easily.  &quot;Once the pouch is gone, the Circle will learn of it, and assume I got away; then they won't be looking for me here, and I can slip out without any problems.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn shrugged, the pouch disappearing almost apologetically.  &quot;Seems easy enough.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Seems too easy,&quot; I countered.  &quot;Why should we trust you?  That pouch could be enchanted to explode.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Malka colored.  &quot;Me?  Why should I trust you?  You're a filthy dark elf!&quot;  I had to bite off my retort, settling for a growl instead.  Thorfinn shook his head, his big hands patting the air between us calmingly.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Now, now.  We're all comrades here.&quot;  He glanced in my direction.  &quot;The pouch is what she says, and she knows we were sent by Vilnius - otherwise we wouldn't have known either his real name or his nickname.  And we know she's the real Malka Rale, since a Circle impostor wouldn't know the same things.  Let's get the pouch out of the city, and let her take care of the rest.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Malka bristled a little bit, but let it go.  She turned back to Thorfinn.  &quot;You'll have to take the pouch to Vilnius yourself; if you wait for me, Hanns will catch you long before you reach the Karanas.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn nodded.  &quot;I know.  The Circle will know that the pouch is gone within three days.&quot;  He scratched at his beard idly.  &quot;Wait a week, and you should be fine.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Malka nodded.  &quot;All right.  I'm trusting you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn smiled, then turned and started back the way we had come.  I followed, glancing back just before we turned the first corner.  In the last flicker of fading torchlight, Malka Rale stood in the center of the small room, hugging herself against the persistent chill of the catacombs.  Suddenly, I realized she was no older than eighteen.  Ruddy glints of color sparkled in the depths of her eyes; whether torchlight or infravision, I couldn't tell.  She looked very alone.<br>
<br>
*  *  *<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest of the night passed quietly and uneventfully.  We were out of the catacombs long before morning, and we left Qeynos with our cloaks wrapped tightly about us.  Thorfinn was quite careful to stroll down the road out the Eastern gate in full view of Jracol Brestiage, Carson's dark elf spy, with the pouch Malka had given him artfully dangling by one drawstring from his belt - but nothing else revealed of his person.  Jracol looked startled, then disappeared, and I had to grin.  Only a few hours out of the city, and already our plan was in motion.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sunrise found us entering the valley at the edge of the Qeynos hills, not far from Blackburrow.  Memories washed over me, as I remembered Daney, Zachton, Kynes, and I all setting out from here for the first time, years ago.  How much had changed since then, for me and for them?  I could barely recall it all, now.  It seemed like another life...indeed, I reminded myself, it WAS another life.  Arafein Soulstriker was dead, as far as the world at large was concerned, and had been dead for a year.  He even had a small grave, not far from here, in Rathe Mountains; I had visited it a few months ago.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is there any sensation as strange as standing over your own grave...?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sunlight flashed off a small piece of mica, catching my eye.  Thorfinn plodded on ahead, but I stopped, looking.  A single chip of mica, set atop a nearby boulder; perfectly positioned to catch the sunlight and project it at eye level across the pathway.  And, under the bolder, an unremarkable slip of folded parchment.  A single <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> H</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was marked on it; for me.  Someone had known I'd be passing this way, and left it for us to find.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I signaled to Thorfinn.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> A message.  Someone knew I'd notice it, and not put here long ago, either.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He shrugged off his cloak, refolded it, and cocked his head at me.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I grimaced, unamused by his play of innocence.  Crouching, I started to reach for the parchment, but paused, noting the whitish-gray tinge at the edge of the page.  Reaching up, I took hold of the chip of mica and used it to drag the parchment out from under the boulder, unfolding it with great care not to let my hands or any unprotected part of my body touch the paper.  It was written in Kobold, and it read:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hunter -<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hope you were smart enough to recognize Iron Dimethy powder when you saw it.  If not, you're likely far too dead to care about anything I had written here.  That would be an awfully ignominous way to go, wouldn't it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A new group has turned up in Highpass, and they don't answer to the Circle or the Coalition.  I can't seem to find anything about them other than the fact that their leader, one &quot;Anson McBale&quot;, seems to be looking for something rather intently.  No one I've talked to knows what it is he's after, but he's certainly got his sights set on acquiring something. Whatever it is, it most likely doesn't belong to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was tailing you from South Karana to Qeynos, but I lost you after you met with that diminutive barbarian - something came up, and I had to attend to it.  But I needed to let you know something:  your &quot;friend&quot;, that con man Vilnius, has an awful lot of deals on the side.  One of my informants saw him meeting with an emissary from this new group in Highpass, so think long and hard before you have any more dealings with him.  If he thinks he's smart, he'll likely try to get someone else to do his work for him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If Thorfinn is still with you, tell him what I've told you.  If you need me, let me know.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don't screw up.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -- Kelthana</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn grunted.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Trying to remember how to read?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Very funny,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I signaled back.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> It's a message from Kelthana, about a new group in Highpass and some connection they have with Vilnius.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Suddenly, something clicked into place in my mind.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> But,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I signaled slowly, I think there's more afoot here than she knows.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh?[/i]  He cracked his neck unconcernedly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kelthana says the leader of this group is a man called &quot;Anson McBale&quot;,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I signaled, my white brows furrowing over my gold-flecked eyes.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Does that name sound odd to you?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He looked at me blankly, and I continued.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Antonius Bayle - AnSON MCBale.  The son of Bayle, or of Qeynos, depending on how you want to interpret it.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn scratched at his beard.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What does that have to do with anything?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It's a message to us, or to whoever were to get ahold of the pouch before Vilnius,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I replied.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> It's letting us know that we should take the pouch to its source.  Whoever this &quot;Anson McBale&quot; is, I'm betting it's this pouch he wants.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And if you're wrong?  If his name is just some sort of unfortunate coincidence?  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->My teacher tapped his toe impatiently.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> If that's the case,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I signaled with a sigh, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it won't make much of a difference anyway.  We can be back here within three days, to deliver the pouch to Vilnius as we promised, and long before Malka Rale comes out of hiding to let Vilnius know we succeeded.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My teacher pondered for a moment, tapping his toe.  With a shrug, I left him to his deliberations; either he'd agree with me, or he wouldn't, and no coercing on my part was going to make any difference.  With the help of a flint-and-tinder, I set Kelthana's parchment on fire, then backed away, covering my nose and mouth with my cloak as it slowly curled into a blackening ball of ash.  The smell of the burning Iron Dimethy powder was awful.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a long moment, Thorfinn nodded.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> All right - we'll try it your way, and see how it plays out.  Vilnius certainly hasn't given me any motive to trust him.  But you realize, this will mean Malka Rale won't get paid either.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If I'm right, that means that Vilnius never had any intention of paying her anyway,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I replied without any hesitation.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She'd deliver the pouch, and he'd disappear.  At least this way, she'll have a decent chance of getting away from Hanns' men.  Vilnius, on the other hand, she'll have to deal with on her own.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thorfinn shrugged.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Whatever you say.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Without another gesture, he turned on his heel and started off into the East, striding into the gathering dawn like a man walking into a strong wind.  I followed silently, clenching my fist around a handful of my cloak with frustration.  I hated uncertainty.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Behind me, I heard the crackle of dying flames as the parchment finally burned out.  A swirl of ash dusted the wind, and I closed my eyes.  It would be winter soon.  <p><b> -- Baron Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br> -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic<br> -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend<br> -- Requiem of Souls<br> -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br></b><i>"Once, in the old west, a gentleman shot a professional gunfighter in the back.
