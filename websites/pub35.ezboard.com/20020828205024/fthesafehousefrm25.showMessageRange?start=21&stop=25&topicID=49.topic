Yes just John. He was a 'Mech Pilot who was a Wiz with engineering and Tinkering. He runs around with a hand on a stick and a backpack. Inside this backpack is a tactical Nuke and the hand is actually a lockpick for the palm reading security doors. The group didn't figure all this out for quite a while and was quite dismayed and agitated that this nuke was in the the same room with them let alone on the same planet. And the hand came in handy a few times when the spook types couldn't get into a few rooms on a run into Kurita space. He had to go with them because it took his computer and engineering skills to figure out what was in the room and how it worked. He offered to destroy the place but the spooks said no just make it unusable. Yes he had his backpack with him.  He made the nuke himself and actually made his rolls to the point where the blast radius was exactly one block off of center. Quirky was an understatement and the only reason the group kept him around after they successfully got the backpack away from him was that his technical skills far outweighed his mental instability. There wasn't much he couldn't hack into or understand once he looked at it. It was fun watching the other people in the group have to change their tactics because he was around. They tended to examine his luggage constantly. I am going to have to get back to that game soon. <br>
<br>
Needless to say when ever I run a game now one of my friends always brings in a quirky character of there own to brighten up my day.<br>

<br>
depraved drow underdark druid comes upon his lifeless corpse and reincarnates him as a gold elf, following him stealthily watching the destruction fangol causes in his unholy rage at what has befallen him. fangol finally finds out about this druid and exacts his vengeance upon her, in horrible unspeakable non pg-13 ways<br>
<br>
fangol was a smart hobgoblin tho (intelligence 16) after awhile he figures out that as an elf he can cause more chaos for the elven nation then he ever could as a hobgoblin so he heads to cormanthor and starts learning, i mean REALLY learning what it means to be an elf. after awhile he classes into spymaster prestige class and proceeds to begin laying out plots that will ensure the deaths of many elves, turned into a very political character. was very very cool. at the end of it all he was rogue 5/assassin5/spymaster4/wizard1/ranger1 (wizard and ranger levels were added to assist him with his cover identities)<br>
<br>
other cool char i played was my dwarven rogue Trapsong Mithrildeath, Took every trapmaking, lock picking feat in the book, also had int 16, he created over 10 totally unique traps as well as being the only person alive to decipher the chaos sphere (took a deck of many things to accomplish it tho heh) anyways if i play with you guys in NWN id play the dwarf as from what ive heard hobgoblins arent playable <p><p align="center"><b><span style="background-color: #FF0000"><font size="5" face="Impact">Evisceratus
