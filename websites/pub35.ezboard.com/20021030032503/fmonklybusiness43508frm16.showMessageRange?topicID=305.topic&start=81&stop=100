I have full Akkirus, and fairly decent gear, no haste item, using SoS(VoG is overwritten by Yaulp V) and Yaulp 5 for haste.

When I logged on I ran and got his spells and took him to guk to grab an FBSS real fast to play around with.  <br>
<br>
Cleric fighting Frenzied Ghoul:<br>
<br>
Had to CH 3x, he is not uber equipped but has planer plus a few better pieces.  People aren't recognizing that for this to be effecient for a cleric to solo they must tank light blue to very low blue mobs, with this patch that means next to no exp.  You talk about these clerics that are tanking hard mobs and mobs with high ac, I would wager to say that very few clerics have enough ac to last 3 minutes with a blue mob and only need a CH after the fight.  I know the vast majority of the clerics I know can't.<br>
<br>
As for the DPS??? Well if its a 3 minute fight that means pet is attacking for the full 3 minutes, and MoR is doing dmg for the full 3 minutes.  In a normal exp group how long do the mobs last? 45 seconds or so max? Well now the pet is only doing one fourth of the dmg it was for the same mana as well as the MoR.  Now have a cleric try meleeing, casting pet, casting MoR, MoK, and keeping up with heals at that pace.  He/she will be oom just as fast as root dot/nuking.  <br>
<br>
Do I think this is unbalancing? No just a new lil toy for clerics, lets them farm and solo a little bit, I do think it will be nerfed simply to appease the complainers.<br>
<br>
Paladins: <br>
First off Paladins do more dmg than most of the posts are saying, I do think they need an improvement in the dmg catagory, but they didn't do the dmg before and instead of wanting their class improved they want another nerfed so they don't feel as bad...  doesn't make sense <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't see the melee threat here from clerics, sorry.  It's nice that they *can* melee and don't have to sit LFG, but let's be real here - even the madly proccing 150dd isn't going to put them anywhere close to a true melee class.<br>
<br>
I saw someone comment on the 165dd proc as impossible.  This is entirely possibly using an ID focus item.  It actually sounds like they were using a mage bracer in this case which will give random boosts up to 20% (so expect a 180dd max).  These focus items *do* affect procs - I've personally seen it a number of times when screwing around with my Sarak Summoner's Dagger.<br>
<br>
Now if you want to talk about an epic mage's dps now that the haste cap has been removed...<br>

Most of them have crappy skills in offense/defense/1hb... and Starting at a skill of 25 in Bash for a level 60 kinda sucks.  <br>
<br>
In my experience, Clerics havent really asked for much anyways.  I have always been amazed at the calmness the cleric community presented.  They sit and watch as class after class got upgrades or reworked in someway and hardly any at all complained as we were repeatedly overlooked.  Sure there was one here or there that whined about this or that, but know where near the whining I see out of most other classes.<br>
<br>
The first grumblings I can really say I felt was when the announcement about druids and shammies getting bigger heals.  This would have been VERY detrimental to a class that is sooooo dependant on a group for general exp - or hell... even to farm lame tradeskills stuff.<br>
<br>
Now clerics have some fun spells.  They can play now and then.  Now clerics dont need to worry as much about a druid or shaman taking their spot in general exp - they are once again viable.  Yeah I know the druid/shaman spells arent live - but they will be.<br>
<br>
If you get in a group where the cleric would rather melee to the detriment of the group, i.e. people dying suddenly, then you should get a new cleric.  A good cleric will know how to back off and when to med.  A cleric's role will ALWAYS be primary healer and they should never forget that.<br>
<br>
Now, we can solo easy mobs for fun,  exp, and whatnot.  We can farm our own t radeskills crap without needing a melee for efficiency.  Instead of being pissy that clerics got some fun to a class that - lets admit it - was rather boring, be happy that more clerics will want to play their cleric instead of their monk or rogue alt. <p><table border="1" width="70%">

Now as for you...Let's take a closer look at this poster who obviously knows EXACTLY how to play a druid, eh?<br>
1.  All those port spells?  Aside from the fact that you are calling me a &quot;gate-bot&quot;, you piece of crap, you do realize that ports are supposedly going to be readily available to ALL classes in the soon-to-be-out PoP?  Great, half my spell book is about to be useless but for a slight convenience.<br>
2.  Druids do get decent nukes and dots, I agree.  We better, since we can't heal for shit and this patch didn't change a thing.  Just fyi, clerics get some pretty rocking nukes now...where's my new healing, again?<br>
2.  All my skin buffs so far have been overwritten by cleric hp/ac buffs, EVEN when my skins are better.  This is mana- and time-wasting as well as highly annoying...can't count how many times my skin buff has been overwritten by a cleric buff.  From the sound of the patch message, even cabbage and potg are going to be overwritten by freeking hero now.  Joy!<br>
3.  All melees want str?  Like hell, half the time they have primal now and couldn't care less about my str buff.  Not that it's overly helpful anyway...I certainly wouldn't base my decision to play a druid on that.  &quot;Oh wow, look at that str buff we get!&quot;  So no, this isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread that you make it out to be.<br>
4.  Almost-CH??  Well for one, it sounds like it's the same casting time, but more cost, than CH, and will not heal nearly as much.  Will it get even used by shamans?  Probably not from what I hear.  For druids, we probably will use it since it's our only heal that might restore more than 1 bubble on a tank.  The super long cast time and expense means that we sure won't be able to do many of these at all before oom...which means that there is STILL NO WAY a druid can out-heal a cleric, and you are on crack if you think so.  In many places a cleric will still be overwhelmingly necessary.<br>
5.  Soloing...that's quite an attractive option, you say?  Well let's take the mind-numbing boringness and add the recent solo xp nerf, and it really doesn't look so good, does it...I sure don't solo if I can help it.  Why clerics keep crying, &quot;I want to solo&quot; is frankly beyond me.<br>
<br>
I was really looking forward to this patch.  I was expecting some new heal that was more than laughable.  Instead, clerics got some unnecessary upgrades.  If druids had a hard time finding groups before...well no way in hell we're needed now with this super-cleric syndrome going on.  <br>
Any clerics who call this &quot;whining&quot; can just go to hell, you have had the premier spot in every group, in every raid, in every guild's recruitment search.  I'm all for helping a class when it's needed, but unwarranted is a vast understatement in regards to these changes.<br>

Umm...how the F were you useless in a single group before????  Clerics are useful EVERYWHERE and for EVERYTHING, as it goes today, and they just got a lot better.

The only thing I didn't change were the options on the top right. I had the class set to monk, haste in at 81%, skill at 252 and strength at 150, with the correct damage bonus.<br>
<br>
Like I said, the calculator either sucks, or those options on the top right are extremely critical and waaay off at default. I have yet to see a calculator that is good for more than comparing two weapon set ups to find out which will do better at level 'x'. Parsed logs are where its at.<br>

If a lvl 60 high end cleric with primal and good haste item is doing 50 DPS I dont have a problem with it.  If thats 60 cleric with just hammer spell and no haste item maybe a bit high.  I'm not one to cry nerf though, good for clerics.<br>

please find where i flamed you. i asked how you achieved 86% haste, i assumed you ment 76% and just did a typo.<br>

then i asked a question to a PALADIN, yes PALADIN, since you never stated you do 30 dps, then how could the post have been directed to you? just because the first half says something to you dont assume the whole post does.<br>
<br>
next issue.<br>
<br>
where did you come by this?<br>

<br>
when clearly in my 2nd post in this thread i said and i quote<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> im really really really doubting a cleric even with a proc could outdamage a rogue with those weapons.<br>
<br>
their weapon is 14/18 if im not mistaken, and with 25% spell haste(and assuming for some god forsaken reason they have a 41% haste item) they will have 66% total haste. which rounds their weapon to something like 12 delay which is 1 swing per 1.2 seconds every other swing proc would be 2.4 seconds so 150 damage per 2.4 seconds is 62.5 dps from procs, add in 15dps from their melee and they have 77dps(sustained) add in 20 for their nukes while keeping up mana with c3 97dps total. round that to 100 dps. i am really doubting a cleric can do 100dps sustained, and that rogue really sucks to not be doing more than 100dps with his weapon setup. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
hrmm, let me think, how is that saying clerics will never do more than that?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
also i have directed what? 1 or 2 posts at you, the rest were all on the subject. <br>
dont try to single me out for bringing facts to the table instead of peoples initial observations. i will bet you any amount of plat that a cleric will not sustain a 50% proc rate, like your first post said nor the dps you origionally claimed(your quite included)<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> With the Pet hitting for 65 65 a round usually, and the hammer procing 150dmg every other swing, the group I am in with 2 clerics, both with hammer and both with pet, Our dps is as if we had 2 level 60 Rogues.

anyways, without duel wield double atk or decent offensive skill pure melee they do 15 or less dps(NOT including procs or anything like that) vs undead they may do slightly more. <p>Frenzy Style<br>

<br>
Someone said they wanted logs of a paladin. I posted a log. I averaged 40 DPS over a period of about 2 months. I am ALWAYS grouped. I always have at a minimum celerity, and usually bard epic proc + warsong of the vah shir. I have a 21% haste item. That log file was partly me using a 39/45 2 hander (Kel Xundrau Xi Xauninae) and partly using a Ancient Flame Etched Flamberge, with an occasional 1 handed swing while switching in my shield to right click AoB.<br>
<br>
If a cleric can even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> approach</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> my melee DPS with STORE bought spells, with no detriment of losing mana by not medding (yaulp 5 regens 10/tick), and still have quality nukes to add in, something is wrong. Keep in mind my weapon is a NTOV drop, I usually have bard haste + spell haste, bard epic +atk, AoB, +atk from Bih'li, etc. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>
