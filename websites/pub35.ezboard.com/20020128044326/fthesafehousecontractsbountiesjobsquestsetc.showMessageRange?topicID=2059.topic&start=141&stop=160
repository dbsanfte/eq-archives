When evade was originally introduced, the rogue was dropped to the bottom of the hate list, and was working as intended.  Now the hate list has expanded, and the rogue drops to the bottom still.  This is viewed as unbalancing?  The obvious solition would be to move the rogue to the spot where he/she woulda been at pre-expanded hate list. and i highly doubt that is between #2 and #3.  <br>
<br>
People that play rogues(pre-evade, and after) know their class, know what is going to happen in situations.  Telling these rogues that you are going to change the evade skill as you have stated, they know what effect it will have on them.  The effect may not be overnight.  The efect may not be as drastic as many have stated, but by using extream examples, people are trying to make a point.<br>
<br>
-The 3 rogue death spiral example is very real in 'raid/uber mob' situations.<br>
-Rogues being moved to 'nukers attack at 50% health' status is maybe a stretch, but i can see it being about 75% in reality.<br>
-Limiting rogues to 1 or 2 per raid, that reminds me alot of the whole 'manastone' situation from last year; when limiting players invited to raids was based solely on 1 reason (then it was if you had a 'manastone', now its 'inefficent' to have to 'res' the rogues after each fight).<br>
<br>
one thing i think should be considered, have the 'Hide/Evade' timer affected by 'haste/level', so that evade would be at the same rate as backstab, allowing rogues the ability to evade when it is most important for them to (right after a backstab attempt).<br>
<br>
Sneak and Hide:  Having 'Sneak and Hide' be active 'thru zoning,' 'linkdead,' and 'logout/in' is one of the most requested things i see after the whole Evade thing.  I would like to add my voice to the crowd.  I think this would be a wonderful addition to the game.  It would allow rogues a higher survival rate when scouting and going linkdead, when traveling(in PvP situations mainly).  I feel it would be good for the game while not causing any negitive effects to any class.<br>
<br>
Backstab and Instill Doubt:  The linking of these keys has always been a strange situation.  Having them be 'greyed out' when the other is pressed would be ok if a couple stipulations were allowed.  <br>
<br>
-Backstab button should be allowed to work if the 'Instill' fails, without having to wait for the 'Instill timer.'  As it works now, after you fail an 'Instill,' you can 'backstab' as soon as you see the 'your not scaring anybody' message.<br>
-The 'Instill timer' should be affected by 'haste/level' in the same way as the 'backstab timer' is. this would allow the 'grey out' time to be constant.<br>
-Intill skill should not have to go thru 'skill check,' 'kick hit/miss check,' and finally a 'fear check' for a successful try.  1 check should be all that is needed.<br>

<br>
I would say that I am a pretty good rogue. <br>

<br>
Nor would I.  Seems, though, to support my earlier, overly-catty remark.  Once cannot expect to waltz into every fight expecting it to go exactly as the last one.  You have to understand - on some level - how your involvement in the fight impacts its direction.  If you know going in that your gear is better than your tank's, it seems logical that you're going to have to adjust how you participate in the encounter or get ready for that rez...  <br>
<br>
I will, however, concede that there are a LOT of factors in this issue that I, being far below the Level 50+ crowd, was not aware of.  Thanks to the discussion between my posts, I have a better feel for why the high-level crowd is so upset about these changes.  Whatever the outcome, this is going to be interesting.<br>

<br>
My #1 issue is sneak/hide.  I hate being seen by someone using see invis.  We use shadows.  If you want us seen (esp. for pvp), give casters a spell like See Shadows.  Give them options but not just a generic see all spell like See Invis.  I am tired of getting /e bonk.  Furthermore, we should not be seen as much as we are nor should other classes like a ranger be able to CR better than us in any situation.<br>
<br>
My #2 issue is disarm traps (and even sense traps).  Bards can remove just about every trap we can yet there cap is 100.  That should not be.  Raise the skill level on more traps as it is our specialty.<br>
<br>
Hope you read this and respond.  Again, more than anything, fix our hide/sneak.  No more bonks from casters and such and make us the premier CR class.<br>

<br>
That would make sure there's always a chance to evade onto the main tank, even if more that one rogue/monk in group.<br>
<br>
In a small group, you'd be able to evade onto your tank and still have enough aggro to quickly taunt off your nuker or healer if necessary.<br>

  I agree with you, I feel that the main outcome of &quot;being responsible for your damage&quot; is an overall reduction in damage a rogue <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do. I say should because it is in the best interests of not only you, but your group to do less damage than before. If I am aggroing the mob too much, then I become a mana sponge, which is bad news. (This is single group scenario) If I don't have a warrior in the group, but instead a SK or pally is acting as the main tank, then I am going to incur even more mob wrath. We may have to adjust not only our tactics, but also our gear. Got a great tank? Pull out the good weaps and offensive gear. Tank not up to par? Pull out the whimpy weaps and defense gear. Finding yourself on the top of the list round after round? /attack off, back up, sit out a few rounds. It is going to take some actual thought to play if this change makes it  through. But the effect of this change may well be first and formost a reduction in dmg output (not dmg potential!). <br>
<br>

<br>
The big picture is -- the damage that rogues do.<br>
I was wondering when this was coming into play, and after reading post after post, and Kendrick's reply -- it came to me.<br>
<br>
Make evade less effective, and you make rogues less able to do damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;We looked at Rogues, saw an oversight in the way Evade worked, and we proposed a change that will not in any way ruin the class, nor make them less powerful, but will make them responsible for more of their damage output.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm reading it wrong but, if evade is less likely to remove you off the hate list for a certain period of time, you're less able to do the damage you could pre-nerf.<br>
<br>
The short of it is, it's a reduction in the ability of a rogue to deal out damage. Plain and simple.<br>

<br>
It's pretty obvious that evade doesn't throw you to the bottom of the aggro list like they say it does, if it did I why would the mob's main concern be to pound on me anyways?<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I think the reason for this is twofold; MOBs only check the hate list every few seconds, and sometimes they decide to stick with there current target instead of going off to attack the guy on the top of the list (particulary if thier current target is low AC and health).<br>
<br>
As to the proposed changes, as they are currently defined they will lead to a rogue not being able to safely do more than maybe 5 to 10% more damage than the main tank, in any size group.<br>
<br>
This is an insignificant difference - in every case a group or raid would be better off with another warrior, monk, paladin, shadowknight, ranger, mage or necro.  All of whom will do an indistinguishable amount of damage, but can not only tank a hell of a lot better (assuming the caps from test, and maybe excluding ranger), but also all have some useful utility, pulling or secondary healing powers as well.<br>
<br>
This means that, for the only group slot a rogue can compete for, we will become the 8th best class. <br>
<br>
If a rogue isn't needed for utility reasons (i.e. pickpocket, _maybe_ disarm traps), then they will be soloing.<br>
<br>
I notice that the one positive change lited for rogues is to bind wounds, which will actually enable well-equipped rogues to solo (though we we still be the worst soloing class, equal worst healer, 3rd or 4th worst main tank).<br>
<br>
I think if these changes see the live servers, we will be doing that a lot.<br>

I cant tell you how many times im in a group with 3 rogues, 1 shaman, 1 cleric.<br>

3 Rogues sharing damage is nothing new, Deal with it. Life it tuff.<br>
<br>
As for raids, if you rogues are on boss mob raids and dont have your HP's buffed to close to 10% of the Taunting tanks, then Find new Clerics/Shaman/Enchanters.<br>

Thats exactly what I am hearing too.  Seems to me that through alot of class envy and whining it was established that rogues are too powerfull (my SKs damage doesnt compare to rogues waaa,  monks should be stronger than rogues waaa, etc etc). <br>
<br>
The outrage that would ensue if VI said &quot;sorry rogues you are too powerful we have to nerf your damage&quot; would be incredible, in fact it would be an outright stupid move by verant. That would be like saying Clerics have too much healing power, sorry complete heal can now only do 75%. <br>
<br>
How then does verant address the fact that rogues do &quot;too much&quot; damage in their minds?  They need to come up with a way to reduce the damage a rogue can do without directly nerfing the damage capapable by the rogue, thereby causeing outrage.  Its very easy then to say &quot;evade is not working properly&quot; and that it needs to be retuned.  Then by laying down a very unacceptable method and &quot;giving in&quot; to a better idea the rogue total evade effectivness gets blown down to worse than the original pre-kunark effectiveness. (remember, before kunark evade put you at 6th on the agro list). Why does their fix involve fancy new methods of lowering agro when they could just set our evading ability back to lowering us to 6 (same as pre-kunark)?<br>
<br>
When and if they implement the &quot;new&quot; evade system, they will have effectively lowered the rogues damage output without directly nerfing out damage, thereby pulling the wool over our eyes. I would be personally VERY happy if we could just have what we had pre-kunark --- lower us to 6 on the agro list.<br>
<br>
I would also like to thank Kendrik for following our situation and doing what he can for us, we are in capable hands with him.<br>
<br>

EDIT: I know this is very conspiracy theory style, but I am really getting scared. just hold tight ardbus...wait and see.... be brave<br>

<br>
One) Rogues will be less effective evading.<br>
<br>
Two) As such, rogues will have to do less damage, and be careful about how they do damage in a group.<br>
<br>
Ardbus hit it right on the nose. Here is a moderate proprosed change to Evade, and look how many posts there are on the subject.<br>
<br>
Would any rogue sit back and take it quietly if Verant decided we were doing too much damage and decided to:<br>
Lower the amount of damage we do by %10<br>
Lower our weapon skill caps<br>
Lower the damage we do via backstab<br>
<br>
Any of those would be a PR nightmare. I know it sounds rather conspiracy'ish, but ... evade and the damage we can do in a group are statically linked.<br>

The managing your aggro argument is utter bunk--look at rangers now too see how well a class that has too &quot;master its aggro&quot; is wanted on raids or in xp groups.<br>
<br>
It's a good thing i can still enjoy xping my latest char (a rogue obviously) because for high level events the rogue is going too be 100% useless.  <br>
<br>
Please don't try too say that EVADE changes will be &quot;well&quot; tested before any changes goes live.  One has but too engage in any high level zone/encounter when they first go live too realise that testing either didn't take place or was carried out by people entirely reliant on /kill babysitting.<br>
<br>
Its ironic that instead of fixing hybrids and monks so that they will be able too participate effectively in events, the nerfs too warriors (taunt doesn't work, so defensive changes have nerfed warriors ability too keep mobs on them) and rogues will change event makeup from war/cle/rog+support too war/cle+support.<br>

Verant has been flat out dishonest about the way they've done nerfs in the past, so this would be nothing new.  Remember the Mark of Karn.  They opened with a ridiculous suggestion, and then toned it down to 'compromise'.  They feel that rogues do too much damage, and in that regard they're full of crap.  Seeing as how all we do is damage, they why in the heck would you choose a rogue over any other given class if they ceased to do an overwhelming amount of damage.  Evade's 'retuning' if you will need only address their concern that we can evade onto passers by.  If 120 is the evade to number and 128 is the walk into melee range number, then put us at 129 when we evade.  That's all they need to do, but instead, they lie to us to sneak in a nerf to our damage.  <br>
<br>
Well Verant can stick it.  Every percent that they nerf our damage in a normal fight due to the evade changes they decided to put in is one more percent chance added to the already high chance that I quit.  And if I go, I'm taking as many people as I can with me.  Sour grapes?  Yep.  I enjoy Everquest, and always have.  I haven't even gotten to see the post 50 game yet, nor have I gotten a ragebringer.  Now, all of the great things that I've stuck with the rogue class since 1999 to see are getting flushed down the crapper, and if they go this route, then they deserve the loss of business that their decision will earn them.  I know I sound bitter, but honestly, I've stuck with a class that is at the bottom end in soloability, the bottom end in versatility, and the bottom end in survivability (ever had the casters gate, the monks and sk's feign, and the heavily armored paladins and warriors run leaving you alone?), so that I could do one thing, and do it well - damage.  Take that away, and I'm a wizard with no ports, no snare and no buffs.  I'll be sitting right beside the wizard on the sideline, getting ready to head into battle for my 2 or 3 combat rounds of 'nuking' before backing out to avoid agro.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, either Verant sticks this evade change in a box, locks it, throws away the key, and makes the skill to pick it 256 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , or they can stick it. <p><p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=37752">Darkrok Shadowwalker</a> - Redeemed Dwarven Rogue of 40 Missions, <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Action=Journal&Jid=4546&Id=37752">Merchant Extraordinaire</a><br>

Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity. <br>
>><br>
<br>
I have played this game for quite awhile (pre-beta) and have played a rogue for 55 levels, and have NEVER seen this happen.  I am just amazed at how Verant always gives an obsure reference to making what could be a class/game changing change.<br>
<br>
The real issue is that certian SoV mobs are overpowered which removes the need for certian classes -> why bring a wizzie to fight a mob that is 100% magic resistant?  Those classes see Warriors, Clerics and Rogues as overpowered, becuase they are the only classes that are really needed to fight these over-powered mobs.  To try to "balance" the game and appease these classes changes are made, NOT to the problem areas of the game, but to the classes that are already "balanced" for these encounters.<br>
<br>
Verant thinking...<br>
"Hmm - there's a pothole in the road that is messing up my cars suspension everytime I drive over it."<br>
<br>
"I know how we can fix it, we can change your car's suspension to support driving in potholes."<br>
<br>
"Won't that change how my car drives on regular pavement?"<br>
<br>
"Do you want to be able to drive over the pothole or not?"<br>
<br>
"Why not just fill in the pothole?"<br>
<br>
"Look - we've already made changes to your cars suspension, filling in the pothole, would only cause more porblems..." <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udratn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dratn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 2:56:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> When moving from #1.. there needs to be a MIN evade % so that rogues dont get stacked up on each other.. if the rogue is losing 50% of his hate by being #2..

<br>
&quot;Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone.

Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gee... Playing a rogue as long as I have, I had no idea I could do these things with evade... I shouldn't even be here... I should take use every moment before our nerf to threaten people with &quot;Evade Trains&quot; from across the zone and demand loot.  <br>

<br>
This will kill rogues who participate in high level raids. If they do this, a lot of us *will* leave the game.  I thought 33% was pretty lame coming from where it was, and thought moving us 50% down would be about right.   For those of you who are posting crap like &quot;oh, but i've been in  a group with 3 rogues and blah blah blah&quot;, stfu. Seriously, you don't know what you're talking about.  We're talking about 2 completely different aspects of the game: You're talking about xp grouping, and Wendolyn, myself, and others are talking about large scale raids.<br>
<br>
In xp grouping, fine, whatever, obviously if you have 3 rogues, 1 of you will be taking all the damage, all the time.  nothing new, that's why a lot of us rogues value ac/hp over strength.  If I go to sebilis, most tanks can't out taunt me, plain and simple.  I get used to it, but I tank pretty well, so i'm not too worried about that.<br>
<br>
In large scale raids, not only can rogues NOT tank, but it only takes 1-2 rounds max to kill us.  Which means, if we get agro, we die.  This is why the evade nerf would hit us so bad.  There would be no way for us to avoid getting hit (and thereby getting killed) within 3-4 seconds of engaging the mob.  Not only that, but if evade DID go off, we'd only be evading the mob onto another rogue, and that's not acceptable.  Period.  That's like robbing peter to pay paul.  Hi, I evaded the mob onto my friend who also can't tank... that was really useful.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a> <b>8</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=161&stop=167>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2067.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2061.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2059.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2059.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2059.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2059.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
