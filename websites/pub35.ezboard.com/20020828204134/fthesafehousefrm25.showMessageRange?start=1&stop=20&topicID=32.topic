<br>
Background-<br>
<br>
In the campaign world I'm playing in there was once a master swordsmith who created 7 Great Works. 300 years ago he went insane, stole all of his swords back, and hid them around the countryside.<br>
<br>
Currently-<br>
<br>
My character has found the location of one of the swords.<br>
<br>
Problem-<br>
<br>
The sword is held in the hand of a statue of Ishtar, and the statue is located in a government building in a neighboring country.<br>
<br>
It gets worse. This neigboring country is a theocracy of Ishtar, which makes the government building in question a temple. And the citizens of said country are zealots.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and there is some possibility that the statue is a golem, since the creator of the swords was a powerful mage.<br>
<br>
Resources-<br>
<br>
Myself, 20th lvl Assassin. A 21st lvl NPC rogue. A decent amount of wealth. One teleportation device (2/day 2 people max) on a world where teleportation is extremely uncommon. I haven't seen the room the statue is in as of yet, so I can't just port into it, and I probably can't port on and off of temple grounds either.<br>
<br>
What I want to accomplish-<br>
<br>
I want to get the sword out of the Temple/Government building without angering the goddess in question, angering her fanatic worshippers, or letting them get any inkling of the value of what I'm taking.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've played with the gamemaster in question for years, and he tends to know my strategies and the way I think. I'm looking for some ideas that will allow me to take him off-guard. =)<br>
<br>
And help would be appreciated.<br>
<br>

<br>
Spend time examining the statue.  As an assassin, you have access to spells, use them to determine the risk/reward.  Is it a Golem?  Detect magic would reveal this.  Are there glyphs and other such protective measures?  Find out.<br>
<br>
You have a decent amount of wealth.  During the off time from your duties as an initiate, find out who the enemies of the temple are.  There will be some.  Using Bluff and Diplomacy and Gather information, convince a group of fanatics of the opposite side that the temple of Ishtar is weak and ripe for the looting.  Make certain to be in disguise during every meeting with these malcontents.<br>
<br>
Out of the country, acquire scrolls of disentegrate, Nystuls Undetectable Aura and Non Detection.  Also beads of force or necklace of fireballs.<br>
<br>
Make certain the malcontents attack at the best time by feeding them information.  Know when they plan on acting.  Manipulate them into making the attack big and noisy.<br>
<br>
Just as their attack begins (or shortly before if you can time it right), use disentegrate on the statue, grab the sword, toss the entire necklace of fireballs/beads of force into the room and activate the teleport to someplace far away.  Use the Scrolls of Undetectable Aura and Non Detection on the sword.<br>
<br>
If possible, leave an unidentifiable corpse dressed in your initiate disguise somewhere on the premises.<br>
<br>
If all goes as planned, it will appear to be a random attack by fanatics who somehow managed to get a couple powerful, but disposable items.  The statue (and thus sword) would appear to be destroyed to must observers.  Even if an investigation is immediately begun, the Non-detection and Undetectable Aura spells should protect you to a large degree.  Since you were always diguised and used false names at all times, you will be hard to track.<br>
<br>
At least, this is what *I* would do.  Feel free to come up with your own variations.  :) <p><SELECT NAME="D1">

While the infiltration plan will take  care of your mundane problems, avoiding the attention of the goddess could be tough, especially if you have become an initiate. in some campaigns this gives the goddess some power over you, and stealing and defacing the statue could smack of treachery. Deities hate that.<br>
<br>
I suggest you avoid defacing the statue. Why not get a sword made up that looks exactly the same and do a swap?

<br>
Good plan. Some of the aspects of it wouldn't work because of the way things work in the campaign world. I will use the initiate disguise idea though, or a variation of it to gain access and to examine the area in question.<br>
<br>
Ravenwinged-<br>
<br>
Umm, this would get me dead really fast. I'd have Ishtar fanatics chasing me for the rest of my days.<br>
<br>
Kintire-<br>
<br>
You're right about the problem being avoiding the eye of the goddess. While not directly active in the campaign, Gods can influence their worshippers, and I don't want to be the target of a church of fanatics. Like I said, they control a whole country on the campaign world (Monotheistic Theocracy).<br>
<br>
If I was to actually join the temple as an initiate, then Ishtar would hold power over me. But I can't actually join the temple as an initiate, as I'm a priest of Haserix, Lord of Flame (See the whole 'my current character' listing). But disguising myself as an initiate, and forging a document to allow me access will probably go over fine.<br>
<br>
I suppose I should go over a couple of things as well so that my resources are better known.<br>
<br>
In the campaign I'm playing in, Assassins do not have spellcasting ability. It's a modified 2nd edition, not a 3rd edition. But I am a priest, so I do have access to priestly magic. Sometimes priestly magic doesn't work on another churchs holy ground though, so I can't count on it.<br>
<br>
Plan A-<br>
<br>
1st- Use a disguise and forgery to gain access to the temple. Examine the statue when no one else is around (Night probably). Find out if it's a golem or not.<br>
<br>
2nd- Get a replica made for the sword if it appears it can be moved. If it doesn't appear it can be moved I move on to plan B.<br>
<br>
3rd- Get back into temple using step one if still available. Swap swords at night. Leave again in the morning and never come back.<br>
<br>
Plan B-<br>
<br>
1st- If the sword cannot be removed it gets harder. Get a new statue commissioned that is the same size as the first one, but much nicer (quality and workmanship).<br>
<br>
2nd- Arrive with the statue and documentation that the existing statue is to be replaced with the new one.<br>
<br>
3rd- Leave with statue. Have someone take special care to remove the sword while doing the least amount of damage to the statue.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me know if you see any weakness here. If it turns out it's a golem, I'm not quite sure what I'll do. Maybe it will talk. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utelurinon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telurinon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/02 1:51:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> My assassin type characters generally are much smarter than wise.

I really like Kintires variation, too.  Much more subtle and more the sort of thing I would do with a thief character.  /shrug<br>
<br>
If it IS a golem, consider getting a Rod of Cancellation and use it to disable the magics animating the golem for a couple rounds.  If you move swiftly, you may be able to per form the swap prior to it become aware again, and depending on its commands it may never react to the theft. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaowyth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caowyth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/02 2:36:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tkcity.com/bbs2/kaogif/atata.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Tel-<br>

Great idea!<br>

<br>
1) Search the world for a truly great artist. <br>
2) Have him or her make an even MORE beautiful statue of Ishtar.<br>
3) Hire agents to start a whispering campaign about the current statue of Ishtar saying that while it is nice, the goddess really deserves something better.<br>
4) When the whispering campaign has had enough time to circulate, and there is rumor of discontent throughout the land, its time to switch statues<br>
<br>
How to switch statues : <br>
Method #1 : Convince the heirarchy of the temple to switch the statues for you.<br>
1) Determine if the statue is indeed a golem.  If so, can you dispell it without having it activate and change poses?  If so, do so. If not, the convince the priesthood scam will probably not work.  Remember that a simple detect magic coming up positive is no guarantee it is a golem.  It could just be blessed, protected from pigeons, or some other such effect.<br>
2) Research the cult of Ishtar.  Do their temples allow only one central statue of Ishtar?  If so, great, go to step 3a.  If not, is the statue you want likely to get moved to another location in the same temple?  If so, go to step 3b.<br>
3a) Approach The temple guardians, offer up the even more valuable/beautiful statue as a replacement for the statue you want, the one the people are unhappy with.  The temple guardians will switch the statues for you, de-consecrating the statue to be removed, and removing it from holy ground for you.  This will let you avoid the anger of the goddess because you are offering her an even nicer statue (goddesses are vain) and the statue removed will not actually be consecrated to her once it is outside the temple.  Once the statue is outside, it will most likely not be under as tight of security, and the temple people will not care as much if it is stolen as it is no longer their divinity embodied.  Down side on this is that if it IS a golem, the temple guys may have some trouble removing it, and may decide that the statue coming to life is a pretty direct omen that the goddess isnt happy with the switch idea.  Also, if the con doesnt work, they are forwarned that someone has an interest in the statue, and may start investigating as to why.<br>
3b) If the temple is likely to keep the statue on its grounds, the following con may work.  In the whispering campaign, spread the rumor that the statue in the temple is not the most beautiful of the goddess.  Someone has made a better one.  When you approach the temple guardians (through agents from whom you are insulated, always!) Put forth the following story : The agents represent a highly devoted and wealthy follower of the goddess who has commissioned and recently had delivered a truly beautiful statue of her.  The spreading discontent with the statue at the temple he has taken as a sign from the goddess that it is wrong to withhold the vision of his statue from his co-religionists.  As a result, he is offering up this statue to replace the one currently in the temple, and will accept the lesser statue for his private chapel.  Advantage : the goddess is again appeased by having a better statue, the temple is not desecrated, as the priesthood will remove the old statue with all due ceremony, AND  the statue you want will be delivered to your agents (and thereby to you).  Disadvantage is again that if it is a golem, the priests may have trouble, and if the con fails, they get suspicious.<br>
<br>
Method #2: Switch the statues yourself.<br>
1) As per method #1, determine if indeed the statue is a golem.  Also, since you will be doing the switch yourself, determine if there are any other magical protections in the temple, as Telurinon said.  If the staue could be or is a golem, go on to step 2 equipped to deal quickly and quietly with a golem armed with a magic sword, in addition to being equipped to deal with other magical and mundane protections.  This scouting run will allow you to get a look at where you're going so as you can use that teleport device.  Also, you could find the stupidest acolyte of the temple and charm him (1st level spell), then question him regarding the security arrangements, and maybe use him to gain access.  Down side of this is that afterward he can talk, unless you silence him, but that may offend the goddess...<br>
2) Arrange to have your beautiful statue shrunk (1st level spell, growth, reversed) to a small enough size that it can be carried while you teleport.  A 9th level wizard casting it will shrink an item to 1/10 its normal dimensions, or 1/1000 its normal mass. (a twice man sized statue, 12 feet tall, about 6400 lb, will reduce to one 1.2 feet tall and about 6.4 lb) and will stay shrunk for 45 rounds.<br>
3) Port into the room.<br>
4) Disable any protections, destroy the golem (if it is one), using growth (reversed) again, shrink down the remains of the Golem (or the staue), and remove them from the pedestal.  Put your shrunken staue in its place (be very careful to place it properly so it is in place when regrown) and either wait for it to regrow, or dispell the shrink on it.<br>
5) Port out with the shrunken golem body (or statue) and pry the sword out at your convenience.<br>
6) use your established whisperers to spread the idea that the mysterious replacement of the statue by an even more beautiful one was a miracle of the goddess.<br>
<br>
Again, what the priests dont know wont hurt them (so long as this was all done quickly and quietly) and the goddess will be placated by having a more beautiful/valuable representation of her in the temple.  She may even tell her priesthood not to worry about it should they ask her if the switch was her doing.<br>
<br>
If you do use charm on an initiate/acolyte (a stupid one to extend the usefulness) you will probably have to arrange a deadly &quot;accident&quot; for them before they come out of charm, or they will blow the whole scam wide open. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthal0012.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thal0012</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/16/02 1:01:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Are they all truly fanatic worshippers?

<br>
Ok, I said there were seven swords right?<br>
<br>
Our party had found out where another one of the swords was hidden, but we got stumped at a puzzle that was there and left. It was in a temple of a forgotten god that was infested with undead. Apparently the swordmaker went there and kicked some of the undead out for a bit to hide the sword.<br>
<br>
Well we went back there the other night and managed to figure the first puzzle out. Figuring out the puzzle opened a secret door that led to a trap filled hallway. Or at least it 'appeared' to be full of traps. There were real pressure plates that didn't do anything, etc.<br>
<br>
At the end of the hallway was the sword we were looking for, embedded in stone in true 'Excalibur' fashion. We figured out that there really was a trap guarding it though, so we fashioned a means to extract the sword without having to physically pull it out.<br>
<br>
Upon it's removal the walls crashed in on the small room it was in. The sword had smacked against the floor on it's way to us, and upon further examination, turned out to be a fake.<br>
<br>
Another secret door, 3 of the most devious and cunning traps I've seen in a while, and a puzzle later and we approached a golem, bearing what appeared to be the real sword. The golem awoke and asked the reason we sought the sword. The leader of our party said to protect the people, and the golem gave up the sword, and it's service.<br>
<br>
After seeing the stats on the sword I really want to get the other one more than ever. But it's starting to look less and less like it will be a simple extraction, and more like a puzzle solver. I'm afraid I might even have to bring the group along. =)<br>

Perhaps here is a solution for you.  Leave your assistant at home.  You will need to hire a mage.  Oh...a fairly high level one.  I like the idea of scouting the temple before hand.  Sneak in at night, have the mage use improved invisibility on him or herself, then lead them to the statue.<br>

Have the mage inscribe their arcane mark on the sword.  Don't worry, it won't hurt it.  Then, transport out of there.  In the safety of...anywhere but the temple...The mage then casts Drawmij's Instant Summons.<br>

<br>
Simply removing the statue from the temple doesn't immediately deconsecrate it.  Holy relics are occasionally moved from temple to temple.  I doubt the temple would &quot;deconsecrate&quot; a statue of their goddess simply because a newer, more beautiful statue had been commissioned.  It may be moved to another location in the temple or moved to another temple (perhaps a new temple in another city/town), but works of art - particularly holy statuary - aren't things you simply destroy when you get a newer version.<br>
<br>
I like the scam in step 3b, though.  It will take time, though, to make your faux nobleman well-known in the area (think <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Count of Monte Christo</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> here).  That could work, but I'd recommend you regularly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> patronize</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the Temple of Ishtar (translation: donate heavily) before approaching the priests to suggest the swap.  Also, keep in mind that the cration of a statue by manual means will take a long time - six months of dedicated work at the least once materials have been procured.  Finding an appropriately-sized block of the right kind of stone may take twice that long, and it won't be cheap.  You could have a mage create some sort of magical similaricrum, but that would radiate magic and may cause undue suspicion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Notes on Method #2</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Using Shrink/Growth has some logistical issues.  In the example given, recall that 45 rounds is only 45 minutes.  That's less than an hour to get to where you need to go before you're stuck with a 6500-pound statue again.  Perhaps you can teleport into the temple - but perhaps you can't.  In any event, simply popping in has some interesting risks associated with it.  It's impossible to know who's in the temple chamber without actually being in the temple chamber, and the last thing you need is to have some insomniac priest admiring the beauty of his goddess witness your less-than-routine arrival on the scene.  Not saying it won't work - just be aware of the potential for GM deviousness.  Thieves must remember two things when planning any job: the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle and Murphey's Law.<br>
<br>
The bit about the goddess being placated by the more beautiful statue is... optimistic.  Regardless of whether you replaced the statue, you still desecrated her temple by stealing and destroying a holy statue. <br>
<br>
I do like the &quot;goddess replaced the statue herself&quot; bit, though.  Unfortunately, it's easily verified if the temple master(s) commune with the goddess on a regular basis.  While the temple may do nothing to counter the rumor (I mean, how would it look if word of the theft and desecration go out?), but you'd best be counting on having the priesthood hunting for the perpetrator.<br>
<br>
Overall, either of these two plans may well accomplish the major goal of acquiring the sword.  However, the minor goal of not pissing off the goddess isn't going to happen in either case.  In fact, I don't see any way to acquire the sword without rising the ire of the diety.<br>
<br>
That said, it may be possible to acquire the sword without bringing the fury of a god down upon yourself.  Say for instance that the statue was moved for some reason to a smaller temple in a distant town.  Obviously, this would only be done at the behest of a great patron of the cult of Istar, and only then if the cult would benefit greatly from the expense, (Let's face it - moving a holy relic ain't a cheap proposition!) but for the sake of argument let's say it's being done.  Of course, moving a statue is going to attract a lot of attention - and we all know first-hand how dangerous the roads can be to travel (**conspirital wink**).  The cult will have a caravan with temple-supported guards, and possibly a mage or combat priest.  Now let's say the unthinkable happens, and the caravan is set upon by brigands.  Orcs, perhaps (at least, that's what the only survivor says).  The caravan is wiped out, and the statue lost.  Over the course of time and circumstance, an honest soul - such as yourself - who likes to collect swords of rare beauty happens across this particular sword at a bazaar in some far away land and manages to acquire it for his collection.  The goddess will perhaps desire its return, and the temple may commisson a search party to seek out and return the sword, but certainly YOU cannot be held responsible for the sword's unfortunate history.  You acquired it fairly, and for a goodly sum.  Should the cult of Istar wish to provide appropriate compensation...<br>
<br>
Obviously, this plan violates the two principles above all over the place.  However, a good GM will see the opportunity for LOTS of fun and adventure with such a plan (of course, a GM's idea of fun is often slightly different that a player's definition), and isn't that what this is all about?<br>
<br>
I offer this knowing nothing about your GM's plan for these swords.  If you're in some sort of save-the-word-from-ultimate-destruction sort of campaign, he may not want to derail his greater plot line for what could well be a campaign in it's own right.  If the object, however, is simply to acquire the swords then (s)he may appreciate your input for furthering the story. <p>Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br>

There's a few other points of research I'm going to do before hand. Since they've got a bit of beauracracy there, I want to know the pertinent details of when the statue was placed there, who commissioned it, etc. I also need to get the floorplans, renovation details, basically anything pertinent to the timeframe that the weapon was placed there.<br>
<br>
We aren't on a huge 'Save the world' campaign, but there will be a big war soon, and the swords would be nice to have for inspirational pieces. They are more of a sub-plot though. I'm currently wondering if the GM is going to force me to use the rest of the party or if it is something I can do without having to use them.<br>

How much the deity is aware of varies from campaign to campaign.  How much power they have in the world varies also.  Getting the Sword from the statue/golem is be the easiest part.  Not getting the clergy down on you while doing it makes getting the sword slightly harder.  Not getting the goddess upset is completely up in the air.

In my plan I made the assumption that the goddess was placatable or at least trickable because otherwise there will be no way short of another divinities intervention to keep her off the characters.<br>
The whole consecration thing would seem to be dependent on the particular rituals of the cult of ishtar, The statue in question may not even be a devotional object.  If it isnt a devotional object, it should be just a  hunk of stone once removed from holy ground.<br>

My monk always had trouble with Golems, until he found a couple of those scarabs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukoru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Koru</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/02 8:13:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Swipey's plan</span><hr size=1> What you can also do is try to arrange some way to damage the statue 'accidentally'. An earthquake spell or heck, anything that can cause the statue to be marred. Then you have a choice between setting yourself or those in your employment up as master craftsmen who can repair it, or to offer to pay for a better more grand statue to a godess who surely deserves far better than a mere repaired statue. Of course you'd be more than willing to have the original taken to a lesser temple where it's imperfection would not offend the godess.<br>
<br>
If you go the way of setting yourself up as master craftsmen naturally you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> work from your workshop to protect the secrets of your craft! Or have a great deal of privacy if you must work on it on the site. Enough privacy that you can examine it in much greater detail.<br>
<br>
You say things are brewing up for a war.. Well, one of your problems is to get the followers out of the temple so you can have your way at the statue. One of the ways to help a minor conflict along the way then infiltrate the city. Preferably outside the city (invaders, not a revolt which would cause the temple guardians to rally around their temple) insuring that the people in the temple have their attention squarely outside the temple and possibly be out defending the city, not looking for intruders within it. Stiring up a bit of trouble can work wonders for distraction  - just make sure you have a good getaway plan.<br>
<br>
It's a tough call though, I don't know how active the gods and clergy in your campaign are. If they're the kind to carry out thorough magical investigations if something goes amiss, immediately know if they've been tricked in any way. Or even send the flaming Avatar of Asskicking after anyone who steals from the temple trying to suck up and buy the sword or statue may be a whole lot safer. Having gods pissed off at you can range from being slightly annoying to having the life expectancy of a Zent in Shadowdale depending on the GM. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukintire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kintire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/21/02 2:56:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Swipey's plan</span><hr size=1> '300 years ago he went insane, stole all of his swords back, and hid them around the countryside.'<br>

Just a point.... Why? It might be worth finding out just why he went mad before you start grabbing these swords....<br>
<br>
Also, how mad? 'Mildly dippy' mad? or 'tortured spirit cannot rest but inflicts curses, haunts and gruesome death on any who hold his treasures' mad?<br>
