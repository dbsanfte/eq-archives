Honestly, I don't have the resources to put together a full-fledged raid, and who knows how long it will take to wait for one of my friends' guilds to plan one.  <br>
<br>
So what is your honest opinion...it sounded somewhat simple to me, just avoid the liches, con stuff, hide/sneak...but maybe it's more difficult than I think?  Any advice would be appreciated! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxetrintheblackguard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xetrin the Blackguard</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 11:59:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15591.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How easy is it REALLY to get the Book of Souls solo?</span><hr size=1> Personally, I wouldn't wanna take the chance if I were you.  You can, and will most likely make it, but depending on your luck, you might aggro     , die, not get ressed(most likely), and still not get the book, so I'd say don't bother.  However, if you've got the exp to spare the chance, and just can't find a single raid willing to let you pay your way and loot it, then by all means, take the risk. <p><hr>

Take a chance.  Go up naked and all you'll lose is exp if the worst happens.  I can't tell you how fun it is, especially if it's your first time to Hate.

The first time I went, I invised before I gated with a wiz then I sneak/hide but I forgot to turn off invis so an abhorrent saw me and I used a Merchant made insta-cast gate potion. The second time I went, I got lost and ended up near Maestro. He personally came down and beat me to death with my own shoes. The third time I went, I did it flawlessly. It's a real rush when you get it and I'd say it's definately worth a shot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uparticleboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>particleboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/4/02 4:54:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15591.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How easy is it REALLY to get the Book of Souls solo?</span><hr size=1> Wouldn't risk it?  Bah!  It should be the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> way to do it.  Picking it up whena  raid clear the level is kinda cheesy.  If you buy an instant gate potion and a hatestone it'll cost you about 1300 plat and 5-10 minutes of time for you and a wizard.  The worst that can happen is you lose your money, don't get the book and have to eat a death (this last one shouldn't happen since you have a gate potion but maybe you go LD or something).  And all thats unlikely to happen if you're careful and follow the guide. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163097">Hagin Netherblade</a><br>

It's worth the risk. It's not THAT hard, if you're patient. If the south route is blocked, you can always go north and cut across the middle of the zone and vice versa. Go camp a CT gate potion, you can sneak/hide out of CT from the maze without being seen. It costs you nothing, there's no risk of dying in Hate with it, and the thrill of being up there is the highlight of the epic quest in my opinion. <p><center>

Don't stress. Once you do it, you're going to laugh about how easy it was.<br>
<br>
Grab a map, a quick way to get out (Gate Potion or rez), and go. There was a very map that I used that was posted around here several times.  It shows where the Lich Patrol Routes are (the mobs that see through invis) and exactly how to get to the Book of Souls.  Scroll down a bit, and look at the other forums involving the Book of Souls.<br>
<br>
The run through Hate is a cakewalk just as long as you know the Lich Patrol Routes.  It FREAKS YOU OUT, I know, thinking about doing this alone -- I was scared.  It was the only one in the zone when doing my run. It's a rush. =P    But it's VERY easy to do solo; there's no need for a raid -- the Book is in the Maestro room, on the upper floor...Which is pretty deep inside Hate.<br>
<br>
The Book is NO DROP -- unless it's MQ'able, so you're going to have to do it yourself, anyway.<br>

I was only successful 3 of these times, though, because sometimes there is a mob or who that is just stading in your way (i.e. standing in the doorway to get in to the Maestro building).  If there is one there, you should get out ASAP, because most mobs right there don't move and eventually, a lich or a haunted chest may come up behind you.<br>
<br>
P.S. Some random mobs see through your hide.  For example, one of those warrior-mimmie things saw me once, and so have the zombies. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231942">

 <br>
If you go up there DON´T do the same mistake as I did, I held my map upside dow and was running around in hate fer about 3-4 hours not finding the dang book, when I finaly realized my map was upside down it took me 2 min to get the blazted book..<br>
Well I guess no one else would ever do that kind of misstake as I did, but I blame the cursed Beer...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showPrevMessage?topicID=15591.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showNextMessage?topicID=15591.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15591.topic&index=14><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.emailToFriend?topicID=15591.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.threadControl?topicID=15591.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15591.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15591.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies>Training Studio</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
