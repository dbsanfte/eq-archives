From a distance I could see little but a wall of flesh surrounded by cloud of Faydwer's more nobel races.  Now, I had heard that there used to be Ogres in the Butcherblock's, but my mother had told me that those were stories to frighten the young dwarves and keep them near the mines. <BR>  <BR> As I approached I could see it was indeed a Ogre with Dwarves and Elves and Half-Elves all around.  I quickly sized up the situation and saw that most of the combatants were clearly superior to me.  Nonetheless Robyntao, the half-elf standing on point, seemed to be weakening, blood staining his garments.  <BR>  <BR> While I have no special love for the elves nor for the mixed races, there is little fouler than Ogrekind.  In a moment my mind was made.  I joined the fight hoping to speed it to an end and save the half-elf what remained of his strength and blood. <BR>  <BR> As the fight wore on my fang glanced this way and that off of  the beast.  When my blows did land, they barely broke the surface of Corflunk's skin, as I would later learn he was called.  Only a few were deep enough to draw blood.   <BR>  <BR> The moments slowed to where each second seemed an eternity, would we ever slay the brute without loosing some of our own? In this fight I became attached to those around me, part of something greater than myself.  And so we fought side by side, Robyntao swinging his ax, the others their swords, mace and clubs. The healers were healing as fast as they could.  And there I was, safe at Corflunk's back, pricking the flesh of his thighs with my fang. <BR>  <BR> Eventually the wall moved, the ogre ran as he never had before.  Popping from one place to another without traveling the space between, as if under a necromancer's enchantment. <BR>  <BR> The party gave chase swinging whatever was at hand and suddenly Corflunk turned to rejoin the fight having regained his strength through some foul magic.  My heart beat ever faster as he swung his ax our way. Slowly our party weakened, but this time it was obvious the Ogre would fall. <BR>  <BR> He turned this way and that lashing out at whatever stood before him. And at the last moment turned to face me.  The blood drained from my face as I looked up from his knee and saw him looking down at me, his green blood oozing from his ears.  Then, his last blow landed beside my head, making my ears ring and my vision swim.  I grasped my fang between both hands. And leapt with all of my might as he fell to his knees and I plunged my sting into his chest to the hilt. <BR>  <BR> Both Bristlebane and Brell must have been smiling on me that day, for my weapon lost in the behemoth's chest he sank backwards and fell away from me. It was finished. He was dead. And what could this be, of the two parties and one lone rogue who fought the glory of the kill was mine alone, his ax and head my trophies of battle. One lone unworthy rogue esteemed greater those he sought to aid. <BR>  <BR> It did not feel right, but it was a good day in Norrath.  The Ogre had fallen.  The fighters had cheered and I walked away feeling a little taller that day. <BR>  <BR> --  <BR> Callatil <BR> Gnomish Rogue of the Seventh Blade--Luclin <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uscrivener.showPublicProfile>Scrivener</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/27/00 11:15:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The OOC of the matter</span><hr size=1> When I approached the crossroad I /conned those around the fight. Corflunk was yellow. One full group was all yellow to me and the other full group mixture of blue, white and yellow.  There were also some freelancers in the fight that were yellow to me as well.  <BR>   <BR> It seemed obvious to me that the kill would belong to the stronger group and it was obvious the casters could barely keep up with the damage that was being handed out. I really only intended to add a little damage to their package and save some people some down time.  But, in the end the kill was mine. How odd! I don't even have Backstab yet. <BR>   <BR> When Corflunk ran the lag became tremendous and you could not tell where he really was. No one healed him other than the natural processes as he ran.  <BR>   <BR> I just thought I would share this story with my new found brothers and sisters of the blade. <p></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uscrivener.showPublicProfile>Scrivener</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 1/28/00 12:16:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/ulyrler.showPublicProfile>Lyrler</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/30/00 7:35:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Face to kneecap with an Ogre</span><hr size=1> GREAT STORY..loved it..thanks <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
