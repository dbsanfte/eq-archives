Yes, some warriors can solo, but no warrior would put on a fungi to do so if they knew what they were<br>
                           doing. Firstly, the two most soloable warrior races (ogres and trolls) cannot even wear a fungi (though they<br>
                           can wear the no-drop Luclin version). Secondly, and perhaps most important, you're talking about an AC<br>
                           21, -10 to DEX/AGI chestpiece. Warriors as a rule do not have high DEX and AGI, and they'd need both to<br>
                           proc their weapons and to avoid being hit.<br>
<br>
                           No...a soloing warrior would rather have a cobalt BP (AC 45, +12 STR/STA/DEX, 100 pt right-click<br>
                           post-combat heal) or some similar BP (heavy rubicite, heraldic plate, etc.). The prices are similar, though<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
WRONG!<br>
<br>
A smart Warrior or Rogue will ALWAYS opt for regen DURING fight and then if the want right click for heals from BP or even better do what monks do BANDAGES!<br>
<br>
Upper end warriors CAN solo and nowadays you dont even need to be upper end to be almost max on all skills especially since Primals/Prismatics abound. Also warriors get a nice choice of weapons that proc Slows, Lifetaps, Rune , Snare etc...<br>
<br>
If an UPPER end warrior can solo pull a mob (yes he has to pick his encounters more carefully) he can easily solo better than a monk if hes got the right equipment. <br>
<br>
Ill give you an example of a warrior in my guild. His HP is almost at 6k unbuffed. His REGEN is : Fungi (15), AA regen (+3) , Aura of Battle items ( +4 or +6 ) , Talisman of Vah Kerrath (+<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ,Dain Ring (+10) , Racial ability (+8 standing? for a troll) for a Total regen of 48hp per tick while fighting. <br>
<br>
Thats not including the fact that he can lifetap for 100 hp , Has primal, has Slow proccing weapon has max skill bind wound, has over 120 AA .... etc.... <br>
<br>
Yes HE is one of the more UBER warriors on any server but wasnt this nerf brought about due to the most UBER monks across servers. Put the comparison and you will see that a Warrior can solo even better than a monk with that type of equipment IF he can fight mobs that come solo. Self Haste for him is 61% to our 81% but hes got all the bells and whistles to help him solo .<br>
<br>
Fungi is BY far worth the neg stats for soloing PERIOD. Unless you can get a Lunar Fungus Tunic.<br>

What I'd ask of you is this... consider what just happened to Monks, and the take a look at the forum you're in. That's all. You seem like a reasonable chap so I'm sure you'll make the right choices. <p><hr />

<br>
They made mistakes along the way by introducing items which turned the monk into the best melee soloing class - not just a &quot;sliver&quot; of soloing ability, as someone mentioned earlier. This is why so many people twinked monks to solo with. Myself included... though I'll move my gear to a beastlord sometime soon.<br>
<br>
The nerf was their way, albeit a bit extreme, of correcting those mistakes.<br>
<br>
Druids, wizards, necros, shamans, beatlords are classes which were designed with the ability so solo in mind. Comparing their solo ability to that of a monk is comparing apples to oranges.<br>
<br>
Although I'll admit that VI should have buffed the monk's offense by a bit when they nerfed their defense. It wasn't fair to take so much away without giving something to compensate for it - it would have been better to accentuate the class' original purpose not just by negative reinforcement but by a mix of positive/negative. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theshrikesideofmike>theshrikesideofmike</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.creativegraphixs.com/grfxbttns/img4.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 10:29:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Soloing</span><hr size=1> Actually if you go back to old skool... Verant didnt want any classes soloing. Thru the added levels and the added equipment various classes have been able to aquire the ability to solo.<br>
<br>
The only question I have about the nerf myself is this. <br>
Why were monks hit with the nerf while the other classes were upped? Nowhere did people complain bout the other melee not being able to tank.<br>
Secondly while I admit monks were never supposed to be tanks to begin with we were supposed to be the TOP melee toe to toe. No questions asked. This however is no longer true either.<br>
Monks no longer have a distinct edge vs the other melee classes damage wise.<br>
Monks also still are the ONLY CLASS that have a weight restriction. Sure alot of uber equipment is low to no weight.. but unless you have an uber guild or you are even in that level range monks have to constantly balance what they wear/carry. This not only hinders us in some AC such as say Treeweave (no monk would ever wear) but it also hinders monks from aquiring money/equipment thru selling. This is never brought up in anything Verant has ever talked about.<br>
If Verant wants us to have less dmg mitigation then we should at least have some more damage avoidance due to the fact that we are not encumbered with platemail.<br>
I mean really how often do you think someone wearing 200+ lbs of armour is going to nimbly dodge aside.<br>
Why dont monks get parry as a skill? That would add in to our damage avoidance. Monks do use wpns even if its just their hands which are considered wpns.<br>
Or if Verant really wanted to &quot;balance&quot; us vs warriors a little bit, give monks an offensive discipline much like warriors defensive discipline. <br>
<br>
On another note I would also like to point out Verants complete unconcern to certain Monk AAXP's that are completely worthless.<br>
Why do we have an aaxp that improves safefall? Are there really that many areas that this aaxp helps at all?<br>
Also heard that Return Kick.. sounds cool right? wrong. From what has been told to me it only works if your Flying Kick button is not greyed, and if it does go off it greys out your Flying Kick button... How does this help?<br>
Monks unless they are afk or are just being lazy always have their special atk used. Now if the riposte returned a kick w/o using our spcl atk up it would be nice.<br>
Technique of Master Wu... Nice skill... if it worked.. my friend has this and after the first hit all other hits miss because they all say you are to far away to hit your target.<br>
Combat Stability.. From what Ive heard this doesnt even work to begin with. If it did .. why does Verant give monks this aaxp instead of more levels of Combat Agility?<br>
How about rethinking our lvl 60 discipline? At the moment this ability is a laughable. The &quot;surprising amount of damage&quot; is anywhere from 200 to maybe 500 dmg. Which happens more often than the autokill. Which if it goes off poofs the corpse. Why do rogues get this as a regular ability at lvl 60 not requiring any discipline that costs one hour to reset? and theirs does not poof corpse and has much higher chance of assassinating the mob. Compared to that ability and rangers with AM3 and EQ3 with TrueShot.. monks dmg capabilities are negligible.<br>
<br>
Just couple things I wanted to express and get off my chest.<br>
<br>
Oh and BTW if Verant didnt want such uber equipment at end lvl encounters going to monks... just put a 7-15lb wt on it instead of being lazy and saying 0.0 and all/all.<br>
<br>
And so ends my thoughts<br>

<br>
As pointed out, in the old world no class was meant to be soloing... some of us remember when kiting was very controvertial, and among the first nerfs were nerfs on Druid DoTs to try and stem Druid soloing.<br>
<br>
So nerfing Monks to prevent soloing has as much merit as nrefing any of the current &quot;solo&quot; capable classes to prevent them soloing.<br>
<br>
I've seen a lot of claims as to what Monks were originally designed to be that frankly have as much weight as claiming Mickey Mouse was originally designed to be a Navy Seal.<br>
<br>
I've no idea how long you may or may not of been playing, but to anybody else that wishes to make claims as to what Monks were are were not originally designed to be, if you weren't playing pre-Kunark in the old world don't even begin to comment on the matter.<br>
<br>
Anybody that was playing pre-Kunark, please for the love of god try and exercise your memory a little, and actually recall what was happening. Remember this was a time when well equipped Warriors, Paladins, SKs, Rangers and Shaman were all running around in exactly the same armour. <p><hr />

Hence if there were to be any justification for todays nerfs based on pre-kunark status, we would give out all spells, wreck rogues and warriors and boost lots of classes that were marginalized with time.<br>
<br>
Which gets me back to the monk status today.<br>
<br>
My perception of the nerf is that it is only and solely promoting the position of warriors in xp groups and raids:<br>
<br>
Other classes solo better than we do. <br>
Quadders get infinitely faster xp than we do.<br>
Same for AE groups restricted typically to wiz/enc/clr mostly, without monks.<br>
<br>
We could so far slay and tank low blues at a fast rate and still keep it efficient.<br>
Now I very much doubt we will in our crippled form.<br>
Indirectly it promoted once again the holy-trinity and reduced once again the versatily in groups and reinforced monk raid/xp marginalisation.<br>
<br>
Warrior first but any other class, is balanced when they are not twice or three time more numerous in groups and raids.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the case before, it is even less the case now.<br>
<br>
So from a too warrior intensive game, melee centric, we are gone to an even more warrior centric game.<br>
<br>
I can't call that balanced, justified nor reasonnable.<br>

Most soloing Wars will tell you exactly the same thing as soloing Monks, or any soloing melee class. Regen &gt; all. I'm a soloing 60 War (off and on) with average gear, but I do have a ToD, and I'd trade my Thurg BP for a fungi any day of the week. I do know that I couldn't solo without a slowing weapon, period. For me, my ToD doesn't make fights easier or more efficient, it makes them possible. Monks, on the other hand, could solo without any form of slow and I was never 100% convinced about the fairness of that.<br>
<br>
From a Warrior perspective on the nerf:<br>
I think they had the right idea and implemented it in completely the wrong way. I wasn't too thrilled about high AC monks in magic pajamas tanking better than I could whilst wearing 3 gazillion lbs of plate steel. Thing is, that problem never happened with my peers which are really my guild monks - I've seen them tank and they couldn't do it as well as I could. The monks that outtanked me were the top 10%, and I don't really tend to hang with that 10% anyway.<br>
<br>
Not all Warriors are cackling gleefully about this - What most of us were complaining about was that top 10% of monks, and that hasn't been the thing that got fixed. I'm sorry we got the rest of you guys nerfed, because that wasn't our wish or intention at all. <p>--<br>

 The &quot;change&quot; Verant made was not well thought out and simply did not adjust the class in the way they had posted it would.

Nice post Tarsk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
P.S. Another reason why monks solo decently compared to warriors is our haste. We can be self hasted to 81% such as myself whereas a warrior would only be at 41%. Thats what really made a big difference. Get yourself that Pirate Eyepatch (forget the exact name but casts Captain Nalots Quickening 20% spell haste for 20 mins)  that casts a self HASTE spell and you will be at 61% self haste and see a big difference in soloing. <br>
<br>
I know our Guild Rogues and Warriors can both solo shrooms just as Monks do.<br>
<br>
On the Other hand a well equipped Paladin can actually go afk while soloing and come back with a dead mob at his feet and no downtime whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Paladin in my Guild with that Srra 2 hander that procs 175 hp heal can pull a shroom , hit attack , go afk and come back with a dead shroom at his feet and sometimes with more HP than when he started.<br>

I think that your experience is similar to that of all the rest of us.  We read about, or heard about some monk, in some guild, on some other server, tanking like a champ.  But, in our own guilds, on our own raids, the idea of letting monk do the tanking was ridiculous and simply didn't happen.  I'm in a 50's-60's guild that does Velious content. Our Sensei *never* tanks unless we have *zero* 55 plus plate classes available as Second Assist and even then, he's the add tank. And when he is pressed into that role, guess what? We're trying to find a tank to bring in asap. Thankfully, we always seem to have at least one plate tank available. I imagine if we had none there to be MA, we'd just fold up our tents and cancel the event. <br>
<br>
It's nice to see that some warriors are basing their reactions on their own experience and not just reading steelwarrior.org and fohguild.org and believing everything they read.  The top 3% of monks aren't even feeling the nerf. That's why they aren't posting. The more it becomes evident that end game SOL monks (you know, the ones tanking Avatar of War /snicker) are untouched, the more likely the plate class hatemongers get after monks again with more calls for nerfing.  Of course, once Verant caves to that pressure, there won't be anything done for the average geared mid 50's-60 monk pulling in ToV, but what can ya do?<br>
<br>
You think the Verant folks sit around invis watching or HoT raids? please.  If the only raids you watch are the ones done by FoH or LoS, of course you are going to see a warped vision of what is really happening out there. When every message board is filled with level 37's ranting about something they read at the FoH board, it gives the impression that the problem is rampant, when it's really such an insignificant issue that it's really a *non issue*.<br>

<br>
I still think that a 15 pt a tick regen, when I have nothing else (no AAXP regen, no natural regen, no effects or potions) is overrated for soloing and I'd still rather have the extra AC, HP and stats.<br>
<br>
However, I have a friend (yes, he's a monkee) who has a fungi, and maybe I can borrow it from him over a weekend and test it out to put my mind at ease one way or another.  <br>
<br>
Peace out.<br>

<br>
Your preference for the AC and HP is a perfectly valid one.<br>
<br>
Would be interested if you could return though and give a before and after comparison using your friends fungi though. Even if that's just to let us know you prefer the War BP. <p><hr />
