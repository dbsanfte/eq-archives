But what the hell.<br><br>I go in and find her standing in the window of the upper gatehouse, facing outwards towards the rest of the Mids below, healing them and /waving, etc.<br><br>So I stand right behind her, knowing that she has to turn around eventually.  5 minutes of standing there, and she finally turns.  PA/CD/SS took her to about 1/2 health.  She kind of freaks a bit, tries to escape, realizes there's closed doors in the way (while I am hitting her) then /bows before she dies.<br><br>Her friends are now on the way, but I jump out of the window and stealth away.<br><br>Best RvR kill for me, just because of the situation, and the uniqueness of it.

I was cutting through the woods southward, almost to the road when I spot a bunch of corpses on the road. So I stroll out to investigate (hidden obviously) and see 3 dead Albions and one dead Hibernian. Just for a split second I see a hidden Briton invader (Archer) but not I'm not quick enough to check con. So I run around in hide some more to spot him and I catch a few more glimpses of him but nothing solid. At this point I'm thinking he is definitly too high a level for me to kill and decide I should run. Next thing I know he pops out of hide. I believe this was because he was being cocky and thought this little shrimp Lurikeen couldn't touch him (He was red con). So at this point I'm still about to run, but just then I see an undead aggroing him from behind! So he starts to run away with this undead after him, he gets diseased and I chase him down and catch him easily as he has majorly slowed down. I catch him and melee him to death with the help of the zombie!!! (I almost died too, 5-10% health left)<br><br>I was laughing so hard after that, and noticed he /released REAL fast. I'm not sure if the zombie did more damage to him than I did, but if so he also lost xp. I'm still not sure if he came out of hide because he was being cocky and was trying to mess with me, or because the undead behind him popped him out of it, either way I'm damn satisfied with the results. I personally would never purposely grief kill someone, but this situation was just too good to pass up.

I was stealthed waiting for the 'right' target to strike, while my realm mates are hacking it out. The I saw an orange con Lurikeen on top of the gate raining down arrows on our clerics.<br>So I decided to sneak up and beat the crapo outta him. He was facing the arrow slits on the wall so there was no way I could land my PA. So I waved at him twice when I was right beside him stealthed. He fell for it, got his weapon out and faced me. Poked me once, and I replied with a huge PA(this was before the stealth nerf). Enervating resisted, but no biggie. Naturally, I followed up with Creeping Death. Then I hear 'thunk', it was blocked! There geos my stun. I was kinda suprised cuz that was the first for me fighting a ranger with a shield. We duked it out for about 15 secs, and I was loosing...<br>The ranger was at around 25% health, but I was down to 10%. Then...I saw the arrow slit(window) on the wall. I said screw this, time ta getta hell outta ere. I disengaged and ran for the window, and jumped down. Yay safe fall! But the ranger had no such luck!

We get flanked by some albions, but end up killing them (I died in the process, but we as a group prevailed).  While dead I go LD and end up at bind point.  I come back and he suicides and we run back out for round two.<br><br>This time we pick up a friend to join us, and all three of us run out for a rematch (cause we KNOW they'll be back).  Stupid us, they setup bait (a low blue running around by himself) and we fell for it, when we attacked him they ran up and killed us.  It was horrible.  This was my second death to a theurgist (damn their pets hit HARD) btw, important later.<br><br>Not to be outdone, round three.  We run out again to the albion milefort, I'm running ahead scouting, stealthed.  I go up the alb milefort stairs, check the upper room, leap out the window, do a quick perimeter check for stealthers, see nothing and tell them to head through.   DOH, albions setup an ambush between the two doors.  I didn't want to give us away by opening the door so I never checked there.  I'm stupid!   Anyway, we prevail and the albs release, sure to come back.<br><br>We setup at the milefort waiting for them.  And we wait.  And wait.  I scout the portal fort a few times .. nothing.  So I suggest to the group that we run to the portal fort .. but approach it from the aggro-monster side, surely a stupid move that they wouldn't expect hehe.  I have the group wait out of sight and I scout the portal fort from the wrong side.  Hey look a big group of albions are heading out to the milefort, AND THEY DIDN'T SEE US, WOOO.<br><br>Group and myself run up behind them while they're staring at the milefort picking their arses, and slaughter them.<br><br>Here's the REALLY good part though.  The theurgist that had killed me twice earlier was mezzed.  I sneak up and perf him.  Success!  But he quickcasts AE mez and starts to run off with very low health.  He got lucky and caught us ALL in the mez ... he's getting away!<br><br>Enter bleed damage.  6 pts .. 5 pts ... 4 pts, and he keels over dead.<br><br>Haha =) <p>-- Huff McTuff, 40 Nightshade, Pendragon<br>-- <i>Nightshade Team Lead</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujaaxtherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaax the Rogue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/02 4:26:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2042.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hehe this one was just rude</span><hr size=1> Very nice stories....

I cannot fully describe how upset I was to die by the staff of a caster. Probably because her staff hit me for around 170.<br><br>So, I spot her chain AE nuking some Hibbies, who being the clumsy disorganized and self-centered lot that Percival Hibbies are, run around in circles while she racks up the RPs. Now, she's surrounded by all manners of healers and tanks, but I'm looking for revenge at any cost, so I strike. Perf, Creeping Death, and start stabbing.<br><br>Now, being the smart cookie that I am, I use disease poison almost always.

Achilles' Heel... finally she dies and I sprint.<br><br>Now, to this day, I'll never understand it, I get away (literally with murder). I make it back to the Albion Milewall and rest for a bit. About a half hour later, what do I see, but Leria running down the path from the Middy wall to the Albion wall. Now, for a moment, my conscious says: <i>Jalena, you've taken your revenge.</i> To which the conscious with horns replies: <i>She beat you to death with a stick! More revenge is required!</i><br><br>So I sneak onto the path, and perf just as she crosses my Mulmar-Kadaffy-esque Line of Death. I slam her with a Creeping Death, and this time finish her off and make a get away again.<br><br>Now, you'd think this would be the end of the story... but oh no... the very next day in the Albion Frontier she died twice to my blades. But it doesn't end there... the next few days I headed deep into Midgard to see about terrorizing the little ones (which turns out is about as much fun as shooting fish in a barrel). Low-and-behold!

There's just something about killing someone when they think they're safe.<br><br>The very best was immediately after an ill-fated relic raid, last Saturday night.  We had just returned to Midgard after the guards at the relic keep had wiped our entire force out without even getting winded...  The Middies had just retaken Blendrake, and rushed out, determined to take it back from them.<br>At the time of night (It must have been 4am eastern) there were a total of 3 climbing shades on the raid.  Valarauco, me, and one other, who didn't really make it into the keep for some reason.   <br>For some reason, the vast majority of the Middy force that had retaken the keep had left.  They seemed to realize that this had been a mistake right as we arrived, but when they attack they were wiped out.  <br>So we finally get on the keep.  Val and I see one red to me, orange to him, Norseman, and decide to double team him.  As fate would have it, we BOTH missed our PAs, but somehow managed to melee him to death.  Unfortunately Val was then sniped while inside the keep, leaving me alone.<br>Well, there had been another Norse archer running around on the battlements too.  She apparantly decided now that perhaps the battlements weren't the safest place, and went for a sit down near the keep door.  Hop down from the battlements, creep up.. PA, CS...  And she was done for.  I thanked the gods that the guards were busy with our siege force outside, and managed to restealth in the middle of the courtyard.  I sneak up the battlements on the other side a second, then jump back down... And turn to see a Norse caster, yellow to me, run out of the tower.  (I'm just about right on top of the body now...) The caster, probably being warned of the assassin on top of the body, runs towards it, probably so she can unstealth and kill the assassin...  Bad idea.  /stick, pop her on the run, and now there's a nice second corpse, lying in the middle of the courtyard.  (I don't remember if I one shotted or not... I think I did)<br>Then, after a quick trip outside the keep (And a death) I make my way back in.  The blue archer must have gotten a res, because she's back.   And sitting in the exact same place I got her the first time.  I got her again, but this time at the cost of my life.. Unknown to me (Mostly because I hadn't been paying enough attention) our besieging force had just gotten jumped by the Middie reinforcements, and with our tanks no longer there to take care of the keep guards... My life didn't last very much longer.  But 3 solo kills in the middle of the keep was definately my best night ever.<br><br> <p><IMG SRC="http://www.dopplex.net/sigfile2.jpg" ALT="Caith Caidh, 35th Season Nightshade, An Claidheamh Soluis" ALIGN="middle"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzarlaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zarlaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 2:04:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2042.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Kills</span><hr size=1> I have a lot that i would like to share but the two that stand out to me right now...<br><br>A Nightshade was griefing some troll thane who was yellow to me on the alb in emain.  I was with a group at the time at the portal and we had to go back and rez this thane 3 times.  I decided i would stay behind and see if he was stupid enough to try it a 4th.  So the thane just sat there on the hillside resting and i stood inside of him.  Not more then 5min later i see an emote of this rouge waving to him so i jump out and see him down below me.  I waved back at him with a nice PA and 2 poisons.  I dropped him before he could get 15 yards.  He was orange to me and i doubt he'll be doing that again anytime soon.<br><br>Another one is on a failed relic raid.  I was the only SB at the time.  At least 45 albs where inside the fort and up along the front by the archers.  I took my time as i was in no hurry since so many albs where running around.  I heard from others that we where getting demolished by the albs as they just kept pooring in.  I said screw it jumped in and took out 2 orange casters and 1 red that where sitting in the middle of the fort surrounded by a ton of albs before anybody knew what happend.  Then proceded on a yellow minstril since i loath them.  I died with in seconds of attacking him but got him to around half hp.  Definatly made up for the 3.5hrs of scouting around Pennine.<br><br>One part that struck me as funny was some alb was actually laughing at me.  Can't believe somebody would laugh after having snuck in and killed 3 people in the middle of 45+ albs.  Oh well, i got his name and i'll be seeing him again.<br><br>Ayron Erebus &lt;Raven's Shadow&gt;<br>lvl 42 Shadowblade <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uunwizness.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unwizness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 7:57:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2042.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh Official member of Creeping Death here</span><hr size=1> hey hey, going rvr'in' later on tonight. hope to see ya man <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utakofmidgard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TakofMidgard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 9:45:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2042.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sweetest RvR Kills</span><hr size=1> Mount Collory, a full group of green and blue conned hibs hunting aughuskys (the horse things in the water).
