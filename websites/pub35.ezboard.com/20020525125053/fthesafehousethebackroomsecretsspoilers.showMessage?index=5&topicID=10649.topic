<br>
IMO, all tears should be retroactively changed to "Dozekar's Tear", all symbols should be retro changed to "Drake Symbol" and all HoT quests should be changed to simply require a mix of Dozekar Tears and Drake Symbols. Or the varieties merged and reduced, to two kinds of tears and three or four kinds of symbols. With too many varieties, and no drop quest items, the small numbers principle kicks in and wreaks havoc with the chances of getting any rewards out of Dozekar that are proportionate to the time invested in him.<br>
<br>
With such a slow quest completion rate, having to kill a contested dragon and one third of TOV thirty times to complete about fifteen quests, and then have another twenty unfinished with no end in sight, is totally retarded. Especially when that dragon is the last thing holding strong guilds onto Skyshrine faction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelodoron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elodoron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 12:16:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10649.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Halls of Testing Symbols / Dozekar Tears rarity?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, farm these incredible hard mobs for Vulak Loot Quality...that's really balanced <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utabbalt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tabb Alt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 12:32:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10649.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Halls of Testing Symbols / Dozekar Tears rarity?</span><hr size=1> Dozekar loot is always one of the top 1-2 items for the slot they go in.  If you want a lot of mana and hp in each slot, doze items have the best hp/mana for the slot they go in.  It is a time investment, spread out over many many raids... in exchange for a large number of items from NTOV.  Dozekar is one of the few reasons to NOT just rape ntov, and its a great building step for lower guilds (with a lot of time on their hands, mind you)<br>
<br>
So yes, its a time investment.  yes you'll get 'more' items from clearning in NTOV.  Yes dozekar farming is worth it for the items you get. <br>

<br>
Think we had 40 tears+ banked at one stage waiting for the right drops to complete quests.  <br>
<br>
My advice is to make sure someone loots the tears and symbols who you trust and just has a massive bank account full of them.  Then someone loots the last symbol/tear so you can MQ it.  <br>
<br>
Otherwize you will loose alot of symbols/tears to guild attrition over the time it takes to complete the quests and you might be in a situation where everyone started a quest, but no one can finish it becuase they *only need* two more items to get theirs.  Also a mule can keep faction up to CoV, whereas some cant whilst fighting in Ntov etc <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uemodius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emodius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 8:29:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10649.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Halls of Testing Symbols / Dozekar Tears rarity?</span><hr size=1> the hard part is getting enough Doze kills.
