<br>
Aten Ha Ra was dead when this happened - no warders at all were up.  The only content that was skipped was the, in the words of Blixen, &quot;10 plus hours of clearing&quot; to get to Mini-Aten.  Let *him* slog through 10 hours of clearing from inzone to DXXT (dead) to TVX (dead) to DXVT (dead) and then the last stretch to VXAHR, and see how eager he is to do that again for two pieces of loot.  It's not like we didn't *walk through VXAHR's room* a few days earlier on the way to kill Aten Ha Ra.  Hell no, nothing like that.<br>
<br>
The whole clusterfuck called Vex Thal should be earmarked as &quot;GM hands off&quot;.  After camping those shards beyond any reasonable expectation of effort, then killing Emperor Ssraeshza to finish the key (which your whole guild had to camp countless hours to get keys and that idiotic ore so you could get to him,) you get to zone in for hours and hours of mindless, pointless tedious clearing to get to the bosses.  The imaginationless lackwit so-called designer probably created the zone in a half a day with judicious use of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.  Hell, a good proportion of the loot is stuff that rates &quot;Ah fuck it, bid so it doesn't rot&quot;.<br>
<br>
After all that bullshit, you should be able to warp pull Vulak to the inzone there without anyone saying boo. <p><table align=left cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=1>

<br>
But it's pretty laughable that the same guilds that complained when second tier guilds came gimping Vulak and skipped killing the other dragons (omg! skipping content!) are now crying like babies when the same rationale they were using is put back in their face. Boowooowoo.<br>
<br>
Don't like content? Just don't fucking go there then.<br>
<br>
EQ requires absolutely NO skills. Just loads of free time. The only thing a uber guild requires is accepting that you will eventually have a pasty white skin and live like a mole.<br>

He showed up and waited to see if you wiped out, at which point he would have left. But since you won, you &quot;clearly&quot; exploited, so he spanked the guild. Typical bullshit from someone with power who doesn't know how to handle it. After the shite required to get into VT, the GMs should leave you the fvck alone while in there - particularly when it's clear from what Blix said that he didn't see the pull. If it's an exploit (which I think is highly debatable), they should fix it, or enforce penalties. Selectively enforcing penalties (and suspending on the first time its <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  ever</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> come up with a guild) is complete BS.<br>
<br>
Keep your head high, guys. Blix will certainly keep his up his ass.<br>
<br>
Back when servers actually had GMs, Blixtev was our &quot;head&quot; GM on Prexus. Frankly, he was pretty much a dick. Prexus crashed for several days, and when I logged on, I found my Peacebringer to be missing. I petitioned about it, and Blix told me &quot;It is policy to not replace missing items due to server crashes. Sorry you lost your item you worked hard to get, but there's nothing we can do.&quot; So I /petitioned again, got a different GM, who replaced my Peacebringer within 10 minutes, and appologized for having it go missing from the crash. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><center>

As much as it would be &quot;nice&quot; if there were, past history shows us that we are doomed to failure. What % of players do you really think even know of this happening ? I can bet it's well below 20% of the server population. And of those, how many agree with VI ? And of those left, how many actually care enough to quit, or do a sit in, or post something ? Pitifully small.<br>
<br>
This is not the 1st occasion such a stink has been raised over an in-game &quot;event&quot; and interaction with CS, and I'm sure it won't be the last.<br>
<br>
VI have NEVER apologised for any GM decision, and have never reversed one. Cast your minds back to &quot;that story&quot;, or the famous ST/Warders bannings. You can go further back if you want, and the result ?<br>
<br>
VI will come out with some bland statement (IF they say anything at all) saying that the situation is unfortunate, but they are right. They will justify their heavy handedness because they have to support the GM.<br>
<br>
Some of those suspended will quit along with others in their guild. But in the end, all those rest of us addicted junkies will carry on paying our $, and a few months down the line this will be history.<br>
<br>
VI will do something horrid to the encounter or game engine in a few months time when we forget about it. Like make these mobs auto poof if they go out of their room (precedent already set) or perma root them. Imagine killing Dain if he poofed outside his room, and was not perma rooted ??. /shudder. Or how easy he would be perma rooted.<br>
<br>
We basically have to face the fact that it IS their world, and they don't have to be fair, don't have to be consistent. To expect such is expecting too much. Our world is rules by cruel gods who do not have to justify themselves, who can (and often are) whimsical in their decisions.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SO FUCKING NUT UP AND DO YOU PUSSY SHCMUCKS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
the reason verant can and will treat us like this is what gary grobson(sp?) told me once,  <br>
&quot;they never leave,  they will hate you, but when it is all over they will come back, they always have, why won't they now&quot;<br>
<br>
and  this was to a person I suspened once as a senior and  I  did it under thier rules and I thought the person did nothing wrong,  about a week later  I was retired for good.<br>
<br>
the reason they can do this is cause all you  guys who talk it up and have nothing to back up your talk about quitting, are just that, TALK<br>
<br>
so leave, so move on, yeah you may miss the game, but aren't your principles more inportant that a nice new steaming pile of shit loot of ahten?<br>

<br>
Having been there and knowing the layout of the zone, my only question is this. Why Pull Mini-Aten down to Kaas room?<br>
<br>
If all the bosses before her are dead, Kaas isnt up to flux you, so that has to be done by a duel right?<br>
<br>
And since the bosses before her are dead, why not just take the porter up after you kill Diabo Xi Va Tamarel? <br>
<br>
Im just confused because without spoiling the zone, after you kill DXVT youre practically in her lap, I cant understand how you would log for the night and leave her up. Only by ripping her through the floor would you avoid the hellish crawl through DXVT's wing to get to her again. Now in that respect, with all pre-bosses down, youre still skipping an incredible ammount of mobs. <br>
<br>
I dont think suspensions were warrented, but I fail to see how anyone can think its ok to skip that crawl. If we killed DXVT and stopped for the night I'd be pissed cause it would ensure in my mind we had to redo that whole 2nd floor break. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8148">Sensei Sikanak Champion of War</a><br>

As to why we didn't kill VXAHR after DXVT, she wasn't respawned yet after we killed DXVT last.  Sooo, we skipped &quot;10 plus hours&quot; of pointless clearing to get to one boss.  This was a conscious decision, based on the implied OK from VI to do it based on Dain and other encounters that have warp pulling involved.  Never seen anyone suspended for pulling Dain have you?  Why would we expect to raise shit over warping any other mob?<br>
<br>
Is warp pulling against the rules?  Everyone has their own opinion, that's natural, but the only one that matters is VI's.  If it is supposed to be against the rules, they should have made it against the rules 18 months ago and made Dain an encounter that did not *require* warp pulling.  You can't have it both ways.  Well, if you're VI I guess you can.  It's a complete bullshit double standard though. <p><table align=left cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=1>

Well, I thought VP was this way when it came out, a &quot;NO CS HERE&quot; zone.<br>
Would have thought the same of ST but that one was not true.<br>
Would have thought the same of VT, but obviously every lvl 40+ jerk that knows where to look up EQ info can get there via the guide program. Yes I said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> guide program</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> because there's no way a real GM would pull this kind of thing.<br>
