Does it seem like mythic always over does changes?<br><br>They nerfed hunters into oblivion.  They then destroyed archer stealth in one swift blow.  Now in another swift blow they completely reversed it and to a large degree negated our stealth.  Now we won't see the archer before they TS and shoot us.  We had a chance before.  But now they can wander around stealthed and see us at clipping range. <br><br>My question is this:  <br><br>Is the game so delicate that small changes make such a difference or is it that mythic makes huge moves without really thinking about how it will impact ballance?<br><br>I think a far better fix for the problems would have been reduce TS range to bowshot range and SH to .75 bow shot range.<br><br>This seems to be a more ballanced small step change that could be adjusted over time.<br><br>What do you all think?  I think the broad changes are really annoying and really hurt mythic.  <br><br>Mel<br><br>PS  I got 50 today (one week before I lose the advantages oh well<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i think that change is good.)<br><br> <p>The only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the government.

Truesight and see hidden never should have gone in as they were either one.<br><br>This change is another example of them completely changing somehting..it does not tone it down..or modify it in a small way to try and improve the situation..it completely reverses the situation.<br><br>Second, I am level 50 and I don't see mid 40s archers in my team from that far off, much less enemies.  It may be that this is what you were told/saw but it's far from my experience.  <br><br>I have an archer and I am all for archers being powerful, but changes like this hurt the game.  Just as see hidden going in hurt the game.  I argued against it and I don't have it in part because I don't like it.  <br><br>I do think a fix was in order but to just negate it completely minus 10minutes after combat?  It would have been much better to adjust the range.  I would be happy with 75% of bow shot range for see hidden and bow shot range for TS myself this seems fair.  I also think fine give archers camo but they can't move or use TS while it's on.  Moving breaks camo. TS breaks stealth.<br><br>Mel<br><br> <p>The only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the government.

Mythic has no concept of making small adjustments and waiting to see the impact.  The nerf to the cleric AE mez is a perfect example.  Out of the blue they changed the recast time from 30 seconds to 300 seconds.  Now my jaw hit the floor when i saw this because how on earth could the same people who once thought 45 seconds or 60 seconds was too long of a recast then just come around full circle and say, &quot;you know, lets multiply it tenfold&quot;.  And to be perfectly honest this is what scares me the most about the future of this game.  They're understaffed and in way too much of a hurry to see the effects of anything they do.  The changes to mez were another thing.  Mez was overpowered but in a single patch they added purge, full resists, duration affected by resists, and heal breaks.  They seemed to have no clue how much it affects something when you hit it with everything you've got from all angles all at once. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utambori.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tambori</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/02 2:57:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3796.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Caxus posted:<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Mez was overpowered but in a single patch they added purge, full resists, duration affected by resists, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> heal breaks</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Heals breaking mez NEVER went live.  1.52 will introduce &quot;cure mez&quot; spells, which are single-target, cast spells. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/26/02 5:59:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3796.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> It's true that it never went live, but it was seriously considered.<br><br>That alone is scary..soo many changes were seriously considered at one time.

They should make small, subtle changes, evaluate their effect, and then tweak a tiny bit more with the next patch and so on.  But instead Mythic appears to be in some sort of a desperate rush to make drastic changes in the game even if they cause major imbalances and piss off players.  <br><br>Why the rush?     <br><br>Server populations are declining fast.  It doesn't look like DAoC in its present form will have the longevity of games like EQ, etc.  Mythic is no doubt worried about this.  <br><br>This game is primarily distinguished by the concept of the three realms at war and its complex character development system.  There is not that much content compared to other MMORPG's.  It seems the master plan was to make a game where you would focus on RvR and all the many skill and equipment variables that affect your character's performance. This is different from a PvE centered game that needs enormous content because exploring and leveling is the main focus.  <br><br>Unfortunately, not enough people have found RvR interesting enough or balanced enough to want to keep doing it for very long.  And PvE, although fun at first, gets weak real quick.  You either change a server and go to another realm to see new zones, etc., which means you lose all your friends, or roll another character and hunt the same green rolling hills you hunted a million times before.  This is why many are leaving.  <br><br>The recent drastic changes like realm skills, rvr tweaks, etc. is Mythic's desperate attempt to keep us busy until they release an expansion with new content to absorb us.  Maybe the basic structure of the game in its present form makes class balancing and good game play in an RvR environment that wont get boring or frustrating quickly just impossible. <br><br>If Mythic believes this then maybe the frequent radical changes are intentional.  Rather then make small, gradual changes that may not convince you to stick around, they make major ones that grab your attention with no regard for balance issues.  If you benefit from a patch your happy and keep playing.  If you got nerfed, you may bitch and moan, but you keep playing anyway and just hope that the next patch may fix it.<br><br>In short, these frequent and major shakeups in the game may be an attempt to preoccupy us so we ignore shortcomings that they can't fix with a simple patch.  This way we will stick around till an expansion or major new game feature is released that will make the game entertaining again.  <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/26/02 11:59:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3796.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic and changes in game thoughts and a question</span><hr size=1> sneaky,good post,however i cant see where your arguement,theory on mythics changes could be seen as an effort to retain customers or keep them occupied.<br><br>now,if your saying the changes were made to try to keep people intersted,then i can accept that. but drastic changes tend to cause more problems then they fix especially long term.<br><br>the safehouse is a perfect example of the state of daoc,for the first 3-4 months,it was very active. then it started becoming less and less active,now its almost a ghost town in reality.<br><br>im not saying everyone who left,left because they quit daoc. but alot of the people no longer post here,because they dont play the game anymore.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uredalkeistarte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Red Alkeistarte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/27/02 2:28:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3796.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic and changes in game thoughts and a question</span><hr size=1> Quote:<br><br>Is the game so delicate that small changes make such a difference or is it that mythic makes huge moves without really thinking about how it will impact balance?<br><br><br>Thoughts:<br><br>Having played UO since Beta, AC since Beta, you name it- I began to really see things differently after a period of time. Much of that perspective came from Raph Koster. I will share with you a few of his thoughts and the thoughts of those he learned from:<br><br>- Depth is the key to an online game’s success. <br><br>It becomes more difficult to administrate the game as the game gets deeper. The amount of interactions makes rule balancing extremely difficult, and perfectly logical actions (such as normal laws of physics) may result in undesirable activity. Houses in UO, which could be broken into by any number of legitimate means, are a great example (healers ressing through windows, for example). What’s more, these are very hard to fix.<br><br>- Dynamic world<br><br>Another Holy Grail. Players want the ultimate. We gave them crafting of leather goods, they wanted lacquering and embroidery. We gave them herding of animals, they want animal husbandry and a genetic system for animal breeding. Why? Because they want to shape their space, and leave a lasting mark. You must provide some means for them to do so. <br><br><br>My own thoughts are that ofcourse Mythic thinks about balance. However they have some challenges. When you are working on a game, you have time to make changes, adjust those changes and really test those changes before a game goes beta. While they are making those changes, everyone realizes &quot;Hey, we are just trying this out&quot; and they expect the game to change and find that &quot;delicate balance&quot;.<br><br>Well, when you release a game two things happen. Players become this HUGE QA team you never had and the game you thought you had balanced becomes a 'work in progress'.<br><br>So using the numbers before them, they begin to try and manage a delicate multiplayer ecosystem if you will. They see some species dying out and others flourishing. In addition, to keep the game 'fun' and 'exciting' they try and add some new content.  As they work on both of these you are sorta right on both accounts: YES, they can be 'huge' moves and YES 'small changes make a big difference'.  <br><br>As I was saying about it being a 'work in progress', they have to make some changes, test them, test them with the player community and then eventually let the massive community load test them as well. Sometimes they will get a reaction they didn't expect- after all it's near impossible to predict every relationship to the game code.  Remember this is a service- and just as any company would, they want to minimize their exposure to failure. If they find a huge bug, yes they will simply reverse the code or bring the game down. However, for features added to the game, they may just figure out a way to add another feature to reverse it.  It's a 'work in progress' with an audience and although it seems to us an obvious 'about face', it was probably planned that way after realizing their delicate ecosystem was disrupted with [enter an ability here]. I hate to say that because I dread to think our world is unbalanced at any time. However, the cold hard truth is that at times it will be- no matter how small or massive that unbalance is. Sometimes we just have to wait and hope they keep making adjustments. This may be the way it stays, this may not be - on any facet of the game. The hardest and inevitable fact is we will have to wait and see. <br><br>I too have been on the 'we have a cool feature' and the 'crap we just lost it' train. I have played a Hunter to level 50 (still play him on Palo), a Shadowblade (Palo) and a Enchanter on Andred and I know very well the excitement and feeling of &quot;Holy Cow we are going to own with this&quot; and the huge disappointment of seeing an apparent strength &quot;removed or negated&quot;.  Some of them I understand why - some I don't. I think only Mythic and those in the staff meetings will truly understand but you can rest assured that they know there is competition coming, they know this is a business and a service and we are the customers, and they know they have to make a game that retains you.  The best advice I can give you is to try and realize that they do listen to player thoughts and feedback. Sometimes they will read yours specifically, somtimes it will be overlooked unfortunately - but if you provide them with well thought out and well written constructive criticism they will consider it. They have the bloodhound senses when it comes to rants, whines and attacks though so you better make sure you have thought out your argument ahead of time and try and really provide them with a sense of balance in your feedback. Just as we expect them to be balanced - they expect us to be as well.<br><br>To help you out, you might take a look at one of the best resources on the web - Raph's webpage regarding online gaming. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/">www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>I hope those reading this enjoyed the thoughts and are walking away with the idea they will come back with better feedback for Mythic.  Although I don't think Camo is unbalanced I am always personally wanting the game to be balanced before I see any of my own characters flourishing and yet the game failing because of it.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Red Alkeistarte<br>(aka Redx, Redxx)<br>KDOLS <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usneakyandmean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SneakyandMean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/28/02 4:41:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3796.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic and changes in game thoughts and a question</span><hr size=1> Just to clarify my point:<br><br>There are fundamental flaws in RvR that frustrate many people.  Its usually just boring horse rides, ports, running long distances, waiting forever, then BANG – 2 seconds of action.  When you die, its usually the result of just one overwhelming thing that you can’t counter and always strikes you as unfair, like AE Mezzes, overpowered bolt spells, etc. (I’m sure our crit strikes also seem unfair to the caster that eats one).   These problems are worse for non-assassins.  Other classes, like many tanks, feel useless much of the time.  They often just stand around out of range of the casters and archers.  They only get action when they are part of a zerg rush and are lucky to get one hit in before the enemy is totally wiped out.  Then go back to waiting for 30 minutes.  At least we get to stalk around and always feel like we are in the action and can pick our battles.  <br><br>This stuff frustrates people.  Small tweaks can’t fix these fundamental problems and players know it.  The promise of minor changes won’t make you stick around because you don’t see how a bit more of this or a bit more of that will solve the problem.  So Mythic introduces major new abilities, nerfs to the classes you hate, etc. that make you think, “Cool, this might do it.”  <br><br>Yes, the downside is that people on the wrong side of these major changes get pissed off.  However, by keeping the game in a constant state of major flux and promising even more new major changes that are just a few weeks away, the people that hate the last patch stick it out in the hopes that the next one will make it better.  You invest a lot of time in your character and don’t want to give it up just like that.  Your willing to wait for the next patch before you quit if you think something big is on the horizon.<br><br>This is why I think Mythic has been making big changes instead of small ones.  <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/28/02 6:13:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3796.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic and changes in game thoughts and a question</span><hr size=1> Regardless of their intentions, the changes they make normally hit the players like a firehose. And the real frustrating ones are the changes they sneak in... deny... then come back and admit to. You lose your credibility with your testers... err I mean players, and then you keep shooting them in the face with a firehose. They'll never achieve balance because they keep layering the RvR with more crap to add to &quot;try to balance&quot; list. Realm abilities, spellcraft, and eventually the new races/classes. <br><br>IMO, DAoC is a sinking ship(albeit sinking very slowly)... the server populations are getting lower which has its negative effects on class diversity, grouping, and RvR. The expansion pack is really gonna have to hit a homerun. <br><br>But ya know what sucks about the expansion? Everyone is going to want to try the new races and classes, but do you have an empty character slot on your main server? I dont. And I dont want to delete the toons I have. 4 characters per server is just flat out stupid. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3796.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3796.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3796.topic&index=12><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3796.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3796.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3796.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3796.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.9<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
