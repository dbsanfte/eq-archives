<br>
I am still learning.<br>
<br>
I am a level 35 Shadow Blade and I am wondering about a few things. First, I have 29 CS and 27 Sword, my strength is about 87 with items.  I am using a 2 Handed Asterite sword with 97% quality. I am usually only able to for no more than 300 or so with a PA and my max has been 425.  Does this sound about right?<br>
<br>
My main question is, I have CS up to AH level.  What do you all believe the best method of attack should be off a PA and then off of a BSII?   Or, do you prefer other ways of taking out an enemy?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
<br>

You should do the bs2 chain id say and then go hamstring backup garotte.<br>

That's all you have, but it should be enough  on the bg.<br>

Sounds like your template is a CritBlade, but honestly, if you're lvl 35 and you don't have CD yet...   CD is so important for a Crit, you need that Med. stun cause of your slow wep.<br>
<br>
Hmm, so prolly what you want to do is open with PA (with DoT), after it lands replace blade with sword (str-debuff if tank, disease if anything else) + shield (with resists or charged).  Or you can use a Left Axe (unskilled) just to land another poison (disease and str-debuf). Then open with hamstring backup garrote once if tank (disease will slight snare), then switch to hamstring backup assault chain to hamstring backup Ice Storm -- obviously use hamstring backup leaper when the hamstring lands.<br>
<br>
This will make for a more complicated quickbar (well two actually), but in all honesty the def. penalty of garrote is a killer in toe-to-toe and the slowness of a 2H means that missing one swing can be the difference between life and death -- switching weps will let you land another poison too.<br>
<br>
The reason I suggest it this way is because your sword skill is close enough to your CS that the dmg will be similar.  If you had made a true CritBlade (like I was in BG3, then different tactics)<br>
<br>
At 35 you would have been similar to the following template:<br>
CS: 34, Sword: 25, Stealth: 25, Env: 14<br>
<br>
With Items (twisted rings, backpiercer gloves, DF bracers, DF jewel):<br>
CS: 41, Sword: 32, Stealth: 31, Env: 20<br>
<br>
You'd be hitting for 400+ damage on opener and landing a pretty nasty poison, then the CD hits for ~100+ and stuns.  If you miss the CD most enemies still turn and run at this point, so the Garrote either kills them or slows them down enough that the DoT finishes them.  In the rare occurance that you miss the PA then another alternative is to switch to a very fast 1H that has snare on it and just run through them (sprint away) and hope to restealth and re-crit (kite them).  Anyway, that's what you would have done if you were a pure Crit.<br>
<br>
Considering CS 29, Sword 27 then you must have some pretty massive points in Stealth or envenom.  If envenom then 2 weps is the way to go to land the poisons... I guess I'm confused by your spec choice. <p>Cheers,<BR>

At 35th I was base specced very similiar to you. I do not remember the exact specs with items; even though it wasn't very long ago. I'm now only 39th.<br>
You use one of the same weapons that I use: 2h Asterite. 98% qual. Should be 4.5spd, I believe. My dmg seemed to be a bit higher at 35 than your getting. But, very similiar(450~, I think). But, in any case, this is what I did.<br>
I also got a 5.6sec delay Maligned Avernal 2h from DF. Only 89% qual. But, it won't be used as your main wpn anyway. It perfs for about 100pts more however.<br>
When running around; I equipped the 4.5sec w/ disease. Kept 1h player-made(99%) with weakening. Kept 5.6sec in pack also w/ disease.<br>
Obviously, there's no attack a 2h cb likes better than PA. But, I would not rely on landing it when soloing or in hunting group.<br>
If I saw another stealther(archer or assasin), I Garroted or Assaulted them. <br>
Kept moving. Disease has a snaring effect. Often, it seems I never got immediately hit in return because I was out of their wpn range or out of view, maybe. Don't know for sure. Just a guess, there.<br>
Switch to 1h/shield. Re-stick.(wpn delay should be finished by then). Hit with the 1h/weakening sword and shield. <br>
I had several pages setup for melee. Standard G/AH combo. Another with the regular sword-style chains. And, both pages had Ham/Leap for evades.<br>
If you *know* you're about to make a PA(larger battles or keep defense, or soloer), simply switch to slower DF sword. <br>
Casters, I 1-shotted or 2-shotted(normal). Rarely, did it take 3. And, no style was required on 3rd. <br>
Assassin fights seemed to be about the same. Killed some. Lost some. But, I did do alot better once I used weakening poisons instead of DoTs. <br>
I normally didn't bother tanks unless I had back-up from our tanks. Not worth the risk for the rp's they have. But, do remember soloing a few of them. <br>
Snare kiting is probably the best attack method for tank killing.<br>
One was very interesting. But, never got a chance to confirm if it was a reliable tank killing method. Was one of my last kills in the BG. <br>
PA'd. Switched to 1h/ shield. I had made a page with G/AH, Assault/Ice Storm, Ham/Leap, &amp; Temper(high defense bonus for next round).<br>
Used Temper on two different occassions. Got an evade both times. Which led to Ham/Leap. The 2nd time, on Leaper, I accidently pushed the arrow key forward after strike. Instead of rolling back to original position, I stopped behind the tank. I had to re-stick. But, the tank had to turn around to continue the fight. I got in another free shot.<br>
 I took alot less damage during the fight as compared to the other tank fights, I was amazed. &lt;shrugs&gt; Could've been a fluke, though. <br>
Of course, you'll develop your own style as you go along. Post what works best for you. I'd be interested in comparing notes with you and other cb's and maybe coming up with new, better ways of attacking. <br>
