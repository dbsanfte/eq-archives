<br>
<br>
urza9082: Okay, you have just entered 'The Tavern With a Man Shrouded In Darkness In the Back Corner Inn'<br>
Aaron Of AZ: Right.. I head inside.<br>
urza9082: Ok, you go into the bar and there's a guy with a big black cloak in the back corner<br>
urza9082: He's trying to not be noticed<br>
urza9082: But his big, black cloak kind of gives him away<br>
Aaron Of AZ: Is he smoking a pipe, too?<br>
urza9082: Yes, a pipe<br>
urza9082: And you can't see his face<br>
urza9082: That's the key<br>
urza9082: But you can bet it's rugged, unshaven, and damned handsome<br>
urza9082: So you screw around a bit<br>
urza9082: And get drunk<br>
Aaron Of AZ: *Hic*<br>
urza9082: And he yanks you into a room and pulls from his pants...<br>
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;No, not that!  You're disgusting!&quot;<br>
urza9082: Oops, sorry. Anyways, he pulls out his half broken sword<br>
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;Dude, you trip and fall on that or something? How long'll it take to heal?&quot;<br>
urza9082: And he's like &quot;Yo, I'm Aragorn, I'll be your guide for this quest... if you look to the left you can see the Black Riders&quot;<br>
urza9082: &quot;And they're trying to kill us, so let's duck into this other room and I'll tell you about my cool sword... I like swords... I have another sword, and it's big&quot;<br>
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;ooooh... big sword&quot;<br>
urza9082: &quot;Ha!  Well this broken one is even bigger, if I could get it fixed, damn it&quot;<br>
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;Ooooh... bigger sword.  Sword envy&quot;<br>
Aaron Of AZ: *drunken laugh*<br>
Aaron Of AZ: Bwahaha<br>
urza9082: Ok, so, like, the guy shows you his sword<br>
urza9082: And tells you that he's not really named Aragorn<br>
urza9082: But actually named Tim<br>
urza9082: He says that if you wish to find the Holy Grail, you gotta follow him<br>
urza9082: So, you follow him, and end up watching a fierce battle between a few knights<br>
urza9082: It's the one in black defeats the one in green in a most horribly bloody way<br>
urza9082: And you try to get past now that the battle is over<br>
urza9082: After telling you that you are repressing him and you try and push him aside, he claims that 'now he sees the violence inherent in the system' and he attacks you<br>
Aaron Of AZ: I shoot him in the head!<br>
Aaron Of AZ: Twice!<br>
urza9082: Alright<br>
urza9082: After a fierce battle, you claim his arms and legs as trophies and continue on, being called a 'nanny girl' the whole way<br>
urza9082: He is extra mad<br>
urza9082: And tries to hop after you because of those arrows<br>
urza9082: and his torso just falls over and he eats dirt<br>
urza9082: You outrun him, though..

I think I'm gonna call it at 6.

<br>
Someone willing to do a website/message board?<br>
(I am a programmer and web type guru so willing to help) <br>
<br>
<br>
I already came up with a couple concepts depending on party make up.  Which leads to to another questions...will we know ahead of time the other classes in the party? (I would hate to see 6 druids, hehe (that was a bad joke)).<br>

Yeah, you're the one I promised the spot too.<br>

Damn, I've got like three things going on that cause me to get new IM names on my list every few days, so I can't keep up.<br>
<br>
Ok, so we got 6.<br>
<br>
That sounds good.  Why doesn't everyone post here what class/race they want (sides Ninara and Bruenorr) and put at least 2 or 3 selections depending on what we get.<br>
<br>
We already have two rangers, so no more rangers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utweil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tweil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/6/02 6:13:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Race/Class</span><hr size=1> Well, I have a couple concepts, really will try and fit in wherever we need it the most....<br>

I figured they deserved it for making me pick fireball rather than a funny non-combat spell. The bastards.<br>

So mainly I'm thinking fighter, multi classed cleric, or thief of the usual vanilla races. We're talking 2nd ed here right? What kits would you have open, the 2 FR book kits? The class book kits? Tymoran cleric, possibly multi'd, sounds like fun.

<br>
Hmmm, Koru, I think a multi-classed cleric would fit very well.  We have no other cleric volunteers yet, so I think I'll say that I'd prefer that over something else, unless someone else says they would do a cleric.<br>
<br>
Zulian, wizard for you, that would be good.<br>
<br>
Two rangers, wizard, multi'ed cleric (maybe cleric/thief... that would be an interesting combo).  That sounds like a pretty good party.<br>
<br>
Tweil, you said you're out, right?  You didn't want to play 2E? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukoru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Koru</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 7:56:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=80>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1> I can think of nothing as appropriate as a Tymoran cleric/rogue.
