<br>
As a result, Mythic HAVE to start playing around with more RvR content, or more and more of the player base will continue to get bored/frustrated and leave.<br>
<br>
DF was a good start, but ultimately, it's already been completed by the hardcore players.<br>
<br>
The Battlegrounds was an excellent idea, fairly well implemented, but its over way too soon (::sniffs:<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Again and again, I hear the argument: &quot;its not PvP - its *R*v*R*&quot; but lately, talk to most of the 45+ crowd, and all RvR seems to be is either small groups looking for action or the Zerg lagfest.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the main problem is that the frontier is too realistic... vast distances meaning everyone converges on a focal point as soon as the skirmishing group vs group gains numbers. Unfortunately, there are few tactics involved (or necessary) in the taking of keeps - as a result, RvR is usually dry, dull or frustrating except for those fun midrange battles.<br>
<br>
Solution? Well, there have been many ideas thrown into the ring by players, but almost all of them involve breaking out of the model for frontier warfare that Mythic has in place.<br>
<br>
Perhaps instead of the most popular idea, a High level battleground, Mythic should create a realm mission feature.<br>
<br>
Based around the players in a chatgroup i.e. max of 30 people, the portal would take you to a random zone map (Not randomly generated on the fly, but a pregenerated map) and the players would have to complete a mission. Capture an artifact from a keep, destroy a bridge, assassinate a noble etc.<br>
<br>
These zones would have a number of checkpoint milegates which would be opened either by siege, or by completing a mission goal. This would create a number of subzones which could randomly add Realm Guards, and Mobs to adjust the challenge of the mission dependant on the levels of the players on the mission, and the amount of defenders. So, 30 players, all high level, higher level mobs and realm guards, and more mobs and guards. More defenders, slower spawn rate of guards etc.<br>
<br>
Mythic could have fun with this by maybe having a contest for player designed mission zones.<br>
<br>
I would picture the scenario as follows. The CG Leader &quot;purchases&quot; the mission with KPs (I'll explain these at the end - bear with me) from the Captain of the guard in the Portal Keep. All other players wishing to go also purchase a mission medallion (For a reduced amount of KPs) The leader then uses a CG command to synchronise everyone in the group's medallion with the same destination. Shift-I on the medallion will give the information of the mission. <br>
<br>
The players portal in as normal to a spawned mission zone. <br>
<br>
On the opposing side, Players can purchase Realm Defense mission medallions (also at a reduced rate of KPs) and port to where they are needed. (With a maximum of 30 defenders going to that newly created zone)<br>
<br>
If there are no Enemy missions currently in action, defenders would portal in as normal, and be able to xp off some of the mobs near the mission objective area.<br>
<br>
There should be a mission timer of 3 hours that starts as soon as the attacking realm portals in. With the mission objective being completeable (not sure if it is a word) no less than 90 mins. Thus, each mission would not require a power gaming schedule to play. Also once that timer has started, players who have died and left the zone can return by talking to the Captain of the guard. (Cause making people wait on a return port and then catching up will be hard enough as it is)<br>
<br>
If the player logs off or goes LD, their Medallion loses the mission key until the CG leader flashes them again with a CG command. Mission key medallions can be traded with other players if replacements are needed.<br>
<br>
On completion of the mission, the group heads back to the mission portal (again, within that 3 hour timer) and the original CG leader speaks to the Agent in the mission zone to complete the mission (like a quest) all the medallions of live people in the zone are then flashed as completed, and become untradeable.(To prevent twinking)<br>
<br>
If it fails, all defense medallions in the zone (whether the defender owning it is alive or dead) are flashed as successful defense, and become untradeable.<br>
<br>
The reward for completing a mission would be a fixed amount of Realm Points reward, some experience, and items. Each member would hand in their mission medallion for that reward, and the raid leaders medallion would give the items in addition. (Chat Group would reveal the items granted to the leader)<br>
<br>
The same rewards would be given to defenders for succcessfully defending against a mission. (Minus the item reward)<br>
<br>
Ok... so what are KPs - these would be Keep Points. (I'm sure someone can figure out a better name) and would be granted for killing a Keep Lord. To qualify for Keep Points, you or your groupmates would normally qualify for experience if the keep lord was a regular mob. If there was anyway to award that by range, and not dead or alive status, I would strongly recommend that.(Tho I dont know if Mythic can add that in without severly messing with the xp code <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
The Amount of KPs would be based on the keep value, and then modified by the amount of opposing players defending the keep. (Again, not sure how that could be coded - but it would reward players for difficult sieges). <br>
<br>
This would continue the war in the frontier, and make sure that plenty of variety would be available to the players.<br>
It would also allow mythic to play around with new ideas to make RvR encounters more enjoyable for Melee types (as tanks will be an absolute necessity to complete the mission) <br>
<br>
It would also be fun for us rogues <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Everyone I've met who played to 50 and RvR'd their way to the top 25 in realm points have left the game. I guess they "won" and then proceeded to leave the game out of boredom or sold their characters.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the sub-50 people I know who don't RvR much and have been playing since day 2 (because I don't know anyone who actually managed to get Camelot on release day) spend a great deal of time doing PvE stuff: Hunting in the epic zone, darkness falls, tradeskills, etc.<br>
<br>
Last I heard, no one has killed one of the epic zone dragons yet. Most people consider the feat impossible. I remember another game where people had the same opinion about dragons.<br>
<br>
The problem with any content, RvR or PvE is that players will devour it faster than Mythic can create it. Good content takes time to build and only moments to explore and conquer.<br>
<br>
Your suggestions for realm missions are extremely difficult to code. The whole concept of realm points, bounty points, and realm levels is confusing enough for the average player. Mythic probably doesn't want to confuse people any further.<br>
<br>
Some of the PvP additions Mythic really needs to add includes:<br>
<br>
A dueling arena, where players from all three realms can compete one on one against each other with no realm point exchange.<br>
<br>
Making keeps harder to take, because as it stand now Midgard and Albion can take a keep on Percival in 5 minutes without seige gear. How to make it harder? Doors should require siege gear to break them. Archers on the walls should get flaming arrows to attack siege gear and concentrate on attacking siege gear. You'll then need assassins to take out the archers and crafters to build seige gear in order to take a keep. No more of this Zergling rush to take Dun Crauchon and die at Dun Crimthainn to get into Darkness Falls.<br>
<br>
A better informational system for knowing when a keep is under seige. It's very difficult to defend keeps without having someone stationed at each keep watching. This leads to people having twinks waiting in the keeps for would-be attackers. Some early warning system such as when the keep is under attack Rank 2 and up players get messages stating such.<br>
<br>
Extra RPs for defending. If you're in the "zone" area of a keep your realm controls and kill an attacker, you get 25% bonus RPs. There's a real problem with getting people to defend keeps because they want phat RPs. Well, give them some added incentive to stay near the keep and defend from attackers.<br>
<br>
With Darkness Falls, there's a real incentive for people to get involved with RvR. More incentives such as Darkness Falls would be great. I leave this open because Mythic seems to have some creative talent that comes up with these ideas regularly.<br>
<br>
All said, I really don't think the system is that broken. More incentives are needed to do things such as defend, and assemble a real keep siege force. It's all too simple right now. But with the proper incentives in place, RvR will require a bit more planning and call upon the unique skills of everyone involved.<br>

<br>
for the majority if level 35-45 players theres no incentive or interest in going out to engage in rvr. basically because its dominated by level 50 players.  players more then 5 levels below 50,are generally worthless,except in specific things like keep taking. <br>
<br>
theres no incentive to be on your own frontier,because your only reward is death,and wasting your time. this basically means most people in this level range,are of the mindset that they have to level via pve to be able to engage successfully in rvr combat. given that every level is essentially an eq hell level,people tend to burn out between 40-45 because it stops being fun and enjoyable and turns into a mindless experience grind. <br>
<br>
by the time you might hear of an enemy force raiding your keeps,they have already taken them. its impossible to set up an adiquate defense,without wasting countless hours of time defending an area that wont be attacked. given the fact that a group of 8-16 high level players can take any keep but the relic keeps in the game,it removes any incentive to defend keeps,as they can strike at there own time. <br>
<br>
until mythic realizes that they have to focus more on player interaction between realms,things wont change. even darkness falls doesnt change things alot. yes keeps switch hands,but only to give once realm access when nessicary. <br>

theres roughly 1300 people on my server during primetime,even with the realm bias,theres probably at most 15% who actually interact with each other. of the other 85% theres probably alot who would want to do so,but they really have no means of doing so successfully,so either get frustrated,or just dont bother.<br>

<br>
FYI-  Few groups (mainly Aonian Proficey I believe) did it on my server (Albion/Palomides) months ago.  Huge fuss over it because when it died no loot dropped :O  Tactics for killing it were kickarse but the GMs watching the event thought that was out of the context of how they wanted the battles to go and promptly changed the Dragon's AI.  Don't think anyone on our server has killed the dragon since.  <br>
<br>
From what I remember about posts on the items they were very nice...... but not worth loosing massive amounts of exp for.  Heard one person lost 5 full bubbles at 49th.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

<br>
Fighters were all grouped. They would run in over and over to hit once or twice before they died. Then clerics (who were not grouped with the fighters) would rez the dead and the rezzed would immediately run in again to hit once or twice before dying. <br>
<br>
I read a post from one person who said he died over 100 times.<br>
<br>
All that was changed was that rez now generated agro. <br>
<br>
<br>
Another time players found a bug in the AI regarding charmed creatures. This was the time that no loot dropped (because most of the damage was done by a mob, quite similar to the old bug EQ had...). Basicly the raid used charmed mobs to kill the dragon. Due to a bug in AI when the charmed mob died the agro would not transfer to the charmer.<br>
<br>
The group was awarded the loot that should have dropped and Mythic fixed the bug in the AI.<br>
<br>
Since then I don't believe that the dragons have been killed. Personally I think that seige weapons will be required for this encounter. Also Mythic needs to reduce the lag encountered in large groups.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utlaarasf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TlaaraSF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/29/02 5:45:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2983.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: replies</span><hr size=1> Maiya - &quot;Contrary to popular belief, the endgame isn't all about RvR. Everyone I've met who played to 50 and RvR'd their way to the top 25 in realm points have left the game. I guess they &quot;won&quot; and then proceeded to leave the game out of boredom or sold their characters.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is exactly the point of this idea. To counter the ennui, and to make 45-50 fun.<br>
<br>
The end game consists RvR, Getting loot from DF and your 50th Epic quest, and playing with the Dragon. After your first 50 deaths, you'll probably get bored/frustrated with the Dragon, you'll eventually (and fairly quickly) get the equipment you want. all that's left is the RvR (as it's the only content in DAoC that is constantly changing)<br>
<br>
The whole point of this suggestion is to add something more fun, and that will stimulate the war in the frontier. (DF is very nice, but most of the 50's I know have &quot;done it&quot; already) <br>
<br>
The main draw of this game is the RvR system, the battlegrounds were a great shot in the arm, and although I think they need one from 36-40 (RRank 2.5 cap) and possibly one for 41-45 (RRank 3.0 cap) having a battleground for the 46+ folks would kill the original frontier (not a bad thing, I just don't think Mythic would go for it)<br>
<br>
As far as this being difficult to code, Mythic has most of the tools in place already to create these mission zones. The idea is essentially based on the existing engine (Quests, Items, Porting) The only thing that isn't in the game is the ability to open Milegates on completion of a mission sub goal. (And I don't believe that would be all that hard)<br>
<br>
Also, the addition of one more Point Currency, I do not believe will confuse the players who are able to participate in these missions.<br>
<br>
Saiya: &quot;The problem with any content, RvR or PvE is that players will devour it faster than Mythic can create it. Good content takes time to build and only moments to explore and conquer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Exactly, no mission would be exactly alike (different attackers, defenders create a huge number of variables) thus your content is always changing.<br>
<br>
Saiya: &quot;Some of the PvP additions Mythic really needs to add includes:<br>
<br>
A dueling arena, where players from all three realms can compete one on one against each other with no realm point exchange.&quot;<br>
<br>
This would be fun, but what would it accomplish?<br>
<br>
&quot;A better informational system for knowing when a keep is under seige. It's very difficult to defend keeps without having someone stationed at each keep watching. This leads to people having twinks waiting in the keeps for would-be attackers. Some early warning system such as when the keep is under attack Rank 2 and up players get messages stating such&quot;<br>
<br>
Absolutely, I saw a great post at the vault network dev board regarding this, I'll repost/post the link if anyone requests it, but essentially it was about making keeps work as a &quot;radar&quot; network for informing players where the enemy was and what numbers they had.<br>
<br>
&quot;Extra RPs for defending. If you're in the &quot;zone&quot; area of a keep your realm controls and kill an attacker, you get 25% bonus RPs. There's a real problem with getting people to defend keeps because they want phat RPs. Well, give them some added incentive to stay near the keep and defend from attackers.&quot; <br>
<br>
I like this A LOT <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Finally, the comments about keeps being too easy to take, it all depends on the amount of defenders. With no defenders, yes absolutely. Siege Equipment (except Rams) are seldom if ever used and instead the Zerg comes into play. Possibly with an early warning system, that might make the zerg easier to defend against. <br>
<br>
Finally, another idea on keeps would to make horse routes for your home frontier, and make horses killable by arrows and spells <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Defenders can quickly sortie (provided no enemy has taken over the keeps on the route)<br>
<br>
I'd like to thank all the posters for the feedback so far <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I like the more warning about keeps under siege, however a rapid warning system that is 100% reliable might be a little much<br>
<br>
try this, an NPC rogue courier at each keep.<br>
When the keep comes under attack the rogue heads out for the nearest friendly keep to spread word of the attack.<br>
<br>
We get a notice if and only if he makes it.<br>
