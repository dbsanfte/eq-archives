I agree that after the life has been started that terminating it is wrong.  Hell, i'm adopted.  imagine how that works out.  <br>
<br>
I know its not a disease but there is simpy the fact that there are lots of stupid people doing it.  There ought to be a way to prevent them from having children unless they are ready moraly and financaially to support them.  how many babies are born now that are left to die because either their mother didnt want it or was too doped up/wasted to remember to feed/nuture it.  Some people shouldnt have kids.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying that having kids is bad,  Children are a great thing.  Its just that there should be a way to monitor it so that the child that is born has a chance at life.  and addien.  I agree that giving teens free reign to have sex is stupid.  making it so that they were unable to have children till they were ready, would simply be for those who decided to ignore their own moral compass and their parents instructions.  That way if teens acually went out and had sex *oh no.. who would ever thing that they did that* the child that resulted wouldnt be forced to live a difficult life simply because their parent was stupid..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaidden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asst.

<br>
There is. Its called not having sex. Or making damn well sure that if you do, pregnancy is not an option.<br>
<br>
My whole point is made within your statement (twice now) Not having sex is never an option to consider, and how dare I or anyone else even bring that up. When we cant even discuss the most basic solution to avoid both unwanted pregnancies, and hence Abortion, then there is no point in arguing the matter.<br>
<br>
But it is simply that simple. Dont engage in the act that causes pregnancy, and you will never have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy. Of course this only applies to children.  Once you are capable of supporting a child and are responsible enough to take care of the child, then if you choose to abort, then it is a matter of convenience. *Discounting medical reasons of course*<br>

I will be the first person to admit that Having sex as a teenager is pretty much what life is all about. I also thank God every day that I was fortunate enough to not get someone pregnant. I was probably the worst offender for not having protected Sex.<br>

Like you said, not having sex is the ultimate responsible choice, but in today's world, as a teenager, that's a myth. Sure, it'd be nice for kids to accept values that make sense, but you'd pass out holding your breath for it. So what is a solution that works for the young ins of today, other than a value system that is nice in theory, but wishful in application. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubledtodeath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bled to Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 5:05:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8763.topic&index=190>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://user.netomia.com/blindedhorse/chibipucca.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Gotta agree with that.

That has always struck me as just slightly hypocritical.  Don't give teenagers the tools they need to understand sex, and birth control but, then expect them to make informed decisions about just those things.<br>

First off you are the only person to bring up sex education, so who are you referring to?<br>
<br>
I am not speaking of education. I am speaking about taking responsibility versus escaping from it. I agreed 100% that preaching abstinence was pointless..<br>
<br>
So whom are you speaking to?<br>
