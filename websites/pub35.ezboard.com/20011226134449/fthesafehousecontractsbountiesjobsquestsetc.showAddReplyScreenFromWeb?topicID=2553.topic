------------------------------<br>
<br>
** Project M Implemented  **<br>
<br>
Tonight we have patched something to the PvP servers that many players have been waiting for. The ability to play that gnoll, orc, or the cute and fuzzy rat. On your character select screen you will notice another button in the upper right part of your screen called &quot;Monster&quot;. Clicking this button will randomly place you in a low-level NPC in a random zone. You will be given full control of the creature to do with it what you like. You may hunt and kill other creatures. You may even attack other players.<br>
<br>
Some things to remember when playing your own personal monster (NPC).<br>
<br>
-You will not be able to interact with players or NPC's other than moving and hitting attack.<br>
-You cannot speak, trade, sell, or do anything else that a player can do.<br>
-You will spawn with normal loot for the monster you are playing and Player Characters will be able to kill you for loot and experience.<br>
-If you are a spell casting monster you might want to take a moment to memorize some spells.<br>
-Once you die, you will return to the character select screen where you may choose to return as another NPC or play your normal character.<br>
-You may gain experience, levels, and skills as this NPC, but once you die, it is all lost. You will need to start over the next time you choose to be a NPC character.<br>
-You can't zone as a monster.  If you try to cross a zone-boarder you will lose your progress and return to the character-select screen.<br>
-Monster PCs (MPCs) can not loot, sell, or gain items.  They only get what they start out with.<br>
<br>
This ability to play a monster is being implemented for PvP servers only as we have no plans to implement non-consensual PvP on a non PvP server.<br>
<br>
However, we are still working with this system.  We may find other ways to implement Project M on the non-PvP servers that are acceptable.  We aren't done looking at the possible uses of this new feature.<br>
<br>
<br>
**  PvP Server Related  **<br>
<br>
- Guards, when seeing PCs in combat, will now attack the one that they like the least (the one with the lowest appropriate faction).  If all the PCs involved are highly regarded (have very high faction) the guards will allow them to resolve their own issues without interfering.<br>
<br>
- Guards should also refrain from attacking PCs that are attacked by pets of any sort.<br>
<br>
- Sullon Zek now has an across the board experience bonus of 20%, and the experience loss on all deaths on Sullon Zek is now 50% less.<br>
<br>
<br>
**  Zone Specific Changes  **<br>
<br>
- Kael now has specific bind locations, located only at the entryways.  This means that binding will only be possible in those areas.<br>
<br>
- Trivial Loot code has been removed from the Stonebrunt Mountains and the Warrens.<br>
<br>
- Added a melee bind location to the dock in Iceclad.<br>
<br>
<br>
**  Bug Fixes  **<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that allowed corpses to get stuck inside walls while creating a phantom corpse at the zone line (on your client only) with which you could not interact.  Now if a corpse ends up in a location that is not 'valid' the corpse will be moved to the 'default coordinates' of the zone.  Also, the /corpse command will now summon your own corpse to you anywhere in the zone as long as that corpse is on the default coordinates.  As a rule of thumb, if you died near a wall and cannot find your corpse where you died, try /corpse before petitioning.<br>
<br>
- Fixed it so that Critical Hit damage messages match the actual damage done.<br>
<br>
- The visible damage bonus modifier on two-handed weapons has been corrected.  The value that was displayed was incorrect, no change has been made to the damage bonus itself.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a language-learning bug on the Firiona Vie Server.  Players will now be train each other up in languages once they train the first point with their guildmaster.<br>
 <br>
<br>
**  Item Changes  **<br>
<br>
- Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon.  Now if the bard has his Epic and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect will take precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used.<br>
<br>
- Cloak of Imperception should now have charges.  You will need to exchange your old one for a new one with your GM within the next five days.<br>
<br>
 Donal's Chestplate of Mourning has unlimited charges again.  You will likewise need to exchange yours should you get an 'out of charges' message when attempting to use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Gameplay/Interface Changes/Additions **<br>
<br>
- We have changed the way the /consider command works and expanded the level range at which players are able to gain experience.  We have added a 'light blue' area between green and blue.  NPCs that used to /consider green but gave experience will now /consider light blue, as well as NPCs of slightly lower level than those greens.  You will always get experience for something that is light blue.  You will not receive experience for greens.  At the same time, by including lower level NPCs in the light blue /consider, we have increased the range of lower level NPCs that will grant experience.  This will be most noticeable for characters of higher level.<br>
<br>
- Added /targetgroupbuff.  Type /targetgroupbuff on to activate, off to turn it off.  When on, all group buff spells you cast will require a target but will affect everyone grouped (and in range) with that target, even if it is not your own group.  When it is off your group buff spells will act normally.  This will only work with group buffs that have a duration, and will not affect heals, portals or change form spells.<br>
<br>
- Added code that will put one item onto your cursor if it won't fit into your inventory due to a cancelled trade or looting items (and other cases).  This will only work if there is not already an item on the cursor.<br>
<br>
- Added code that prevents player characters from dropping coins on the ground.  This should prevent the loss of coins due to accident or scam.<br>
<br>
- Made a modification to the chase camera mouselook code.  Moving the mouse forward or back in this camera view will make the camera move up and down, and the camera also automatically pitches to keep your character in view.<br>
<br>
- You now see the number of hit points you are healed, and you also now see how many hit points you heal when healing others.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Skill Changes **<br>
<br>
- Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level.<br>
<br>
- Foraging and Fishing will now result in a wider variety of items, especially in zones that have unusual items available to forage or fish (such as quest items).  Quest and unique items were too common in zones that had them, often making it hard to use those skills to obtain items such as food and drink.  These quest and rare items will now actually be rarely foraged or fished, as they should have been.  Such items will still be available, even to those with low foraging skills, but they will be more easily found by those who have practiced the skills.<br>

<br>
Do I read this correctly as meaning that if a wizard with ally faction nukes a person with dubious faction the guards in that town will instantly attack the dubious person regardless of if they have even attacked back? If so this is incredibly stupid.  So guards support the random murder of people who con amiable just because a person who cons ally wants to kill them?<br>
<br>
I see this as a great way for a large number of people to be experience killed by grief players if so.  Id rather the guard just attack the first person they witness attacking any person with decent faction.<br>

That wizard won't be ally for long if he kills someone of the same race as the guards are - he will lose faction, no? And if the person he is killing isn't a member of the same race, well, then the guards should indeed support him, or? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/7/01 8:46:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: patch message 11/07/01 (wow!)</span><hr size=1> Its not about realism although I would personally say that a non evil city wouldn't support the random murder of people in good standing with the city just because they happen to like the attacker a tad bit better than they like the person being attacked.<br>
<br>
The issue would in fact be gameplay.  Take this scenario.  A lvl 20 rogue walks into freeport past a group of guards.  A lvl 20 wizard sitting by the guards casts root on the rogue.  Rogue is rooted...<br>
<br>
Current rules...The guards attack the wizard.  However the wizard is free to pvp in the city zone as long as he doesn't try to commit murder under the eyes of the guards but if his target is disliked by the guards they will look the other way when he is attacked.  Fairly reasonable with a few problems.<br>
<br>
New rules if I understand it right...guards say wow wizard_ganker00 thinks your bad you must be a real bad man die now and proceed to slaugher frustrated_rogue00.<br>
<br>
The point is this is essentially a way for people with good faction in a city to cause exp deaths to those with less faction even if their faction is kindly an ally faction person can exp kill them or have the guards assistance in ganking them for their items.  It in no way enhances gameplay and is in fact distinctly negative regardless of if you feel it is realistic or not.<br>
<br>
Also fyi most people who use a bank aren't going to be of the same race as the guards and in velious, nobody is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=emryss>emryss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/7/01 9:49:21 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://personal.cha.bellsouth.net/~drew_ash/images/misc/lotor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: patch message 11/07/01 (wow!)</span><hr size=1> wow, nice ) Maybe now when there are no groups or guildies to play with, I can actually get exp from the few things I CAN solo!

I never read the News Bulletin board, because I like to get news w/o opinions first from news only sites, so I forgot it was here.  Anyways, I think most of the patch was great, but I do have a little problem with the bard skill cap for piercing being increased.  Here's the text from the locked thread I errantly made:<br>
<br>
So now the bard piercing cap is as high as the rogue piercing cap. WTF? Since when are BARDS the master of piercing? I thought this was reserved for rogues who *have* to use piercing. This makes piercing their highest weapon skill by a full 25 points. Their epic is 1hs. Breath of Harmony is 1hs. There is only 1 &quot;end game&quot; bard only piercer. Is there some particular reason that bards should favor piercing? I don't see any RP reason, like knights geting lances, either. Is there something particularly musical about piercing weapons? Were spears the preferred weapon of medeival bards? Was there some work of fantasy literature where a bard used a piercing weapon? <br>
<br>
I don't really mind some bards doing a little more damage, but I do see this as taking something that was unique to the rogue class away. Why not make it 240, to match warriors and make it the best bard skill, and leave 250 to rogues? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usvaratoolbox.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Svara Toolbox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/7/01 10:01:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: patch message 11/07/01 (wow!)</span><hr size=1> yep all in all very nice patch.<br>

If the other person takes it like a man then the attacker gets squashed I believe.  And even if that isn't the case, it makes sense that the guards should assist whoever they like more.  Personally, seems to add much more realistic reaction into the game.<br>
<br>
Interesting their taking all trivial loot code out.  I guess no-one used those zones at all.<br>
<br>
I am happy about the MPCs and only hope they can get it applied to Blue Servers.  I think it'd add excitement to the blue servers for once and allow alot of event style things.  Maybe it'll just be something they can turn on and off for special events.  Wish they'd impliment communication between MPCs of the same races though.<br>
<br>
Woohoo for /con, and I'm sure the druids and shamans are crying tears of joy about now.<br>
<br>
Not a bad patch.  Some things I don't like, but overall good. <p>    --------------------------

<br>
*Just added within the past month<br>
<br>
I may have missed a few here..but do you sense a pattern developing here in regards to how VI seems to view bards when it comes to weapon choices?  All of bard's weapon skills where equal prior to the last melee skill patch.  Why do you think there were so many pissed off bards when piercing got capped at 240 ( 1HS/1HB at 250 ) when the new melee changes went in a few weeks ago?  <br>
<br>
It's because many of the good bard only weapons are piercing.  <br>
<br>

Anyways, I still think that it was nice when rogues had the highest piercing cap.  Sure, it was just a token, and of course I know that bards will never match a rogue's damage output, but it was still a comforting thing.
