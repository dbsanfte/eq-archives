<br>
You can be rest assured that anyone even remotely linked to this will be utterly and completely wiped from the face of Earth if at all possible.<br>
<br>
Today they had a poll that stated that 96% of the American people favored military action and that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 92%</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> would still favor it even if that meant we had to go to war to do it.<br>
<br>
Most of our allies would be sure to assist and I think in the end this will do a number of things that could have a profound effect on the world.<br>
<br>
1. Palestinians ever hoping the US would force Israel to give up land are kidding themselves after yesterday.  There is not a chance in hell America would be seen helping muslims especially radicals that cheer when civilians are killed.  (Even though I doubt they were really cheering what happened...it was probably some lame propoganda piece where they ask do you love Palestine?  *crowd cheers*).  Couple that with the fact that Israel sent over its most trained rescue teams to assist within a matter of HOURS and that they are the only &quot;allies&quot; to the west in that entire region that is not built on a tenuous and ever threatened alliance (like Saudi Arabia).<br>
<br>
2. If and when we take out whoever was responsible expect some sort of response.  Though when you think about it after Reagan bombed the crap out of Lybia all the sudden Kadafi shut up real quick even though he is surely a player behind the scenes and then Iraq and the fact that he is limited and the country is in ruin.<br>
<br>
3. This will also in the end spark a huge economic revival as the government will start spending on military again and all the resultant effects that has on the economy which will in turn spark economic growth in the troubled European and Asian markets as well much like the situation in Iraq which caused an economic boon that lasted almost 10 years here in America.<br>
<br>
Yesterday was a day to be frightened...today is a day to mourn...tomorrow is a day to be outraged... <p><br><table border="0" align="left">

I don't really have anything to say on this.  My heart still aches and I still have a very empty feeling that keep me from putting my thoughts into words.<br>

<br>
I would like to bring up another point real quick after todays events at my university. <br>
<br>
Walking in the commons area of the university I witnessed people of American and African American descent taunting an Arabic student and generally putting the responsibility on him for the happenings of yesterday. This .. well sheer ignorance is seriously the LAST thing we need. For the love of @#%$ do not start blaming people for this just because of their ethnicity. Everyone is feeling anger right now and directing it towards our friends/neighbors just weakens us, which is exactly what the terrorists want. <br>
Remember these people are the same as you and I and just because a few members of their ethnic group took it upon themselves to commit this heinous crime does not make them at any way responsible... they care just as much as we do believe me. My lab partner is from Afghanistan and he organized a candle light walk tonight. <br>

This event is an outrage, there should not be any decent person in the world to cheer this catastrophe (sp).  For any life to be lost is comepletely outragous and not called for.  Whowever performed this deed is not human, they are animals and we shall hunt them as such dispose of them in such that matter.  that is the justice that will be levied upon them.  This will not be an act of vengence but of justice.  America was atked the other day. Not an act of terrorism but of war.  These were not military targests per sya but innocent civilians being targeted for extermination....it is time to take the gloves off, we have been civil with uncivil people for years and years...granted sometiems misdirected but we have tried to conduct ourselves civilly...every human being is capable of both good and evil to an extent of large degree.  i would only hope that we dont respond in an evil fashion but in a justified fashion. <br>
<br>
the Middle East is for the most part 3rd world coountry and unfortunatly most of the money spent there is for military means.  of course as of yet we have not concluded who all was involved but these people have had to organized somewhere....i know they didnt do this in the air our out in space....that means a country KNOWINGLY harbored them.....also though i am sure that most of this was funded with money gained through oil and gas sold to America, another fact i hate to admit is i bet whoever trade them was trade by us....also they prob us american made equipement to achieve what means to conduct this.....we have fed this fire for years in the hopes we could keep it contained but no longer.....reacting against this is part of the solution the other part is stop the spawning of people who do these things...ONly one option to stop the acquistion of the resources to conduct these acts.....stop the money, stop the weps stop the food.....without food they cant find, without money they cant acquire resources...without the resources they cant do $#!*.....well anyway wanted to voice my words, most of thsi is not specualtion but pure observation.....granted these poeple will be brought to justice, but we must the the behavior and resources that allows these people to train and conduct these acts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urazoreyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Razor Eyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/13/01 4:34:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm.</span><hr size=1> Should be interesting to see how many people in the Middle East will die for 20, 000+ @#%$-loving Americans dying.

Iraq suffered 1.2 million confirmed (by the UN) casualties as a direct result of US sanctions, nuclear weapons (uranium), and damage inflicted on their support structure,  among other things. 2500-10000 of those are estimated to be soldiers.<br>
