Back then I still enjoyed playing this game. I cant seem to find that enjoyment anymore. I miss all the friends I made back then. I miss the pure joy of this game. My memories are all that I have left and I hope all of you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed playing Bikbuz for the last 2+ years.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Bikbuz was born in the underclass of Akanon. His family did not have much money and he lived poorly. His father was a guard back then. Even though the Watchmen of Akanon protected the city and died for thier king, they were not paid much. They only recived 15pp a year, not counting the 10pp sign on bonus. They were able to loot what ever they could off corpses of the monsters they felled. This was a main source of income for his family. <br>
<br>
His mother was, and still is, a baker. Her wears were sold in the main market of Akanon, but not many bought her muffins and pies. The adventurers that came into Akanon all bought bread and water from the mecha merchants at the gates of the fair city. Few ever made thier way down to the market with food in mind after passing the bread. Though a few did. Those few became her best customers. They bought her muffins, meat pies, bat-wing crunchies and other assorted items she made. <br>
<br>
Although Bikbuz was not a rich gnome, he was comfy in his little home. He learned the art of war from his father to one day become a guard like himself. His mother taught him her trade so one day he might take over her buisness and the few kind souls that bought her food would keep coming back. <br>
<br>
Then the stronger adventurers came. They had no interest in the fair city of Akanon. His father had recived a few raises and gained the honor of guarding the front gate itself. His job was enjoyable, seeing young gnomes run off to smite evil and pour forth good into the world. <br>
<br>
It was a warm day. His father talked with his fellow guardsman and shared some bat-wing crunchies his wife had made. Suddenly, his friend was ensnared! Bikbuz's father drew forth his short sword and look out-twards the wilder part of Steamfront. There, clad in a blue robe, was a necromancer, his pet charging head-long twards him and his friend. He glances around and saw a mage as well. There was the one who snared his friend. <br>
<br>
Bikbuz's father, Linbud, met the necromancers pet head on. The thing was a grusome sight. Old bones held together by magical energy. How he wished he was gnomish paladin. He shruged off the thought and hacked into the thing. His partner was blasted by the magicial energeys of the two foul casters. Linbud glanced past the two and almost cheered. Halv was coming. Watchman Halv tore into the two casters. His Fine-steel two-handed sword hacking off a good part of the necromacer. <br>
<br>
Linbud and his friend soon finished off the pet and charged twards the two casters Halv was battling. Out of the ground came a earth elemental. The mage pet smashed its fist into his fellow guards face, crushing it and killing him. Linbud twirled and snatched up his fallen short sword and duel-wielded them. He soon laid into the pet. The mage, not liking this, blasted Linbud back. He was stunned. The pet kept rooting him and he could not get away. He hacked into the clod of dirt, hoping to damage it enough. <br>
<br>
SOon, a small gathering of younger gnomes can to watch. They could help. The Gods had forbid them to attack other Adventures and they could not help him with any healing magics. Halv cleaved off the necromancers head and laid into the mage pet. The mage was running low on mana and he was worried. Once again magic blast into Linbud. And he sunk down. Linbud was to tired to fight on. The foul mage smiled and blasted Linbud into oblivion. Halv finished off the mage pet and charged after the mage, tears flowing from his eyes. This day would not be forgotten. <br>
<br>
*edit* <br>
<br>
Halv came back to the two fallen guards bodies. A young gnome knelt next to Linbuds corpse. Halv knew it to be Bikbuz, Linbuds young son. He walked up to Bikbuz and placed a hand on his shoulder. Bikbuz looked up at Halv and lept into the guards strong arms. Bikbuz cried. <br>
<br>
Halv supported Bikbuz and his mother. Bikbuz decided being a Watchman was not his destiny. He was ment for...something else. The guard killings soon became worse. Younger gnomes were unable to flee back to the guards for protection if they got in over thier bald heads. The King could only replace the guards daily. He had no idea what to do about the infidels attacking his fair city. <br>
<br>
Halv was slain during a raid of minotaur slavers, lead by thier hero. A foolish young gnome had gone to deep into the cave and fled for his life to the guards, dozens of minotars on his tail. <br>
<br>
Bikbuz and his mother fell on hard times. He got work around town, but not enough to pay for thier needs. His mother was getting to old to keep selling her food stuffs to the good adventures that still came into Akanon. Bikbuz was worried. What would he do? He could not support his mother and younger brother. He would have to find a way. Some how. <br>
<br>
LAte one night, Bikbuz was staring over the waterfall into the stone, seeking answers. A hand claped down on his shoulder and he looked up in shock. The figure moved back. He smirked at Bikbuz and patted twin dirks at his side. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye best not try yer luck boy. Ye would not do ta good.&quot; The figure said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are ye and what da ye want wit me?&quot; Said Bikbuz, his tone foul. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have a deal for ye Bikbuz, one that will let ye and yer family live well fer the time bein. Long as ye keep yer part..&quot; The figure said. <br>
<br>
Bikbuz looked at the gnome curiously. &quot;Alright, ye have a deal..whatever it tis..&quot; <br>
<br>
The man smiled and held a hand out to Bikbuz. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye will be a welcome addition ta the Shadows boy-o-mine.&quot; the man stated. <br>
<br>
Bikbuz only nodded, and followed. <br>
