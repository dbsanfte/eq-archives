So, we sit there in the empty camp and another wave of grimlings come in and we kill them. This happens about 15-20 more waves and still no officer that he was talking about has showed up. We just let him die and went on to explore deeper in.<br><br>This leads me to believe the officer is a random spawn in the waves of the grimlings. That, or the quest is broken. Probably the first option though.<br><br>btw, the trick to keeping him alive is simple: just hit every grimling that comes in with the wave once or twice and they'll aggro on you and not him.

Hint: you can /assist the scout, and if you stay alert you can put yourself between the charging grimlings and the Scout so they agro on you and not him.<br><br>I found out tho that the real beginning of this is to talk to one of the VahShir.. Captain someone, on a porchfront with a Scout.  The captain says 'help out scouts Hamus, Darrin, and Dxxx(I forget) and then put their rewards in a Chest Of Valor and give it to me for more instructions'.  Well, thats the gist of it.  So 3 miniquests later (and innumerable dead grimlings later) I put the three medals (copper, silver lined copper, and gold lined copper) into a chest of Valor and hit Combine to end up with a Soldier's Chest.  Giving that to the Captain gets me instructions to gather 'two dozen people as strong as myself' and then hand in the map so he can lead the way.<br><br>this together with clues from the General's text makes me think that I would eventually get a Copper Medal of the Vah'Shir or somesuch, then upgradeable to Silver and Gold, which I could turn in to the General for the key.

Are you here to serve in the war against the grimling horde? <br>You say, 'yes i am here to serve in the war'<br>General Staginar says 'As you probably know, we've been battling the grunts for nearly a generation now. They have proven to be a challenging opponent. We've inflicted great casualties upon their kind in this war, yet somehow, they seem to grow even more numerous. Barring some miracle, they will become a serious threat to Shar Vahl very soon. One remaining strategy has a chance of bringing us victory, but none have met the requirements for its implementation. <br>You say, 'what are the requirements?'<br>General Staginar says 'Our intelligence has provided us with some information about the enemy. They blindly follow a being they refer to as 'the master'. Our high spiritists have sensed a powerful presence from the caverns beyond our mines, but only those who possess a special key can venture there. None who have obtained the key and ventured into the caverns have been seen alive again. <br>You say, 'where can i get the key?'<br>General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander holds half of a magical acrylia obelisk that will transport the wielder to their master's stronghold. I have slain the high commander who held the other half of the obelisk and I have the knowledge of it's construction. I will only give it to one who has proven to be a powerful soldier, for nothing less would stand a chance against the enemy ruler. <br>You say, 'what high commander?'<br>General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander will only appear if their compound to the north is overrun. There are two encampments near the compound that will need to be invaded as well in order to secure the area. It is a very complex mission and I will only authorize you to lead it if you have demonstrated competence. Serve our people by successfully completing the lesser raids here in the forest. Bring me the Golden Medal of the Shar Vahl as proof of your prowess, or, if you are already at least as powerful as I am, there is another test that will give me confidence in your abilities. <br>You say, 'what other test?'<br>General Staginar says 'If you are less experienced than I am, performing this task will gain you nothing. With that in mind, take this box and venture through the mines and into the caverns. Combine in it Gooplart's tooth, Gizgargank's scalp, Grikplag's skull, Gnildaria's eye, Gnerpokkel's heart, Gilgaplank's toes, the husk of the summoned burrower, and the shackles of a Vah Shir captive. Return to me with the Box of the Hero of Shar Vahl and I will send a team of our veterans to escort you into battle.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>You receive a container (cannot remember the name of the box exactly). This container has 8 slots, one for each piece.<br><br>Behind the building with the general is a perch with a an imprisoned grimling.

Hurry, locks change soon!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>You receive a forked key (cannot quite remember the name). The key is lore, no rent and no drop.<br><br>I thought about getting the items General Staginar talked about in the Caves leading to the Acrylia Caverns - some semi named up, lots of runes dropped but no notable item except one grimling toes who aren't even no drop. Farmed the Caves for 2 hours, then we moved into Acrylia Caverns. No single grimling outside in GW saw invis and no grimling inside does. So it is rather safe to roam there.<br>Beware: Mobs (30% SKs) level 42 and up, resulting in multiple 600+ HTs can turn this cakewalk quickly into a nightmare. AC strips levitate buffs and you cant levitate inside. Do NOT try to CoH in AC - this will result in a grimling hero spawning that is reported to be lvl 57 (I cannot confirm that but I didn't try) and the 'spell not working in this zone' message.<br>Spawn time is around 8 minutes I believe (didn't time it but it is short) so you better be moving forward while rolling through the zone - agro range of the grimlings at lvl 60 is rather short so you could squeeze through at some point.<br>Rather small, boring zone with 3 exceptions: <br>a) A kind of summoning circle that spawns (or rather shows) grimlings around it when you enter it - those are illusions I think because they don't have names and disappear as soon as you leave the circle.<br>b) A waterfilled cavern with fishes inside (don't see invis) and a 'Summoned Hatchling' ('Sandwurm/Shai-Hulud' model) that cant be targeted. Dropping invis does not produce results, cavern is surrounded by grimlings, some of them 'grimling summoners' (summoned the hatchling perhaps?) which are nowhere else to be found.<br>c) A kind of ruined temple area with grimlings and 'a possessed corpse' (vah shir skeleton) - some of those skeletons are casters and see invis, all possessed corpses seem to be around lvl 46 SKs. A large stair which leads to a closed drawbridge like castle front (drawbridge is not a door and closed) and a large room with a lava pool in the middle - you cannot get out if you fall in so watch out.<br>Here is where the interesting part starts. To the left of the large room is a door which leads to another locked door - if you use the key you got from the imprisoned grimling you find the imprisoned vah shir.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  You say, 'Hail, Trondol Shir'<br>Trondol Shir looks around frantically, 'What are you doing here? You'll be killed! Do not waste your time trying to help me. Save yourself and leave at once!' <br>You say, 'i will help you'<br>Trondol Shir shakes his head in frustration, 'I am beyond help. The key to my shackles is held by the grunts' high priest, curse him. I feel his dark magic pulling at my soul. I am doomed to join the legion of our fallen people that serve their twisted master here. <br>You say, 'what key?'<br>Trondol Shir opens his mouth as if to speak, but lacks the strength to form words. <br>You say, 'what high priest?'<br>Trondol Shir Trondol speaks slowly between shallow, labored breaths, 'Through some kind of dark magic, the grunts steal away the spirit energy from their victims. I know not what they do with this energy once they procure it. When the victim is all but drained of life, the high priest forces them to walk to the end of the platform over there. He then performs some sacrificial ritual that hurls the prisoner into the pit. Shortly thereafter, the bones of the fallen are collected and reanimated, destined to serve the grunts forever. I have seen this a dozen times now, and now my time is near.' </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>I suppose you get the shackles the general requested from Trondol Shir if you free him. The lava pool is surrounded by other non targetable grimlings and there is a 'plank' leading out above the lava from a room which is accessed by a door on the opposite side of the large room.<br>Inside is a grimling priest (actually I believe talking to Trondol Shir made additional priests spawn on the exact spot - priests conned blue to lvl 60) who is again not targetable and 4 possessed corpse. I could not kill the corpses solo (left my team out because we had no inviser) and the priest didnt react to my presence if deinvised. The 'plank' which will lead the captured Vah Shir to their fiery fate is reported to have an irresistible trap and will hurl you in the lava - I didn't confirm that though.<br><br>I suppose you somehow need to trigger the ceremony to have a chance to kill the priest and free the captured cat - the key to free Trondol Shir should be dropped by the priest. Handing the key to Trondol will result in him giving you the key back.<br><br><br>I will return later tomorrow and try other ways to free Trondol.

You need to combine the three medals you receive (gold, silver, copper) in the chest of valor (purchased at the merchant), and give it to the captain.  He then gives you a map of the grimling forest (I couldnt read it though, tried for about 20 minutes, clicking on the darn thing), and says to return the map to him when you are ready for battle.  The awesome part, is that he asks for TWENTY FOUR people to come.  Stupid me, I didnt turn my log on, but I took screenshots of his text.  Btw, I did the scout quests with myself (60 war), 59 sk, 59 druid, and 56 shaman.  The SK and shaman pets work extremelly well, as they aggro on anything around (having them sit helps more).  So anyways, once I figure out how many people Im going to do this with, I return the map to the captain, and he leads me on a raid against the grimling main fort (Im thinking the one in front of the acrylia cave entrance).

Our lvl 60 Cleric/SK tag team had trouble handling them, make sure you got enough physical stunning power because some of them cannot be stunned by spells.<br>We haven't quite figured out if the metalworker is a PH of some sort (killed around 18 of them without a named spawning): Other notable mobs are the three grimling foremen roaming the entrance area as well as the both grimling guardians beside the entrance to the Acrylia Caverns. We are convinced that they are not important (killed a lot of foremen and some guardians to check) but they may as well be - need more raw killing numbers to confirm that for good.<br><br>The fifth drop we had was from Corpseraiser Gilgaplank inside the Acrylia Caverns:<br><img src="http://www.bilderservice.de/ISROOT/Bilderservice/Thumbs/15825/819-s6codbd28630acjxmeaw2wuops3a48cap11oty3p-3c16ca57-t3.jpg"><br><br>He spawns near the 'cage' with the possessed corpse in the middle of the room - the picture should give you a hint there.<br>He seems to not have a semi named PH which poses a problem: The sixth quest item drops off of a named grimling for sure and we are convinced that Gooplart spawns inside the Acrylia Caverns.<br><br>The other two quest parts should be tied to the summoned hatchling in the underwater cavern and the cat captive near the lava pool with the sacrificial party.<br>We killed the two 'grimling summoner' standing above the pool leading to the hatchling for quite some time today to maybe get a rare drop off of them (which could be the husk) or in case they are the PH for a named summoner - the hatchling in the cavern has been summoned which could point to one of the mobs there having the husk.<br><br>About the captive: We can get to him but we cannot seem to trigger his release or sacrifice - so another thought could be that the captive drops the shackles himself (herself?!). I pulled him to the zone (he cons green and hits for 177 max) and we tried to kill him. At 30% health this happened:<br><i>Trondol Shir hits YOU for 79 points of damage.<br>You crush Trondol Shir for 36 points of damage.<br>Trondol Shir says 'My comrades will avenge my death.'<br>You must target an NPC to taunt first.<br>You have been healed for 2382 points of damage.<br>You are completely healed.<br>...<br>...<br>You begin casting Locate Corpse.<br>You don't sense any corpses.</i><br>He could have poofed in the wall I pushed him into but I doubt that. He was not in his cell when I checked shortly after - maybe he is scripted to return or poof after a certain amount of time (already pulled him on top of the high priest) and it was an awfully long fight. We will try again to kill the captive tomorrow (although I doubt he drops the shackles - for sure death would save him from the grisly fate he is about to meet but this is a tad hard).<br><br>Another notable thing revolves around the ritual circle in the caverns:<br><i>As you step into the grimling's ring of fire, a hot breeze blows into the cavern and begins swirling about you. The grimling's constant chanting seems to grow louder... </i><br>At this point I charged the warder who spawned in the hallway leading to the circle.<i><br>a grimling warder says 'A fine sacrifice you make! Say hello to the master! <br>a grimling warder says 'It's Dark Elves like you who have ruined your own lands. You'll not ruin mine!'<br>Your shadows fade.<br>A grimling warder hits YOU for 106 points of damage.<br>a grimling warder shouts 'Master!

He returns you a map (which didnt seem to be a map) and when you give it back to him, he starts to walk to a grimling camp, just like the scout quests.  Now I had done all 3 with me (55 sk), a 55 chanter, and 56 ranger with no problems.  So I figured we could handle this one as well.  Well it turns out that you meet up with a second vashir officer along the way.. and the captain tells you that you need to split up your group, and the stronger force stay with him. DOH!!!<br><br>With only 3 ppl there was really no way to do this.  We let the officer go on alone with the hope that he wasn't necessary for the quest.  We whiped out the camp that the Captain took us too fairly easily, but the officer was killed...<br><br>As soon as we finished clearing the camp, and the Captain went to his spot, he said something about the officer being killed and now we have no chance... and promply poofed, ending my quest.  So be forewarned, you will need 2 groups to do this part.<br><br>So I tried the alternate method... went for the body parts that the general has.  Ranger tracked down the named to the caverns before the zone to Acrylia Caverns.  Some Overseer.. con light blue.  Single pulling was easy.  5 seconds later we were on CR.  Sucker hits for 180 and very very fast.  He also summons.  As do the rest I imagine.  Later we came back with a slower and a cleric and he was easy once slowed.   We got 2 of the named... Overseer, and a Sorceress.  I have not been able to find the rest, but have heard that they all spawn in that area.  Im going to return sometime and kill all of the grims in there to find the rest of the spawns.  <br><br>Still have no idea about the summoned burrower or shackles... I'm thinking it may be easier just to do the scout/captain quests again with a few more ppl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueeep.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eeep</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/11/01 11:18:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3430.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scout Quests...</span><hr size=1> Possesor is at that back of a camp of grimlings around a campfire .. its the first one if you follow wall on right.
