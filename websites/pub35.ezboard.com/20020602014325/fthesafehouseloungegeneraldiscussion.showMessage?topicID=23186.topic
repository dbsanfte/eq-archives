Some really good stuff in that thread, but you had to wade through a lot of Flame to find it .... I see no need to re-open that old wound, so I'll start a new thread and we can all just 'Get Along'.  I direct the post at Brik Bludgaard who seemed to know what he was talkin about, however I welcome anything relevant from anyone who may have it.  I'm here to get educated on the Rules and Possiblities .... not have my spelling corrected, save that crap for yer highschool pals .... d00d.<br><br>(LOL, if that ain't askin for trouble .... I dunno what is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>Heyas Brik,<br><br>It would appear that you are just the Troll I need to talk to.<br><br>My issue is bad VS faction .... not a big issue for most, but for a 52 DE SK looking to start his Epic .... a very big deal. I've read the spoiler and I know that I can Ninja in around the side and talk to the guy who initiates my Epic without having every other mob in the Outpost go absolutely ape-shi .... well, you know. I also know I can live without a Workers Sledge Mallet .... but like my oldest daughter is so fond of telling me, <br><br>&quot;I dun wanna.&quot;<br><br>I knew about the Kunark Dragon fix .... not an option for me at this time. So I read, and searched, and read, and pounded my friends (like all 4 of em) with hours of silly questions, and read, and cursed the very foundations of Karnors Castle, and read, and wondered why Verant put all of my really nice toys in KC, and read .... my wife threatened to divorce me if I mentioned anything to her about it ever again, so I just made a new SK. That lasted about 33.5 lvl's.<br><br>With the help of 2 of my friends (the other 2 are dumb as a box of hammers), a carton of smokes and 6 pots of coffee .... we managed to get 3 ideas to survive the common sense test. We used the term 'common sense' in the loosest of all possible forms, and we dun really call the ideas 'Bright' .... they are simply not as 'Dim' as most of our other ideas:<br><br>Not-So-Dim-Idea #1. Amulet of Necropotence .... anyone can right click this baby in general inventory and POOF, yer a skelly.<br><br>Problems: People want enough money for one of these to warrant an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. Some people say that it boosts factions with Evil-Types, some say it doesn't at all .... no way for me to confirm it.<br><br><br>Not-So-Dim-Idea #2. Get a big Necro from Rent-A-Friend (I have a necro friend -one of the hammer twins- but he's too little) and duel him. Have him use the DoT that turns the target into a skelly for a short period of time.<br><br>Problems: This one didn't really survive the common sense test .... we just thought it was way cooooooll and would be a lot of fun. I could only survive something like 90 seconds of this, no one can heal you if you're dueling, weren't sure if I could even open a trade window while dueling, and once again .. no idea if the skelly form actually gave a positive boost to evil-type-factions. <br><br>&quot;Here it comes brotha, you ready ?&quot;<br><br>&quot;DoT me Suckah!!!!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aight, casting.&quot;<br><br>&quot;OOOooOOOooOOWWWWwwwWWWwwwww!!!!!!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Start runnin man!!&quot;<br><br>&quot;OOOOOOWWWwwwwwwwww ....&quot;<br><br>&quot;DUDE, the other way .. the Outpost is THE OTHER WAY!!!&quot;<br><br>&quot;oooooowwwwWWWWWWWWWWW!!!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Crap ... stop ... I gotta refresh it ...&quot;<br><br><br>Not-So-Dim-Idea #3. Get a big Enchie from Rent-A-Friend (I have a big Enchie friend -1 of my 2 reasonably intelligent friends- he told me to go f..... well, he said 'no') and have him try to charm Rotgrime so I could turn in braids.<br><br>Problems: Finding someone to pull Rotgrime. Finding a rez for me after we couldn't find anyone to pull him and I had to do it. No idea if you can open a trade window with a charmed mob and my Enchie friend absolutely refused to have anything more to do with what he called, &quot;The DUMBEST idea since Disco.&quot; .... so we couldn't test it. We're not even sure if Rotgrime is charmable .... we asked my big Enchie friend if he knew .... he called us &quot;Morons of the Highest Order&quot; and logged.<br><br><br>I discovered earlier tonite that SK's get an Illusion-Skelly-type spell at 58, maybe at 55 as well .... atleast on the test server anyway. No idea when or even if they will go live on the main servers .... and, once again, no idea if it adjusts evil-type-factions in the direction I want it to go in.<br><br>I'm only at Threateningly with the Outpost, but as we all know .... thats enough to make a Goon want to inspect yer internal organs. My main problem with the Kunark Dragon approach is finding a guild on E-Marr that raids em and doesn't want me to already be lvl 60 with my Epic and all resists over 100 unbuffed .... &lt;shruggs&gt; I'm sure they're out there, I just can't find em.<br><br>Anyway, lemme know what you think Brotha-Brik.<br><br>Incursus Nocturna<br>Knight of the Shadows<br>52nd Circle of Hate<br>E-Marr<br><br>&quot;Incursus points at you.

You starting factoin is composed of you race, your class and then your religion. Any of these three can change your starting faction and when your race is changed by an illusion it temperarily changes your base faction base. In your case I doubt that skelly's or earth ele's are more liked than your natural DE base would be. Illusion skelly will help out for a high elf or barbarian who they don't like because of thier race but I doubt it would help you at all.<br><br>The 4th component of faction is the one we're trying to fix here and thats the modifier that stored that makes up your positive and negative faction adjustments from things you've done.<br><br>Charming is an option for you on this one. There have been a couple threads about bards doing that. A lvl 60 enchanter with dictate would porbably be a good thing to try this with since you get 48 seconds of charm with out it breaking.<br><br>Another option is that there is an amulet that drops in icewell that has 5 charges of alliance and can be usedby anyone. Since you are only threatening you could probably camp or purchase one of these and use it to get your faction high enough to do turn ins. Then just turn in enough braids to be non kos with out the faction spell. The faction boost from the spell lasts until you zone/log/etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umony.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mony</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.idiom.com/~mony/gifs/frog.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/02 12:27:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23186.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can you do the turn in Feign Death?</span><hr size=1> One day in Howling Stones did what seven levels in KC couldn't do: <br><br>Made me KoS to the outpost in my DE illusion with my faction song working. <p><center><img src=http://www.idiom.com/~mony/gifs/kyenasig3.jpg><br>Bard of the 53rd Song<br><a href=http://pub33.ezboard.com/btriadofhonor>Triad of Honor</a><br>Mithaniel Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uprodigious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prodigious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/02 12:30:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23186.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Outpost Faction .... &lt;slaps Verant&gt;</span><hr size=1> i want an OT gate hammer bad and after tons of kunark dragon kills i'm still scowling....really sucks there's no way to raise it other than the braids. i've thought about maybe pulling the captain to skyfire then zoning, and zoning back in....sneak up on him and turn in. risky though. <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21797">Veteran Prodigious</a><br>Assassin<br>Fennin Ro</font><br><img src="http://prod.homepage.dk/pics/1106bs.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upatofnaud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>patofnaud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/02 1:34:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23186.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Outpost Faction .... &lt;slaps Verant&gt;</span><hr size=1> Get backpacks of the braids, inviz in, FD at his back, break inviz, hand em all in and hope you get back enough faction to be able to stand back up and leave. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uincursusnocturna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Incursus Nocturna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/02 1:59:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23186.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Outpost Faction .... &lt;slaps Verant&gt;</span><hr size=1> Did a test with the FD trade .... the NPC's now tell you that they are busy if you try to open a trade window with them while you are FD'd <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br><br>Curse<br><br>P.S.
