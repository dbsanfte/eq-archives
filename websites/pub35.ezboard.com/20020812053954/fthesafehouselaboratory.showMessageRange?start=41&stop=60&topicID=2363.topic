<br>
I do not think that Apply Poison only applies to the application of that poison on a weapon.  If they modified that percentage with Apply Poison playin' a significant role, then the whole process would be interestin' and the AA Poison Mastery would definitely be useful.<br>
<br>
It also means that if it is truly proc buffin', then it should be absolutely no problem for Rogues to &quot;poison&quot; other people's weapons.  If they do that and base it on the Apply Poison skill, then that could mean that other classes may have a default % in which it kicks in whereas Rogues have that percentage affected by the Apply Poison skill.  <br>
<br>
What I mean is this.  Take a enchantresswho has her piercer poisoned. You can have the results based on <br>
<br>
A) Default % of &quot;proc&quot; since they didn't apply the poison<br>
<br>
B) A 1/4 or 1/3 value of the Rogue who applied the poison's Apply Poison added to that default %<br>
<br>
Whereas a Rogue who applies his/her poison to his/her weapon will have maybe 1/2 or a whole value added to that default %.  That would certify that Rogue's are TRULY the masters of poisonin'.  It would be how like other classes use arrows well but nowhere as near as Rangers and so on.<br>
<br>
It just has so many possibilites.<br>

<br>
However, farming components for these poisons again and again is going to get old fast =(<br>
<br>
I only wish they made the potions unlimited charges but requiring a reagent in inventory to cast.<br>
<br>
For example, to apply liquid silver to your weapon you need a zombie skin, or a stack of zombine skins etc.. in your bag that are not consumed, but it wont cast if you dont have the reagents in inventory. <br>
<br>
This makes it so you have to at least get the reagents once, but then you dont have to keep going back after you have :<br>
<br>
a) combined all the proper components into your Poison Vial and created the final product with the Effect<br>
<br>
b) kept a required reagent(s) in inventory while applying this poison<br>
<br>
If they make them 1 shots that you have to farm constantly and fill up your bags for it, well, i probly wont put too much effort into it especially considering the resist rate on poison , and the fact that the poison debuffs for necro class check against poison resist to land and agro worse than tash... perhaps if they did a word wide reduction of poison resists much like the velious patch to magic/fire/cold resists, it would be a lot more handy.<br>

<br>
Will be interesting to see if rogue poison will be something that can be handed out to others; because if it is the shammies are gonna go off the deep end because of the absurd utility of those from a large scale perspective.  Not to mention there's gonna be some really busy rogues and poison farming is going to be insane.<br>
<br>

<br>
currently: to do 'standard rogue damage', you show up and backstab. If you want to stand out, you can do the farming greens/making vials thing, and get some nice effects that are situationally useful.<br>
<br>
with this change: to do 'standard rogue damage', you have to fiddle about buying stuff from merchants, right clicking 40,000 times to raise skills, lugging a bunch of components round, whatever. Everyone has to do that, and there is no way for anyone to do any more to stand out.<br>
<br>
Just one more sign that the current EQ team has absolutely no clue as to what makes a game fun and interesting. I _don't want_ powers that makes farming low blues 2% faster. I want skills that make a heroic recovery from a chaotic overpull in a mad dungeon crawl _possible_.<br>
<br>
Reminder to verant: there are users sitting in front of the screen, who need things to do. Taking the decision of when/if to apply poison out of the user's hands and making it a random proc is a big step backwards.<br>

<br>
You're assuming that they would remove the existing poisons.<br>
<br>
There's no reason why poison making can't create both the existing poisons, and new poisons that act as a procbuff.<br>
<br>
I personally think that it would be quite cool to be able to poison my weapons so that it fires more than once.  Or even better, poison a party member's weapons.<br>
<br>
For those who don't want to make poisons, there's this nifty new thing called the bazaar, where people who do make 'em can sell 'em.<br>
<br>
You're correct in assuming that if this goes active, then rogues will more or less be 'expected' to be poisonbuffed.<br>
<br>
How feasible that will be will depend on the availability of the components.<br>

&lt;&lt;This change is just lame. I am boggled that people actually think it is good.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I don't know how you can think it's anythin' but good.  Finally, somethin' to revolutionize the art of poisonin' that is supposed to be one of the definin' traits of bein' a Rogue.  You can't think of anythin' good from it?  I can think of a few.<br>
<br>
1) Multiple poison chances: How many people have invested time and money into a poison, finally made and applied it, get all excited to use that poison only to have it resisted.  All that time seems lost.  In a fight there are times where you DON'T have time to reach for another poison.  A 10 mintue duration means you have 10 minutes to hit more than one creature with a poison as opposed to a one shot 50/50 chance.<br>
<br>
2) Time Consumption: You know how frustratin' it is for some people to have to poison, hit, wait for mob to drop, and then poison again?  Personally I can land at least 3 poisons in a fight but some other people can't.  And when it comes to certain mobs where you can't sit, Applyin' Poison could mean your life as well as others.  10 minutes is 10 minutes of chances.  I'd take that over one dose any day.<br>
<br>
3) AA Skill - Poison Mastery: If this change does occur, Poison Mastery will actually be USEFUL.  When I first saw that we received Poison Mastery I was upset.  I thought Throwin' Mastery would have been more useful considerin' the annoyance of poisonin' at times.  This change will give Poison Mastery a reason to be useful. The point of poison mastery is that you ne'er fail at applyin' a poison, you shave up to 50% of time in application, and reduce the chance of failure in poison makin' by up to 50%.  End result: More poison chances for ev'ryone.<br>
<br>
4) Possibility of Poisonin' Weapons for Others - Imagine that.  With AA Skill it's e'en better.  Goin' around and poisonin' your groups weapons. It can realistically shave a mob down to size.  It can also make battles a lot less intense for mobs with HIGH MR.  Most mobs and PC characters relatively have higher MR than PR because Magic is more expected than poison.<br>
<br>
5) The Deceit Factor - If someone's poisoned in a fight out of nowhere, who are they gonna blame?  I've been a strong believer that Rogues are one of the deadliest classes because a person can ne'er know what to expect from a Rogue.<br>
<br>
 I can go on and on about the positive factors of this change, especially if they keep the old poisons.  The old ones could be used by and for Rogues only while the new ones can be applied to other classes, just like how classes have Self buffs and Group buffs.  I'm really lookin' forward to this. It would make a lot of people happy and it would really change a lot of horizons in EQ.<br>

<br>
1. I don't like the idea of applying for others. This makes rogues in to a walking poison factory for your tanks:<br>
<br>
Tank_1: Hey rogue, apply poison for me. I'm twinked out with 255 DEX so I'm better at landing it then you.<br>
<br>
Nah, I don't think so. I've said it before, if you're going to allow rogues to poison other weapons, then make the Apply Poison skill affect the chance of proccing. <br>
<br>
2. These changes will only help if they are ADDED to the current system, and not in replacement of it.<br>
<br>
Cleric_1: Rogue, slow that mob.<br>
Rogue_1: I'm trying, but my poison won't proc!<br>
Cleric_1: The tank is dead and I am hurting!<br>
Rogue_1: Yay! it finally procced!<br>
<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.<br>
<br>
Someone suggested earlier that by adding an ingredient to all the poison recipes would be what makes them the buff proc as oppose to the first hit type of thing. That would be good, as it gives us more options.<br>
<br>
3. Stackable poisons in your inventory isn't going to happen and shouldn't happen! Assuming these changes go in, a rogue could carry 1 stack of spider venom sacs, 1 stack of vials and 1 stack of suspensions and be &quot;buffed&quot; with Weaken I poison for 150 minutes! Come on. That's great. Add a stack of snake venom sacs and you could &quot;buff&quot; another 150 minutes of Inject I! 300 minutes of &quot;buffed&quot; poisoning with only 4 inventory slots taken up. Please. That rocks as is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessageRange?topicID=2363.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessageRange?topicID=2363.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessageRange?topicID=2363.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessageRange?topicID=2363.topic&start=81&stop=98>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showPrevMessage?topicID=2363.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showNextMessage?topicID=2363.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2363.topic&index=60><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.emailToFriend?topicID=2363.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.threadControl?topicID=2363.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2363.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2363.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory>Laboratory</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
