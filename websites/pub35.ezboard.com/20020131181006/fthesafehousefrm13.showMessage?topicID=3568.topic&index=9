Reward:  Belt of the Khala Dun.  6ac 3str 4wis 2pr 2dr.<br>
<br>
Quest starts with Kalila in the palace.  A girl who is crying on her bed in a room on the first floor of the palace. I don't have the logs... but you get sent around town to gather some items to give to an npc in the shaman guild, Kadaan.... this has to be done because he is on his own faction, and you need to raise the faction.  So there are at least two npcs who will make the potion, which is 'Elixer of Obsession' and id's as 'Drink me'.  At least, that's what the elixer made by kadaan is.  both Kadaan and Hoober request the same ingredients, tho.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Kadaan talked to hoober and got the recipe from him... Behari wanted the potion to give to Kalila (Cat Viagra, maybe).  So he went seeking Hoober in the mountains.....<br>
But Kadaan says that the only way to talk to someone who has become a potion junky is to give them some of the potion.<br>
<br>
Soooooo....<br>
<br>
Drop of Moonlight - astronmer on roof of palace wants a reflective shard from any tinker vendor.  Nearest is in katta. <br>
<br>
Luclin Clover - foraged in Shadeweavers Thicket.  no drop no rent.  yes, no rent<br>
<br>
Essence of Sonnet - This was the coolest part of the quest.  If you don't start the quest with Kelila, you won't get the Essence of Sonnet.  That's all I'm gonna say.<br>
<br>
Soooo ... give them to Kadaan... and he gives you Elixer of Obsession. Id's as Drink me.<br>
<br>
Off to tenebrous mountains.<br>

[Fri Dec 21 03:56:38 2001] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:39 2001] You say, 'Hail, Hoober'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:39 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:39 2001] You say, 'Hail, Hoober'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:40 2001] Hoober snaps his eyes in your direction.  He gestures wildly with his hands and face, his voice crackling with insanity as he speaks, 'Are you talking to me?  I don't see anyone else around so you must be talking to me.  Did you come to discuss matters of high importance like the struggle between the Violet Tri-tubes and their oppression under the iron fist of the Barrel Trees?  Or perhaps you wish to speak directly with the animals for I can show you how.  If you came in search of the power of flight, you would not be the first.' <br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:40 2001] You say, 'Hail, Hoober'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:41 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:42 2001] Your feet move faster.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:43 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:44 2001] You say, 'what power of flight?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:51 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:52 2001] You say, 'I need a love potion'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:52 2001] Hoober sort of calms as he speaks very clearly, very deliberately, 'Do not trifle with me on this.  A luclin clover, a drop of moonlight and the essence of sonnet- bring me these things and you will share eternity with whomever you treasure most.' <br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:53 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:54 2001] Your feet move faster.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:55 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:57 2001] You say, 'I seek behari'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:57 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:56:57 2001] Hoober says 'He was a man.  He was a good man.  Born on a rock in a lake in world from a reality far from this coil you and I call our homes.  He was the hero of his existence, fighting for those that sought to destroy you as part of the endless struggle to remove the giant rat from power.  Did you know that with the proper care and education, elemental pets can make wonderful conversationalists? <br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:57:15 2001] You say, 'what conversationalists?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:57:15 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:57:18 2001] Your feet move faster.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:57:41 2001] You told Terrik, 'sigh.  do i give him the potion now?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:57:59 2001] You told Terrik, 'or beat him up?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:58:28 2001] You say, 'what is the elixer of obsession?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:58:42 2001] You say, 'what happened to behari?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:58:42 2001] Hoober says 'He was a man.  He was a good man.  Born on a rock in a lake in world from a reality far from this coil you and I call our homes.  He was the hero of his existence, fighting for those that sought to destroy you as part of the endless struggle to remove the giant rat from power.  Did you know that with the proper care and education, elemental pets can make wonderful conversationalists? <br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:58:46 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:58:46 2001] You say, 'where is behari?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:58:46 2001] Hoober says 'He was a man.  He was a good man.  Born on a rock in a lake in world from a reality far from this coil you and I call our homes.  He was the hero of his existence, fighting for those that sought to destroy you as part of the endless struggle to remove the giant rat from power.

[Fri Dec 21 03:59:29 2001] Your song ends.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:59:30 2001] Hoober is straight ahead.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:59:31 2001] Hoober struggles as you try to force-feed him the elixir, making you think twice about the wisdom of force-feeding something to a madman.  'I DON'T WANT TO DRINK MY JUICE, MOTHER!!!  NOW GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!!!!!!' he shouts. <br>
[Fri Dec 21 03:59:31 2001] Hoober tries to punch YOU, but misses!<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:00:44 2001] Terrik tells you, 'what did you decide, heh'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:00:52 2001] You say, 'Hail, Hoober'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:05 2001] You have lost your target.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:05 2001] You slash Hoober for 84 points of damage.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:05 2001] You have slain Hoober!<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:05 2001] You miss a note, bringing your song to a close!<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:05 2001] Your song ends.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:08 2001] Hoober`s Pet begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:09 2001] You say, 'Hail, Hoober'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:09 2001] Hoober appears to be subdued. <br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:12 2001] You say, 'where is behari?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:12 2001] You are no longer roused.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:16 2001] You say, 'who is behari?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:25 2001] You slow down.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:29 2001] Hoober coughs a bit as you feed him the elixir.  With a bit o a start he comes around to full consciousness with a calm in his eyes.  'Do I know you?' he asks. <br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:31 2001] Challia saved.<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:38 2001] You say, 'i am looking for behari?'<br>
[Fri Dec 21 04:01:39 2001] Hoober sobs into his hands, 'horrible things... such horrible things...  I remember this man named Behari, take this, it belonged to him before... before I... '  suddenly, Hoober begins to shake uncontrollably.  He starts to look at you, something between fear and dementia behind his eyes, 'Go!  GO NOW!!!  It's starting again, I shouldn't be around decent people! LEAVE ME ALONE!!!  Stop treating me like a fool, I will leave the money in a sack under the seventy-third pillar from the giant froglok just as I agreed with your master NOW GET AWAY FROM ME!!!'  His shouts echo throughout the mountains as he tears off at a full sprint. <br>
----------------<br>
<br>
He gives you Aisha's locket, no drop.  Aisha is Kalila's mother.<br>
I tried giving the locket to the pet once...'Thanks for the Aisha's Locket, Challia' Grrr.  hoober is on a long damn spawn, too.  10+ hours.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
[Sat Dec 22 15:10:27 2001] Kalila Talih gasps at the sight of what you have handed her, 'mother's locket!  Have you found...' She looks into your eyes and sees the answer to her unspoken question.  'I... I thank you,' is all that she can manage. <br>
[Sat Dec 22 15:10:27 2001] Jalil Talih says 'At least now we know.  You have gone to such lengths, please take this, it was my gift from the city upon obtaining full Khala Dun honors.  You have earned it my friend. <br>
[Sat Dec 22 15:11:11 2001] You say, 'what are khala dun honors?'<br>
[Sat Dec 22 15:11:11 2001] Jalil Talih says 'The Khala Dun are the king's warriors. They are charged with defending the city of Shar Vahl and commanding any offensives necessary. They are named after Khala Dun who was King Vah Kerrath's protector during the times of the shifting. You can find their guild within the Arena Complex in the merchants quarter. <br>
[Sat Dec 22 15:12:08 2001] You say to your guild, '5ac 3str 4wis 2dr 2pr belt.'<br>
[Sat Dec 22 15:12:26 2001] You say to your guild, '6ac, sorry.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufortunadofuerte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fortunado Fuerte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/22/01 9:08:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3568.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not to hoober</span><hr size=1> I think if you ask &quot;how about the power of flight?&quot; he should say &quot;it's levitation, homes.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mendan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/02 1:20:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3568.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not to hoober</span><hr size=1> Came across this quest recently, is it just me or is the reward here not very bard oriented?
