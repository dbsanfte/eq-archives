It began primarily as an urban minority form of expression and has subsequently spread to other types of people/music.  Personally(important word), I feel it will have a major influence on the majority of music and culture in the future, although that will not be truly noticed until another ten years.  Its already began with several expressions such as &quot;24/7&quot; and &quot;my bad&quot; becoming mainstream(I heard a reporter on CNN say 24/7 recently) and rockers that rap(i.e. Limp Bizkit and Lincoln Park).  Where did those expressions begin?  In my opinion, just to use that as an example of its effect on our culture, it was through slang originating in urban areas and popularized via rap music.<br>
<br>
You should be suspicious of anyone who states &quot;X is easy&quot; or &quot;it takes less musical skills&quot; even though they have never done it.  Until a person is able write 3 verses, 16 bars each and 2-3 choruses then use samples/and or make beats that harmonize with the lyrics then I don't feel they can really label it as being easy.  Furthermore, some groups use live instruments.  The rap world is not confined to what is simply heard on the radio or seen on videos.  Like in all types of music, what becomes popular is not necessarily the best representation of what is really good about it.  I love it how many people(not on this thread necessarily, but in general) make an argument based on one or a few rap songs they heard and brand the whole industry as being similar.  That would be like me stating well &quot;I heard Vanilla Ice's new rock album and well, I just think rock is horrible.&quot;  There are many different types of rap just as there are many different types of rock, an open mind is key and to say rap is not music is showing the complete opposite.  <br>
<br>
I see rap as being very similar to poetry put to music.  A story is told, it often reflects the conditions which that person has grown up in.  Is it all happy, sunshine, party type music?  No, of course not. The reason for that is that inner city urban areas suffer from a lot of social and economic ills.  That is not a cliche, that is a fact of life, and if you don't believe me then take a tour of your local housing project.  The &quot;dark&quot; things(lovingly referred to as &quot;gangsta&quot; by the media *rolls eyes*) can be equated, in my opinion, to literature written in other times which reflect the problems of society.  You don't say &quot;oh Johnathan Swift was such a awful, vicious person and completely out of line for writing A Modest Proposal&quot; although it is seemingly horrific.(Yes, it is satire, but it speaks about the ills of society during that period)  Again, is ALL rap like this? No, you can quote some lyrics from some rappers but it would be just as easy to take random quotes from bad rockers or whatever and state that proves rock is bad.<br>
<br>
During the early 90s there was a lot more violence in rap.  Subsequently, there was an economic boom(which, argueably, did affect virtually all aspects of society) coupled with the growth of the rap industry which led to lighter rap dealing with things which shows how life is more lucrative.  To some, particularly people that live outside of urban areas, that looks like bragging.  To others, it looks like promise or potential, hope even in a world that many times seems devoid of it.  Although this may seem melodramatic, really it is not. Admittadley, not all rappers come from that type of world but many do and are just telling their stories both to show others that they understand(such as a support group) and to perhaps to show others that have had no contact with that world what it is like.<br>
<br>
Of course, liking it is also subjective so I could understand people not listenting to it.  But to say that it is not music is way off base.  Anyone who has taken any music courses(particularly at the college level) understands that music can be a variety of things and immediatley jumping to the conclusion that something is not without truly attempting to see its merits only stifles creativity. <p>------------------------ <Br>
