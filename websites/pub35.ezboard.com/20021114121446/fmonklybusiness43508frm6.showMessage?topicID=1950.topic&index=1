When you can get a kpp every 6 or 8 hours, you can afford to get really nice mid level gear for any alts you may want to have.  I have been astounded at the income difference my druid has now at 52, compared to even level 40.  I spend 3 or 4 hours grinding exp, not even caring about money, and i get 200 to 400 pp in cash and vendor loot, plus assorted items that can sell to players for significantly more.  Also, concentrating time on one character will help you level far faster, which will let you earn income quicker and get better gear.<br>
<br>
I have given up on playing my monk untwinked.  He is going to get a full suit of acrylia reinforced, and a few nice weapons.  take me a week or so to get the cash up for it (as soon as i pay for my earing of nature on the druid.  and a veluim diamond ring, velium blue diamond bracer, the list just keeps growing...) <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60598>Oakwood Moonblaze, Wood Elf Druid<br></a>

<br>
Furthermore, you should know that toe to toe combat is a poor strategy in EQ for soloing. Consequently, (untwinked) melee-only classes generally do quite poorly. Since you're comparing to Paladins, you should know that they are significantly better soloists than Monks during the middle levels because they have easier access to better equipment (and 2-handed weapons are generally better than dual wield in that level range), and have the ability to root MOBS and heal themselves during battle when things go poorly. In the early days of the game, Monks were the better soloists at all levels, but Paladins have received massive enhancements, and are now very good through the mid levels. At high levels, Monks probably still have the advantage at soloing - but not where you are now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=phungkuu>Phung Kuu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/8/02 10:59:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1950.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Funny... thread.<br>

Fight up in MSeru.  Real close to Nexus.  Drops some plat and peris on passing Clerics for aego, buys 1100 hps.  Each one will last you at least half a level(til you reach 30), great investment.<br>

First off, dump your belt, cloak and neck items, you can get spider fur in all those slots for way cheap and they all weigh 0.0.  Lose the rings and get at least some jagged bands if not the 6ac 65 hp rings.  The thing that will help you the most in soloing though will be haste, either get an FBSS or SCHW, it is amazing how much a little haste will help.<br>

My monk is 1 level above yours and as you can see from his magelo profile he has a lot of the same armor as yours does...<br>

I didn't even realize I was still wearing a Cutthroat Ring.<br>
<br>
Daleb - So what's a better way of soloing? Maybe it's just because I'm relatively new to monks, but I can't think of many other strategies other than feigning death, trying to heal myself, and then fighting again. (Which doesn't seem wise to me, since mobs regen a lot faster than we do<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
As far as gear goes, if I can get some invis potions, I'll send my main back to LGuk. (Ruined my faction helping a guildie get a component for a spell quest on the live side) Maybe I can get an FBSS if I'm really lucky.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the suggestions though. I'll definitely be looking at replacing the Cutthroat ring, Raw Silk Neck and Back, and the Spore Covered Gloves first. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udaleb123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daleb123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/9/02 2:01:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1950.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Soloing</span><hr size=1> The reason why toe-to-toe combat is not very effective for soloing is because you allow your opponent to pound on you. Since the game is balanced to be group-oriented, MOBs of equal level are both stronger and tougher than you. Consequently, you end up fighting creatures that barely give exp, and still not winning much of the time - and when you do, you have long recovery times before you are ready to fight again. <br>
<br>
The classes which are most successful are those that kill from a distance, or that can make their opponents run in fear while being damaged. <br>
<br>
Monks don't have many options. You have no meaningful ranged attacks, and your fear abilities are limited (Instill Doubt/Intimidation). That's about it. In other words, Monks are not a great choice for the soloist. Being an Iksar helps considerably, since you get an AC/Damage Mitigation bonus and faster regeneration, but the truth is that Monks are now one of the worst soloist classes in the game...unless you twink. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uhaeppwin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haeppwin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/9/02 2:31:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1950.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soloing</span><hr size=1> hmmm... the fact that as you say toe to toe combat is not effective is shaky at best... I've soloed my way pretty much all the way through to 49... about to ding 50 on my iksar monk. When I started off &quot;twinked&quot; I had a CCS which is debatably worse than LockJaw's no haste and only 1 CoT for a weapon using fist for offhand... I did however have 6/65 rings... but let me tell you I have NEVER soloed in any way beside standing and beating the shit out of mobs... whether bandits in PC orcs in CC mutants in Echo or as of now Umberbulks in Echo again... I would suggest going to the moon again and hunting the top floor of Echo... with a little better gear you could solo mutants as long as they aren't named and people are always lookin for a monk puller in their grps there... as soon as you hit 30 or so... (I went at 28 with a prtner until 30) go to CC and hunt Orc Miners and with a little better gear than you have Watchmen as well... stay away from casters and Foremen... you can do CC for quite some time... I did Dawnshroud tribals by ME zone for a little variety in my high 30s... but on point... soloing toe to toe is how  the majority of people do it... the only time I have heard it really isn't the best way is when you have ID maxed at mid 50s+ and can fear kite the mobs around... however I will say Iksar are vastly easier to solo due to our regen small that it might be at that lvl... our AC doesn't hurt... anyways I think you get the point and I'll stop rambling now<br>
