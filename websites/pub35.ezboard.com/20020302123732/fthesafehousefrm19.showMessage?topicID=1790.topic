To be honest to have someone there 24 hours a day will not happen and is unreasonable ( my opnion).  I am hoping that they just make the gaurds at relic keeps attack any battering rams and destroy them.  once done there should be some kind of alert that our keep is being attacked so we can check it out.  by the time we were aware of it it was to late.  Kudos to Midgard but to be honest I think Mythic will nerf the assassin now big time not like we arent already gimped.

<br>
What were the facts involved?  30minutes you say?  Wasn't the first relic stolen by a rogue done in 12hours, or thereabouts?  How was it sped up 20x?<br>
<br>
Were the doors upgraded and repaired?  Did noone go check on yer relics when this relic-stealin-tactic came round?  I can confirm that Albion rogues definitely knew this relic strategy, as I was defending against them in our relic faste.<br>
<br>
If there were high lvl doors at full health taken down in 30minutes by a couple of rogues, expect a nerf.  If not, maybe all ya need is a little more defense.<br>
<br>
fyi, you will usually not notice things that got stolen until they are gone.<br>

Please inform yourself of all the facts before making claims you know nothing about, considering the content of your post.<br>
<br>
I personally was not involved in stealing the relic, but people I know closely were involved, as well as a couple of guildmates.<br>
<br>
The entire process took over 18 hours I would say.  So I have no idea where you get some idea it took 30 minutes.  This took alot of patience and determination on the part of SEVERAL people, not only rogues.<br>
<br>
So before you start making people panic about some nerf, please get your facts straight.<br>
<br>
And I have to stay, that Merlin's staff is one nifty looking relic.  We'll enjoy it.<br>

When the rest of the community complains to high heaven you think it will remain.  No i doubt it.  If it does great but I doubt it.  Flame me all you want just wait and see how long it remains the way it is.

Instead of worrying about what Mythic can do to prevent this from happening again and wasting valued bandwidth go off as a realm think of how to stop it.  Use some creativity with the resources you DO have!!<br>

<br>
The same thing was tried on the Hibernians, they were smart enough to upgrade the doors of their relic keeps.  Additionally they have had people who stop by and check their relic keeps.<br>
<br>
When was the last time you stopped by one of your relic forts?<br>
<br>
Its plain and simple.  Albion got caught with its pants down.  To top it off, your own infiltrators tried this on our own relic forts and guess what.  It wasn't going to happen.  Why?  Because we watch our forts and we upgraded all our doors to level 8.  I personally stop by our forts 2 times a day, else someone else in my guild does.  Doesn't take long to stop this 12 - 16 hour process, you just have to spend a simple 30 minutes 2 times a day, you or any other of the 1000 Albion players on Percival to stop an attack by rogues.<br>
<br>
<br>
To add insult to the injury, I'd prefer not to go into specific details.  But there was a big broadcast (and most of you Albions on Percival are still whining even though you had your chance) about how the Albion relic was recovered by Albion.  This is because it was dropped due to the death of the rogue carrying it.  In fact the entire team of rogues was wiped out.  So we had to go back to our portal fort in Midgard, port over to Hadrian's Wall, run all the way to Snowdonia to pick the relic back up.  Meanwhile your Albion forces were picking their noses at the Midgard Bledmeer fort.  Forces in Odin's Gate kept those people busy and occupied them long enough for our strike team to get back, get the relic, run it back (not stealthed) to Hadrian's Wall, port to Midgard, run through the Frontier to our Horn Keep where we deposited Merlin's Staff.<br>
<br>
Albion if they had been paying attention all along would have noticed this.  They had more than enough chances to stop this.  Honestly considering the &quot;strike team&quot; force size, all it would have taken was one of your many 45+ level groups of 8 to have ended this all and kept your precious relic in your homeland.<br>
<br>
You guys screwed up plain and simple.  Just like people on numerous other servers now who weren't smart enough to keep an eye on what their realm considers precious to you.<br>

Notice in the new patch the inability to cast buffs, heals, rezzes through keep walls?  That prevents these rogues from going in with the wood, building their rams undetected, then firing them off.  Once they die, the enemy healer clicks on that member of the group and rezzes him, buffs him/her back up, and they then climb back over the wall.  Die. Rinse. Repeat.<br>
<br>
Being an assassin, I admire the tenacity of those who are willing to go through such hardships just to damage a keep door.  But at the same time, I am quite disappointed in my own realm guards who were oblivious to a ram being built in their own midst, and then after the infiltrators were dispatched with, allowed the ram to continue to stand.<br>

<br>
The responses are to demonstrate that this is not the case...and if it was not the case then the class does not warrant a nerf.<br>
<br>
Facts:<br>
<br>
- It did indeed take over 10 hours to complete the deed, I believe it was either 16 or 18 hours.<br>
<br>
- The doors were not above level 2 in the upgrade scale.<br>
<br>
- Hibernian's relics were considered BUT they had upgraded their door and this thwarted this same tactic.<br>
<br>
- The same tactic had already been attempted on a Midgard relic...but the damage was noticed by shadowblade scouts and the doors were repaired and upgraded.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
This could have been prevented fairly painlessly by either an upgrade on the Albion doors or a patrol going by to check them sometime in the course of those 16-18 hours(understand though that Midgard forces were mobilized on purpose to help distract).<br>
<br>
Therefore:<br>
<br>
This theft was not easy to accomplish and in fact could have been easily prevented.<br>
<br>
If ye must find fault for a nerf it will be in the guards not noticing a battering ram not in our class abilities. <p><table width="436" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2">

Notice in the new patch the inability to cast buffs, heals, rezzes through keep walls? That prevents these rogues from going in with the wood, building their rams undetected, then firing them off. Once they die, the enemy healer clicks on that member of the group and rezzes him, buffs him/her back up, and they then climb back over the wall. Die. Rinse. Repeat.<br>

<br>
Er, no...<br>
<br>
Both incidents as far as I know they released.. ran all the way back.. and repeated.. :/ So that has no real effect.. my guess is the wall thing was because of the fact now Assassins can nonstop jump the wall and kill casters with one-shots before dying..(Not positive, but that could be the reason) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utheycallmespanky.showPublicProfile?language=EN>theycallmespanky</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 7:29:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get ready for the nerf</span><hr size=1> So why would a rogue jump the wall to a keep?  <br>
<br>
You can no longer take relics, unless doors get reset from lvl8 to lvl1.<br>
<br>
You can't very well assassinate people in a keep, unless you one shot em(will this go away soon?).  If you die you will can no longer be rezzed.<br>

It was a great job by the people involved in Midgard on Percival, Shadowblades especially. It took alot of time and it took alot of screw ups by Albion (they have no one to blame but themselves).<br>
<br>
Next time someone says they don't need a 'blade because he's a 'blade on this server no longer loses a healer to the group (assuming he's not kicked out :P), but also convieniently won't be res'd on the battlefield. <p>-----<br>

not really sure about this though,i dont think the servers keep track of that issue.also i thought the doors degraded over time,possible bug? if they dont they should imo. hell my weapons degrade fast enough as it is:P<br>
<br>
this means every server patch/downtime that people will be attempting to steal relics with this process.<br>
<br>
i expect it to be honest to get nerfed. why?<br>
<br>
well for one thing,people dont want to bother with strategy. its the eq mindset,rather then plan defense,we just want to be lemmings. add in all the things about every person in the realm who lost a relic,saying rogues are to powerful,because we can stealth and steal relics,under perfect conditions. to them the conditions dont matter,the fact that we can do it is the issue.<br>
<br>
my personal feeling is that mythic will take a look at it,say good job using strategy for those who did it. however,we feel that in the future,that a small dedicated group of players shouldnt impact the server as a whole,in this manner.<br>
<br>
im against the nerf,but i can see it coming. im giving the game another try,after not playing for the last month. then i find out that rogues stole relics. can see the nerf bat coming,reminds me to much of past experiances in other games when things like this happens.<br>
<br>
all i can really say is the games about pvp combat. people using there abilities to achieve there ends,is what should be rewarded not punished. <br>

An assassin stealing a relic I mean the server and realm are inconsequential...  I also think it does kind of trivialize the whole thing...  So I think it should be &quot;nerfed&quot;...  I don't think assassins should be nerfed at all...  All they would have to do is have an alarm go out when the doors are attacked...  Or, Let the doors heal, like after 5 mins of no damage they begin to heal til they are back to 100% or are damaged again...  Consider it regular maintenance...  Guard doing his routine patrol finds the door is damaged and has it fixed/replaced...  Of course he isn't suspicious of the ram laying next to the door...  never said he was a good Guard...   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=1790.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=1790.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=1790.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1790.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=1790.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=1790.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1790.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1790.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm24">Realm Quests<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
