Key is to spec early for soloing and not worry about RvR . that means keep your poisoning maxed and your weapon skill maxed . You also HAVE to keep your armor and weapons up to date . No blue, keep everything yellow or orange to you . Pick places to hunt where you will not get adds and you can solo yellows fine .  <p>Moonglum DAoC

Takes me about 35 minutes per bubble.<br>
<br>
Nightshades even specced well have problems soloing much over a blue con except for a few mobs you get strong +s to damage on. <br>
<br>
Have a L44 NS and a L30s Inf.<br>
<br>
The SB may well solo evens well but mine is only L-teens so too early for me to opinion.<br>
<br>
As to why to solo atall; it's nescessary practice. If you don't spend hours a week stalking, panning camera to check other mobs around, getting the PA and CD off right... then DON'T expect those skills to appear when yer on a wall trying to kill a defender. <br>
<br>
PS Lately I have been practicing the &quot;running&quot; PA (getting in front of a moving Mob and time PA to work as he steps into range). After many failures I got it down just right (90+% of time it works) and now my &quot;Running PA&quot; works well on enemy RvR also. Without the practice; don't even try it.<br>

I would ignore your stealth early on. If you're going for Slash, don't worry about CS too much either, early on, since you've got Amethyst to work with. If you're going for Thrust, you may wanna bring CS up for the Garrote-AH combo, but... up to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  try to fight neutral mobs to land side or back positionals on, they can really help.

In a fight Im losing when a double attack has me hurting I take one desperate swing and, hopein' it takes, run. <br>

Have escaped 1/2 Health Bar even cons with my last bubble under one left because as slow as I trot wounded, they are slower. <br>

Aside from the occasional &quot;Get outta Dead Pool free&quot; cards it's really only great in RvR. Bogs the runners right down so you can sushi.<br>

<br>
Now at 42 I can solo low yellows with some downtime. High yellows are risky unless I get good bonuses and they get good penalties. <br>

Stats are 33 stealth, 34 CS, 34 thrust, 30 poison, and 15 DW. I wield epic and crafter high yellow 98% qual weapons. Armor is 99% qual crafted level 45 armor.<br>

Oh, the pain.<br>

Blues I can rip through usually before creeping death's stun has even worn off.<br>

On a side note: I wonder if Mythic understands yet that the ability to solo a blue is meaningless at high levels.  I don't know if there are many classes that can't solo a yellow at 50.
