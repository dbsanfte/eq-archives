Those mentioned within the story really do exist and did everything as far as I can remember. This is not a story of swashbuckeling and mass murder, there are far too many of them, but of intrigue, cunning, and too many close calls, which is what a rogues life is meant to be about - and I regret dispite studying it well, my ability to spell in common is quite poor - Enjoy)<br>
<br>
<br>
Allow me to introduce myself, for I have not posted on this board before. I am Cyriex Callidus, a half elf with a strong distace for dark elves, and the current master of the Callidus Temple of Assasinorium. I have spent the last two days in Neriak, spying on the movements of the Dark Elves, and I belive my story of the adventure will be interesting to you fellow rogues.<br>
Also the reasons behind my going to Neriak shall remain hidden for now, I can tell you of what I was requested to do there. My &quot;employers&quot; required me to gain access to Neriak, locate the hidden tunnel system, and gather information on all the guards and guilds located in the three areas of the town. For such a mammoth task, I went to Freeport to recruit at least one aspiring rogue to acompany me on this journey. Before I even entered the town, I saw a young half elf by the name of Rourke running out of the West gate being chased by a group of guards screaming &quot;Stop THEIF!&quot;. Admiring this young mans cunning, I followed him for a while before talking to him and seeing if he was interested in joining me. He was delighted, so we left all but the bare essentials in the bank, (for who needs weapons or armor when we are not to be seen?) and headed out to the commonlands.<br>
Not wanting to waste time we rushed into the Nektulos Forest, just to be greated by a welcoming party of a Dragoon and his Sergant. Obviously the Teir'Dal had heard of my mission. We made a hasty withdrawl back to the East commonlands to rest from such a close encounter with the Indigo Brotherhoods best. We then crossed into the forest again and sucessfully started sneaking our way towards Neriak.<br>
As I neared Neriak (Rourke having split up to take a &quot;short-cut&quot;), Innoruuk himself tried to use his powers to slow my progress (OOC 4 Link Deaths and 3 disconnections all in a matter of 10 mins!!..not lucky). Amazingly I managed to keep control of myself and finally made it to the entrance to Neriak. After whispering to each other to make sure we were both there, Rourke and I entered the evil city.<br>
On the other side of the entrance, I was surprised to find a Dark Elf Necromancer by the name of Sajja standing their smiling at us. I feared she would inform the guards and our mission would be over in no time, but it seems she had also been employed to find the hidden tunnel system, but had failed. She told us what she had learnt, and thankfully distracted the guards while we hid again. The two of us then creapt off towards the Ogre and Troll section of the Foreign Quarter, where Sajja had heard rumors of a secret tunnel being found. Sure enough we located a room with walls decorated with symbols concerning the Lord of Hate himself. While taking a closer look, I fell through the wall itself and into a tunnel. The first part of our mission was going all too smoothly. Taking a quick sketch of the area in order to jog my memory if I ever return, me and Rourke headed down the tunnel, which led underneath the commons of Neriak. We entered a large cavern, and both jumped back with surprise when we saw a Dark Elven caster running about. Luckily he could not see us, and soon went down the tunnel we had emerged from.<br>
While exploring the cavern, both Rourke and I fell down a rather large pit. Thank Bristlebane we had left our armor in the bank, for the extra weight would have definatly caused more damage than the fall did (neither Rourke nor I have learnt the skill of safe fall yet...well I had..in a past life..that is another story). On our way out of the pit Rourke and I got seperated, for it is hard to stay close when you can't see each other. I heard a splash, and turned round to see Rouke scrabbeling out of a pool of water from my vantage point behind a waterfall. Luckilly only the priest of discord saw this before rourke hid again, but it meant I had to explore the tunnels in this area on my own while Rourke tried to find a way of getting back into the tunnels.<br>
The tunnels ended and bought me up in a tavern called The Toadstool. Ignoring the guards and guilds for now, I rushed back to where the priest of discord stands to meet up with Rourke. As we tried to enter the town, a dark elf somehow, amazingly, revealed where Rourke was hiding, unfortunatly without him knowing. Before I could warn him, guards piled out from the gate infront of us, and Rourke was slain.<br>
The gods were on our side and allowed Rourke to return to this world, alas only in Freeport. I chose to do what needed doing in this area while Rourke caught up, and we would proceed to the infamous 3rd Gate area of Neriak together, for we feared even our combine wits would not be able to keep us hidden from the abominations contained within.<br>
Having drawn sketches of the movements of the guards and each guildmaster and his bodyguards, I was surprised to hear a door open behind me in the guildhall of the Indigo Brotherhood. I span round to see nothing. Wondering if the rumors of Neriak being haunted were true, I was relived when Rourke whispered &quot;psst..anyone in here?&quot;. It takes a fine rogue to find another when you are both hidden. Re-united, we set off to the 3rd Gate and what perils would lay within.<br>
Entering the deepest soul of Neriak, we were relived that the entrance allowed us to hide without the guard noticing us. Obviously the archetects did not expect a rogue to be able to get this deep into the city. We moved deeper into the city, exploring the disgusting Temple of Innorruk as quickly as possible, and moving on towards the main cluster of buildings in the area. Before we could reach the gate, we past two Dark Elves having a conversation. My memory is always poor with names, but I belive them to be Darnax Do'Lethlan of DeVir, and Shatrd Angel of the Soliders of Light. After listening to their conversation for a good few minutes, a small amount of underground dust got into my nostrils and I sneezed (OOC I accadently hit jump!). They heard this noise and were soon spinning about trying to find the source. Darnax had the forsight to cast a spell that allowed him to see us, and we were soon fearing for our lives, for even an attempt to cast magic on us would reveal us to the guards. Luckily, being a true son of hate, he was ammused that two pale skinned &quot;fools&quot; as he put it, had got so far past the Indigo Brotherhood. He soon ran off to &quot;educate&quot; them in how to find rogues, and gave us vital time to finish our mission. We sneaked off towards the guildhall of the Ebon Mask as fast as we could. Once inside we were pushed aside by a rather odd rogue by the name of Molon Tplth. As he seemed to enjoy wondering, we went off to follow him after recording the strength of the rogue presance in the guildhall. Together, we managed to track him down to a small tavern called the Maidens fancy. On entering, I realised it was not like any other tavern in Norrath, and definatly not one I would wish to enter unless I was a son of hate myself. Dead bodies littered the floor, and a necromancer was having fun killing all those she could as they entered the bar. Surprisingly she left Molon, perhaps because he seemed an exceptionally skilled rogue.<br>
Overhearing a conversation between what seemed to be another Teir'Dal warrior and Molon, he recommended the downstairs level to the young adventurer. Curious to its purpose I headed down, while Rourke went to the other guildhall in the area and did what we were meant to be doing. On clearing the stairs, I can explain what I saw as nothing less than a fully fledged brothel. Scantly clad Dark Elf females were dancing on the bar, while an Ambassador was getting amazingly drunk. Off from the bar is three rooms containing beds, and I heard the sounds of one obviously dissatified customer slaying his company. Discusted by the atmosphere of death in the place, I left and regrouped with Rourke just outside of the Casters guild.<br>
He informed me that there was not any necromancers in that guild, which surprised me, and meant there still was the guildmaster of the dead that we had not gathered information on. After some searching, we found a small archway around the back of the casters guild, and a path led to a small tunnel guarded by three guards. I praised the fact the gods had taught us rogues how to hide from these undead devils, and effortlessly snuck past them, to be confronted by a blood red building which we assume to be none other than the ledendary Lodge of the Dead. Keeping an extra eye out for Necromancers who may be able to see us, we very cautiosly entered the lodge. The atmosphere of death was almost overpowering, and it was clear that we were less welcome here than we were anywhere else in the city. Luckily not one of the magic casting Dark Elves had giving themselves the ability of additional sight, and we were able to explore the lodge without incident. Then, as we were leaving the guild, another rogue by the name of Tadyen (a rogue who I had read about just the day before at the safehouse), possibly with the help of some caster of some kind, talked to me directly, while he was miles away (OOC he TELLed me ok). At first confused by the psychic interuption, he informed me that he had heard that a rather notorious rogue of many adventures was currently spying in Neriak. At first thinking this meant that we were not the only rogues here, which caused him some enjoyment, he explained to me that he indeed ment that I was the notorious rogue. He told me that he had heard of my many exploits. We were soon locked in a intersting swapping of stories, and before I knew it I was alone, having bid Rourke farewell and a job well done, and I was getting tired. Tadyen, who is currently employed as the only rogue by my 1st ever employers, Troy II (OOC who highly dislike rogues since I've left..I have no clue what Tadyen is doing there), although miles away, had me in such a interesting conversation about the powers of us rogues, and swapping a mirriad of interesting stories, I soon realised it must have been many hours since I had last slept. I bidded Tadyen farewell for the night, shut my mind out of his distracting words, and found a small empty room to sleep in at the top floor of the Toadstool. Tadyen, as he managed to somehow persuade me to stay around long enough for our conversation, is now an Apprentice in the Callidus Temple of Assasinorium and I hope to train him in the ways I have be taught before me. Rourke was not sure in his future in Norrath, he had paid dearly in a bet and lost all his possesions, but as this adventure has shown, you can be down in your luck, but gain more experiance than 1000 slayings of Orcs.<br>
<br>
EPILOG - Waking up in the toadstool the next morning was mildly disoriantating, I was getting too used to the open air of the commonlands and the desert of Ro. Not wanting to spend more time than I had to surrounded by these foul spawnings of hate, I snuck out of the city using the most direct route, noticing a few guards that I did not the day before. I guess it was a good thing I chose to stay here after all. I can tell you now that there was not a more satifying feeling than that I felt to see the daylight rising over the commonlands after I had got out of the dark abismal areas of Neriak and the surrounding forest.<br>
Although it has been a fine adventure, and one I may have to do again one day, I hope that day will be a long time coming. The Dark elves killed my parents, and when I return to Neriak, I hope it is to slay those I saw over the last two days.<br>
