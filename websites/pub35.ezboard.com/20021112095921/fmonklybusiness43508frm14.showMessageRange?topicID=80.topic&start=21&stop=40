The purpose of those servers is to create an environment for roleplay, and people who screw that up should be removed.  I'd have to disagree that name petitions and such are trivial.<br>
I'm aware that some people play on RP servers purely to get away from the d00dz on other servers rather than to roleplay.  That's cool, but it doesn't change the fact that the server isn't set up for that purpose. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

DAoC isn't stupid.. it's fun but this is an opinion thing so what somebody else says just doesn't really matter.<br>

I can exp hunt, I can do fetch/carry tasks or kill tasks, I can quest or I can tailor. I always have something to do that is useful even when none of my friends are on.

There's nobody capable of fighting the ubermobs on most servers, that sort of content is for a mature playerbase and isn't needed until months after launch. Mythic already stated they are adding &quot;high level encounters&quot;. Saying endgame DAoC is only RvR is just throwing FUD at the game. Unlike with VI, I expect Mythic to deliver on their promises, since they have a much better track record. <p>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>

I definitely agree with you on that.  Granted, according to Sanya a large portion of the stuck people could get themselves out if they'd just use the /stuck command, and people who are actually unable to play are supposed to be prioritized over those with more minor problems.  Regardless, it shouldn't take a large number of people to chase down a few d00dz and make them change their names. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

<br>
However, even if it is easier than in EQ, thats no problem, because each class has so many variants, that there will be a long life for people who want to re-make with a different style set.<br>
<br>
For example, say a person likes playing a cleric. They might make a cleric with smite specialisation, and play it to 50, only to find that the cleric is great in RvR, but poor in high level PvE encounters, and thus make another cleric and play it to 50, but this time specialising in rejuvination skills.<br>
<br>
And then there are other classes to play, and each of the variants of each, and should you get bored of those.. then there is the option of playing a different realm (albeit on a different server) and experiencing life from the other side of the coin.<br>

For example, the fact that everyone in the party gets a quest reward is often unfair to those that contributed more towards accomplishing the task. <br>
Also, small things like the ease of combining items for tradesklls and the fact that failures dont result in the destruction of items takes away from the inherent purpose of building skills in order to reduce failures and the risk and loss that should be associated with building skill. <p><table border="0" width="545" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

DAoC gives you more for the time you invest than EQ.<br>

That right there is a huge selling point.  If you notice alot of the upcoming MMORPG(like WoW &amp; DAoC) are tryin to do away with useless downtime but up the replayability of mid-endgame areas.  I think currently EQ has absolutely NOTHING that could make me go back to it.  Zero, zip, zilch, nada.<br>

LOL , I remember doing things like that in d2 &amp; wizardry(which is still the original badboy for me, wiz VIII is out nov 15th, w00t!), and I still love daoc.  just don't have the timesink crap for eq anymore.  Now when I spend 8hrs online I'm alot more likely to have a good gaming experience than say... solo'n ragers for abit, or campin kc, or crap like that. When you figure the time it takes to get something together in EQ(let alone do a simple CR), that's  where it starts to shake, and the fact that there is competent competition on the market, verant should start figuring out that there is another venue for online play w/ friends etc which doesn't have alot of what made people waste time.<br>
<br>
Sure, daoc may be 2nd gen online, but I think for 2nd gen it's a great start, can't wait to see the future games like WoW, but I WILL stray from SWG game that verant is crafting.<br>
<br>
DAoC is just too *fun* right now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And if all else fails, i still have rollercoaster tycoon. <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

Does this game come with a free 1 or 2 month trail, like eq?<br>
<br>
Thanks...<br>

rollercoaster tycoon = imo, the coolest sim game ever. ever. my bro and I used to have this contest--see who could build the most intense and nausinating rollercoster.  We'd build 'em then email them to each other...<br>

As far as challenge goes... and bear in mind that this is just my perspective, not a slam on EQ players... it seems to me that every time someone brings up how much more challenging EQ supposedly is, what they really wind up talking about his how much longer and how many more people it takes to do anything.  If that's something you consider challenging then more power to you.  It doesn't work for me. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

I would love to finish my epic, but don't see having the time to camp KC and Chardok.  Raids?  Another 4-6+ hr time investment and thats if everything is organized and starts right away.  Too much like work.<br>
