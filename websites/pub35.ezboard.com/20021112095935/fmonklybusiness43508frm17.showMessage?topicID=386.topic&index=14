Abandoned at 51.<br>
<br>
Determined to not make the same mistake again, I tried an enchanter.  Everyone loves them, and they get group easily (well, atleast as soon as you reach 16.. soloing before that time).  Played the class grouped all the way to 60 in like half the time it took my mage to get 51.  Then I found out that at raids enchanters are nothing more than buffers.. no more crowd control, no more keeping that pet charmed to do extra damage.. the challenge is gone.<br>
<br>
Being a bit more aware of what the high end game looked, I decide on playing a rogue.  I liked that alot, but it was quite a bit harder to get a group than with my enchanter, mainly because rogues don't do anything that's really essential in a fast paced dungeon group (ie, tank, snare, heal, evac, mana regen, slow or crowd control -- note that mages don't either).  In other words, if you're lacking any of the above, you don't get a damage dealer.<br>
<br>
Dunno exactly why I tried the monk, but before my rogue was 50, I tried a monk.  I was very impressed.  I loved cabillis (my first iksar), loved mend, and loved the fact I could do things with almost no gear at all (was only at level 20 orso before I did some twinking, as I decided I liked the class a lot).  Grouping wasn't essential, but neither was it impossible, perfect!  I could function as emergency tank in groups (before uber gear, our low hitpoints make us inefficient to heal), but I never thought of myself as the main tank, not even in groups I formed myself.  <br>
<br>
Needless to say, the monk was 60 way before my rogue (still not 60), and I never regretted it.  I still don't regret it, however the recent nerf has taken a lot of fun out of the game for me.  Getting nerfed accross the board, for no other reason that VI screwed up on all/all gear and some warriors whining that they suck is ludicrous.  <br>
<br>
I see no reason why only people that can soak up lots of damage wearing plate are supposed to be the best tanks in ALL cases.  I can make an equally valid point that someone who's almost nekkid and can dodge blows almost faster than the eye can see (hey, if plate can absorb and even dodge blows from AoW, then I can dodge faster than the eye can see) wouldn't tank BETTER in SOME situations.<br>
<br>
But VI is unfortunately blind.  Instead of spreading the burden amongst classes to create more diversity, they focus on this &quot;1 class has to be best at something ALL of the time&quot; thing:<br>
<br>
Warrior - tanking<br>
Cleric - healing<br>
Shaman - slowing &amp; stat buffing<br>
Wizards - nuking<br>
Necro - dots<br>
Enchanter - speed &amp; mana buf<br>
<br>
Don't think there are any other classes that are better at something in all cases, except perhaps for some minor buffs or very situational skill.  Rogues can be beat by Rangers at damage dealing.  For pulling rangers, bards, sk's and monks all are used in different situations.<br>
<br>
Verant sticks pretty hard to the above list though, with only minor exceptions.  If I was designing the classes, I'd have ensured that classes are still very interdependant, but at the same time, no class would be the best at anything in more than 90% of the cases.  I'd spread debuffs around a bit better; currently only Slow has any real effect on a mob, I'd prolly make Slow less effective, but enhance the effectiveness of another debuff (Weakness or Cripple) to achieve the same total effect.  ie, the mob hits faster because it isn't slowed as much, but thanks to Weakness it hits less hard when it does, giving the same total effect as currently the single 75% slow spell would have in damage reduction.<br>
<br>
I'd create more mobs that are only viable to be killed if you have lots of nukers (like Sontalak).  I'd create more mobs that dodge almost all blows or are nearly immune to melee, yet are easily nuked down.  I'd create mobs that hit so fast that you need a high mitigation tank as dodging blows is not viable (assuming there's a limit how fast you can dodge blows -- that would be realistic).  And the other way around, mobs that hit so hard but slow, that dodging the blows is the only realistic solution.  This could even be a racial difference amongst tanks, ie, the gnome warrior dodges more, and the ogre warriors absorbs better, making them slightly better tanks in specific situations, but never overly preferred over the other for any situation.<br>
<br>
In other words, I'd be in favor for more variation, instead of: &quot;stick plate tank infront of mob, and keep him/her upright while 50 other people beat it up with the mob never as much as flinching at them&quot;.  <br>

My current monk, the Iksar I made for sheer fun and utility after pulling out of the high end game completely. I wanted some flexibility and well... just some fun. This happened about the time we started working on VT keys. I was just done with that game.<br>

<br>
I did not realise how addicted I would become to the class, I played totally untwinked from lvl 1-30 (AB pre movelog), and loved it, I made all my own cured silk, was wearing derv rings etc, it was great, I still didnt really throw some cash at my monk until he reached lvl 44 (I earnt my 2 wus sticks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>

This change means nothing to me, I play my monk because I enjoy it, not because I want to be the #2/3 damage dealer, nor the best solo melee class, nor the best xp group tank, but because I love the class as a whole, this change does not affect my enjoyment of the class, just means I will have to change my arrogant &quot;I can tank better than that stupid warrior&quot; attitude and control my agro better in groups, I still pull better than war/sk and thats where half the fun is with monks IMO. <p><center><-^-><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=179210"> Eckles - 57 Enchanter</a> <-^-><br>

good point, two reasons<br>
<br>
1) i said i was a newb when i started EQ, the only real referance to the game i had was D&amp;D, and i hated rogues in that game.<br>
<br>
2) having started right after Kunark was released (like 3 days after), i figured i would play a race that was brand new and nobody knew anything about, i would be on equal footing with everyone else, hence i play an Iksar--no rogues <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mfalk01/pics/xavious.gif"><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28243" target="_blank"><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mfalk01/pics/Image1.jpg"><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28243">Property of Tamarai</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uchaidragonborne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ChaiDragonborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 4:58:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=386.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why did you make a monk?</span><hr size=1> I played monk on another server, and I played monk on my current server.<br>
I love playing monk, this is my main and I don't have twink gear like Fungi and COF, all I own I made with my monk.<br>
<br>
So why did I create a monk?  Because they are fun to play!  I can still solo at 53, and I'm still useful groups. I love the fact I can FD when a fight is not in my favor, and having a mend that I can use often enough to rely on it in combat. If I see a high cliff, wall, tower or spire, I can't resist to jump down. Exception is Hole, NK and DL spires <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I don't want to lead people cross DL, they take damage just looking at a cliff.<br>
<br>
Sure, some classes might be better at solo, some more popular in groups, some might outdamage me, and some might outlive me, but who cares? I don't. I enjoy playing monk, that's what matters.<br>
<br>
After patch I could still solo my regular foes, perhaps I need 1-2 bandages more than before, but nerf wasn't as horrid as I first feared.<br>
