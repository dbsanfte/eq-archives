Removing his snow covered boots, the Merchant from Halas went over to the wood pile in the corner to fetch wood to re-start the fire which was reduced to just glowing embers in the fireplace.<br>
<br>
“Warmth from a raging fire, and some ale is what I really need” Thought Leopok.<br>
<br>
From the corner a robed figure emerges from the shadows. Silently and stealthily he moves behind the unsuspecting Barbarian.<br>
Turning, his arms full of wood, Leopok drops his load in surprise as he confronts the hooded dark visitor.<br>
<br>
“Who are you and what do you want?” Asks Leopok, no sign of fear in his voice or his eyes. <br>
“The question is,…. what do You want Leopok Terrilon?” Replies the shadow in a low, soft gravelly voice.<br>
<br>
Realization dawns on Leopok and he thinks back to several months ago.<br>
It was with a heavy heart that Leopok asked a rogue in his shop one day for help. The attentive Halfling agreed and listened quietly to the heart-wrenching story,<br>
<br>
A peaceful, quiet, honest man, his fighting days long past, Leopok struggled with all his heart about the decision he had made. His younger sister, Greta Terrilon had recently married Ulrich McManus, a young guard in the Halas regiment. The marriage seemed good to the outside eye, but the stark reality was that Ulrich was a boorish drunk who beat and abused his wife. Knowing this, Leopok had many times urged his sister to leave Ulrich, but she never could.<br>
One day he received word that his sister was found dead near the entrance to Blackburrow. When the guards questioned Ulrich about his wife’s death, he merely stated that they had a quarrel the night before and Greta had left in a fury. The body was found near a dead Gnoll, the presumption that it had surprised the much larger Greta and somehow got in a killing blow before finally dying at the Barbarian’s hand.<br>
Leopok knew better, indeed everyone knew that there was no way a Gnoll would have ever considered attacking an armed Barbarian, female or not. One thing that was never explained was Greta’s badly battered face. Ulrich was guilty but instead of being imprisoned, the understaffed regiment sent him to an outpost in the Karanas.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Please sit down” Leopok told the shadowy visitor motioning to his table.<br>
“I’ll stand” was the curt reply<br>
“Can I get you anything?”<br>
“No”<br>
“How much will this cost me?”<br>
“We’ll discuss that when the job is done. Show me your sister’s grave”<br>
<br>
<br>
Ulrich McManus strolled in the warm sunshine, the breeze off the lake carrying the scent of fish through the small fishing village in the Southern part of West Karana. <br>
In a particularly nasty mood this morning from having drunk too much the night before, Ulrich was heading towards the enclosure where Frostbite was barking and snarling at something.<br>
<br>
“Damn wolf barking so early in the morning disturbing my sleep. I’ll give him something to bark at” fumed Ulrich, sporting a short cudgel in his massive hand.<br>
<br>
“Shut up!” screamed Ulrich at the cowering animal, cudgel raised for a third blow.<br>
<br>
Ulrich missed the telltale chant of the Necromancer a few feet away because of his yelling. Like a thousand needles pricking his body, the powerful dot seared through Ulrich’s mind and he instantly drops the cudgel. Reaching for his sword, he spins to face a huge skeleton wielding a wickedly curved scythe and a short hooded figure enshrouded in a black robe. Heading to engage the skeleton, Ulrich hears soft chanting and is suddenly gripped with darkness and a terror so fierce that he wets himself. He turns to run away from the swinging skeleton but his legs move no faster than a slow walk, his body and mind paralyzed. <br>
<br>
Blurry light. Blue coming into focus. White starting to form. He is looking up at the clear blue sky.<br>
<br>
Ulrich realizes in horror that he is lying on his back. The powerful poison still coursing through his body, agonizingly slow and paralyzing him. Standing over him is the skeleton with Scythe raised, unmoving. <br>
He hears the fall of footsteps nearby as the shadowy figure gets down on one knee and comes into view.<br>
<br>
Removing the hood to reveal glowing green eyes, the Dark-elf whispers softly into Ulrich’s ear; “Arma Aquetatis. Equal Justice.”<br>
<br>
Motioning towards the skeleton he says to Ulrich, “Greta’s beautiful now isn’t she?”<br>
<br>
The last emotions to run through Ulrich were desolation and revulsion. The scythe came down, parting Ulrich’s head from his shoulders. <br>
“Hmmmm…..” an idea forming in the Necro’s head. With a big evil grin, the shadowy figure takes his scythe back from the motionless pet. The skeleton of Greta Terrilon reaches down and picks up the severed head of her husband, then slowly starts clacking it’s way to the middle of the fishing village.<br>
Word would travel to Halas quickly. Leopok would hear the news. <br>
The Necro had no intention of returning to Halas for payment. This was a favor for Squink.<br>
<br>
Straining to hear over the breeze, snippets of conversation could be heard coming up the path.<br>
He relaxes at once when he recognizes the banter between Cabertoss and Jobrien. The two are teasing each other incessantly, creating enough noise to wake the dead. “Rookies” he says aloud, amusingly.<br>
<br>
Today was starting out to be an excellent day indeed, he thought. With a flowing motion of his robe, and a mischievous grin, Lethall Dosage set off to intercept his arriving friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
My first encounter with<br>
Lethall Dosage - ARMA AQUETATIS<br>

Level 39 DeathMaster<br>
&quot;What do you want to KILL today?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh is that smell your blood boiling?&quot;<br>
