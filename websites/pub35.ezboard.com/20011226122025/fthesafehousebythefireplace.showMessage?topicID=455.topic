<br>
Logged in at Mistmoore, and got a quick ride back to WC (thanks Jelly), hit Befallen and got my lockpick up to 125, snuck into Freeport and got my gem case. Spent the next hour trying to sell some of the stuff I had sitting in the bank, I was still trying to save up enough money for the gem for the BR quest. Decided to heck with it, and created a scavenger hunt for newbies in Nektulos and give a bunch of the stuff as prizes instead. Another guy came along, gave me a +2 int ring to add to the prizes, and he and I went to buy some booze and handed that out to all at the Newbie Log in Nektulos as well. A good time was had by all, about 20 folks got drunk and I handed out a few lightsones, 4-5 +stat rings, and a split paw tunic, all to newbies.<br>
<br>
What goes around comes around...<br>
<br>
I decided to head to SolA and see about the rest of the BR Quest. I get inside and /ooc asking if anyone is around the Outcast, and would kill her and let me loot the purse. I get /tells from 2 folks, a 32 rogue (Kulamorm) and a 49 paladian (Cazba). They chat with me a bit about the quest etc, and next thing I know Kulamorm is in front of me and hands me a Clockwork Oil Stout and Cazba is standing there and tells me he's going to clear a path so I can get back to the High Shaman's room (where the Outcast is supposed to be). It gets better though... Kulamorm joins us, and we make our way deep into SolA. Cazba is whacking stuff left and right and tells me to turn off auto-split and start looting. It was a darn good thing there is a goblin merchant in there, FS weapons weigh a ton! Cazba mentioned he had gotten a rogue blade the night before and was trying to figure what it was worth, neither of us 2 rogues knew, but we both knew it was good (can't remember the stats or name now, sorry). So Cazba says to heck with it, both of you roll 1 - 1000. I roll a 54, Kulamorm rolls 958 (something like that, I was totally blown away). Cazba hands the blade to Kulamorm and says, now do you have a blade you are replacing to give to Kirrae? Kulamorm says sure thing, and hands me an Obsidian Shard! Well that was it for me, this was an amazing day right there. I had been wanting one of these babies, but there was no way I could get one while saving for the gem. <br>
<br>
But it still gets better!<br>
<br>
We make it all back there, and the Outcast isn't there. We camped the rooms for a bit, hoping for the Outcast and the High Shaman to turn up (Kulamorm wanted a band from him). A few misfortunes and Kulamorm and Cazba died (never go afk back there). Got them ressed, went back, HS showed up and dropped a totem (Kulamorm got that). Another misfortune, Kulamorm and I died. Got our bodies and decided to try to make up some exp for a while instead. Cazba led us over to another area, I died again (I hate that lava). Got ressed, and another guy joined us, level 34 (I think) cleric, Carbez. Cazba ungrouped and pulled, and the other 3 of us started whacking on stuff. The clockwork guy with the Charred Guardian Shield popped, and we got him! We rolled, and guess who won the shield? WOOHOO! That's right, Kirrae won her first treasure. Shortly after this we all had to take off, so out we went. <br>
<br>
All in all, I lost a full bubble of exp, including level 24. I came out with an Obsidian Shard, Charred Guardian Shield, Firewalker Boots, the Clockwork Oil Stout, and over 100pp.<br>
<br>
The stout was the last drink I needed though (thanks to Rake for helping me get the Blood Spirits in Mistmoore!), so after hitting the bank, I high-tailed it over to Highpass and got my Gem of Stamina, which dinged me back to level 24 (about 1/2 a bub for that).<br>
<br>
Ended the day over in Kunark (for the first time) down by Lake of Ill Omen (again more thanks this time to Milamr for showing me how to get there and where to go etc). I didn't have time to do a lot there, but I'm looking forward to it tonight.<br>
<br>
SolA is very scary at level 23-24, *everything* in there was red after the first little bit. I got a few /tells from other friends while I was in there asking me wtf I was doing there at my level. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But I stuck it out, and boy am I ever glad I did! *bounce*<br>
<br>
Still no Sparkle Purse though, and it's the only think I need now. I'll be in Kunark for a bit though, I do have a new blade to play with for a while.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now you know why I play this game. <br>
<br>
I meet folk all the time that just camp in one spot for weeks so they can level. How boring. Camping for a rare spawn I can understand. Sitting in Crushbone or HighHold for weeks is not my idea of fun.<br>
<br>
I like going to meet people, see things, do some quest, get scared, get REALLY SCARED..<br>
<br>
If I didn't do that I never would have met Peebs and Nimblyfeet just to name a few.<br>
<br>
I have friends in GFay that are over level 20 and have never saw the underside of a Griffon, never ran in terror after getting bonked twice from a Sand Giant that is pissed off, never seen a Froglok. <br>
<br>
Only downside is I level slow, but if you couple your journeys with some well timed trafficing, you can put quite a bit of plat in the bank.. <br>
<br>
Things that are common in Faydwer may be rare in Antonica. Some day I will make it down to Kunark and bring them something we have that they don't and bring back some of those cool looking weps. Blackened Armor from Rivervale is UNSEEN in GFAY, Spiked Collars can be bought in Blackburrow at 3pp and sold in GFAY at 6pp. +2DEX derv rings that are plentiful in No Ro sell for up to 1p each in GFay. GFay has no Firebeetles, hence no eyes for Druid level 1 Flamelick Spells. (Do you know how many level 1 Druids are in Kelethin?!) Freeport has no fletching kits (or none that I have found), Kelethin has many. <br>
<br>
Plus try to find all the Anatonican Bards you can, to do mail runs when you are out on the road. (/em wishes there was a list of them.) I have found the ones in Ak'Anon, Felwithe, Kaladim, Kithicore and No Freeport. <p><b><i>Patofnaud</i></b><br>

I had a pretty good night myself, me and my friend went to Warsliks Wood and decided to get Bracer of Scavenging, well we ended up getting 4 and giving 2 away to some of our friends nearby. Earlier in the day I proclaimed myself first halfling to cross Cabilis, though the newbies told me otherwise. And on top of that I got in a group in Overthere with only 3 people and we had nonstop pulls for about 4 hours, I got probly 2 bubbles of exp, I can see myself leaving level 40 soon. BTW if any rogues come by Overthere and you see me, give me a tell, I'll go get you bracers of scavenging, I can actually solo the mob that drops it wooot.<br>
