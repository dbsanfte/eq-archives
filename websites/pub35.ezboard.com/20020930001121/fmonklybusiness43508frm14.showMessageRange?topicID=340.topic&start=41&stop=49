FF8 has a HORRIBLE story, i dunno what you're smoking. the battle system sucks but thats not what caused it to be the first RPG that I simply COULD NOT finish.<br>
FF9 ruled, plain and simple. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

Having played all the Final Fantasy games I could get my hands on, including the second one for the NES (got that one as a ROM, was too dated though I'd probably have liked it back in the day) I have to say this.  FF1 (for the freedom in the party creation process) is my favorite.  I love the idea of having four black belts, or a red mage a white mage and two blacck mages, etc. instead of the traditional party.  The other FF games all had the characters preset for a certain class, though they pretty much all become spellcasters from 4 through 8. 7 and 8 were the absolute worst FF games to date though (even worse than Final Fantasy Mystic Quest).  Poor storyline, poor thought to character advancement (c'mon, though few would attempt it, you could have someone master 8 fire materia all at once, and then have some insane materia combo using fire 3; and in 8 all you had to do was hold out until the main guy was alone, just landing the air ship, and then power yourself up from solo, using nothing but the stat up abilities, then get everyone else, get the cactaur GF, then power everyone else up to level 100 using the stat up abilities, making the game WAY too easy), poor thought to the combat system (especially in 8 . . . level down anyone?) made for two games I regret spending the time on.  X is a decent game, not quite as broken as 7 and 8 were characterwise but close . . . the only things going for it are the graphics, speech, and storyline.  Once you reach the end oc X and have the air ship, it is super easy to power your characters up to insane degrees (even compared to the previous FF games) through development of some insane weaponry and armor.  Most characters come very close to maxing out their stats (and need the break HP and MP barrier abilities to get the most hp and mp) when they complete the board, BTW.  9 had a pretty cool storyline (though at times I thought I was playing another PS game, Legend of Legaia, with all teh references to mist) and a decent character advancement system.  Although I'm not a fan of learning skills and such from equipment (except maybe spellbooks to teach spells) the system works well.  6 (3 on the SNES) is my fourth favorite game (and was the third until I got my hands on a copy of 5) with the battle system and the diversity (at least, initially) of the characters.  5 had a REAL cool job system, though towards the end if you build up each character through each job they all look alike. Still, I thought this game better than 6, for the innovative storyline and the way the world changes as the story progresses.  4 (2 on the SNES) is my second favorite FF game; I love the sense of urgency that most of the game had (gotta stop Golbez from doing this before he brings an end to the world, gotta hurry and save Rosa from Kain and Golbez, etc.).  1 is my favorite though, simply because I love the freedom of classes you have.  Sure, you have that freedom in 5 but its a different kind of freedom.  In 1 you select the party and thats all you have, regardless of how you design the party.  You have to start over if the party isn't what you expected.  Imagine going through 6 with a party of 4 Sabin's, for example, who cannot learn spells.  <br>
<br>
One thing I tend to hate about the FF games, however, is the overall trend toward godhood.  As the series progresses, your party tends to get even more and more powerful in the end game than in the previous one.  Chaos wouldn't last against Cecil, for example; and the sorceress in 8 wouldn't stand a chance against a souped up party in X.  Heck, get one person in X to complete the board, and only the optional bosses in the arena can withstand his attacks and come close to killing him.  I built my FFX party up in the arena against the tonberry's I'd caught in the Omega Dungeon . . . that took a while, but believe me when I say that a FFX party fully maxed out is more powerful than anything you've seen in any previous FF game.  Magimaster casting Ultima and dealing 9999 damage to everyone? Sorry, but the party I've got would laugh at a 9999 damage attack . . . and seeing Tidus deal in excess of 150000 damage with his last Blitz is insane.  I only know of one game with a higher damage potential per round. <br>
<br>
Anyone here ever play Valkyrie Profile?  That game is the only game with the higher damage than FFX . . . Such as killing an enemy with 950000 hp in one round, or taking a couple rounds to take out a boss with 2300000 hp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujurrai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1306<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/21/02 9:50:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=340.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Does Final Fantasy Ten (FFX) Suck?</span><hr size=1> I can't chime in with regards to FFX, since I have not played it yet, but I must disagree with you.  Yes, FF8 was horrible for numerous reasons, and FF7 had its flaws as well, but I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed FF7.  FF:Mystic Quest was horrible if I remember correctly, heh, and this flexability you speak of in FF1 (which I have not played <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) does, by the looks of your description, renascent once again in Final Fantasy Tactics, which is one of my Favorite FF's for that reason.<br>

Lots of plot.  The rest was not really connected together all that well, IMO.<br>
<br>
The original FF game is horribly dated by today's standards.  Party of four, you select the classes to start, and level up with experience points.  Unlike FFT or FF5 you do not get to decide upon abilities to learn, however.  All levelling does is get you better stats and hp.  Also, unlike other FF games (not sure about 2 and 3 on the NES) you have to buy your spells; there are a total of 64 spells in the game split evenly between white and black magic; your characters get to select 3 of 4 spells in a given spell rank.  The game is my favorite because of the freedom in designing your party.  If you've played FF5 or FFT before getting a copy of FF1 then you won't see it as being such freedom, however.<br>
<br>
FFX isn't really broken, not that I saw, until the end of the game.  And then only assuming you spent the time to get weapons with the Break Damage Barrier; otherwise you're stuck with doing 9999 damage each hit instead of 45000 damage in a hit.  I think Tidus was doing something like 55000 damage per hit normally at the end; he was able to down the tonberries with ease after a while, and I had to work to cycle everyone through to get the AP.<br>
<br>
And you're right, FFMQ was horrible.  I just think that FF7 and 8 were worse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utheyanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Yanger </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www1.iswest.com/theyanger/y.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 2098<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/22/02 10:25:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=340.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Does Final Fantasy Ten (FFX) Suck?</span><hr size=1> FF1 sucks because the combat is less than fun, and the story is lame.

FFT is nothing like FF1. FFT is based on the job system of FF5, which is completely different.<br>
FF1, well check out 8 bit theater for that www.nuklearpower.com/comic<br>
or www2.nuklearpower.com/comic<br>
imagine those characters, except once you pick 4 of them at the start of the game you can't change them. they change into an advanced class ONCE, but other than that. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">
