I'm not *completely* new to DAOC but I'm pretty new, and brand new to the rogue-type classes. <br><br>I got fed up with EQ for all the reasons you've heard before, I won't go into them here. So, last night I decided I would give DAOC a try. I created a Nightshade on the Tristan server and he's currently level 7. Everything seems to be great so far, but I do have some questions, though.<br><br>-I'm using some dropped armor that I picked up last night. It's conning green to me right now - should I tailor some new armor for myself, or purchase it somewhere?<br>-I was told that spec'ing in piercing and critical strike was good for now. Is that true, and what will I have to change later?<br>-How do poisons work? Do you apply them to your weapons or use them in some other way? If you apply them to your weapons, how long do they last?<br>-I tried unsucessfully to get a backstab to land. It always said &quot;you fail to execute your backstab perfectly&quot;. I was standing behind the baddie I was trying to do it to.. was I doing something wrong?<br>-In a group, what sorts of roles can I fill based on how I spec?<br>-In RvR, what roles will I fill? (mainly, I chose nightshade because I like the concept. but what specific jobs will I have in RvR? is RvR usually organized, or sort of a chaotic melee of people in one general area?)<br>-Should I be putting points into Stealth?<br>-Any other advice for me? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=toxicanti>Toxicanti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 9:01:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3535.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re</span><hr size=1> - Your armor should be yellow or orange con to you if you can afford it.

You want your armor and weapons to ideally be yellow/orange at all times. However if your new to DAoC then your funding for that will be tough. Working tradeskills is not only a good way to make money, and provide for yourself, but also allows you to become intimately familiar with crafted items and what does what. However crafting is a MUCH slower process than leveling. And tedious too. If you dont have the patience for it, then essentially farm green con mobs for money/loot and buy the armor you need. <br><br>-How to spec a nightshade isnt an easilyy answered question. Unfortunately your going to have to make your own decisions there. You definately want to keep your weapons 2/3 specc'd or higher. The Value of CS for a Shade is very questionable. Knowing what I know now, I personally would go more weapon/envenom than CS. <br><br>-You apply the poison to your weapon. When you hit with that weapon the poison is used(it either sticks or gets resisted) and will need to be reapplied. Once you envenom a weapon the poison is on there till the weapon is used. <br><br>-You have to be stealthed in order to get a backstab of. Backstab is VERY different than that of the one you may be familiar with in EQ. Backstab in DAoC for the most part is one time per fight attack. Its your hidden opener.<br><br>-In a group you can be the puller with your nuke, and then be secondary melee damage. Use your positional styles such as Pincer to do good damage, but try to keep the aggro off you as much as possible.<br><br>-Eventually yes you will want stealth as close to your character lvl as possible. Doesnt mean you have to train stealth right away. If you want to play in the Battlegrounds then you are going to need a high stealth. Example if you lvl 24, you will want your stealth naturally in the 18-20 range. You can get additional points into stealth via magic items. <br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A> at: 6/13/02 9:09:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lakeb>Lakeb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 9:32:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3535.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> young shade</span><hr size=1> Biggest help I can offer is that you need to spec high in primary weapon (be it pierce or blade) and I recommend 3/4 spec in primary weapon.  I suggest making either envenom or CS be your second highest (I chose env).  Let stealth trail behind for a while at about 1/2 level... it doesn't do you any good to sneak up on something you can't kill so use your points on something that increases your damage.<br><br>Having said this, stealth is still really important in RVR.  by the time you are 20, you really need to have 16 stealth for &quot;see invisible&quot; skill.  By 24 I recommend 18 as a minimum in Stealth.<br><br>In a group, you will fill different roles depending on who else is in the group.  If you are in a group of casters and healers, you might end up tanking.  Most of the times, you play side kick to the main tank... whatever the tank hits, you hit.  You will do good damage, but your armor lacks so you want to avoid being hit by orange  con mobs.<br><br>As you gain levels, you can round out your character and get more stealth and CS and CD.  These are all valuable but in the beginning you just don't have a lot of points to spend so you must budget.  Also, low levels there are very few items with  skill.  Once you start finding these items, you can modify your spec priorities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/utalchi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talchi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/02 9:44:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3535.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: young shade</span><hr size=1> Poison on blades is a one time use.
