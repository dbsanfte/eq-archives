I've smoked tons of dope in my<br>
life and never touched cocaine or heroin. Why ? Because I knew it was potentially very harmful.<br>
Same reason I'll have a few drinks; but not chug a 40 ouncer.<br>
It all boils down to the individual. The vast majority of people<br>
know the difference between use and abuse of intoxicants.<br>
Everyone should not be prohibited from something because<br>
of the chance some poor guy will misuse it - if that were the<br>
case, there wouldn't be much that would be legal.<br>
Here's some backup in case you're thinking we're all stoned :P<br>
<br>
From the Canadian Senate's Special Committee on Illegal Drugs, May 2002:<br>
----------------------<br>
- Marijuana is not a gateway to the use of hard drugs. &quot;There is no convincing evidence to establish the gateway hypothesis. Data from population surveys show that out of 100 cannabis users in adolescence, about 10 will become regular users and 5 will move to using other drugs.&quot;<br>
<br>
- Marijuana users are unlikely to become addicted. &quot;Research conducted internationally shows that between 8 to 10 percent of cannabis users may develop some psychological dependency, a much smaller portion than for many other drugs, illegal and legal, and comparable to some prescribed medications. ... For most dependent users, stopping use for a few days is usually sufficient to eliminate any symptoms of addiction.&quot;<br>
<br>
- Marijuana prohibition has little impact on marijuana use. &quot;Whether countries are prohibitionist such as Canada, Sweden or the USA or more liberal as in Australia, The Netherlands or Spain, levels and patterns of use vary according to other factors and are little influenced by the policy.&quot; For example, Americans by percentage use marijuana at rates nearly twice as high as their Dutch counterparts, the study found, despite more restrictive U.S. Drug War-based policies.<br>
<br>
- Marijuana use does not lead to the commission of crime. &quot;Cannabis use does not increase aggressive or anti-social behavior ... [or] ... induce users to commit other forms of crime.&quot;<br>
<br>
- Marijuana is a not a serious health risk. &quot;Cannabis may have some negative effects on the health of individuals, but considering the patterns of use, these effects are relatively benign.&quot;<br>

<br>
hmm k yes original poster the kid is a waste of space.<br>
Why? well obviously the @#%$ didn't have the Guts to @#%$ do anything  but betray his family.<br>
Family is first in all things. If your to young to appreciate that or to @#%$ up shrug its your loss but it is the truth.<br>
IF the kid said &quot;well i tried to talk to my daddy about it and he beat my ass..then i tried to call my relatives and they told me to shut the fook up well then you could see his appearent desperation(rolls eyes OMG ITS MJ!)<br>
<br>
but he didn't he figured why i'm gonna do whats right and @#%$ my family over potentially ruin dads life for the rest of his life potentially take his fatheraway from his sister and brother for their youths cuz damn it i was to much of a putz to try to work this out like the man i'm pretending to be.<br>
<br>
You always hear that saying &quot;Family Values&quot; thrown around these days ..that we have lost them...welp from most of you folks I'd have to say yep ya's have if your answer to helping your father is to destroy his life. Because if you believe pot is as bad as all that you gotta believe he needed help Right?Well nice attitude towards helping someone you should love for bringing ya into the world.<br>
<br>
Oh and na i don't smoke weed and yes i have in my youth AND HAHHAH By god i hope to hell its never legalized. Why? Just what this country needs(Canada) Another  legal reason for people to act completely retarded and moronic...boy thats a beautiful picture to sell to the world.<br>
Come to canada Drink Beer smoke Pot eat  some Canadian bacon when ya get the munchies...christ ya lets make it EASIER for everyone to become even more selfabsorbed dumbasses that just sit there looking stupid saying ME ME ME ME! I WANT MORE FOR NOTHING I WANT LESS ACCOUNTABILITY!BLAME IT ON SOMEONE ELSE..NOW PASSS ME A DUBE!  thats what i wanna see HA!<br>
<br>
Oh and of all the years and all the hundreds of people I've met that are high on pot/oil/hash..never met a violent one ...weed is not an agressive enhancement drug at all. Well unless you hog the snacks then your getting your ass handed to ya.<br>

<br>
With a little work I'm sure they could get it down to having pretty much no THC at all.

When you're already invested in<br>
the wood pulp method of paper production; it would costs<br>
millions to switch your factories to hemp as the processing<br>
involved is quite different. Not to mention divesting yourself from forestry investments . Pulp and paper interests, namely<br>
William Randolph Hearst, are mostly responsible for the illegality of marijuana. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hearst, the DuPont corporation, and Federal Bureau<br>
of Narcotics Director, Harry Anslinger  succeeded in lobbying to pass the 1937 Marihuana(sic.) Tax Act.  The prohibition on hemp was temporarily rescinded during WWII and then put back in place after the war was over.<br>
DuPont's and Hearst's roles had to do with newsprint. A method for efficiently processing hemp fiber for use as newsprint had been invented.<br>
This would have severely cut into the Hearst's forest investments for wood pulp, as well as the DuPont process for turning that wood pulp into paper.<br>
Both Hearst and DuPont fed a national hysteria to turn Reefer Madness into a national crisis-  and thus we got hemp prohibition.  &quot;<br>
<br>
Hearst was in a very powerful position to do this. He owned the largest  chain of newspapers in the country, which was<br>
his vehicle for 'whipping up public hysteria'. The phrase<br>
&quot;reefer madness&quot; was in fact invented by him.<br>
<br>
Also Dupont was heavily promoting use of the newly invented<br>
NYLON for rope, as opposed to using the traditional hemp rope. This gave further cause for Dupont to agitate against hemp. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usplendora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Splendora</A> at: 7/31/02 7:53:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukroemagnon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kroe Magnon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/happy/jestera.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 3:27:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8799.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://macmorrigan.homestead.com/files/funnyraven.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOL you folks kill me</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Well put, indeed.
