Note that all classes share the jewels but that there isnt a BP-jewel or a Arm-jewel since the jewels are used for different slots for each class. <br>
<br>
My bet is the Jewels will be the rare drop (since they are not likely to rot since SOMONE will likely need one who is around)....its like the Velious armor quests only by making the jewel set slightly different for each class you dont run into the problem of having to farm XXX area to get only Plate Bps when all other drops get wasted.  The Paladin BP gem is the Pants for Enchanter and the Arms and Girdle for a Bard.<br>
<br>
Very nice implementation!<br>

Nexus Hail Info <br>
<br>
'Hail, Fani Dertrimas' <br>
Fani Dertrimas says 'Welcome to the Nexus! Down each stairway is a hallway that leads out from the Nexus. Through those hallways you will find the great trade city of Shadow Haven, the Bazaar, and the cavern systems that lead to the surface of Luclin. Also, located in each tunnel is a teleport pad that can return you to Norrath. There is much information to be gathered here in this location. Be sure to speak to everyone and ask a lot of questions. Farewell. <br>
<br>
'Hail, Persy Clutches' <br>
Persy Clutches says 'Welcome to the center of Luclin. This is a very magical place. The magic that emanates from this place can be felt even on the surface. Because of the strong magical forces here, teleporting has become somewhat complicated. Anyone that uses a teleport on the moon seems to end up here. But once they are here, they are then able to return to Norrath be either using their teleport spell again, or by visiting one of the teleport pads located in the hallways behind me. Hopefully one day our researchers in Midst will be able to solve this problem. Don't forget to speak to as many of us as you can before you venture far. <br>
<br>
'Hail, Jayson Bri Tian' <br>
Jayson Bri`Tian says 'Ahh, welcome. It is good to see more and more people visiting now that the portals are functional. It took us many many years to understand the magical powers of Luclin. Whether through dumb luck or divine intervention, we have succeeded in opening the gate back to Norrath. How long it stays open, no one knows. My colleagues and I are here to maintain and watch for changes in the Nexus. Should anything happen, you will be notified. Safe travels. <br>
<br>
'Hail, Kardador Tarsinian' <br>
Kardador Tarsinian says 'Greetings. The passages extending from the heart of Luclin take you east to Shadow Haven, south to the Bazaar, west in the direction of the city Sseru, and north to the feline city of Shar Val. Before heading in anyone of these directions, speak to the keepers at the entrances. <br>

<br>
Horses! <br>
&gt; <br>
Just like the transportation we use in the real world, horses range widely in cost and speed, from a relatively affordable 8400pp Chevy to the 105,000pp Porche. They are summoned from a riding whip, and cannot exist <br>
at the same time as any pet or familiar. There are 4 color choices, brown, <br>
tan, white and black, 4 whip types, rope, leather, silk and chain, and sizes <br>
vary depending on your race. The summoning whips are no drop, so you'll have to buy your own pony, no Christmas gifts, but they are not lore, so if you're really rich you can buy a horse to match <br>
each outfit. <br>
You can cast on horseback, but not while riding, and no mean monsters are going to slay your horse unless they kill you first. The two of you are one! <br>
The animations are beautiful, and as a horse person in real life, I'm particularly impressed by the little touches. It takes a while for your horse to hit running speed, it will walk a few steps, trot a few steps, then speed up and race like the wind. The view is very realistic in first person view, so targetting might be a bit of an issue, and the different sizes <br>
mean the different racial heights are even more noticeable. The sound of hoofbeats as you race across the world will make you believe you can feel the wind in your hair. <br>
<br>
I'm going to have to start having foragers save me carrots. My pony deserves the very best! <br>
<br>
Available for sale at any reputable stable are sixteen types of bridle, <br>
these <br>
are split into four categories Rope, Leather, Silk and Chain (These <br>
correspond <br>
to the speed of the horses, with Rope being roughly equivalent to the speed <br>
of Journeyman's Boots and Chain being slightly slower than Spirit of The <br>
Cheetah.). The colour of each bridle corresponds to the colour of the horse <br>
Tan, Brown, White and Black. The prices can range from 10,000pp being the <br>
cheapest to 113,750pp for the most expensive (Depending on you faction with <br>
the merchants.). <br>
<br>
Now once you have purchased a bridle you will need to place it one of your <br>
main inventory slots and summon your magical steed by right clicking on the <br>
bridle. After a few seconds your mount will arrive and you will be placed <br>
upon his or her back. If you no longer require the services of your fine <br>
steed you only need click the icon in your buff window and you mount will <br>
disappear to be called again when you need him. <br>
<br>
Horses can only be summoned while outside. <br>
<br>
While riding a horse you can perform all the actions you could under normal <br>
circumstances e.g. Spell casting. <br>
<br>
Before you say what is the point of owning a horse when you can quest for <br>
Journeyman's Boots or buy a Spirit of the Wolf potion ? Well they are a <br>
status symbol for the rich and famous and look wonderful. <br>
