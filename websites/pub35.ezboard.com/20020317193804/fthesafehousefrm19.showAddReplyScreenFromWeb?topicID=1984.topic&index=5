I never played EQ, it just wasnt my type of game.<br>
I perfer more realistic medevil MMORPGs, and DAoC seems to be pretty realisitc based on the stories from that time period. <br>
<br>
I'm sorta depressed about the no stealing/snooping, but I'll live. And from some of the posts I've read, PvP does seem rather adequate compared to most online RPGs. Although, I have read a lot of bickering about it being unbalanced, and quite to the contrary it actually does seem rather well balanced from those posts that are bickering about it. LOL<br>
<br>
And yes, back in the day of UO, most thieves were griefers... But that's why I was the best-ever RP thief in UO. It takes skill to role play a thief, without anyone knowing you are a thief. :)<br>
<br>

<br>
hrm,my thoughts are tending to be negative about this game in alot of respects. just to give you some varying opinions really.please note,im pretty burned out on the whole genre of these games,most are just clones and dont really bring anything inventive or new to the table.<br>
<br>
personally for me,the game has turned into a bland boring one. now mind you this is after only 6 months. i was in beta,rogues werent implemented until the end of beta.<br>
<br>
GAME ISSUES: <br>
<br>
The world is completely static,your actions have no real impact upon the world. the game is also extremly one dimensional,in that its about combat,and more combat,and well combat between players, umm did i forget to mention the combat? strategy is non existant in the game,in terms of the overall realm picture,and in terms of rvr combat and its effects and outcomes. RVR between individuals has strategy,RVR as a general rule does not.<br>
<br>
<br>
in RVR i have a real problem with the fact that level means everything. basically your level vs enemies level will determine if you win or lose. theres no real skill in attacking a higher level player if your in a group,theres no challange to killing numerous green/grey con players. also note,that there is a lack of strategy both in small group and large scale rvr.  big issue here is theres no real forced interaction between realms.<br>
<br>
alot of this is server dependent,so picking a good server will probably be paramount to you if you plan on playing for a long time.NOTE: there is some strategy in going against other stealthed players 1 on 1,however theres a general lack of overall skill or strategy to the game itself.<br>
<br>
PVE combat, is just a tool to allow people to level. In EQ PVE was the game,and there was some challange to working together to defeat large scale &quot;UBER&quot; mobs. that was the driving force behind the game. granted it was a game of gimme my new toys to replace my old toys. PVP there was more of an afterthought. Here,its just designed so that you will level up,so that you can then participate in rvr. most people in the level 10-30 range dont go out on the frontier ever,its dominated by level 35+ players,with most being 40+. this means your going to spend alot of time playing whack a mole till your big enough.<br>
<br>
the lack of forced interaction between realms,is a major issue, since the game is designed around realm combat. theres no real reason to take enemy keeps,nor any reward to do so. taking relics in reality means very little.<br>
<br>
ROGUE ISSUES: just let me state that by rogues i mean the 3 meelee classes. <br>
<br>
1. basically rogues in each realm are carbon copies of each other,theres no differance between playing a shadowblade and playing a nightshade. The only exception to that is how you spec your rogue is the only differance in how you will end up playing him. <br>
<br>
2. class is completely incomplete in terms of what the classes should be. granted theres alot of differance of opinion on what the 3 realms rogues should be,but.... were cookie cutter copies of each other. theres no real differance in each realm,theres no unique abilitys or skills to use.<br>
<br>
3. the class has serious problems to me,in terms of ability to play. essentially to boil it down,your first 40 levels your weak,and after 41 you get to be pretty powerful. problem is you shouldnt play 40 levels to suddenly turn into what mythic has designed the class as. i still state that the class is inherently broken,given the fact that rogues suddenly come into there own at level 40. theres to many areas of issue to break them all down,but until your end game,the class really isnt all that playable. tolerable yes,but not playable.<br>
<br>
4. rogues as a rule,dont bring anything to groups, this means that rogues are less wanted in group situations,unless you have a good guild,or friends who also play and will support you grouping needs. spending 1-3 hours looking for a group everytime i log in,while i can watch as others get groups in 5 minutes,just reinforces this. granted only certain classes get groups with little effort,its human nature,problem is mythic hasnt implemented any tools to overcome this. <br>
<br>
before anyone flames me,im not ranting about the game,im trying to state what my opinions are,and why the game for me fails. i dont hate the game,rather im disapointed that a game that had potential to be groundbreaking ends up being rather mundane. <br>
<br>
CLOSING:<br>
<br>
For me DAOC turned into a pitstop ,while waiting for something truly new,or mabye old&lt;NWN&gt; to come along that will truly recreate what these games should be about,and what rogues should be about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unyvinyd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyvinyd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 8:01:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1984.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jurassic5.com/images/index_logo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: General DAOC Questions</span><hr size=1> In my humble opinion...<br>
<br>
When I play an MMORPG I really just play it for the MMO.  As far as I've seen, MMORPGs are like porn.  The more story you put into it, the worse it gets.  DAoC has changed this slightly by taking away story but giving it a very good choice of environment.  In UO there were dungeons, mountains, caves,  and forests.  In DAoC, you basically just pick whatever realm seems appealing and you'll be just fine.<br>
<br>
All the classes are KIND OF balanced in PvE.  Just about everything can solo a yellow, some can solo an orange if you plan it right.<br>
<br>
Also about the classes...  I REALLY like the skill system for this game.  Unlike EQ, you can choose what kind of character you are.  In EQ, you were a rogue and then your initial stats and equipment were everything. to seperate you from your fellow rogue.<br>
<br>
In DAoC, however, you can make yourself a berserker-esque rogue, a poisoner, a critical striker, whatever you want, really.<br>
<br>
One last note when/if you start up.  Here's the basic test I use (and it's worked so far) to choose what realm you'd be best suited for.  You need to clear away a bunch of small trees (think 1-3 inches in diameter).  Which would you rather use to clear them away?  Would you rather use an axe, a saw, or a machete?<br>
<br>
Axe = Midgard (RARR!! CLEAR AWAY TREE SMASH!)<br>
<br>
Saw = Albion (Efficient.  Clean.  Mechanical.)<br>
<br>
Machete = Hibernia (Light and somewhat flashy.  Sharp.  For people who don't really want to use brute strength, nor do they want to be on their knees.) <p><center><img src=http://www.rockapella.com/IMAGES/rocktype.gif></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufricka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fricka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 1:14:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1984.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: General DAOC Questions</span><hr size=1> My input on a few things.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Static world</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
DAoC is less of a static world than EQ is. In EQ the uber mobs would fall and simply respawn. In DAoC if a relic falls everyone in the realm that won the relic gets a bonus of either power or strength depending on which relic was won.<br>
<br>
You can also check your realm status of keep and fastes at the Herald. An example: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/realms/Percival/">www.camelotherald.com/realms/Percival/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This is all in addition to the general community feeling that having three realms at war with each other brings. Each server has it's own history and it pays to know it. This was somewhat true on EQ PvP servers, but not as much on blue (none PvP) EQ servers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Uber mobs&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you must have uber mobs, Mythic is putting them in. Dragons are already on test, a type of &quot;planes&quot; is also on test. Remember that most of EQ's &quot;uber mobs&quot; and planes took a long time to show up in the game. Mythic is putting them in before its first year is up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> In regards to choosing a realm</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Read the descriptions and choose an environment that feels right for your character but if you want a quick way...<br>
<br>
Dominant colors of each realm and their &quot;mood&quot;:<br>
<br>
Albion: Green and brown. Arthur used to live here, &quot;Proper&quot;<br>
Hibernia: Bright green with colorful accents. &quot;Whimsical&quot;<br>
Midgard: Brown, darker green and white. &quot;Rugged&quot;<br>
<br>
These are my movie companions for each realm:<br>
