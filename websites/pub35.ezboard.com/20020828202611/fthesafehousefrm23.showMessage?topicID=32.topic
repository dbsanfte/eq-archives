<br>
You get detect hidden ability when you attain a natural 16 spec in stealth.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2) Who gets detect hidden?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The detect hidden ability is given only to assassin classes (nightshade, shadowblade, infiltrator).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  3) How does detect hidden work?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Long answer, so first a few definitions:<br>
<br>
Hider - The person that is stealthed<br>
<br>
Seeker - The person seeking the stealthed person<br>
<br>
/loc unit - Distance measured in the units that /loc gives you.  /loc prints the location as 4 numbers.  The x location, the y location, the z location and the directional facing, based on 360 degree compass reading. 0 = north.  Distance between two points: sqrt( (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 )   One human-sized horse is approximately 125 /loc units long.<br>
<br>
Characters with the detect hidden ability are able to detect a hider within a minimum detect radius that depends on the class of the hider.<br>
<br>
When seeking an archer class, the minimum radius of detection is 250 /loc units.  When seeking other assassins, the minimum radius of detection is 125 /loc units.  For each character level of the seeker higher than the spec level of stealth of the hider, add 50 /loc units to this radius.  <br>
<br>
For characters without the detect hidden ability, the minimum distance for seeing all hiders is 125 /loc units, adding 20 units to the radius for each character level of the seeker above the spec level of stealth of the hider.<br>
<br>
In both cases, if the stealth level of the hider is higher than the character level of the seeker, the appropriate minimum detect radius is used.  For purposes of hider stealth spec, items and realm rank bonuses are included.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4) So, does stealth over 50 help me?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
With the way detect hidden works, no.  Your targets in RvR are a max level of 50.  And since it compares your stealth to their level, anything over 50 means that their detect radius will be the minimum distance (125 /loc units).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 5) Does the z-axis have anything to do with the calculations?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I have to say that for the time being, I don't know.  All my testing was done on flat ground.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6) Why don't I see stealthers sometimes even though I know they are within my detect radius?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The client receives stealthed char info about once every 3 seconds.  So depending on where you are and where they are when that 3 second 'tick' happens, it's possible to walk right by someone without being seen if you get lucky.  Never assume you're safe though, would be my advice. <p>-- Huff McTuff, 41 Nightshade, Pendragon<br>

<br>
It's interesting to see that the z radius isn't taken into account at all...that would explain why I've yet to have anybody surprise me at the climb wall spots when I've been guarding them.<br>
<br>
Does this also mean, though, that every single time I've been killing casters and the such they've SEEN me and simply stood there waiting to be cut down? There has got to be more to this for those without stealth/detect hidden, isn't there? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwirt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wirt</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.computerpro.com/~wirt/Wirt.GIF" BORDER=0> at: 3/23/02 10:04:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usquinkmcpoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squink McPoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 4:41:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden FAQ</span><hr size=1> All my distance tests were on flat ground, so I don't have an answer for you on the z-axis question.<br>
<br>
The client is updated about once every 3 seconds with regards to &quot;is there a stealthed character within the detect radius based on my level and his stealth&quot;, so a moving stealther (depending on timing) may appear right at the edge of the detect radius, or not at all, depending on when the 3-second 'tick' falls.  So in that regard it's simply luck of the draw in a lot of cases.<br>
<br>
And your question about 51 stealth .. should read 50 stealth, then the answer would be &quot;yes&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uditherdaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dither DAoC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 5:19:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/dither/smiley2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden FAQ</span><hr size=1> in order for the casters to get line of sight,t hey cant pan out like we do when we check climb points.  also, many people simply dont know where climb points are, nor the finer details of stealth and detection.

<br>
     You said, &quot;When seeking an archer class, the MINIMUM radius of detection is 250 loc units. When seeking other assassins, the MINIMUM radius of detection is 125 loc units... For characters without the detect hidden ability, the MINIMUM distance for seeing all hiders is 125 loc units...&quot;<br>
<br>
     Reading this literally I take this to mean that an Infiltrator (whose character level equals the stealth level of the hider) with the detect hidden ability could see a stealthed archer 250 or more loc units away, but could not detect him if he moved closer to say 200 loc units and that other assassins like Nightshades or Shadowblades (who should have even better stealthing abilities) fare worse because the infiltrator can see them at 125 loc units or more away and that they would need to move within 125 loc units of the Infiltrator to be truly invisible.  Additionally, a pally or cleric of equal level without detect hidden would have the advantage of being able to see both archers and assassins 125 loc units away whereas the Infiltrator could see the assassin but not the archer at that distance.  This is counterintuitive because I would think that the farther away the hider moves from the seeker the harder it is for the seeker to see him.  Therefore I am hoping you meant &quot;maximum radius&quot; not &quot;minimum radius.&quot;   Please help me out here.  <br>
<br>
      And since we are on the subject of things that confuse me, I am hoping someone can answer this question (Yes, I am a bit of a newb, my Infiltrator is only lvl 16): If indeed you did mean maximum radius then if I am 100% spec'd in stealth how can I pull off a perforate artery on an even con enemy (one without detect hidden)?  I assume that I would need to be within one horse length (125 loc units) for me to pull this off and therefore could not do it in this scenario because I would be seen.  Does your stealth spec have to be higher then the level of your intended victim to be able to pull of a PA?  And if so, how much?  How many loc units do you deduct from the 125 loc unit radius of detection per stealth point above your enemy's level?  And if I had enough stealth spec points above enemy level to reduce the radius to zero does that mean I can never ever be seen by that enemy unless I unstealth?<br>

Rogues get to see all non rogue stealthers at 2x the distance of everyone else, making them the best at finding archers and minstrels, but the same at finding other rogues(which is fine, because it is hard as hell to find another rogue, as it should be).<br>
<br>
125 units is like 2 paces, PA'ing even red is pretty easy.  evens dont stand a chance, unless they are actively looking for you.<br>

Minimum detection radius - this is the smallest that your &quot;I can see stealthed people&quot; bubble will ever get.<br>
<br>
The bubble expands or contracts depending on the stealth/class of the person hiding, and expands or contracts depending on your level and whether you have the detect hidden ability yet or not.<br>
<br>
However, the min radius is the smallest that the bubble will ever get, no matter what stealth/class or level/DH. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaureliuscov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurelius CoV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/02 10:42:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden FAQ</span><hr size=1> just FYI, z-axis isnt taken into account.

At first I swapped it out with a different cloak because the original white made the stealthed cloak black and not transparent.  However, I decided to switch to the guild cloak because it gave me one more stealth.  I would have to say that people in my own realm see the black of the cloak, but the Hibs and Mids don't see the cloak.  I can still cross paths with a stealthed enemy and usually get the upper hand/attack on them.  Of course this is just from my experience and the way it really works I do not know.  I will however keep wearing the cloak that gives me the better stealth. <p><center><IMG SRC="http://www.rlk2.com/eq/javanet_sig_file.jpg" ALT="Javanet Billboard" WIDTH="460"

<br>
Stealth spec-level above my char level is still advantageous because its the stealth level that counts, not my char level, when comparing to the seeker's char level, correct? (this is for the below 50th level scenario)<br>
<br>
Does being detected (seen) mean that you lose stealth or just that you can be seen tranparently?  The former means no PA or BS, the latter means you need to get it off quickly before they hit you with something and break stealth, no?<br>
<br>
If someone comes within my detect radius and I see them, how does the 3 second rule work...they stay detected for at least three seconds or just for as long as they are within my detection radius?  Does this also mean that they could enter my radius just after a 3 second &quot;sweep&quot; occurred and remain unseen for the next three seconds?<br>

While in the 30-35 BG, there was an infiltrator who continually attempted to climb the walls. Now I have 28+7 stealth in RvR, but she still could see me before I saw her, at last on flat ground. When I stood on top of the keep wall, turned my character around so he faced away from the stealther, and looked down, I saw her come into view while she was about 2 steps away from the base of the wall. Mind you, this was from the top of a keep wall. I could see her come up, all the way, but once I moved a couple steps off the wall, she vanished again (til I shouted on her, and bowmen stuck her ass to death, hehe).<br>
<br>
Anyways, guild cloaks ARE completely black in RvR, and they are a dead giveaway. Go match your cloak with your armor color, accessorize, make yourself an outfit even Martha Stewart would be proud of. I'm Rust/Royal Orange... hehe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uditherdaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dither DAoC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/12/02 10:33:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/dither/smiley2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden FAQ</span><hr size=1> lets gets this sticky <p><a href="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=38056&raceid=10&classid=44">Dither Disgustipated</a><BR>
