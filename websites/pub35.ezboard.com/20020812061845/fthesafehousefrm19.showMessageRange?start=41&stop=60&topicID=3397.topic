Do you encounter that problem only when you use the /stick command and it turns you to face the opponent?  I have had this happen several times (but it is not really reproducable.. mainly crappy luck).  If you look closely at your dmg lists what is happening is you start to do a PA and a double hit.  However somehow the PA part gets lost but your dual weild offhand hit still is there.  I have brought this up but the problem is since it is so random it is hard to track down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bloodreign>bloodreign</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 3:07:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fighting Infils and SBs</span><hr size=1> Zedie,<br>
I also was evaded by an SB on a perf attempt the other day.  It pissed me off so bad because he evaded both my perf and off-hand swings, while still stealthed, and managed to get a perf on me.  I took a screenshot of it and would be happy to send it to you.  In the screenshot, you can clearly see I become unhidden after my perf attempt was evaded and was hit by the sb. <br>

On the enchanter using PBAE that is new.. I was going to ask to see if there might have been an archer using true sight keeping you from stealthing but that would not effect your poisons.  Is this reproduceable at all?

When you look at your chat box does it say the &quot;you begin to perform PA&quot; then does not give you a fail message?  Also is the hit with your main or offhand weapon?<br>
<br>
In the instances I have seen I start to do a PA but then it just skips the acutal PA and hits with my offhand.  If it was a failed PA you would get hte message and swing with your main (always swing main on a style) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 2:30:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theblackwatch.biz/Balor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hm.</span><hr size=1> double post. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A> at: 6/18/02 2:32:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 2:31:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theblackwatch.biz/Balor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hm.</span><hr size=1> It's Balor<br>

Ok, this is what I got<br>
<br>
You attempt to perform a Perforate Artery.<br>
You are no longer hidden.<br>
You hit Smitar with your rapier for 45(+8).<br>
<br>
THOSE are the ones I have a problem with.  They can say that I just failed my PA but didn't get the message, but I say that's complete BS.  That's the message I was getting back when this bug was in the first time.<br>
<br>
These are the normal misses<br>
<br>
You attempt to perform a Perforate Artery.<br>
You are no longer hidden.<br>
You fail to perform a perforate artery perfectly.<br>
You hit Smitar for 45(+7)<br>
<br>
I can live with those.<br>
<br>
Now, on top of it.. every now and again I get...<br>
<br>
You attempt to perform a Perforate Artery<br>
You are no longer hidden<br>
Sosar has evaded your attack<br>
You fail to perform a perforate artery perfectly.<br>
You hit sosar for some subpar crap piercing damage.<br>
<br>
THAT sucks too?  Can they confirm that PA is supposed to be able to be evaded now?  I really don't think the counted on the effectiveness of Dodger III.   It rocks.<br>
<br>
Smitar is a smite cleric<br>
Sosar is a scout<br>

I at least know better which bug this is..<br>
When you do a successful PA you get the 'unhidden' message AFTER the PA style.  However in your case (and some others where people have sent me screenshots) for some reason or other you become visible right BEFORE you try to PA.  And this does not give you a fail message.  So far we don't know what causes it and have not been able to find a reliable way to reproduce it but it has been passed to mythic.  And sorry about the name.. was going from memory when writing =P (yes.. I know I could have scrolled down when posting just did not think of it)<br>

<br>
1) Why are players causing us to become visible?<br>
2) Why is there no message (as there is when a monster reveals you) saying if it is in fact because we are being revealed:<br>
<br>
You are no longer hidden!<br>
You attempt to perform a Perforate Artery!<br>
You Fail to perform your Perforate Artery perfectly.<br>
You hit Maul for 20(-20).<br>
<br>
I as well can accept the positional requirements, and failing because of that.<br>
<br>
This is extremely frustrating because it is a bug from release that seems to be happening a LOT more often now, like ~10% of the time.<br>
<br>
I think the people that are claiming to have PA evaded are simply experiencing this bug.  What is happening in that case (just like above) is that instead of doing a PA like you planned you are just doing a normal swing.  As we know, non-styled attacks are much more easily evaded. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ukreigmeister.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreigmeister</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 5:57:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Evades</span><hr size=1> Nope there is definately an evade of PA happening. I'm very careful about reviewing my post death logs. Since I was asked to provide some proof i screenshot every PA failure that seems questionable to me. I have a nice portfoilio of PA failure screenshots.<br>
<br>
The one thing that caught my attention was that I was using F8 to target enemies and would get revealed before PA happened. It rarely happens when i don't use F8. <br>
<br>
When I don't use F8 and PA fails generally it's because of the location bug i reported on my first post of the thread. Stuff like &quot;Target not in View&quot; or &quot;Target not in Range&quot; when clearly my screen shows i'm in a very good position for PA.<br>
<br>
Right now i can successfully pull a PA off about 10-20% of the time in RvR and it fails about 10% of the time in PvE. Since I am mostly CS spec'd this causes me alot of deaths. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uosteon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Osteon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 6:12:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fighting Infils and SBs</span><hr size=1> Sorry Zed didn't check this post for a while but it seems like you've nailed down the bug im talking about.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uinfinital.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Infinital</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 6:17:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.midsouth.rr.com/yamahaman/lostboy/ff8gifs/moods/restless.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NS report time comming up.. any new concerns?</span><hr size=1> the lack of being able to find a damn stealth item.

I really think that the Perforate Artery itself is being evaded.<br>
<br>
If it wasn't, then the fail message would come BEFORE the evade message ;)<br>

Hope ya understand.<br>

Please Zel, keep us posted on what Mythic is going to do about this.  It's getting quite frustrating on a class that is already frustrating enough to play.  <br>

(sorry for late response, my earlier post got eaten <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
This has been in game prior to the addition of True Sight, so it definately is not that. My guild has a full mana spec enchanter that I group with a lot. I only have problems with retealth/poisoning when in group with her (I doubt it's just an enchanter thing, I just don't happen to group with any mana eldritches with any regularity). It's most noticeable when on keep raids since I jump the wall to get healed/restealth/repoison after killing guards. It's not a case of me being hit by archers who never lose aggro (this should be fixed too btw. It's absolutely stupid that if I happen to aggro the tower archers, who can't see me anyway, I can run out of range, stealth, and when I get back into their range they immediately hit me again even though I'm stealthed. It makes me useless until those archers can be killed).<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure that when the enchanter hits a mob with pbae, the entire group gets counted as being in combat. Since we keep enchanter speed going all the time, it's pretty obvious when this happens. We can stop to kill aggros in the middle of nowhere, and even though I never draw my weapons or cast a spell, I lose speed and I can't stealth. <br>
<br>
Just so you can really see how bad this is, here are some lines from my chat logs. I am grouped with Madalen, a 48 spec mana enchanter and we're on a keep raid. Madalen regularly pbae's the guard repops while I go up the walls to take care of defenders/archers. It's edited; this is just to show how long I am unable to stealth for.<br>

(this is the last time I actually hit someone; at this point I jumped the wall; the full log shows a bunch of spam from me hitting the stealth key, and I have no aggro from archers so my timer isn't being reset because of that. I should be able to restealth by 19:08:0<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I couldn't figure out the reason, and am not 100% sure that the enchanter thing is it, but it definitely happened most often in keep raids. Very annoying bug. Nothing like running up to a keep without having swung a weapon in 5 minutes and being told you have been in combat too recently to stealth. Its definitely NOT Truesight, the message you get for that is that an enemy is too close to hide.<br>
