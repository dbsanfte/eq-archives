No changes can be expected that would harm or even inconvenience the pve game on blue servers. Yet pvp basicly requires everything to be tuned FOR pvp to really work well. Everywhere you look there are holes in the pvp game that exist because EQ is a pve game. How do you fill those holes without killing verants cash cow? <br><br>Well it takes work. Its not as simple as changing spell x because while spell x may be fubar in pvp its quite balanced allready pve wise. What must be done is spells/skills/abilities MUST be coded to work differently when used in pvp. This is harder. This requires more work than opening up a database and changing an entry but it has to be done to really make eq pvp better.<br><br>1) Item loot is broken beyond repair. Its been discussed before and will be again. I wont go over it here. Make it optional but permenant. Make it something like turning in your tome to the pod. Must be done by like say 30. This should satisfy pvpers who are for and against item loot. Except for the gankers.<br><br>2) Mannaburn should either be made non pve or should have the following changes implimented to make it an interesting pvp tool rather than a gimp burn. I feel that if players felt balanced at all lvls and lameness was avoided elsewhere in the game people wouldn't take offense at the change to this skill which is nothing more than a wet dream to most wizards at this point. <br><br>It should be limited to 1000 pvp dmg or 1/2 of the players max hp whichever is less.<br><br>It should say a msg when they begin to cast, such as so and sos hands begin to glow with a terrible light. Whatever.<br><br>If withing 5 minutes of first trying to cast it no mannaburn has been cast the timer should have to reset.<br><br>The timer should be changed to 72 minutes like HT<br><br>3) HT should be limited to doing 40% of a players max hp<br><br>4) Dmg discs should be limted to doing 1/2 max of a players max hp in one round.<br><br>All normal nukes and normal melee combat rounds including crits should be capped at 1/3 of a players max hp.<br><br>5) Dispelling should be fixed. Specificly give melees channeling skill and make player dispells ignore insta clicky effects. In this manner dispelling will be a viable strategy as it must be without being an overpowered one as with wands.<br><br>6) Horses are fubar. Make it possible to backstab someone who is riding possibly by simply giving bs a slightly longer range. Further make it possible to bs from horseback and work on any bugs that still exist that would prevent casting on someone on horseback.<br><br>7) Cut a character off from their char (not all chars) for 10 minutes after pvp death to prevent bind rushing.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Give all weapons, haste items, regen items on pvp servers a recommended lvl.<br><br>9) Institute a resist cap on pvp serversfor lower lvls to prevent BD pvp twinking, not too strict though.<br><br>10) Limit lifeburn in a similar manner to MB<br><br>Tweaking melee AND caster dmg. The next set of suggestions are about tuning both melee and spell dmg on a case by case basis based on who they are up against. The purpose of this is not to eliminate the differences in the class nor to make everyone perfectly balanced against everyone else. The purpose is to make everyone balanced enough that things get interesting. If you look at it and think the idea is to make you weaker and melees stronger your not getting the point. Both would situationally be adjusted.<br><br>11) Institute spell dmg reduction tables as per my earlier suggestion. That suggestion is as follows.<br><br>Each class gets a table that decides what the pvp spell dmg reduction is in different instances rather than have a flat 66%. You get a new table for each lvl range.<br><br>Each table contains values like this<br><br>Wiz table 20-29<br>dmg vs wizards x %<br>dmg vs warriors x %<br><br>and so on with a table for each class and each lvl range giving the changing degree of reduction for each match up.<br><br>12) Melee dmg reduction/increase and to hit tables. Very similar to the caster tables only they would describe the different classes chances to hit and average dmg in all possible match ups at different lvl ranges.<br><br>13) Spell tweaking. Each spell should be tweakable as far as its pvp performance both as far as resists and dmg. It should be able to have it's own dmg mofifier much like the 2/3 one that is in effect for all pvp spells that would allow verant to tweak its performance up and down in pvp independant of spell reduction tables. Example... Ice comet<br>The wiz lvl 50-54 table could look like<br>wizard dmg vs warrior 70%<br>Ice comet could have a +10% modifier if verant felt the need to boost its pvp performance thus most pvp spells would do 70% of max pve dmg vs a warrior but ice comet would do 77%<br><br>As far as resists that allready exists but only one variable is used for both pve and pvp, example..<br><br>Resistance Check: Cold<br><br>or<br><br>Resistance Check: Cold +25 meaning the target has +25 to his save before the check is made.<br><br>If a seperate save mofifier were created spells could be tuned better for pvp.<br><br>14) Fix charm poofing pets. It's about time<br><br>15) Nerf insta gate. Pvp without risk is bs. Remove the pvp usefullness but keep the pve uses intact. How do you do this? Every time pvp is initiated between 2 parties flip a flag and start a 5 minute timer for both. Each time pvp of some form occurs start the timer over. When the timer expires flip the flags to neutral. While the flags are flipped insta gate will not fuction.<br><br>16) The LOS check for spells should be done only at the start of the cast to prevent people ducking around corners to avoid nukes from people within LOS while still preventing exploiting.<br><br>I'm sure I missed many issues that deal with classes I have no experience with.

At least the people who are too afraid to wear items now die easier.  Item loot makes the server interesting.<br><br>&quot;2) Mannaburn should either be made non pve....&quot;<br><br>Should just leave it at that.  Any of these other changes are A) too hard for Verant to code in just for 4 servers<br>B) make Manaburn silly and useless anyway.  Who the hell would use all their mana for 1k dmg.  <br><br>&quot;4) Dmg discs should be limted to doing 1/2 max of a players max hp in one round.&quot;<br><br>What kind of happy fun basketfull of puppies world do you want to live in?  Why not just turn the pvp servers back to pre-kunark.  Avoiding melees is the easiest thing in the world, no reason a Melee should be doing a full round on you unless there is teamwork involved or he's a monk with a t-staff.  Now, say that t-staff proc should be resistable and I'll agree.<br><br>&quot;5) Dispelling should be fixed. Specificly give melees channeling skill and make player dispells ignore insta clicky effects. In this manner dispelling will be a viable strategy as it must be without being an overpowered one as with wands.&quot;<br><br>I'll agree with ignoring clicky effects, but give melees channeling?  Are you on crack?  Why not just give clerics 252 1hb and double attack.  <br><br><br>&quot;7) Cut a character off from their char (not all chars) for 10 minutes after pvp death to prevent bind rushing.&quot;<br><br>That's enough to make me quit EQ.  You're saying if I'm trying to get to my corpse and goto bed because I'm tired, and someone kills me along the way, I have to wait another 10 minutes?  Or..let's say I'm on my way to a raid and I get killed, raid group has to wait 10 minutes for me to show up?  In zones like The Deep where you can't CoH this is kind of a pisser.  <br><br><br><br>You can't really fix pvp.  Manaburn should be made non-pvp, lifeburn should be made non-pvp.  I don't really care much about wizards insta-gating.  Most PK's don't wear gear anyway and it means they are out of the fight.<br><br>You see, EQ is a pve game.  I could think of great fixes, like making it so when melees run out of sta from meleeing they hit like little girls.  This would make it so that a melee couldn't pvp for 8 hours straight while casters run oom and have to sit.  But this would screw up the PvE part of EQ.  I've been in fights that last forever, having to sit melees out would make you lose.  PvE/PvP ballance is a scale.  You ballance one side more you unballance the other.  More people PvE, PvP is more unballanced.  Live with it, and quit making sillyass posts every few weeks about what you think would fix it, because half of them would never be implemented and the other half are dumb.<br><br>Moffon <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lucasv>Lucas V</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/29/02 7:13:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=694.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Needed changes.</span><hr size=1> I can't comment on the suggested item-loot changes since I don't play on Rallos, but I agree with most of the stuff you said, though some may be going a little too far.  Restricting resists on newbies/lowbies just might work out, if done very fairly ( which is subjective.... fun fun ).<br>I don't know if MB should be reduced to 1/2 and/or 1k, but there isn't a doubt in my mind that it isn't overpowered ( same with Harm Touch).  Ever wonder why wizards make up around 30% of Sullon's top PK charts? And the top 3 or 4 are wizards 90% of the time, and the top 2 about 99% of the time.<br>I personally could not stand the idea of having to wait 10 minutes to get back on after I get PK'd.... bind rushing sucks, but in my mind, that would suck even more.<br>Hybrids already have channeling, which really 'helps' ( if you're a hybrid reading this) or 'overpowers' ( if you're not one ).  As for rogues/monks/warriors, I wouldn't have a problem if they were given a small channeling skill... where they have a healthy chance of going through a hit or two, but not a overly large one.<br>Horses?

That makes like 15 of your 16 suggestions unfounded, biased, and flat out clueless.<br><br>The problem with Manaburn is not that it can do 6k+ damage, it's the fact that it can do 6k+ damage reliably, no matter what your resists are, what you are wearing, what you are doing, etc.... Manaburning should be 'risky', it's not atm, it's a sure winner against everyone except completely buffed warriors. <br><br>How exactly do we put that risk in there is up to debate. I'll list you some suggestions, not all to be implemented, just one of the list should be sufficient.<br><br>1) Make manaburn non-lure in PvP, make it magic based.<br>2) Make manaburn a bolt (meaning you can miss if someone hides behind a corner)<br>3) Make manaburn skill expend whether or not your attempt is interrupted (or person goes out of range, etc)<br>4) Make manaburn have random damage, in a range. Something like 2k minimum damage and a random roll from 1 to your mana pool added to it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/15/02 9:22:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=694.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Needed changes.</span><hr size=1> Making mannaburn resistable wouldn't be effective.  I got MBed for 5600 by a wizard with average if that gear non crit.  A half resist would still have killed me instantly.<br><br>In its current form it just isn't a fair tool in pvp.<br><br>In response to moffons earlier post.<br><br>Item loot.  Just in case you didn't get it let me clarify.  Those who turned off item loot wouldn't be able to loot anyone or get looted.  Those who remained loot+ would be able to do both.  You would not be able to abuse the system by switching back and forth.  It would be permenent and would have to be set by lvl 30 or for those allready beyond that point say within one week of it being implimented.  <br><br>To further prevent abuse via groups of loot- people with a designated finisher those players who don't lose a majority of their life to loot+ players shouldn't be lootable.  This should apply to people who have been dmged by mobs as has been suggested before as well.<br><br>Allow me to break it down into its effect on the different groups on RZ.<br><br>Bluebies.  These are the cattle on which the gankers feed largely with cheap and lame tactics. They would all go loot-. Oh well.<br><br>Anti-pks.  For those of you not on RZ this group of players isn't really neccesarily against pvp think of RZ antis and pks as the light and dark team of RZ.   This group would be split between loot- and loot+.  This group would be the main adversaries of the gankers since they have loot but are easier to kill than warring guilds. <br><br>Gankers.  This group would remain loot+ clearly.  They would however find the blubies that they prey on loot- and wouldn't gain much from their pathetic weak ganking tactics and would be forced to turn to more able foes.<br><br>Pks. Note there is a distinction between the 2 groups. The former lacks style, class, and usually skill as well.  This group would be loot+ and would mostly fight anti pks and warring groups.<br><br>Warring groups.  This basicly covers combination pve pvp guilds that engage in a lot of pvp mainly in the form of guildwars.  They would probably be pvp+ largly and would fight the pks, destroy the gankers, occasionally the antis.  They would however most likely leave the blubies alone.<br><br>My conclusion is that pvp would become somewhat more uncertain if it wasn't openly discerable what someones status was and that the only group harmed in any real way are the gankers that spoil the server anyway.  Show me the downside.<br><br>Mannaburn.  You wouldn't need all of your manna to do 1k dmg.  You would only have to use the normal amount needed to do 1k dmg which is what 500 manna?  The intent is to make it into a finishing blow instead of a ganking tool.  <br><br>If you wanna ask how this is better than lure of ice. Well Lure of ice (including crits) would be limited to 1/3 of a players hp as per an earlier entry on the list <br><br><br>You are right about it being too hard for verant to impliment for the sake of the fraction of pvp plaers though but then again so is this whole list.  This is more for fun than anything else.  I expect one of verants competitors to bring out a real solution to pvp sooner or later.<br><br>Dmg Discs.  You misunderstand.  The definition of one round is just that one round of combat.  Not the full duration of the disc.  In other words for most melees that would consist of a single or double attack + duel wield single or double attack if applicable + a special attack if applicable.  In other words no melee would get to insta kill anyone any more than a mannaburner could.  Currently melees discs have nowhere near the power of mannaburn but this is largely a point of fairness.  It would give the melee who used the disc a decisive advantage without allowing for too much of one even if the melee got an exceptional roll.<br><br>Dispelling.  Oh please the only use for channeling skill is to allow melees to use a single very essenial clicky item in situations where they currently can't since cast times were added to egg pumice and wands.  Situations in which they are not viable in pvp without it.  Allowing melees to pumice themselves and others with pets/melees hitting them isn't too much to ask for.  Giving clerics monk like melee dmg in addition to their superior healing abilities on the other hand is a joke.<br><br>You do have a valid point about corpse camping. However that could probably be adressed simply.  just set it up in such a manner that you cannot be knocked off your character a 2nd time until at least 5 minutes after you have looted the last item off your corpse or you have cast a detrimental spell on another player whichever comes first. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukinthaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinthaf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/17/02 12:48:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=694.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> All that needs to be done to MB/LB kills is make them non-lootable, keeps the tactical advantage there, while removing the incentive to gank.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/17/02 3:11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=694.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I do not believe that there should be a DT key even if use of same results in no loot.<br><br>It just doesn't seem right to allow any class such a cheesy get ouf of jail free card.
