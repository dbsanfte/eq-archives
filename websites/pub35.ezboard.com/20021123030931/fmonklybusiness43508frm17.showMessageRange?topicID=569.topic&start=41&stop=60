<br>
 There is no such thing as a pulling class. Verant has not nor acknowledge that a classes defining ability should be pulling. Matter of fact for awhile they where strictly claiming that pulling should not happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
 The people that are leaving is because thier characters are unplayable. Simple fact. <br>
<br>
 If a class cannot offer a group ANYTHING besides being a second rate dmg dealer thats on his back 20% of the fight or if that class CANNOT solo worth a crap in HIGH armor then whats the sense of playing that class or the game itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Hey KKK before u come here and bitch and moan saying all is well because your class is soo uber now why not take a walk in the shoes of the people your putting down?<br>

 Your posts clearly show u know jack about the class itself and any posts here on out will be treated as just that.<br>

It's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like nerfing a single overpowered ability or item, nerfing the mitigation of a class is nerfing the way a class works, it's changing EVERYTHING about a class in one nerf.  (which is a MUCH bigger and far reaching thing than say the original paladin nerf idea, which was only ONE aspect and yet look at the uproar over that)<br>
<br>
<br>
It <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one nerf, but it's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one change, it affects pretty much every aspect of being a monk.<br>
<br>
From pulling (can't take hits can't do long pulls), to damage dealing (can't take hits and have no method of reducing hate without reducing DPS), to soloing (can't take hit means a sigificant reduction in solo ablity).<br>
<br>
<br>
A lot of things change when you nerf something so integral to a class and don't re-balance them (more avoidance, more damage etc.) in some way.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can't just nerf something like that and expect that to be it, nerfing the WAY A CLASS WORKS, requires careful <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>thought</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (something VI haven't really done) and that the class needs to be looked at and rebalanced after the nerf. <br>

<br>
Doesn't change the class?!?!? <br>
How can getting hit for more in pretty much every situation NOT affect the 'idea' of the class.<br>
<br>
And as for pulling, if you don't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to FD pull a warrior, ranger, paladin or a SK is a better choice for pulling than a monk.<br>
<br>
For many situations where FD <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> absolutely needed a SK (post-nerf) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> makes a better choice for pulling.<br>

I'm going into Keamil Argument Mode here so all sane readers, please bear with me.<br>
<br>
So your Paladin is a &quot;tank&quot; class. How do you think Paladins would feel if Verant said &quot;Ok. Paladins are tanks. We're going to remove your ability to double attack and you will have the melee skills of a cleric.&quot;  Say they even throw you a bone and make your stuns an even more awesome taunt than they are. You would still be able to tank. Hell, you could just chain cast stuns to hold aggro.  Would that be ok with you? It would follow your logic since Paladins, being a &quot;tank&quot; class, don't need to do any dmg right? All you need to do is soak and taunt. Your ridiculous argument is much the same. You think it's perfectly ok to nerf a monks ability to take damage down to nothing because we are &quot;pulling&quot;. I say that it's fair for *you* (not all paladins, just you) to not be able to do any dmg at all since you are a &quot;tank&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Sound like fun?<br>
<br>
I'm going to save off this thread to my hard drive so that I will always be able to remind myself of how *not* to prove a point. Any time I see someone making arguments that are completely illogical, making up facts as the go along and generally pretending to know what they're talking about when they're clueless, I'll just say &quot;Ahh.

<br>
Hmm so by that statement, if they changed a paladin to a cloth class, you would continue to play your 850 ac new gimp cleric?<br>
<br>
The issue that has the monks all worked up is that many of us that chose this class did so because we liked the packaging. I work far to many hours a week to be a 'power gamer' or to join a 'l33t' guild.. I value my time outside of the game to much. When I play this game I do it in 2-4 hour sets which does NOT fit well with the /lfg for 1 hour framework.<br>
<br>
I don't like to leave other people high and dry by abandoning a group I was pulling or tanking for so I usually stick with a very small group of select friends (none of us play a tank so I WAS the tank for us) or I solo.. I have been doing this for 60 levels and 11 aa. Now I do neither of these things effectively.<br>
<br>
I was sold on a monk BECAUSE IT FIT MY PLAY PROFILE.. I wanted a melee but I needed to be able to play in short stints. I have reached a /played of 70 days in 2-4 hour blocks so figure out for yourself how long I have been playing this game.<br>
<br>
The reason I have quit is because I cannot play to this style anymore and I refuse to screw up other peoples nights by constantly bailing on groups because of my play times. To be very very frank CHILD I take a great deal of offence to you coming to a MONK board and saying 'whats the big deal' without bothering to get at least SOME of your facts correct.<br>
<br>
Incidentally child, you are correct, monks are very easy to play.. but guess what? So is a paladin. If you truly think it takes 'l33t' skill to get a paladin to low fifties I really will laugh. Basically any class that does not have inherent agro issues (i.e. tashing and slowing a quadding 770 mob, or playing a song that debuffs every creature in a 60' radius) is easy. Don't be so neive to think because you have pretty crystals to push as well as a half dozen buttons that your are fringing on divine skill. If you really think that because sometime you have to play ghetto healer or root parker you have a harder job then a monk or any other class for that matter, look me up in game, I will set you up with raid so you can show off your 'l33t' 6 caster fd skills.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raign>Raign</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 7:21:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.exoduszek.com/uploads/yyangbiglb1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what i really see</span><hr size=1> Incidentally,<br>

<br>
Monks are taking between 10% and 80% more damage from mobs, depending on the mobs level in relation to their level. Or more precisely, the mobs attack relative to their AC.<br>
<br>
This means that monks effectively have 91% to 56% of the hitpoints the same monk would have had prior to the nerf. This hitpoint adjustment is applied to both the character’s level based hitpoints and any hitpoints added by hp items, stamina items or buffs.<br>
<br>
This change has crippled the monk class. No one would have chosen a class that was crippled like this if they knew that they would end up so badly nerfed. Who would chose a pure melee class that effectively had 91% to 56% of a rogue or bards hitpoints?<br>

Congratulation!!...AD 2111: All Bases of Cats were destroyed.        It seems to be peaceful. But it is incorrect.       Cats is still alive.      ZIG-01 must fight against Cats again<br>
and down with them completely .   Good luck!!<br>

You try to pull something big. See how easy it is. I've never played a paladin so i wont say they are easy. But you have never played a monk but you say they are. Who the FUCK are you to say that? You have NO experience in what we do. Go troll some warrior forum so you actually have something semi-revelant to be wrong about.<br>

The patch crippled the monk ability to SOLO...a monk is a group based class that has been ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PLAYERS to be a PULLING CLASS...<br>
Fist of Acrylia/Primal Velium with Epic...Or even a Tstaff/Epic...God, do the math...monks fists at 60 are 24/20 (onhand/offhand using magelo calc)...24/20...shit thats insane...add in the fact that primal/acrylia &gt; Ragebringer/Anything you want here...AND there are EVEN BETTER monk items in Vex Thal...<br>
The monk was changed to a Group based class and you run...whats there to argue with?...<br>
MOST people i know like this change...a MONK is a NON-ARMOR traditionally based CLASS...a class that can FIGHT WITHOUT WEAPONS...<br>
You loose the ability to solo and you flee...<br>
Every other class has been a group based class including Necro's recently...Solo EXP was bitch nerfed and your telling me you didnt expect this?<br>
<br>
Im not trying to start an argument...I asked a question and had my ass flamed by a bunch of babies that cant handle the facts...<br>
<br>
Your all leaving because of a single change...Necros had their asses nerfed...paladins used to suck...rangers used to suck...Most monks have more ac still then i do, so what they changed how much damage you took...PoP is a strategy GAME...a group based Strategic expansion...<br>
<br>
Monks are Acknowledge by the PLAYERS as a PULLING CLASS...<br>
<br>
Again, why dont you just answer my original question...If all they did is change the damage you take in a fight...why do you all leave...<br>
<br>
Rogue&gt;Monk&gt;Ranger BTW...as i explained above with magelo's damage calc =P...<br>
<br>
Monks are made even and FINALLY Balanced and you all bitch about it...Paladins are a different story...You try being 52 for 6 months, try waiting 5hrs for a group while 4 monks come in and get groups before ya...or oh yea...the 48 warrior...ONLY now are paladins/Rangers actually a grouping class...you monks have taken it for granted for so long its incredible...Soloing instead of grouping...Others had it different... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zikoz>Zikoz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 686<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 9:38:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...Monk damage &gt; than most...</span><hr size=1> Why should we even bother to argue against your position when you do it so well.

<br>
You are correct that a Rogue always wants to be behind a mob, but not always do the mobs agree with the Rogue. Sometimes in certain situations you can not get behind a mob, hence no backstab. Backstabs also create lots of aggro, again no backstab. While we have evade, which is a very good aggro management tool, aggro for the most part is part of every fight. So, when a Rogue has aggro or is evading he is not able to backstab. = situational<br>

<br>
the reason alot of monks gave up is because why play a monk now when you can play a Shadow knight better Midigation and Armor now..See you come here wanting an answer from all these monks that stop playing..<br>
<br>
Well the answer is We feel let down.VI has made it very clear they dont care about us as a Player class or base.<br>
<br>
What did i think about SU3 being put on the chopping  block I didnt because its not something that is used by the class EVERYDAY for Every encounter..<br>
<br>
Our AC on the other Hand is something we use for Every fight Taking that Secret 200+ ac from us Hurt alot of the Low end Monks if you want to understand how bad it hurt us use 3/4 your mana and Engage a blue coning Mob Find you how fast you have to flee or can you stand Toe/Toe..<br>
<br>
I For one waited to see how bad the nerf was and when i logged on the next day i had found the nerf to be VERY harsh indeed..<br>
<br>
you want an Example the week before UP Pulling Assasins <br>
<br>
60 Mob Double Backstab for 900 sometimes 1000 Dmg pulling before the nerf i would make it back to My group with around 2 and a half Bubs of health MT would take it off me and i would be healed to Full health Stand and Administer a little PAY back..After the nerf my first pull double BS for 950/1000 With 2 hits for just around 285.. Droped like a rock So yes my Pulling is VERY damaged by the Nerf..<br>
<br>
In closing you try spliting the PoZ in Kael by yourself mister Uber pally because after this nerf Monks are crap...<br>
