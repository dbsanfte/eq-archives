***EverQuest Turns Two***<br>
<br>
Two years ago this Friday, EverQuest was launched, forever changing the course of online gaming. Today EverQuest boasts nearly 360,000 active subscribers, and a two-year retention rate of 65%. Peak usage tops 89,000 simultaneous users with average peak usage at roughly 87,000. The EverQuest community continues to grow daily. <br>
<br>
We've put up a page on the EverQuest website to help celebrate EverQuest's achievement and to thank our loyal fans. Over the next couple of days we will be posting interesting content from EverQuest's humble beginnings, as well as a few surprises. Check it out! everquest.station.sony.co.../index.jsp<br>
<br>
*Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding*<br>
<br>
The Warrens:<br>
<br>
As part of our two-year celebration, we're pleased to announce the release of &quot;The Warrens&quot;, a free expansion zone located on Odus. &quot;The Warrens&quot; is a low-to-mid level dungeon and the home of the Kobolds on Odus. You can patch the Warrens by running the &quot;Optional Patch&quot;. <br>
<br>
In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, &quot;the Warrens&quot; will also serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought forth by members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some common gameplay issues. We would like to see what options might be open to and enjoyed by the players in the future.<br>
<br>
The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level creatures. To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that &quot;outclasses&quot; a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP. All other loot will drop. &quot;Outclassing&quot; a foe is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill. This can happen if, for instance, the foe is &quot;green&quot; to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.<br>
<br>
Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was &quot;trivial&quot; will be displayed to the group. <br>
<br>
As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and adjustements in the Warrens. Please be sure to let us know what you think!<br>
<br>
The Planes:<br>
<br>
The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year celebration. Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some high-level foes are now available. Rewards for former &quot;boss npcs&quot; have been moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful as the old bosses were.<br>
<br>
The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, now full high-level expansion-oriented content. Much as with Fear, rewards from bosses have been moved. <br>
<br>
Epic Quests:<br>
<br>
As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic quests for a number of classes. Previously, questers of many classes were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers for a few coveted spawns. In these cases, a new step has been added to separate the &quot;Epic Encounter&quot; NPCs from the &quot;Epic Quest&quot; NPCs. <br>
<br>
For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the same. In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, the same reward applies. What has changed is that some components may be in a different location from where you expect them. It is recommended that you check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find where you need to go next.<br>
<br>
***Patch Day***<br>
<br>
Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between character control being established and loading of character faction tables.<br>
- Fixed the Dagger of Frost. Its special item flags were improperly removed in the last patch.<br>
- The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.<br>
- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to the enhanced Mark of Karn. The casting time on these items has also been changed to 9 seconds.<br>
- NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.<br>
- Fixed a problem present in Nagafen's Lair and the Plane of Hate that caused framerate to drop over time.<br>
- Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the whole stack. This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which will cause you to pick up one. These both also work for coins now as well as items.<br>
- In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking the &quot;Sell&quot; button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell the entire stack of items if a stack is selected. For example, you can sell 20 peridots by selecting the stack, and shift-clicking &quot;Sell&quot;. I'd recommend though that you give them to your neighborhood cleric first though The ability to buy stacks is on the list for implementation in the near future.<br>
- There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there. Check your books. <br>
- There are a bunch of new quests as well.<br>
- It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it to be unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready for use. Let us know if there are any further problems.<br>
- Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what you've foraged.<br>
<br>
Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E'ci is scheduled for this weekend. Please read the message below for details on the /movelog.<br>
<br>
*A Message From Customer Service*<br>
<br>
We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters moved from one server to another, or from one account to another. Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters across servers or accounts. <br>
<br>
It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server remain on that server. We also feel that it is important that characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that reputation by changing servers.<br>
<br>
The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large number of characters to new servers. At no other time will we move a character in such a fashion.<br>
<br>
- The EverQuest Team<br>
<br>
<br>
March 9th, 12:00am<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
*E'ci and The Rathe Movelog*<br>
<br>
We will be opening a new server and moving characters from the E'ci and The Rather severs to this new server upon the request of the customer. If you choose to move your characters to the new server, please be aware that all of your characters on the old server will be moved to the new server.<br>
<br>
To request to have your characters moved to the new server, all you need to do is type &quot;/movelog yes&quot; into the chat window while playing a character on that server during the time that the move log is open.<br>
<br>
We will be opening the move log for these two servers on Friday, March 16th, 2001 at 6:00 pm. PST (which is Saturday morning at 2:00 am GMT). We will be closing the move log on Sunday, March 18th, 2001 at 11:59 pm PST (7:59 am on Monday the 19th GMT). The new, yet unnamed, server should be opened some time during the week of March 19th. We'll announce the exact date as soon as we can.<br>
<br>
There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing to move your characters to the new server. The most important thing to keep in mind is that character corpses will not be moved with the characters. So it is important to make certain that you have looted all of the corpses that you want to loot before the characters are moved.<br>
<br>
Also, characters names are unique on the new server. Because characters will be moving from two separate servers onto the new one, there may be cases where two characters with the same name are created on the new server. Because character names must be unique, one of the two characters will be chosen at random and have an 'x' added to the end of their name. If you find that one of your characters has had an 'x' tacked onto their name after the move and you would rather have a new name, please contact your GM by using the /petition function. The GM will help you to change the name of your character.<br>
<br>
Guild structures do not follow the characters to the new server. We will be unable to reestablish guilds until at least a week has passed after the split. On any day after the new server has been up for eight days, the guild leader can /petition for a GM to help them reestablish the guild. Please do not petition for this before seven days have passed, we will not be able to set up your guild before then.<br>
<br>
We will not be moving characters back to the old server, so make certain that you want to move your characters before you type &quot;/movelog yes&quot;. And we will not be moving characters for those that fail to execute the movelog command during the stated window of opportunity. <br>

Anyone who says they need to apply this to all zones should really reconsider.<br>
<br>
How many quest items that are magic or NO DROP have you had to obtain from green mobs?  How much faction work have you done by collecting no-drop items from greens?  How many times have you gone to a lower level mob to obtain something you would USE because you hadn't been able to get it before (for me it's been Runed Bone Fork mostly... still don't have one... planning on going back for a TBB soon).<br>
<br>
Say goodbye to all of that with solutions like the Warrens.  You pass a certain level without being able to obtain something, and kiss it goodbye.<br>
<br>
As I just said on my guildboard.  There is a difference between farming and ph4rming. <p><img src="http://fp.geocities.com/teksoldier.geo/Notwen.jpg"><br>

Most will pop in. clear the zone to the &quot;boss&quot;, and then pretty much leave. I kinda like that really.) The Planes changes are kinda nice I guess, brings them in line with Kunark and Velious a bit more. And since they've moved the previously godly loot to equal underlings, the only real difference should be a slight change in tactics to deal with the general yard trash possibly being stronger, and many raids will not be able to kill the @#%$ itself, but rather an underling. I'll be interested to see how this goes. <br>
<br>
 One thing, it doesn't seem like the class balance discussions have manifested themselves a whole heck of a lot in the last few patches. I know there were some changes, but nothing like I was imagining would occur after all the discussions. Maybe some things are still in the works. Glad to see them fixing broken stuff, but I was really expecting more changes in this patch. Heh, maybe I've just gotten used to sweeping changes in gameplay over the last couple months that have come with each patch. Sigh, I guess I'm just never satisfied <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwendolynkeplegrobal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wendolyn KeplegrobAL</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendhead.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/01 8:52:04 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendside.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch 3/14/01</span><hr size=1> The patch message specifically says &quot;will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP.&quot;  So yes... some epic quests, as well as Nalot's eyepatch and other nice quests will be unavailable to high level players if they make this zone-wide.

And I agree, there should be exceptions to the loot-mechanism, but in general (discounting quests and such) this is a very nice change that will reduce a lot of farming. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugilthana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilthana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/01 8:58:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch 3/14/01</span><hr size=1> ugh you are right ... this is not a good thing...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  hmm  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uchibibrolibeguiler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chibibroli Beguiler</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/01 9:27:36 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/chibibroli_beguiler/sigpicbroli2.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch 3/14/01</span><hr size=1> All this does is make farmers bring a friend of the apprpriate level and buff/heal him while he kills said mob.

All in all a good patch, but I think the anti-farming measure will affect more of the game then VI has forseen.  <p>Chib-Too many to friggin count.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udarthender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarthEnder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/01 10:17:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch 3/14/01</span><hr size=1> Most of this patch is FANTASTIC!<br>
<br>
As for the level thing on the Warrens, I don't know, in a way, it's good.  But I don't see the point of making NO DROP items not appear for high levels, as NO DROP items can't really be farmed.<br>
<br>
Also, I guess the Warrens is simply not for me.  I don't feel like starting a new character right now, and I'm sure I'm too high for the zone.<br>
<br>
It's too bad really, because the warrens is just too far out of the way to go for just sightseeing.<br>
<br>
Other than that though, great stuff on the patch! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udarthender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarthEnder</A> at: 3/14/01 10:57:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/01 10:21:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch 3/14/01</span><hr size=1> Darth, that was basically the most positive post I saw from you in a long time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But I fully support Verant at least trying it out in a single zone, just to see how it goes, and possibly iron out some details that may make this feasible for world-wide implementation. Whatever they do, I'm sure they would take special care to not break quests just because your level is too high to loot this or that necesarry item. <p>Rathaniel Soulpiercer - 30th Redeemed Rogue of the Blackwatch Legion - Torvonnilous</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shaderick>Shaderick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/01 10:51:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch 3/14/01</span><hr size=1> Sounds like an excellent patch ta me.

As fer the anti-farmin' code, well, I think it's a good idea.  It'll prolly have some kinks that'll need ta be worked out (I forsee a new flag in the database &quot;Farmable&quot;, where items with this flag on will drop for everyone, even if they are lore, nodrop, magic, whatever.) but anythin' that gets the bleedin' loot farmers the hell OUT o' the Crystal Caverns is a good thing, so I fully approve of them puttin' somethin' in to test in the Warrens.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udarthender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarthEnder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/01 10:59:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch 3/14/01</span><hr size=1> Actually Shadow, I've revised my opinion of the new Evade as well.
