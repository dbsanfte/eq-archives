I made the mistake of playing a hu,man rogue in freeport before the level 6 limit, so you can imagine that my opinion of pvpers was rather low.<br>
<br>
But the challenge kept naggin at me so after playing a few characters on Sullon for a while I decided to return to Tallon and join up with my RL friend who has a few mid level characters in a decent guild on Tallon.<br>
<br>
So I started a dwarven warrior. I levled him up to 6 on  my own then my mates druid kinda pld me a bit up to 11th.(I know dont give me a hard time but I purposefully didnt play a rogue cos I couldnt stand the shame of pling a rogue - yes i am a hipocrite<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
So today I was at the crossroads waitin to meet up my friend when a fellow dwarf runs up with a Human monk hot on his tail.<br>
He yells for help and I figure I shouild help my cousin.<br>
the monk was white to me and the other dwarf was down to next to nothing so I jumped in.<br>
<br>
He fought back for a bit but I was actually beating him, (Yeah I was as surprised as you)<br>
Then he starts pleading with me to stop. Huh?<br>
<br>
He starts moanin that the othe other Dwarf was a member of Tiny Knights and they are a pk guild so I shouldnt be helping him.<br>
<br>
By this time  an elven bard has turned up and she starts healing the Dwarf ( I think she was anyeway) either way she keeps the monk away from the dwarf.<br>
So the monk goes off monain about the bard and the other Dwarf.<br>
He stopped moanin at me when I said I didnt care what guild the dwarf was in he was a cousin and it was my honour to protect him.<br>
Anyway I let him go rather than kill him.<br>
<br>
Not much of a story I know but it was first real balanced pvp encounter and I have to say my heart was goin ten to the dozen the whole time it was a great feeling.<br>
<br>
Did I do the right thing?<br>
Is TK a known bad pk guild?<br>
Should I have killed the monk or was letting him go (in the opposite direction to the dwarf lol) the right thing to do?<br>
<br>
Any feedback/critiscism would be appreciated as I intend to play more on Tallon and need to understand the politics etc.<br>

<br>
Clearly you did the right thing, then.  I've read a lot of your posts - you seem to do fine following your instincts, in terms of no regrets afterwards.<br>
<br>
You felt like letting him go, so you did - killing him in spite of that 'cause of some extraneous stuff would not have been the right thing.<br>

There's really almost no excuse for a guild on sullon zek to be non-pk.  He was a human monk, he was in your territory, he realized he was dying and decided to give up.  If he really didn't want to fight you, he would have said something before he started losing to you.

if you want a great shorty PK guild hook up with LoTU.  vary honorable, some of my best fights have been with their members.<br>
<br>
and yeah, people usually KoS people who will attack them if given the chance.  its a matter of self preservation. <p>Liringlas Lookinglass<br><a href=mrfixitonline.com/patron>Patron Saints</a>

<br>
/ooc Bloodlines = team name colors, ex: Blue Bloods, Orange, Yellow and Purple.  Seriously, Stytch, though I've only got a below 20 character on Tallon and am really a Vallon Zek'er I have always respected pure team players which ever server they were on.<br>
<br>
Hopefully Verant will follow through with what has hinted and hoped at: hard coding teams on Vallon or Tallon and allowing a move log between the two.<br>
<br>
With the success of Sullon Zek, and the diminished numbers on the other Zeks, they might realize that there is indeed a desire and need for one of the team servers to be hard coded for true race war -- as both servers used to be called. <p><table border=0 align=left width=100%>

Sanitarium.<br>
<br>
Its the guild my RL friend is in.<br>
Obviously he's told me good things and they sound like my kinda people but I would be interested to hear if any here have had dealings with them or heard of them.<br>
<br>
Tonight I ended up goin to Unrest with my friends 14th dwarven cleric (Im now 13th).<br>
We were having a merry old time of it when this Human jumps outa nowhere and starts attakin my partner.<br>
Well I naturally start to attack only nothins happenin. I con him and he's red to me. (does that make him 22nd? can fight a 14th but not a 13th?)<br>
My friend is badly out done by this guy and starts to run for it but gets rooted/snared or some such. Well to cut a long story short or I'll be ramblin all night. He kills my partner.<br>
When I get back to the zone to await my bud there's a whole corridor full of disgruntled dwarves, Gnomes an even a couple of Elves.<br>
<br>
Turns out the guy had Rune 3 cast on him (Ench spell?) and was singlehandedly trying to de-populate unrest.<br>
<br>
Eventually the spell musta worn off cos one of the guys who had gone in huntin him got him.<br>
<br>
I was mad at first at the way he just attacked for no reason - griefing I thought of it. But by the end I couldnt help admire how many he had killed so quicklly. He also didnt loot my partner nor I think anyof the others. thought he had really good gear maybe that was just cos he could afford not to.<br>
<br>
 Also enjoyed the camraderie of the little posse that gathered outside the zone sending new champions in to take it back for the dwarves lol.<br>
<br>
I like pvp.<br>
Startin to dislike humans though.<br>
