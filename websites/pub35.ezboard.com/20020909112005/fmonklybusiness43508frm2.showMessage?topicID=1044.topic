I haven't done THAT many raids as leader but I have been told that I run a good raid so I will pass on what it is that I do while running raids that makes them work. Go grab a drink and settle in for a LONG read.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Getting ready to raid before you hit EQ</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>-----------------------------------------<br>Getting ready to be raid leader starts at home first. The raid leader needs to be there all the time to keep the raid moving and make sure things are running smoothly. You are the glue that keeps the raid together and you need to keep it organized. It's also good for morale, folks don't like to see the management walking off during a raid and feeling like they don't have leadership, atleast from what I have gathered. Plan to have food and drink readily available. You might end up ordering pizza during the raid, making sure that you some sandwiches prepared, left overs to quickly reheat, etc. Drink is pretty simple, but one rule is to stay away from heavy alcohol and such since you have alot of work to do and need to be on your toes. If you have medicine to take, make sure you have it and something to wash it down with nearby and also some food if required with the medicine. If you have kids, ask your significant other if they don't mind watching the children for the day since you will be busy watching the &quot;children&quot; in the game for the entire raid. If you have a favorite TV show, make sure you set up the VCR to record it. If you are a smoker, have a couple of packs of your favorite brand nearby. Turn the answering machine on and screen calls while you are playing. This may all sound a little extreme, but you will probably be REALLY busy watching over 40 people on a raid along with communicating with the puller, master looter, main assist, your group, your guild, your friends and also taking care of any issues with things between all 40 people on the raid. You won't have much time to go off and take care of things in RL and still run the raid so make sure you have all of you RL issues covered before you start the raid. You also need to make sure you are prepared for the long run on a raid, it may take longer than you planned.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Getting ready to raid in EQ</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>-----------------------------------------<br>Now is where you need to make some decisions, gather information, gather players and get everyone ready.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      First the decisions:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>a. Where are you going to raid?<br><br>This is easy to answer, you know where you want to go before you even start planning usually. There are exceptions to this though, some times you have a small number of groups (1 to 3) and are going to a zone just to go and have fun. In this case you should have atleast 2 alternatives incase you end up finding your planned area camped. If you have a large number of groups and a major raid, but the raid was jumped you should probably call it off and try again later. The folks normally were wanting to go to that big raid for a reason and trying to get them to another area is difficult at best along with loosing folks that don't want to go to the new area.<br><br>b. What is your hard set goal(s) in this zone?<br><br>This is also usually easy to answer. Normally, you have an item(s) you are searching for or quest you are planning on doing and that is the goal. If it's just to have fun though, you need to atleast make SOME goals to keep the raid folks focused and so you can feel you completed what you planned to do. Keeping the raid folks focused is one of the most important reasons though. Try to have a goal like these:<br><br>1. Get certain class items to drop or a number of drops.<br>2. Get an item for every member of the raid (hard or impossible to do on very large raids)<br>3. Kill all of the spawns for certains areas, two or more times if the spawn rate allows.<br>4. Advance your way to a certain area of the zone. Examples: Get to and clear isle 4 in Plane of Air, Get to and clear the Maestro's room in Plane of Hate.<br>5. Kill a specific monster<br><br>I am sure after looking at these you can find a good goal that is well defined and able to be attained.<br><br>c. Do you have an alternate plan for your goal(s) or a secondary goal(s)?<br><br>If you go on a raid with enough people, or to a zone you can handle more easily, you may choose more goals to set. Also you may end up hitting a zone and finding that the rare spawn you were aiming for was taken down a couple of hours before you got there. Make sure you have plans to keep the raid together and give the people something to aim for while they are there.<br><br>d. How many people is it going to take? And what levels of people minimum?<br><br>This one is completely random depending on the zone you are going to and what you have planned for the raid. Normally you can ask a few folks and find out what the recommended amount and levels for a zone are. I would suggest asking folks that have done the zone before and had a successful raid. The number of people versus the levels is also VERY important. An example would be Phinigel Attropos in Kedge Keep. One single group of 60s that is organized well can take him down, but it may take 4 or 5 groups of 45th to 50th level players to do the same task simply because of spell levels and tactics differences for the levels. Try to keep the levels of the players you want to take into account for the number you will need.<br><br>e. Now that you know the people coming, who is the MA, SA, ML, SL and Puller (not necessarily in that order)?<br><br>These are going to be important! It is nice to have all of these set well before the raid starts, but you can also select at raid time and let the raiders know. Make sure they are able to stay the entire time too if you can, as they are important to the raid's functioning.<br><br>1. Puller - You can't always get a puller that is knowledgable about a zone before you get there, everyone has to learn on the job SOMETIME... and if you have to choose a puller that is learning the zone, try to choose one with good hit points and maybe secondary abilities (root, snare, harmony, feign death). Hopefully the puller will know the zone though. A good puller for a zone will know enough to do the job without pulling the whole zone, know what should be pulled right away and what shouldn't be, the types of mobs he is pulling (wizards, enchanters, warriors, SKs, etc.), the maximum number of mobs he should be pulling at a time, where the best place is to lie down on a really bad pull, which mobs see through invis/sneak, and what type of pathing there is generally for the mobs.<br><br>2. Main Assist - This is your biggest baddest tank normally. S/he is going to be taking a beating like few others will and s/he will be doing most of the taunting before attack many times. If you can find a good MA that knows the mobs and will chose to attack the right ones in the right order to minimize difficulty then you are in the green. Otherwise, the MA is going to be learning on the job which are healers, casters, fighters and then choosing which need to be taken down first to finish a fight with minimal loses and effort.<br><br>3. Secondary Assist - This is your second biggest baddest tank. This person shouldn't be taking as much of a beating as the first one, but if things go bad and you lose the MA, then this person will be taking the beating and making the decisions that the MA was supposed to be making while they were still standing.<br><br>4. Master looter - A thankless and tiring job on most raids. This person needs a few qualities/skills/tools to do the job: They need to be honest enough to trust with some of that uber loot =), they need be to able to type decently (they have to do ALOT of it), they need a list of ALL the people on the raid and their classes written down for quick reference plus they need to keep the list updated along with a basic of who has won what so there isn't any one person walking out with all the loot, they need to keep their list updated with the SA's list if there is an SA, they need to have the loot rules defined to them so they divvy the loot right, and they need to be quick on the uptake. <br><br>5. Secondary looter - Same as the master looter for the most part. The SA's job is to take up slack for divvying loot, hate raids are a good example where you have multiple nodrop class items on the ground and you need to get them randomed out to the folks before they rot. The SA needs to keep an eye on what the MA is doing and keep their listing updated with the MA's listing of who has won what.<br><br>f. How long are you going to give the raid to meet the goal(s)?<br><br>This is dependant on a few factors:<br>1. How much time can you spare?<br>2. How much time can your raiders spare?<br>3. How many people do you have?<br>4. What levels are the people you have?<br><br>If you have quite a few good 60th level players, you will end up completing your goals sooner most likely than if you have alot of 50th level players.<br><br>g. What is the best start time to encompass the number of people from different time zones and still meet your raid time goal?<br><br>This is completely subject to you and those that you are taking on the raid. Set a start time that is a short while earlier than the actual planned start time. If you want to start at 6pm, then tell folks to be there at 5:30pm.... but don't TELL them you are gathering early or they will just mess around and take their time getting there, in which case you won't start til 6:30pm because folks decided they didn't need to show up early.<br><br>h. Where should everyone be to start this raid?<br><br>This one is easy as well. Normally folks gather at the zone in to get ready for a raid. There are a few places that are somewhere different... Hate and Sky. For Hate people gather at the wizard teleport pyramid in Nek forest, for Sky it's the pyramid in WC. The reasons for these gathering spots is because they are at main teleport locations to gather folks for the raid, specifically wizard ports who are the class taking you to these planes anyways. Secondly, they are out of the way of main travel points and so you aren't lagging others, getting run over by others and don't have guards normally near either spot.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Now for an example of setup using one of my old raids...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Zone: City of Mist<br>Goal(s): Gather 1 torch of elements for mage epic quest (reasonable and well defined goal)<br>Secondary Goal(s): Gather 1 jade reaver for druid/ranger epic quest (reasonable and well defined goal)<br>Minimum people needed: 40th minimum level, 3 groups if high level folks, 4 to 5 groups if lower level<br>MA,SA,ML,SL,Puller: MA - Garlander, SA - Tefrin, ML - Eterno, Puller - Sleight (again, this doesn't need to be chosen ahead of time)<br>Raid length: 4 hours minimum<br>Start time: 5:30pm PST (covers most of the U.S. that way)<br>Gather point: City of Mist entrance<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Now to gather information on your raid:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>When you are going to raid a zone, you need to make sure you have enough information that you can effectively run the raid and make choices during the raid if things change. You don't have to write all the info down or print out every page you find on the web, but make sure you get enough info to run the raid with some confidence. This info includes:<br><br>a. Maps - Requirement for any raid. You need to know where you are, where you are going and where you can go if things go bad. With a map you shouldn't get lost, but even if you do you can HOPEFULLY find your way back to the group using it. A good map should have general mob spawns, traps, named spawns, various levels of the zone and zone-in/zone-outs.<br><br>b. Monster info - Most zone monsters can be defined by type and sorted more easily that way. This means looking up zone mob info on sites and boards for a bit and getting to know the basics of what to expect, then maybe typing or writing a little info on the mobs such as the general mob's class, level range and MR. You might also add next to certain mobs anything you think required like &quot;Mob harder than level&quot; or &quot;Mob very FR&quot;. You don't need an essay on every mob, you just need a quick reference for the mobs.<br><br>Example from Hate :<br>A Loathling Lich - 51 to 53 - Necro<br>An Abhorrent - 49 - Rogue<br>An Ashenbone Drake - 51 to 53 - SK - High MR<br>Cleric of Innoruuk - 49 to 51 - Cleric - High MR<br>Spite Golem - 51 to 53 - Shaman - Extreme MR,FR,CR. Lures only.<br><br>Just a few, you get the idea though. You can make a quick list with just a few pieces of info and know what you are up against.<br><br>c. Item drops - Again, you don't need to write everything down for every item. If anything, the only thing you need is the class/race combo for an item. Even then, this is more of a job for the ML than the raiders or raid leader.<br><br>d. Miscellaneous - Some times there is a little extra info on the zone itself that you need to know such as spawn rates, mob triggers, secret areas, etc. Normally you will find this info as you are looking up the other parts of the info for the zone.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Time to get the troops all lined up:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Most of the folks going to your raid should already have rides or be in the area before the raid starts, but you will find that it's not always easy to get a ride for some folks. In this case it's good if you can get a porter from your raid or a friend to pick up and deliver the folks to you.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Getting everyone ready:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>This is the part where you set the groups, assign the ML,SL, MA, SA and puller if you haven't already. To get this part started you will need to get everyone that is on your raid to turn off anon/role and turn on LFG so you can make sure of who is there for the raid. I usually shout out a dozen times over 5 minutes for the folks to turn off anon/role and turn on LFG before I even start. Once you have that done, you need to look over the ranks and decide who are going to be MA, SA and puller. The reason is because you will be forming groups around them at first and then forming the others. Groups one and two are the main focus while the full power of the raid will be spread across the rest of the groups, so once you choose a good MA and puller, stick them in the first group with a good cleric so they can get personal attention. You probably want to assign a druid/shaman as buffer (they need all they can get) and secondary healer just in case. Then assign SA and a cleric together as the core of group two. If you have an enchanter, you should assign them to group two as well. Ok, now the rest of our raiders. Fill in group one with yourself and an appropriate extra such as a damage dealer or maybe another tank. Try to not have another drain on the healers in that group if you can. Second group has a good healer and tank so now we can fill in with almost anything to make the group working. When you form groups always try to calculate the amount of healing versus the amount of tanking. A few group examples:<br><br>a. 2 druids, 2 tanks, chanter and wizard<br>b. 1 cleric, 1 druid, 3 tanks and wizard<br>c. Any number of only Necros/Mages (works great, no healing should be required)<br>d. 1 shaman, 1 druid, 1 bard, 2 tanks, 1 rogue<br><br>Basically try to balance the amount of damage incoming versus the amount that can be healed reasonably. Once you have all of the groups set up, write down all the names and groups. This is important because of two reasons... loot and re-organization. Loot should be the ML's job, but the re-organization is usually required. I will cover re-organization in the raid resposibilities below.<br><br><br><br>Contestant A: I can raid that tomb in only 5 groups<br>Contestant B: I can raid that tomb in only 4 groups<br>Contestant A: I can raid it in only 3 groups.<br>Contestant B: Raid that tomb!<br>(aka Raid time)<br>-----------------------------------------<br>Ok, now you have everyone's lives in your hands... it's time to do what I call &quot;herding alleycats&quot;. You have to keep everyone together, listening to you, paying attention and doing their jobs. This is the part where you have alot to do and there won't seem to be enough of you most of the way until the raiders get into a rythm.<br><br>One of the first things you need to do is announce who the MA, SA, ML, SA and puller are so that hotkeys can be setup and the group looters know who to talk to about loot dropped. Make SURE to announce it a couple of times so there aren't mistakes.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Next you need to lay down the rules for people:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>a. *Assist* - Major rule and very important! You need to /shout this out and remind people about this a few times during the raid. Everyone needs to assist the MA/SA and pay attention to the MA/SA during the whole raid. Even if the puller isn't pulling you may get a wanderer or pop and you need the raiders to react quickly. If ANYONE isn't assisting, then you need to reassert assist and make SURE people are assisting. If you have a chanter and people don't assist, then you won't have a chanter for long. Also, it's very wasteful for the healers to be pumping out heals constantly because folks are all over the different mobs and it's taking too long to drop them. People who don't assist don't stay on the raid, no matter how good of a friend they are... they are endangering the raid and making your raid look bad. People won't ever come back to badly run raids... you wouldn't, why expect others to.<br><br>b. Chat - The raid leader, puller, MA, SA, ML and SL should be the only ones on the /shout channel and only when they are doing their jobs. Everyone else should be in the dedicated channel. Try to enforce this, the raiders don't need to be spamming the shout channel making it impossible to tell what the assist is or what is incoming.<br><br>c. Positioning - NO ONE should be standing past the MA/SA at any time. The MA/SA must be positioned at the front of the raid, and the raiders must stay behind him. If not then you end up with aggroed mobs on the wrong tanks, wrong assists, healers getting aggroed trying to keep the people standing forward alive, chain pulls that go bad and more. It's just a bad thing, k? Another rule you will need to enforce.<br><br>d. Pets - Most raids do not allow pets. I try to allow pets on my raids but I have a few rules I lay down as absolute LAW for pet casters:<br><br>*Pets will be allowed in almost all situations if the /pet hold command is avaliable to the caster.*<br>1. Pets are allowed out to play ONLY when we are sitting at a spot for longer than 3 minutes. Even then I have to make a decision on it.  Also make sure you dont run yourself LOM just to cast your pet, as this hurts the raid.<br>2. Pets MUST be parked well behind the MA at all times! NO wanderering or /pet guard me types allowed. <br>3. When we move around the zone, you MUST suck up the pet. No pet's following, no summon companion and no pet's guarding a spot. It all just leads to issues, trust me on this... back spawn and you will be in trouble QUICK.<br><br>If you break the rules I warn you. If you break it multiple times I forbid a pet. If you summon a pet after that I will personally log in my wizard and port you somewhere REALLY unpleasant (Wuoshi anyone?)<br><br>e. Aggro - First let's talk about the casters. Casters should not be aggroing things at all. Period. Overcasting is a sign that you are too anxious for exp/loot/to show off and I don't need someone that is going to pull an active, aggro mob into the group of healers/casters. I will give 2 warnings per hour for this offense. Secondly tanks, if you want to give your healer something to do, then take a couple of smacks, but don't try to be the main tank unless you are the MA/SA or the MA/SA is no longer standing. I am not harsh on this part of the rule, it's a tanks job to be smacked around like a school girl in a cat fight, just don't take the mob into the healers and don't make it cost the raid.<br><br>You need to keep enforcing the rules, keeping an eye on the raiders so they are following them and make sure they aren't wandering, fighting, or messing around where they shouldn't be. And if you just read that and said to yourself, &quot;Geez, sounds like I am a babysitter!&quot;, then guess what... you are. There is more to the raid than that, but it will take the largest portion of your time by alot. The other things you will be taking care of are....<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Raid responsibilities:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>a. Raid speed - Try to give feedback to the pull/MA to keep the pace of the raid brisk, the raiders get bored quickly since they are just standing there twiddling their thumbs when you don't have something there for them to beat on. Bored raiders lead to mistakes and messing around that gets alot of folks killed. Keep them on their toes with a quick kill rate.<br><br>b. Loot issues - They always come up even when you define the rules ahead of time. Stick by your rules and let people know that you are not going to completely switch raid rules right in the middle of the raid. If people don't like it, then let them know that it will change next time, but not in the middle of the raid since there are too many other things you need to worry about usually. Besides, you keep the pace fast and most folks will not focus on the loot so heavily.<br><br>c. Movement - Hopefully you studied the zone enough before hand because you are going to make key decisions on where and when to move around if you are going to move at all. You get feedback from your puller about mob quantity and placement, and then make choices on movement.<br><br>d. Re-organization - It happens with every raid, you are half way into the raid and a third of the folks say bye. Well... not on mine, but it happens. You will need to recreate a viable raid on-the-fly, this is where that list you wrote with all the names of the raiders comes in handy (you DID make that list right?) With your trusty list in hand you will look up who will be left, is there anything missing to make new groups and who goes where to remake those groups. <br><br>The puller and MA actually have more to do with advancing the raid than you do as they will be the ones clearing paths though the zone and setting the timing by how quick at getting the mobs to the raid. You can tell em to speed up or slow down, but ultimately they can help make or break a raid. Keep in contact with them as much as possible.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Post raid duties (I'm tired now! No more responsibilities!)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>-----------------------------------------<br>Yeah, there are sometimes things you need to cover to be a good raid leader. One is to send tells out to most of the folks with a, &quot;Thanks for coming to the raid&quot; or something along those lines. Also there are gems/gravy loot that needs to be lottoed off usually. You have the raid listing (you DID write it down, right?) and can just lotto against the names. Then you can give the item(s) if the person is still hanging out. Many times, the moment the raid is over alot of the folks just take off for home or groups elsewhere. In this case keep a list of who won what, notify them of what they won, and let em know that they need to pick it up soon. You don't need to hang on to 30 items waiting on these folks as you probably don't have bank room anymore as it is. If they don't pick up the item(s) in the next day or so, then consider them yours... you AREN'T their bank. I know it sounds a little harsh but I hold on to stuff for WEEKS before people send me a tell while I am deep in a dungeon somewhere and want their item. Hey, I need room too and I can't just drop everything for every person that wants their item this very minute.<br><br><br>*whew* That's too much typing... my fingers are sore now. I hope you have gleened a little info out of this to make you a better raid leader. Alot of the info is good to know for raiders as well so they know all the sorrow a raid leader goes through to get a raid going and to make it work. Please give me feedback on this, I haven't run that many raids and am just using my own limited knowledge of running raids and watching other successful raids being run. And yes, this takes alot of paying attention and energy by the raid leader... but the raids seem to come off much better when you have a driven and hard working raid leader than when you have some guy that threw a bunch of folks together and then sits around joking and hoping the raid works. <br><br><br> <p><table width="490"><tr><td> <img src="http://lukang.homestead.com/files/untitled1.jpg" width="374" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="3" alt="Me"> </td><td align="middle" font size=2 face=arial color=grey><div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999" size="2">Sargin Nazumi<br>55 Master<br><a href="http://www.eqlov.com">Legion Of Valor on Bristlebane</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=226543">Sargin's profile</a></font></div></td></tr></table> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usarginthemonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarginthemonk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://info.winamp.com/winamp/images/ebay.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/29/02 9:05:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uharrington.showPublicProfile?language=EN>harrington</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=46307" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/25/02 4:54:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1044.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> awesome thanks</span><hr size=1> thanks for the great info sargrin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uyanbun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yanbun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/25/02 6:35:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1044.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: awesome thanks</span><hr size=1> As a mage-monk, let me comment on your pet rules.<br><br>First off, I can speak for 99.9999 percent of Mages out there, we can handle our pets.

A pet that gets lost can wander all over a zone, and never aggro anything.  Once a pet is fighting, it can get aggro.  If the mage has Pet Hold, then you can beat on a pet or its master and it won't fight back.  Pets won't be getting any exp anymore either.  If anyone other than the pet does even 1 point of dmg, the pet gets no exp.<br><br>VI is trying to fix it so pets can't break mez.  Maybe they have...  So far even if I order pet to break a mez, it's not happened;  the pet even tells you that it won't do it.  Supposedly if the pet is casting its spell (a pretty quick cast) at the moment a mob is mezzed, it will continue casting and break the mez.  I think pets are better than players now at not breaking mez.<br><br>The AOE thing is the big problem.  The owner (way in the back!) gets hit for a tiny bit and the pet takes the offensive.  If you don't have Pet Hold, you need to be fast on the back off key, or have your earthen boots hot keyed.  Hit that, you go invis to animals, and the pet is gone, no matter where it is.  IMO this problem is the worst potential downfall of pets, and the Mage class is a big letdown without the pet.  It requires everyone to place TOO much trust in the pet owner.<br><br>As a RL you should know that when you say &quot;no pets&quot; you put a knife in the Mage's gut.  At least say why, in that situation.  It sounds like you are a person who values every player he meets, so you are probably as fair as you can be already.  Pet Hold should be a level 50 skill, not such a hard-to-get AA skill.<br><br>Oh, and all you RL's; you have to have the mage in the puller's group for Call of the Hero to work!  Recently had a L60 RL/puller tell me to CoH him.  He had not put a mage in his group...<br><br>Loraff, 55 Mage<br>Up-and-coming 17 Monk<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=philomath>Philomath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/27/02 5:48:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1044.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to Becoming a Successful Raid Leader(long)</span><hr size=1>    Sometimes you need to outline the usage of DOTs before a raid.  DOT corpse poofing has been fixed for anyone who remembers the bug.  However a DOTed mob cannot be mezzed.  This can pose a problem on raids.  Most times you are not going to try to offload a boss mob (mezz him and switch targets), due to an add or something, just be aware that if he is dotted you will not be able to mezz him.  Also be aware that Necro snares have a DOT component so if they are snaring things those things cannot be mezzed.  DOTs are a valuable addition for killing mobs that take over a minute or two to kill, but when the the *&amp;%^ hits the fan and you want the chanter to lock things down be aware that those those mobs are not going to lock down.  <br><br>   I have been to raids with my Necro where DOTs were not allowed at all.

Even then, the pet owner has a few seconds to press /pet back off after each AE to keep the pet from charging the MoBs.<br><br>If the person has /pet hold, then they should be able to use a pet whenever they want.<br><br>They only way for for a pet to break a mez is if the pet starts casting a spell before mez has landed, and the spell lands after mez has landed.  This will almost never happen because pet spells cast almost instantly (99% of the time the Pet Beginis to Cast a spell message and the spell landing message will be listed in the same second in a log file).  It seems like the spells have a 2 second cast time when you watch the pet, but that is because after the spell lands the pet cannot begin meleeing again for 2 seconds.  Durring those 2 second the pet just sits there, so it looks like the pet is still casting the spell (especially because the animation from the spell effect is probably not finished yet).<br><br>There are some mobs where pets will be made useless because of AEs, or will die quick because of AEs and it is not worth summoning a pet, but it's up to the pet owner because it wont hurt the raid. <p><font size=1 face="verdana"><center>[60 <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">Arch Mage</a>] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13177" target="_blank">Waldena</a> (Human) < <a href="http://pub80.ezboard.com/btranscended">Transcended</a> > SERVER: <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg">The Tribunal</a><br><i>"Summon someone who gives a damn"</i>-Pirotes<br>Golf is not a sport</center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwaldena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Waldena</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/flamedot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/29/02 6:57:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usarginthemonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarginthemonk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://info.winamp.com/winamp/images/ebay.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/29/02 9:06:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1044.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to Becoming a Successful Raid Leader(long)</span><hr size=1> Changed pet rules around a little. <p><table width="490"><tr><td> <img src="http://lukang.homestead.com/files/untitled1.jpg" width="374" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="3" alt="Me"> </td><td align="middle" font size=2 face=arial color=grey><div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999" size="2">Sargin Nazumi<br>55 Master<br><a href="http://www.eqlov.com">Legion Of Valor on Bristlebane</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=226543">Sargin's profile</a></font></div></td></tr></table> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=smackdragon>Smackdragon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/1/02 11:36:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1044.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.adamhsu.com/LFdudesANI2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE</span><hr size=1> HTML Comments are not allowed <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sukishammerfist>Sukis Hammerfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/2/02 7:16:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1044.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lizardworks.com/animation/rasberry.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE</span><hr size=1> Cut and dry, any ae will cause pet to agro.
