The trip was long and fun, and I made it without a scratch. When I got there though, I didn't have any clue where to go. So after payin a fizzler to make Freeport my home town, I backtrack to East Commons to see what I could hunt. I wanderered along the south desert wall a little, and came up to a giant rattlesnake. <BR> <BR> The snake decided to slither right between my legs, (the nerve), so I decided it needed some ventilation in it's back.. A short battle commenced, and the snake was slain. Unfortunately, I was heavily beaten, and poisoned. Now this poison is evil stuff.. it just ate away at my well being. Eventually, I passed out from it, and had a kind of out of body experience. <BR> <BR> As my body slowly withered away, I kept getting closer and closer to a dark light. (I was banned from the bright one). I just watched in horror as I got dragged closer and closer to the light, my body going through it's death throes. Right when I was inches from the light, my body relaxed, as the poison wore off. Now the snake had only given me small bites, so I wasn't bleeding to death. Slowly but surely, I recovered, eventually regained conciousness, and crawled into a corner and licked my wounds. That is the closest I've ever been to death. <BR> <BR> OOC: I hit -10 hp when poison wore off.. still not sure why I didn't bleed to death though.. <BR>  <p>Laan of Tunare - <ShadoWalkers></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=ulaan.showPublicProfile>Laan</A></span><br><font color=#FF0000>(6/20/99 3:13:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The closest I've been to death without dying </span><hr size=1> Err made a tiny error up there..

He turned, and cast charm person on me. Now this is when it gets interesting. I am forced to wander around. Boy, was I lost. Had no control.

Well, someone shouts &quot;Train to zone!&quot; and instead of zoning, being the curious Rogue I am...I move to where I could have a look see. This huge train barrels through, and I turn to run. But as soon as the engine zoned, they all turned on me... I was getting stunned and whaced at from all directions as I inched towards the zone line. <BR> <BR> A-l-m-o-s-t there!.. Then with one more hit from a Legionnaire I fall unconcious. But Brell was with me for as I fell I zoned!! It was incredible.

The wolf diseased me and was about to kill me when I started to run. My shouts for help were answered and someone came to my rescue. As I ran, I was knocked unconscious right before the wolf was slain. This must be a bug or something, but my corpse continued to run after i was knocked unconscious. So my unconscious body was sliding across the hills at a decent pace. I figured I would eventually regain consciousness, so I let my corpse run along the ground. It was kind of amusing to watch.. when it finally hit the wall, it continued to slide along it.. After a VERY long wait for me to regain consciousness, I realized that my meter wasnt going up because of my disease. I couldnt ask anyone to cure it because you cant talk when you are unconscious.. :( .. I thought that I would be stuck like that forever. Luckily, after about 2 minutes, I respawned at my home point. There must be some sort of time limit for how long you can be unconscious for. <BR> <BR> Even though I lost the exp, it was better than being stuck unconscious for the rest of my life.. <BR> <BR>  <p><h3><b><font color = blue>SLAYDE</font><font color = black> - </font><font color = green>Xegony</font></b></h3></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=udagorn.showPublicProfile>Dagorn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br><font color=#FF0000>(6/22/99 3:45:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The closest I've been to death without dying </span><hr size=1> I've had a similar experience with my Shaman.

There were a couple other casters there then and we all started to blast him.  He was resisting ALL of my damage spells so the only thing I could do was keep conjuring pets to throw at him over and over.  The cleric and ranger I was with were doing pretty bad at this time and Glubbsink managed to resist everyones spells.  He was going down in health incredibally slowly.  Thats when a goblin came from nowhere and started to pound me..I made quick work of him with my damage spells and pet but unfortunatly didn't kill him and he ran off.  I decided to focus my attention on glubbsink.  At this point the ranger and cleric were dead and so was the extra caster that was there.  There still was another caster and I threw another pet at him and could only engage in melee.  Of course that was a bad idea because he knocked me unconscience and by the time I came to glubbsink killed the last caster and my Pet actually managed to kill glubbsink.  We killed the bastard...hooray...I was the last man standing...Now I figured it would be a good time to sit down.

I was low on health but not too worried as they really seem to hate me bard friend....he and the other escaped to the zone just before I did....which of course means they turn on me immediately.  Stunned,  stunned inch forward hit hit hit (gasp) I am sooo close to the zone...then I get the dreaded Your feet adhere to the ground...argghh....I get hit, and again, almost dead now, hit again and...........zoned!  Their blows knocked me into the zone line while I was still rooted and I was still rooted on the OTHER side of the zone line with 3 hp left. <BR>  <BR> Ahhh brother bard play that sweet healing rhythm! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://206.86.100.18:8080/ugholamstickyfingers.showPublicProfile>Gholam Stickyfingers</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br><font color=#FF0000>(7/18/99 5:28:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The closest I've been to death without dying </span><hr size=1> Here is my closest to death experience... <BR>  <BR> I was running from Feerrott to Arena to get bound (I was bound in greater faydark at the moment), and when I zoned into Lake Rathetear, I saw a named froglok called Prince Kyrmt Keroppi.

First sign of trouble - you are pierced by thorns! But I continue fighting... both of us are losing health at about the same rate, finally darkness goes off and I run around in circles plunking him with bow (I had about a bar and a half of health left at the moment, he was a little higher), arrows and darkness evened it out a little, then darkness ended and I had to engage in melee again...
