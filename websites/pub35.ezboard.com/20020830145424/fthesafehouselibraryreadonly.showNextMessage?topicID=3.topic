Enjoy!  If you have more info to add, please throw me an email.<br><br>-Zato<br>------------------------<br><br>Posted by Leod<br>52nd Circle Shaman<br>Fennin Ro<br>Sterling Order of Knights<br><br>First, to hunt in Trakanon (effectively) you need a 6 man team. 1 ranger, 1 shaman/enchanter, 1 cleric, and 3 others, tanks or pet classes are best (3 rogues work great). My normal gruop is atleast one ranger, 1 shaman, 1 cleric (won't hunt there without one), 2 rogues, 1 warrior. Sometimes the warrior is a 3rd rogue, sometimes a 2nd ranger. Oh, and I have an enchanter slave keeping us aug'd and with clarity, so mana and quickness ain't never a problem...heh.<br><br>Your normal fight will be a level 45 frog, the froglok hunter and the froglok forager. They are both up at the same time, and they both spawn &lt;B&gt;instantly&lt;/B&gt; when they die. <br><br>Each frog will drop a spectral bow (dunno what it's for, nodrop lore item), and a medalion. Every time. The bow is the same on each (I think, I never really checked come to think about it), but the medalion is different. Hand in a medalion from each frog to Emperor Ganak down south and he rewards you with a key to Sebilis. The medalions are lore, the keys are not. Both are nodrop.<br><br>As soon as you kill a hunter or forager, another one should be on your rangers tracking list immediately. If not, one of three things has happened.<br><br>1) A rare spawned instead. Grab it and have fun. Rares are level 45, 48, 50, or 55. Only Doom is 55. Trakasaur Rex is level 50, as well as Harbinger Jontik (iksar mask). There are 18 rares that I know of, over half of which don't drop anything. About 20% of the rares have the standard naked male human model (reminds me of a monk), which leads me to believe that the zone isn't finished yet or someone forgot about it.<br><br>2) Hunter or Forager has spawned out of tracking range. 95% of the time this will be down south towards Emperor Ganak. Tanks can sit down and grab a drink, it could be awhile before your tracker can get ahold of it again.<br><br>3) Hunter went bugged. Something happens to the hunter's spawn on a regular basis that causes him and his rares to stop spawning. A GM repop is the only thing that has worked on Fennin Ro to my knowledge to get it back.<br><br>Each of the two frogs seems to have his own set of rares. <br><br>If this theory holds, Trakasaur Rex poped off the hunter, and Harbinger (all 5 times we've killed him) has poped off the forager. Hangman I *think* comes off the hunter, but I dunno for sure. We have only gotten him once, and that was last week. I don't remember what we killed before he spawned, I just know we've killed the forager about 1000 times and the hunter maybe a hundred, and we've only seen the hangman once.<br><br>Thanks to Gilthana, Bilban, and Kulyen for all the good times and discoveries we've had in Trakanon. It's been a fun as hell zone to explore.<br><br>---------------------------<br>Posted by Altea<br><br>Here's a summery of the thread so far:<br><br>Hunter<br>Doom - Very large Iksar skeleton – No known drop<br>Ffroaak -  Drops nothing - fast, wizard, his nukes hurt<br>Harbinger Dresnik (Dronik?) - Iksar ghost wizard - Drops Iksar Hide Mask (tradeable)<br>Harbinger Josk - drops nothing<br>Hierophant Ixyl - Iksar skeleton (with pet) – no known loot<br>Keeper Sessis - drop nothing<br>Oracle Froskil - Iksar skeleton - no know loot<br>Partisan Yinlen – Specter – Gleaming Shortsword 10/29 +5 cha 1hs, all melee classes. <br>Trakanasaurus Rex - Drops Trak Tooth (10/20 Rogue only weapon)<br>Vessel Fryn - drops nothing - skelie shaman<br><br>Forager<br>Bloodeye - dino that melee's for 127's, drops trak hide armor<br>Commander Silis - Iksar ghost look.
