Dalane Swiftblade traveled very far, from the Trollish city of Grobb, to retrieve her belongings which were snatched by the infamous Lady Vox. She got her things in order, and proceeded to look around, she found her friend Guntak adventuring in this very cold land, and also a new friend she was about to meet, a very powerful Cleric.  <BR>  <BR>        They messed around in these parts, and killed some Ice Giants and ugly blue Goblins which were harassing them. She was even fortunate to pick up a bag, which seems to make things lighter when holding them. Next Guntak and Dalane recieved a message via an (overworked, and very tired) messager pigeon... requesting their presence to aid Platt(ypus) in the sewers of the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule, seems he needed some help slaying lizards and alligators. So the two friends found a ride, and were wisked away (by some sort of magic that Dalane can not fully grasp) and joined Platt.  <BR>  <BR>        Cazic Thule proved interesting, profitible, and gave Dalane some great combat experience, after several hours there, she knew she was on the verge of a major breakthrough (ooc: leveling), and by this time Alim and Broy had joined in the fun. Also, the group of hearty adventurers claimed the lives of several nasty looking beasts called &quot;The Avatar of Fear&quot;. This also helped gain some much needed money for Broy, who had previously spent lots of money trying to assist in the slaying (actually the aftermaths) of Lady Vox back in Permafrost, where our story began. Platt had to leave, as did Broy... but Baraccas and Alim remained, and Noruas a charming and kind musician came to assist. The group learned lots with Noruas' help, and they had much fun together. Dalane was so excited to have learned so much, met so many new people in depth, and had an overall great time.  <BR>  <BR>        The next day, Dalane decided the sewers were a good place to adventurer, but almost immediately after joining up, her good friend Ralis told her that she must join him in Lower Guk. Lower Guk is still pretty scary to our adventurer Dalane, but she decided to go, as he said the rewards would be well worth the risk. Dalane got there, and saw Svarte and immediately gave him and Ralis one of her patented *hugs*. She settled in with her new group, and she must have been a goodluck charm, as these ghoulish beasts of the frenzied nature bestowed both Svarte and Ralis beautiful Flowing Black Silk Sashes. These are some of the most revered belts for any experienced adventurer, and the group was thrilled to have recieved these blessings from the gods. Soon after, Dalane somehow managed to wiggle her way into the group leadership position, and from that point on... her brethren in her house of friends, they call themselves The Mystical Order, claimed this part of this scary and dangerous dungeon. Eventually Dalane go a FBSS of her own, after only 9 hours, and a moonstone ring too! She also had a major relevation (ooc: leveled) as she stayed her. TMO tried to stay as long as possible, but the world was unstable, and they would up having to take a few unwanted breaks from the hunts. Many were there to help their younger brethren, and for this we are all humbled and extremely thankful for their overwhelming aid.  <BR>  <BR>        All in all, everyone had a great time, and met others they may not have known so well. Much was learned, much was gained, and bonds were formed ever tighter.  <BR>  <p><IMG SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~dalane01/dalanetorso.jpg"><BR>
