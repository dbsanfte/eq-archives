This is how it works - you are in one of those life or death races to the zone line.  You are getting rooted/stunned/blown up/hacked to pieces right at the zone line.  With nothing left, down to that nasty crossed-out name display of your health, you cross!  Then, you appear, NOT at the zone line byt somewhere in the middle of the zone, with full health and (when applicable) no mana.  My theory - you died INSIDE the zone line, and the AI just freaked out and stuck you somewhere handy. Or maybe Bristlebain really does reward the tricky. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Jarondel</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/22/99 12:13:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dead? .......not yet....</span><hr size=1> I was playing in Crushbone as I was want to do from about 7 to 17 when at the level of 13 the Infamous &quot;D'Vinn to Zone&quot; shout arrives on my box. I had been fighting Legs so I was taking a pretty good pounding and was &quot;resting&quot; at the CB side of the zone. I decided that the better part of valor was to high tail it to the other or SAFE side of the zone. I zone without problem and being down to about half a bub of HP I decide that it is time to Real World eat.  <BR>  <BR> I Know that it will take forever to regenerate my large roguely number of HP so I think this will be the perfect opportunity to get that EtOH Tolerance up at the same time. I start in on the short beers. Approximately 7 or 8 of the short brews later my INT is about 20 and I am looking at a sliver of recognizable landscape surrounded by a streaking of surroundings. I sit and Hide, but the hide will not work because I am weaving approximately 30 feet as I sit.  <BR>  <BR> I decided that at level 13 nothing outside of Crushbone can hurt me so I get up and get some food. I watch a bit of TV and fix a magnificent sandwich accompanied by chips and salsa. Yes I am a Southwestern Boy at heart if not presently in geography.  <BR>  <BR> After about 30 minutes I remember that I am sitting in the Crushbone entrance and figure that I will be Normal/Normal Hp/INT. Much to my surprise, when I get to my screen, I am looking at the back of a Guards legs.  <BR>  <BR> Interesting, I think, then I stand and actually sit down. Now How did that happen? I quickly realize that I am not in the Crushbone entrance anymore but at my &quot;gate&quot; point at the orc lift. Also the You are hungry/thirsty message is platered on my screen from top to bottem, interspersed with the occasional Faydark /auction.  <BR>  <BR> I scroll up and low and behold my entire screen is red with 'an orc centurion trys to hit you but misses&quot; with the occsional Hits you for 2 or 3 points. As I inquire further I see the ever telling &quot;you are knocked unconscious&quot; along with the heralded &quot;you regain consciousness&quot; only to be knocked down again. This occurred 7 times on my screen with about 100 misses or hits for 3 hp messages interspersed. It took up the entire scroll. I have no idea how long the orc or orcs had been hitting me or trying to hit me but by scrolling up, I had proof that I had been knocked unconscious at LEAST 7 times. Finally being dealt the death blow by a lucky hit of 4 hp. Loading, Please wait..... <BR>  <BR> Being killed by a Cent at 13 is bad enough, but to have this happen was horrible. The worst part was that I know at least 30 people were zoning in and out of Crush that night, and at least on my scope, non helped me. I deserve it. Nothing is free unless you pick it yourself. haha But the good news is that my EtOH tolerance increase to 12 that night. Alas all was not lost.  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Jarondel 21 99/100   <BR> Mith Marr <BR> Currently in South Karana <BR> Hmmmm, what about &quot;Birdbag&quot; for a last name. <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/ufreonsmurf.showPublicProfile>FreonSmurf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif  BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/22/99 4:07:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dead? .......not yet....</span><hr size=1> This has to be the oldest thread still alive onthis message board <p><body bgcolor="#FFFBEC" text="#000000" link="#0000FF" alink="#FF2020" vlink="#800020">

I was in hide/sneak mode with a SOW on me so that I wouldn't move too slowly and was doing alright.  Then all of a sudden I heard &quot;Minotaur train!&quot;  Smugly I continued on my way not paying attention since the mino couldn't see me anyway.  THen all of a sudden I am getting hit for 63 points of damage.  I guess Bristlbane wanted to punish me, he is a bit fickle, for my arrogance.  I am too far from the cave opening and was getting hit to hard and i knew I was done for.  As I lay there gasping for breath (still looking beautiful I might add) I prayed one last time and prepared for the afterlife.  Then I heard the sound of a sword being drawn and flesh splitting apart.  I lifted my weak head and saw this valiant little dwarf battling the mino.  Soon the dwarf was surrounded with finger wagglers (still to this day can't understand why he chose to go with them casters) and they dispatched the mino into the fiery inferno of the underworld.  I was soon surrounded with a blue haze (ok ok casters have their good points) and was restored to full health.  *smiles* And that dwarf and I have been happily married for three years now :) <BR> Of course we look a bit odd as I hail from the north and he is from Kaladim but our respective gods have blessed our union so we can go forth and prosper. <BR>  <BR> Syryn <BR>  <BR> /ooc I spilled some water my keyboard and accidently hit the hide hotkey while wiping it up.

I am a dwarven rogue who was trying to get more popular with the gnomes. I was just looking around when I saw a young Highelf wizard fighting a gnome skeleton, he looked weak but his magic was strong and didn't seem to worried. After whatching him figting the skeleton, a plague rat joined the fight..I would have some trouble with the skeleton, but the rat seemed no problem to me......He yelled for help and because I don't like those deseased things and skeletons I swiftly backstabbed the rat. The Rat Much bigger and stonger than I anticipated, casted some plague spell on me. That meant trouble....The wizard killed the skeleton and turned around to help me.  While gathering some space so he could cast he backed up towards two Kobolds !, Already hurt from the last battle he didn't last long.. poor lad.... I never knew his name.  Luckily the kobolds didn't have any grudge towards me and left me alone. But the rat was too tough...Much too tough..so to my shame I ran.. the guards were too far away so I ran toward the pass of faydark, I knew the rat wouldn't follow me there.. The rat was quick on his feet and manage to bite me and cast a plague spell so many times I thought I would never make it...But I did..with a mimimum of health left(half a bar)..I quickly took out to bandage myself and felt better, but everytime I bandege myself the plague took its toll and my wounds became worse.  <BR> Knowing that I would lose consiousness if i wouldn't bandage myself I kept bandaging.(I gained by bandaging about 1/4 a bar but lost a little more by the plageu spell)  My life decreased even more and more over time, It seemed to be a loosing battle. finally when the plague brought me down to a minimum (1/10th of health orso) and the bandaging wouldn't help me anymore, I overcame the plague....weak as I was I cheered..Then I discovered that I just used the last bandage, if the plague had lasted a little longer or if I had less bandages I would have been a dead dwarf ! <BR>  <BR> Gronti <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/ucaowyth.showPublicProfile>Caowyth</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/29/99 12:52:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Helping can be dangerous</span><hr size=1> I have one of these to tell myself. <BR>  <BR> The other night some of my friends and I went out to Gargoyle island in the Ocean of Tears. The place was camped, and not spawning Gargoyles like it used to in the days of yore, so we decided to head over to the Oracle Island to slaughter some goblins. <BR>  <BR> The group consisted of Myself, a 20th level wizard, a 20th level Magician, an 18th level Shaman, and a 22nd level Cleric. <BR>  <BR> Well about halfway through the night we had a bad pull and ended up with the Island goblin Headmaster on us. Not a problem, I thought, as we have taken him before. <BR>  <BR> As it turned out however, we ended up with a much higher spawn than last time, and all of the casters spells were being resisted. In the meantime I was getting double attacked for 54. Now earlier in the night a high level Druid had seen fit to cast a Skin like Nature spell on me (Which for those that don't know is the ULTIMATE hit point buff with a minor regen effect). Now we are fighting this goblin, but it turns out that I am the only thing capable of taking it. So the Wizard and Magician back off and start using bandages on me. The cleric and shaman started using their heals on me as well. I got hit, knocked unconcious, got back up with 120 hit points. Got knocked unconcious again, got back up with 110 hit points, got knocked unconcious again. I was knocked unconcious about 8 times during the fight. <BR>  <BR> But we won! =) <BR>  <BR> Now if I can only find out what this Chippedbone Mask is for. <BR>  <BR> Caowyth Shadowbane <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/ukatzpaw.showPublicProfile>Katzpaw</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/29/99 10:42:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chipped bone mask</span><hr size=1> the chipped bone mask is for wizard only armor in the Solsek Ro quest <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Krieger</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/30/99 4:33:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The closest I've been to death without dying</span><hr size=1> One fine day when I was a newbie rogue (about 4th shadow) I was trotting along the road from me home in kaladim to the green forests of Gfay.  I had gotten a message from me close friend Marbain the Magnificent who requested my help at orc hill.  Though we were both only level 4 we had a older dwarven guildbrother who was a level 9 cleric.  I immediately agreed as I was ready for some action.  I zoned into gfay and was on me way to the hill when I heard a scream to my left.  I turned and saw a young female half-elf frantically trying to escape a wandering orc cent who was beating the ever-living elf out of her. I immediately hitched up me patchwork pants settled me scarab helm and readied me rusty spear then I charged.  The orc sensing my approach changed targets and started pounding on me while I kept missing him.  The half-elf girl ran away and I was glad that she would survive.  I could feel the blood flowing freely from the many wounds the orc was inflicting on me and knew I would soon see Death.  Falling back beneath the massive heel of the cent I prepared me death chant and had just opened me mouth to sing it when I was knocked unconscious. Death be not proud.  As I started to float away towards that trap-filled, lots of locks to pick, poison never fails, pick pocketing always works and you never die Heaven in the sky, I saw a small figure hurry to me side.  I knew there was no hope so I closed me eyes and readied for ... &quot;You are conscious&quot;  It was me dwarven cleric friend!  He spent his precious energy on healing my wounds until it was like I had never been wounded at all!  Truly Rodcet Nife is a wonderous God to allow such power.  The orc cent that had nearly sent me to me reward was promptly dispatched by his companion and they looted it.  I drew in a weary breath and limped to the area by the guards.  I sat there for awhile and pondered if I truly wanted to try me wits against an orc again.  True me friend wanted me but surely if he had nearly died like I had he would think twice about fighting them.  So when the time came and Marbain stood before me waiting for me to follow I did what any other rogue would do ... hitched up me torn patchwork pants settled me scratched scarab helm readied me rusty spear and away we went! <BR>  <BR> Krieger the 2nd <BR> 8th Shadow <BR>  <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Shirl</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/99 1:30:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> How close to dead?</span><hr size=1>  I had been sneaking and peeking in and around Crushbone with little luck. Couldn't find a group, and all the centurions were looking a bit tough to me, so I left and headed for Orc Hill.  <BR>    On the way I spotted a centurion who didn't look too tough, so I lit into him, and pouned him but good. Just as it looked like he was going to go down, his brother showed up. No need to start worrying, I figured I'd be able to knock the first one off and then handle the second one since he didn't look very tough either. <BR>    Just as the first orc turned tail and ran, two more jumped me from behind. 'Time to beat feet' I told myself, and made the dash to the summit of Orc Hill figuring I'd find some able bodied help there. I mean, there' ALWAYS someone there, right? ALWAYS! <BR>  <BR> Not tonight there wasn't. Not a soul, and poor me now being chased by 4 centurions (#1 had gotten his courage back and rejoined the fight). <BR>  <BR> Better to die fighting - and where I know I can find my corpse, then fleeing through some dark, mist shrouded forest, so I turned and fought. Oh brother did I fight, but there were to many of them, and I thought I was a goner. Just as I felt my fell into uncosciousness a passing do gooder joined the fray, and healed me enough to get me back on my feet.  <BR> And so I fought on. <BR>  <BR> We knocked off two of the orcs, but down I went again, and again he healed me before I could bleed to death, so back into the melee I went. It was glorious, but it wasn't over yet. <BR>  <BR> Some poor fellow who would have been safer hunting spiders and bats came charging up the hill with a train of 4 more centurions behind him. Try as he might, my companion was unable to save him from death, and as soon as the poor fellow died his brutish followers turned their unwanted attentions on us.  <BR>  <BR> I went down for a third time, and was certain that this sealed an unhappy fate for your's truly, but lo, once more my unknown companion juiced me up again, and we fought on. In short order we killed off the last two of the original 4 centurions that had jumped me, and then turned on the 4 Grishnak-come-latelies. <BR>  <BR> I took out one of those 4 without further help, but since he had his entire neighborhood on his side, I was taken down again (the 4th time), and thought for sure that this was it.  <BR>  <BR> Nope, I was healed one last time, and it lasted long enough for the two of us to finish off the last of the orcs. When the fight was finally over I had 3- THREE!!! Hit points left, and had been below zero 4 times!!!  <BR>  <BR> I don't know who my benefactor was that night, he left when the fight ended, but if I ever find him again, I'm gonna make him my new best friend. <BR>  <BR> So, if you happen to read this, whoever you were that night on Orc Hill, Mithanial Marr, two nights ago (wed 12/7) and remember that fight, contact me, I have to thank you. <BR>  <BR> Four times unconscious in one long, brawling, unbelievable fight.

Well things turned ugly.. I barely survived, as did Nikilis, but during the fight Kul was going down... I fought bravely to get to him to taunt the Orc away, but the room was too crowded, and Kulwaen fell.  The Orc somehow managed to find new prey.  The fight raged on when Kulwaen unconsious body started crying 'help'  I had to look twice as I thought he was dead.  <BR> 'Help im unconsious' the inert form of Kulwaen cried... its hard to fight when your laughing loudly to your enemies.  <BR> Needless to say he was soon bandaged up and rearing to go.  <BR> The dwarf managed to survive too.. which was lucky... I was about to flame him for his stupidness, and my wrath must has been great indeed, for the silly little dwarf backed off from me and  fell out of the window in the tower and died.  <BR> It was a great night to be remembered...

Normally I'd have no problem with them, but after the battle with Mooto, I only had about 1/2 a bub, so I decided to run. Over the hill I see the entrance and those kill stealing guards...

I love this thread.  How about the LONGEST you've been unconcious without dying?  I was attacking people at random in the Qeynos area of Vallon Zek,  not killing anyone,  but just attacking and playing hide and seek in town.  Well one guy 8 levels above me decided he was too annoyed,  rooted me and blasted me unconcious.  Rather then kill me though he just kept punching me for one point of damage over and over and over.  The only thing you can do unconcious of course is talk  so after 7 minutes of this I typed /quit  and logged out for a bit.  Turns out he kept up the punching so long while I was linkdead that I disapeared before he could actually kill me.  whoop! <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/uprenn.showPublicProfile>Prenn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/21/99 4:34:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The closest I've been to death without dying </span><hr size=1> Finally I have a worthy contribution to this excellent thread! <BR>  <BR> Anyone who's been to West Commonlands on The Tribunal in the past two days is tired of hearing <BR>  <BR> Pren actions, &quot;Buying Greater lightstones, 7pp each.&quot; <BR>  <BR> I've been buying tons of GLSs, and killing as many wisps as possible. However, since I'm used to being my lvl20 monk, I forget that a wisp can kick my ass. Someone who was gathering GLSs for me tells me there was a large respawn of wisps east of the tollbooth. I turn around and see him down the hill attacking a wisp, and 2 wisps going off in other directions. I leap on one and start pummeling it. It's doing ALOT of damage to me, and I only had 4 bubbles to start with. Down to 2 bubbles, a second wisp joins in. Mend.. <BR>  <BR> You have worsened your wounds! (Oh sh!t...) <BR> I turn to run and get stunned twice in a row, seeing a nice panaramic view while the wisps beat my ass into the ground. <BR>  <BR> I take off running, giving some /y's. I get missed _12_ times in a row by the wisps (with 63 agility!!!) I run past the other guy, and the wisp he has near dead *aggros on ME*. So here I am, running to the EC zone, with 3 wisps, a necro, and his pet in tow. The wisps constantly are missing me, and only hitting for 1 damage. Almost to the zone, a wisp dies. The two open a can on me (Ok, so they hit me for 11 and 13) dropping me down to practically nothing. I hit my 3 hotkey (personna), and see 17 hps left as I hit the zone line. When I finish zoning, i've got 0 stamina (alot of jumping), and 6 hps. <BR>  <BR> Regretably, the 2 wisps turned and killed the necro. He got stunlocked and died very close to the zone, apparently. <BR>  <BR> Why did I not die? How could I run 1/4th of the zone with 1/2 a bubble of hps? <BR>  <BR> A druid was hunting guards at the tollbooth, so he sow'd everyone there. Since the guards don't attack wisps, I would have died had he not decided to kill the guards there. Heh, sometimes the druids really do help more than the guards. Thanks Dolt ;) <BR>  <BR> PS: Dont use mend in combat until you're lvl20 & 1/2 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/ushaidon.showPublicProfile>Shaidon </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/15/00 2:36:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The closest I've been to death without dying </span><hr size=1> I wanted to do this for a LONG time.=)  Now that *bumps* are fashionable, I suppose I shall do this. <BR>  <BR> *bump* <BR> *grin* <p><strong><font size="4"> Shaidon d'Sombra</font></strong><br>

Getting ready to pull the 3 from the top which are a bit harder, especially with a smaller group.  Yllems says he has to go eat dinner real quick, so we wait for him.  I'm the impatient type so as soon as he comes back, we pull the top.  <BR>   <BR> Right into the middle of a spawn.  Two extra protectors.  We try it anyway.  Sow blinks.  Yell for the shaman to run, but he just runs around trying to get a sow off, he has a tendency to do stupid, brave things like that when he has the most xp.  Sow leaves, shaman dies.  Start running.  Not too bad, luckily the warrior is getting most of the hits, and he can handle it.  Get to the door outside the courtyard, mess up opening it and get caught in the door.  Have to open and close it, now they're hitting on me.  I can't handle it.  Half way through the courtyard my health bar turns purple and I'm looking at my body on the ground, some wierd view bug.  All the sudden I'm off and running again.  Shaman's health bar starts dropping like a rock.  We both make it, barely.  <BR>   <BR> Yup, shaman died, was bound in CY, immediantly memmed heal, got it off JUST in time and tanked the mobs while completely neked while we zoned. <p><strong><font size=4 color="#333333"><u>Ozaak Kaazo                                        </u></font><br>

<br>
A bunch of elves were camping the bank in Kelethin when this poor Gnome decided to do deposit her loot.  They rooted her and all started hitting on her.  She was very patient, closed her bank account, /tapped her foot, and as soon as the root broke ran out the door and off the edge of the platform.<br>
<br>
The bank in Kelethin is quite high up--third level?--and even her Rogueish Safefall didn't save her.  She died, but at least she wasn't PKed.<br>
<br>
Then the strange part.  The entire server crashed.  When it finally goes back up she logs on and finds that her last save point was in mid-air!  So she only falls for half the distance, hits the ground, and runs off to recuperate.  No death at all.<br>
<br>
If only we could arrange these convenient all-server crashes more often.<br>
