<br>
Feign Death is one of the two defining characteristics of the Monk class.  The other being the ability to Dual Wield at level one and having a higher skill cap in the skill than any other class.  This skill will be enormously important to playing a Monk well in most of the traditional roles a Monk plays in groups. It is also invaluable during soloing at higher levels.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, the skill does two things.<br>
<br>
Causes you to be indifferent to all NPCs.   This means attacking NPCs stop attacking and will treat you as if you were invisible as long as you lie still.  This does not mean they will no longer attack you if you stand back up.  In that case it will be like you have lost your invisibility and you will again be attacked.<br>
<br>
Causes you to be removed from NPC "Hatelists" 100% of the time if the NPC is under level 32, and has a much smaller chance of removing you from the list if the NPC is above level 32.<br>
<br>
<H4>Getting and Training Feign Outside of Combat.</H4><br>
Feign Death is a trained skill.  This means visiting a Monk Trainer in one of the guilds is necessary to get the skill active after you reach level 17.<br>
<br>
From level 8 on I saved all my skill points. I spent 10 on Double Attack when I got it, but since I did a lot of soloing I did not anticipate many problems getting it to the level cap quickly/easily.  This meant I had 35 skill points(5 skill points per level saved up over 9 levels would be 45 points, but I spent 10 on Double Attack at level 15) I could give Feign Death a "jumpstart" with.  When I reached level 17, I spent all these points on Feign. This gave me a skill of 51 in Feign before I even left the guild hall. The first training point spent on a skill gained after level 1 gives you a skill level of the skill level your class gains that ability at and the others give you one skill point per training point.<br>
<br>
I immediately made a macro to train Feign Death during downtime and during travel.<br>
<br>
/doability 8 (my FD skill is in skill slot 8 )<br>
/stand<br>
/pause 90<br>
/doability 8<br>
/stand<br>
<br>
There may be better macros that could be contrived(and indeed others have replied to this thread with their favorites, I'll be including them as a small appendix at the end of this guide), but this one practices FD twice, and immediately stands back up after feigning.  This meant I could run and still use it as long as I was willing to forgo the use of the autorun feature.  Feigning and standing back up breaks the autorun and you would have to re-start it after each feign.  <br>
<br>
I used this macro as frequently as I possibly could.  The momentary hitch in your step as you fall and then stand back up adds minimal overhead to the length of time it takes to run most distances. It was even easier when I was on a boat. I'd use this macro and open up my abilities menu to practice Sense Heading, Sneak, Instill Doubt, etc on boat rides.  It is important to remember  that only one macro can execute at a time. So when I was using my Feign Death practice macro I could not use my macros to practice Sneak, Sense Heading, etc.  So I would have a bank of hotkeys with all these buttons in close proximity to my Feign Death practice macro. After I started the macro I would use the individual buttons to practice my other skills.  All of this could be done while traveling, and indeed I got many of my skill increases during my frequent runs across Antonica.<br>
<br>
As soon as I left the Ashen House in Freeport, I was dying to try out my new skill.  I ran out to the newbie area outside the gates in West Freeport and wasted several dozen shiruken pulling bats, rats, orcs, snakes, fire beetles, skeletons, pretty much anything I could hit, just to watch them get close to me before I would feign.  Very, very funny(and how ironic that this was good practice for splitting pulls later!).  <br>
<br>
I did some dumb things too.  I decided that the reason I was always able to feign off the greenies in the newbie zone was because they were green!  So I needed to try a harder target and see if they would buy it.   I got as far as I could from the Guard who patrols by the North  Freeport zone and threw a shiruken.<br>
<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT<br>
You have LOST a level. You are now level 16.<br>
<br>
/cry<br>
<br>
I learned an important lesson with that death.  Different creatures have different chances to "believe" your trickery.   Those many levels higher than you will rarely "fall for it" and those many levels below you will almost always be fooled.<br>
<br>
I also did some silly things like being a Monk Flag hanging out over the guards by feigning as I stood on the edge of the wall of the city.  "Sleeping" in beds or "taking a nap in Emperor Crush's Throne" are still some of my favorite silly things to do. A female monk friend had a social emote made which she used to flirt with.<br>
<br>
/em faints at %Ts sexy eyes<br>
/doability Feign Death<br>
<br>
I thought it was funny the first time, but the death scream kind of ruined the mood :p       But the point holds, you can get in Feign Death practice even when you're doing silly things, and believe me, you can't practice enough.<br>
<br>
<H4>Using Feign Death to split spawns</H4><br>
I did not rely on FD during combat until my skill level hit the high 70s, and I was still very leary of it. If things started going bad, I would much rather turn tail and run, than attempt to Feign until my skill was very close to master level. Other monks have given the same impressions, failure to feign your death often results in your actual death at lower levels.<br>
<br>
Probably the first thing you should do when you start considering using FD during combat or to split pulls is to make a macro for it.  Here is what mine looks like.<br>
/autoattack off<br>
/doability 8 (Feign Death)<br>
/consider<br>
<br>
With autoattack still on, your feign is more likely to be unsuccessful.  This may be paranoia on the part of many monks, but it has long become habit and convention that FD is successful more often with the Autoattack turned off before the attempt is made. The /consider command is there to give me notification, before the next wave of attacks hits hopefully, if the NPC has forgotten about me or not.  If they regard you indifferently, you should be fine.  If they are Scowling, Ready to Attack, then your Feign Death has failed and you should stand back up immediately before their weapon delay runs out and they hit you for max damage as you lay prone before them.<br>
<br>
Until my monk was in the mid-20s, I rarely had occasion to need to "split" mobs.  Most of the creatures I chose to hunt were solitary, and I deliberately pulled them away from the paths of others of their kind if they were "social"(Creatures that are "social" are creatures who will join in a fight even if they were not attacked themselves.  Fire Beetles are a common type of "social" mob)  Since I had roughly 7 levels of practicing FD, by the time I needed to use it to split spawns, it was at master level.  Your experiences may be different if you don't have a master FD skill before starting to try to split spawns.  Many in the Monk community, and myself as well, highly reccommend having a Master skill level before trying.  This means level 20 at the earliest.  More example practice macros can be found at the end of this guide.<br>
<br>
Here is an example from some of my early days of learning how to split pulls.<br>
<br>
I've fought a lot in The Warrens. The King's room is essentially a large square that bulges where the throne room is. The King and the High Shaman often spawn together and it is necessary to split them if you can't take both together. Add the fact that some of the Kobold Elders, Pack Leaders or Huge Kobolds will still aggro on you at level 25, and it's kind of a difficult room to hold solo at the level I did it. Here is a link to a map of the room, and how I did it. <br>
<br>
http://www.eqatlas.com/warrensmap.html<br>
<br>
The King's room is number 11 on the map. The throne is pretty much exactly where the numbers are.<br>
<br>
The pathing in this room is pretty straightforward. It follows the walls for the most part, there is a path that crosses in front of the throne and a path that runs down the center of the room straight East from the throne and connects the cross-path and the path which runs North-South along the Eastern wall. The King spawns just West of the cross-line and just East of the throne(immediately to the right of the number 11 on the map, and the cross-line runs North-South just a little further East of the King's spawn point). The High Shaman spawns just North-East of the King.  In the case of The Warrens it is important to clear the room of all the Shaman-class mobs. Even the green mobs will heal the King or High Shaman if they are still up.  I also made rounds of all the Pack Elders, Huge Kobolds and others that might have been aggressive and add during my pull and killed them.  <br>
<br>
The way I split the King and High Shaman was to aggro both and run them around in the North-West wing of the throne room until the High Shaman began to cast a spell. As soon as he stopped to cast, I'd make a bee-line towards the South-East corner of the room, with the King hot on my heels. When I was hit by the spell I would immediately feign. The Shaman was in the North-West side of the room, left behind because he stopped chasing me to cast his spell and then lost interest after I feigned, so he would follow the path along the North side of the room back to the cross-line and then to his spawn point. However, the king was in the South-East corner, so he would hug the South wall until he got to the cross-line, then head North along it. This was plenty of space to tag the King again after feigning them off. The Shaman would stand in his spawn point blissfully unaware that I was killing the king.  His aggro radius at level 25 was about 15 feet or so, and his assist radius was a little larger, maybe 25 feet or so.<br>
<br>
When the king began to run, he would follow the walls to the North and East out the door, so he stayed away from the Shaman who would have healed him. After that I simply ran up to the Shaman and killed him at his spawn point. Without the king to back him up, he wasn't too hard.<br>
<br>
There is a second type of split pull you can do solo, it's far easier.  Sometimes when you pull a group of mobs they will stand over you after you feign and then each individual will wander off at different times.  Simply pull them all to you and then feign.  They will stand still for a certain amount of time, then take their paths back to spawn one at a time.  Stand back up after there are only one or two, or however many you can handle, left and engage it/them.  The dangrous thing about this type of split pulling is that often times the others will not have gone far enough and you will still be within their Assist Radius.  They will re-aggro, then if they are within another mob's Assist Radius, yet another mob will aggro and the chain will continue.  This is called Chain Aggro, and is deadly.   It's often better to take your time pulling and feigning several times without trying to engage the at all.  Just watch the pathing and amount of time between when each mob starts to wander back to their spawn point. This will help you determine what is the exact amount of time you need to stay feigned in order for enough of the group to have wandered far enough away for it to be safe to engage the others.<br>
<br>
To practice this type of pull I reccommend the Goblins in the Lake of Ill Omen.  <br>
<br>
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/lakeofillomenmap.html<br>
<br>
There are several ruined forts along the lake where Goblins hide behind the entranceways. Locations 6, and 9 on the map. If you pull one of these Goblins by the door, several others will come as well from further in the building.  Two and three at a time, sometimes with a Spirit Caller(shaman class mob).  Pull them towards the lakeshore and then feign on the beach.  They will sometimes wander far enough to not chain-aggro again, but sometimes when you stand back up the others have not gone far enough away and will come running back.  If you learn the pathing you can still split them, or pull a Sarnak to them and feign.  Once the Sarnak finishes off one or two of them(and dies to the third depending on the levels of each this will vary) you can mop up the rest.  The Goblins also tend to wander off at time intervals which allows them all to stay within each other's Assist Radius.  Practicing splitting pulls here will certainly give you the chance of seeing chain aggro in person.  A valuable experience.  Patience is required.  If they continue to chain-aggro, abort completely and let them return to spawn points and try again. Maybe pull to a different spot on the beach the next time and see if they take different paths back.<br>
<br>
Using a third-person view for this type of splitting is invaluable.  You can rarely accurately judge the distance the others have wandered if you don't use the third-person views.  I'd reccommend working on fighting using third-person views as much as possible, this will be of massive benefit both to you and your group.   Being able to see yourself, them behind you and the mobs you're pulling all at the same time is almost critical to the success of a high-end pull.<br>
<br>
For more detailed information on the Art of Pulling I highly reccommend the excellent <A HREF="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=291.topic">Guide to Advanced Pulling</A> by <b>LaotzuQigong</b><br>
<br>
Other places to practice splitting pulls are the Sarnaks in the Lake of Ill Omen, the City of Mist, Frogloks in Guk, Sol A & B, Cazic Thule, and Dalnir's Crypt.  Realistically, any zone where multiple creatures aggro on you can be used to practice splitting.  For practice purposes you could even run around and "tag" several NPCs to create a group to split.  This is kind of ridiculous when you consider the large number of zones where hostile NPCs are already organized into groups. <br>
<br>
At some point in your career be sure to visit a zone with many caster-type mobs.  Learning how to judge the timing of a Feign attempt in order to keep a spell from breaking it is something you must learn in person.  Running out of sight of a casting mob after they begin casting to keep them from casting over and over on you.  If you are out of line of sight, they will chase after you until they can see you again.  By leading them one curve at a time through corridors you can pull them to your group. You can also give yourself enough of a head start while they stand still casting to get out of line of sight and feign after the spells they're currently casting hit without worrying about them starting a new spell.<br>
<br>
<H4>Other Uses for Feign Death.</H4><br>
Feign Death is a remarkably flexible skill.  It can be used to help control aggro, to help travel, to save your life, and to aid in rescuing other groupmates.<br>
<br>
I have used it to run past creatures which would kill me and while they are chasing after me I would feign and they would wander back out of aggro range to their spawn points.  I could stand up and continue my journey.  When this is done repeatedly it is often called "feign-flopping" and allows monks to penetrate deep levels of dungeons or escape from such dungeons without magical aid.<br>
<br>
If many members of a group are killed during a bad fight, the monk can Feign Death and then after the mob has left, can drag his companions corpses to the zone line to be resurrected or looted.  This saves your groupmates the loss of valuable experience or equipment in especially dangerous zones.<br>
<br>
Aggro management with Feign Death is kind of tricky at high levels because mobs over level 32 do not have as high a chance of getting the memory-wipe effect, but there is still a chance.  Several monks choose to build a hotkey which produces an effect similar to the Evade ability of Rogues.<br>
<br>
/attack off<br>
/doability FD<br>
/con<br>
/Sit off<br>
/attack on<br>
<br>
If they regarded you indifferently with the con, then you probably lost some aggro and can stand back up to continue dealing damage.<br>
<br>
Feign Death can sometimes help you kill mobs you normally could not kill.  Pull a static spawn(one that does not wander) and fight it as long as you can.  Feign it off and as soon as it wanders out of aggro range begin to bind your wounds and recover your HP.  In this manner you can often regain HP faster than the Mob will and you can pull it again with you at half life and it already damaged.  Since you have healed more than it has, you can re-engage it and this extra bit of health will help you bring it lower than you could the first time. Repeat as necessary to whittle down it's life total.  Note that this is a very dangerous technique as the regeneration rate of mobs is extremely high and without a very high skill in Bind Wound you often will not be able to regain more life then the mob and the margin you are counting on will be negligible.<br>

<br>
<H4>Glossary of Terms Often Used in Discussions About Feign Death.</H4><br>
<b>Aggro and Assist Radius.</b><br>
<br>
The Aggro Radius is the minimum distance you must stay away from a hostile NPC to keep it from attempting to engage you.  <br>
<br>
The Assist Radius is the minimum distance you must be away from a second NPC which is "social" with the type of NPC you are fighting in order to keep it from attacking as well. <br>
<br>
Typically the Assist Radius is larger than the Aggro Radius.  If you need to be ten feet from a NPC to keep it from attacking you, you probably should allow 20 to 30 feet between the two of you and the nearest of it's fellows before attacking it if you do not wish to fight both.  The Assist Radius is the minimum distance you must keep both yourself and your opponent from any of it's fellows, even when it is running from you, to keep from having to fight both.<br>
<br>
The most important thing to remember about Aggro/Assist Radii is that they change constantly.  Depending on your level, your health, the mob you're fighting, your faction and dozens of other factors, these circles can be from tiny to enormous.  The Mansion of Unrest is famous for it's "lawn trash" which are usually low-level undead and Death Beetles which will join in a fight even if they themselves are green to the PCs.  If a PC is not engaged with a NPC, the death beetles leave them alone, but if they see an encounter, they hop in.  Only careful study of a zone and it's inhabitants will give you a feel for the aggro radii you will have to work around when pulling/splitting and fear kiting.  And you will have to re-learn this every level because these radii change.<br>
<br>
<b>Pathing.</b><br>
<br>
Think of paths like the highway/street system in real world cities.  Most of the time people stay on the roads, and if you're off the road for some reason and an emergency comes up(like being nearly beaten to death) the best chance you have is to get back to the road and hope someone else helps, or hope you can make it to some safe haven before you are slain.<br>
<br>
Players can pretty much wander wherever they want, but mobs typically follow pre-set paths.  When a zone is designed, paths are laid out that monsters will follow.  They may look like they are  wandering aimlessly, but in reality they are following these paths until something causes them  to leave it(something like chasing down an adventurer).  This is a restriction of the computer-based medium of the game.  If each monster were to have it's own sense of direction and be able to wander anywhere they pleased, the amount of programming and processing power they would require to keep from running off a cliff, wandering at the zone line trying to cross, or doing things like walking through lava, would be immense.   As a comprimise, there are, sometimes very complex, paths laid down that NPCs will follow. <br>
<br>
Sometimes adventurers engage NPCs on these paths, and another NPC wanders down it and joins the fight.  This can be deadly in many situations, and it is often better to provoke the NPC into following you to some goodly distance from the "path" and fighting it there.  If it is a monster which will attempt to run when it's life total gets low, it will turn around and head for the path again when it's life reaches a certain point.  If it reaches the path, it will again follow it in it's attempt to flee.  Knowing the movement patterns of the monsters you are hunting is extremely beneficial.  If they run straight into a camp of their fellows it could cause your death to run after them.  It would be wiser to pull them further out so they will be dead before they could reach their camp.  If you ever want to try the technique known as "Fear Kiting" using your Instill Doubt skill, knowing the pathing of the creatures you will be fighting becomes absolutely vital.  You should also study the pathing patterns of other creatures in the area to be sure there are none who will cross your path and join the fight on your enemy's side.  Often there are only a few paths in a zone and most monsters will re-use the same trail others used.  <br>

<br>
FD is not really reliable for pulling/combat until skill 101. Which means level 20. Tough but there it is.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when you FD and stand right back up you cant move, the fix is to sit and then stand again.<br>
<br>
You do not need to be feigning off a mob for the skill to go up. Basically just mash the key every time it ungreys.<br>

<br>
Feign Death isn't reliable at skill 200 (atleast not mine, i think it's broke).  Also, mobs uner lvl 35 (this means the actual mobs level, not your lvl) will forget you after a successful feign 100% of the time. Mobs over lvl 35 have a chance at remembering you, and it's a pretty high percentage (can't remember exact sorry guys) until they get back to their spawn point.  Once back to their spawn point they have a pretty low chance of rememberng youif they still have one at all...in my 51 lvls of monkdom i have had ONE reaggro after the mob got back to it's spawn point.<br>

All i can think of at the moment, will be back later with more hopefully <p>Shenlon Flamingfists

for me, it seems if i fd while attacking.. i fd good but there still scowling.. my only guess is i hit them while doin the FD.<br>

every time i have a successful FD while not attacking, it works =]<br>
<br>
also, if your being casted on by an npc.. fd AFTER the spell hits you, takes practice.. and may take a few times to do, if there chain casting or youve got 2+ caster types on you.<br>
<br>
if you fd and a spell lands on you, fd will be broke.. youll get that message about how your no longer feigned.<br>

turn off auto attack -&gt; wait for like a split second -&gt; fd<br>
wait for spell to land on you -&gt; fd<br>

Far easier to get away from numerous casters than simply standing in the open getting chain casted on whilst trying to time a feign between spells. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p><br>

<br>
beside my FD button i made one titled FSnek that is simply<br>
<br>
/loc<br>
/sit off <br>
/doability (sneak)<br>
<br>
This does double duty.  It gives me my normal sneak button, AND it allows me to get up from a feign and immediately start sneaking.  Unless a mob just sticks there for a bit, they will all be out of 'line-of-site' when you are ready to get up, so this can and will save yer butt. The /loc part is a matter of discipline for me.  I add it to everything I do, and almost always I have a reference point to find my corpse.<br>
<br>
Today I was using Froon to practice my 2hb (28... arrrgh) with my new swoobie Adamantite Bo.  here's my tactic, to make the above clear.<br>
<br>
1) sneak and approach Froon (who i now refer to as Homer Simpson) from behind.<br>
2) WHILE SNEAKING instill doubt.  I never got a sucessful one against him, but hey, i can dream...  it always seemed to fizzle on the third try and he would aggro.<br>
3) whack away for several blows, i.e. til i got down to a couple of red bubbles.<br>
4) back up to my original spot behind him at the edge of his aggro radius, FD, wait for him to go back.<br>
<br>
5) press the said button above, bind my wounds, mend if it was ready, and back at him.<br>
<br>
I also chased a Corrupted Mammoth halfway across Everfrost like this today solo.  whack, whack, FD, bind, bind, chase, whack, whack...<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp.<br>

<br>
A little correction. Should be &quot;The first training point spent on a skill gained after level 1 gives you a skill level of the experience level you gain access to that skill.&quot; Which means: even if you wait 'til level 20 and then put your first skill point in FD you still only get a skill of 17.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
This meant I could run and still use it as long as I was willing to forgo the use of the autorun feature. Feigning and standing back up breaks the autorun and you would have to re-start it after each feign. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There is a way to still use auto-run with this. There are two ways to activate auto-run. One is the common known (num-lock). Second way: while keeping your forward button pressed press enter to open the chat line. Now release the forward button and you'll still be running forward, even after pressing return again to close the chat line. When using this way to auto-run you'll still move forward after getting up after a FD. To stop running just press the forward key once.<br>
<br>
Another thing to note: you don't need to get up between subsequent FDs to raise your skill, this saves your surroundings the death scream every 10 second.<br>

<br>
Monk Evade Key:<br>
<br>
/attack off<br>
/doability X (FD)<br>
/con<br>
/Sit off<br>
/attack on<br>
<br>
<br>
So Turns attack off, flops you, Cons the mob (not really needed) stands you up and turns on attack, This all happens in about 1 second if not less.<br>
<br>
I have used this a great many time where I am not meant to be the *Tank.* I am level 60 and use this everywhere.<br>
<br>
Pulling HoT grab a mob bring it back to your MA for tagging as soon as you see a spell/arrow hit the target and are sure the none of them round the corner sitting casters are going to be agroed hit evade.. wala! MA is now agro. Long fights find that your epic taunts to much and get you smacked a few times... Hit the evade key every 15-20 seconds and you will never have agro again.<br>
<br>
Works wonders, I think this is the best hotkey ever for a monk.<br>

I am in my 20th season and I find FD to be the greatest skill.  I am now able to go almost anywhere without fear.  I have tried FD with attack on and off and have found that there is no diff.  <br>
<br>
I only put 1 skill point into FD when I got it and I maxed it out just FDing no matter where I was.  Now I can go solo all sorts of things and have a blast doing it.  I do not think I will ever tire of seeing those creatures stare at me in awe as I lay there dead.  Love watching them walk back to their spawn point.  As a new monk I do find that comments about pulling etc are helpful but playing with lower level creatures is where the real learning starts.  Go to EC or NRO and fight dervs or orc's and practice pulling and FD and you will learn to be a master in no time.  <br>
<br>
One last thing of note, Let the members of your group know that you can FD.  I have had more clerics etc. try to heal me when I drop it is not funny.  Not funny to me at all considering now I am being attacked again.  Also, I have found that I am a great puller if I have SOW.  Pull, Run like the wind back to the party (Using the F9 different views to make sure you did not pull too much, people hate that! ;-)) at this point FD and hope it suceeds, the tank will start taking the hits and you jump back up and start doing that monk thing.<br>

General Practice (Not during a fight)<br>
/pause 90,/doability FD<br>
/pause 90,/doability FD<br>
/pause 90,/doability FD<br>
/pause 90,/doability FD<br>

/attack off<br>
/doability FD<br>
/stand<br>
/doability Sneak (May as well work on it too)<br>
/attack on<br>

The fighting one takes about 1 attack away from your fight, so it's not an issue with losing dmg output.<br>
<br>
Likewise for Instill Doubt which seems to simply crawl up in skill slow enough to drive me batty.. Target some player or some mob that isn't likely to disappear and then get out of range of it..<br>
<br>

<br>
Outdoor dungeon so you can get sow if you have a friend/group and zone is close by and easy to get to if you get in too much trouble.<br>
<br>
Most (meaning all really hehe) mobs are melee types (shadow types proc a lifetap but it has 0 cast time so should almost never interrupt a feign attempt) so you don't have to deal with a lot of casters ruining a split attempt with a delayed casting spell.<br>
<br>
You can also learn to use the environment (walls/corners etc) in this place to good effect when splitting. Pathing is a little funny at 1st, but once you get used to it you can quite often pull a small train and split them safely at the zone side of the bridge where the 1st mobs pop. Have your group waiting near the zone itself, and when you have only 1 or 2 move around the corner to your group. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As you get higher in levels push in further to some of the other camp spots. I feel it is a good warm up dungeon to get some practice in before hitting KC, (damn that place hehe) Seb and other similar zones. <p><br>

The space bar is a nice big button to hit that will toggle off your attack as your hand moves to your hotkey or the mouse moves to pop the button.<br>

I think I really honed my skills in Dalnir's Crypt though. A good mix of melee and caster types. Died to a number of mages before I finally felt confident pulling the corner with 2 or more. Sometimes it takes a bit of luck, but the more you practice.... <br>

<br>
I agree about dalnir being a very good place to hone pulling abilities, before journeying to The Crypt of Dalnir I never really needed to use FD.  I would use it ocassionaly in the sarnak fort and goblin mines, but only when I picked up adds, not for splitting, as low lvl groups generaly can handle 2 mobs. When you arrive in Dalnir, you're in for a rude awakening if you have never feign pulled before. The casters will eat you alive if you pop FD just after you agro them as I tried. you have to anticipate how many spells are hitting you, and wait for effects (DoT landing, Nuke, slow, snare etc..) from each spell before feigning, this may require you to stand idle for a few sec while taking mele damage. This particular zone is taxing because there may be mobs casting on floors above/below you, so you basicaly ahve to guess at the number of mobs you agroed, and which are casting. This is the beginning of the many Educated Guessses you will encounter as a monk. Educated because you muct know what mobs you agroed and what class they are (each race/gender/size/name NPC in zone is a specific class in dalnir) and agro radius. <br>
<br>
Another feature not mentioned yet is chain pulling.This is used after lvl 35 when mobs remember you untill they return to spawn points. This is done by having a monk or shadowknight pulling a group of mobs to a set point, where another monk/shadowknight is feigned or a rogue is hidden. the monk feigns off the mobs. The other monk/sk or rogue pops up when one (or two, depending on how many group wants) mob is left. This can also be acomplished by having a caster or archer hit the remaining mob when signaled by the monk on the first leg, but it is more dangerous for a non-feigner to do second leg since if they go early they cannot lose agro from the ensuing train.<br>
The traditional chain pulling methods are thrown out in Velious (and Luclin?) since mobs all return at once to their spawn points/paths, making chain pulling impossible. Usually, my groups will have a SK/necro (dangerous for necro...) snare one mob and wait for all (including snared mob, who will trail behind the others) to get to them, where the second leg of the chain is waiting and feign. Necro will need to burn HS for this. When the mobs go back to spawn points, snared mob will be left behind somewhat, if you pulled it far enough from the bind point, it will be easily single pulled. This is hampered by unsnareable mobs and resists though, and is time-comsuming most times.<br>
<br>
There is probably more to pulling I don't know yet, as I managed to get through nearly 54 levels without knowing I could put skills in macros.... thanks for the input on that. I'm not going to venture into calling this a comprehensive guide, but it is a start for young pullers looking to earn their keep. this, along with the information above, should take you up to 50's imho. <p>Greetings!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uxaylintunare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XaylinTunare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(12/31/01 1:07:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=668.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A start on the Feign Death guide we need.</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;Sometimes when you FD and stand right back up you cant move, the fix is to sit and then stand again.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
This only happens in first person, Better to fix this by hitting f9 and going to a third person view, so you don't have to sit down.<br>
<br>
... We all know what happens when you sit down pulling say.. the protectors of zek and they warp on you<br>

<br>
I started my feign pulling at the bandit camp in EK at level 18. I was promptly killed by the named bandit who happened to be a caster however after my multiple failed feigns, so decided that was probably not the best place to try.<br>
<br>
After I had 100+ skill (and was level 20) and my first real splitting came at 3 bird at the Aviaks in Lake Rathe. Aggro the three, then run down the slope feigning half way down, and eventually after 2 had returned, I would take the remaining one. I would then kill them one by one, and eventually kill them all.  <p><p align="center"><img src=http://kibadachi.homestead.com/files/sig53.gif></p>
