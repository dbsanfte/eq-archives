<blockquote><br>
I like griefers. Anything to spice up the normal day to day grind of DAOC. This game needs a bit more excitement.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
So I assume you're going to be playing on the PvP server? Good for you--be sure to write. For the rest of us, we're not looking for any exploiters to add "excitement" to the game.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
If the developers/coders present a product that still seems to be in a "beta" mode, don't we have the right to try anything we find?<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
You don't have that right. Re-read your end user license again, it will point you to the Rules of Conduct, which you agree to abide by every time you play the game:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
PLAYER MAY NOT USE THE DAoC SERVICES TO: <br>
<br>
12. Abuse or exploit bugs, undocumented features, design errors or problems in the game collectively referred to as Problems. Player acknowledges and agrees to report all problems, errors or bugs in the game to Mythic as soon as they are found as their continued use can damage the enjoyment of the game for all its players.  Mythic will do everything within their power to fix these types of issues in a timely manner, and will give all customers the benefit of the doubt when dealing with these problems.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
Read that one more time... Mythic will give you the benefit of the doubt. You should be glad, in EQ they just ban you even if it was an accident.<br>
<br>
You don't have the rights to "try anything we find". You have one important right:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>
13. Termination<br>
<br>
* Either you or Mythic may terminate your Account, for any reason, without further obligation to the other.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<br>
You wanna talk the talk? Walk the walk and hit the cancel account button if you want Mythic to know how unhappy you are with the "'beta' mode" the game is in. Even Sanya agrees that the only way to get the big-wigs attention. Me, Mythic gets my money... cheaper than a night out dancing and I can kill the guys that pester me.<br>

<br>
If you fall through a hole, even by accident, then you have done the same and are a &quot;cheater&quot;. What do you do about it?<br>
<br>
Lots of people have reported these holes and Mythic have not repaired them. This means that you can fall through by &quot;by acciddent&quot; still.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is an exploit, but it is there for 2 reasons.<br>
<br>
1. BAD CODING<br>
2. LOW FIX PRIORITY<br>
<br>
If it is a low fix priority, then the bug/exploit is considered minor. BUT remember, some bugs end up as intentional code, so lets presume that its not been fixed because Mythic will make it intentional.<br>

<br>
Unlike your ill-formed, and unsubstaniated opinions, I provided evidence to support my claim that you do not have the right "to try anything" just because there is a bug you can exploit.<br>
<br>
You can try to justify away your cheating anyway you want... whatever gets you through the night, princess... the fact is sneaking into an enemy realm through a hole in the wall is an exploit.<br>
<br>
It's ashame that so many find being a cheater to be amusing, macho, or cool--or worse that anyone would defend the actions of a cheater.<br>

While 'I have a right to do what I like with this game I bought' is fine with single player, it does NOT apply to multiplayer games. There, you have a right to play within the rules so that other people can have a good time too, and you do not have a right to spoil things for them!<br>
<br>
If someone perfed me off a horse after a long trip with no other stable nearby I'd be swering, espicially if people were waiting for me. Not to mention that there is a known bug with being killed on a horse (you respawn to the horse, and you still can't move fight or cast spells just as if you were still mounted.) Just be a bit careful okay? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=javelin>Javelin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 5:07:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3499.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Spelling...</span><hr size=1> Quote :<br>

My trip to mini-golf l</span><hr size=1> Ok, let me get this straight.<br>
<br>
Someone who is too intept to defeat their enemies on the field of battle take the rout of exploiting a bug in the game so that they can gank people of their true abilities (read as level 5 casters).<br>
<br>
Then, lets say the person came here and bragged about how 1337 it was.<br>
<br>
I suppose that in this very unlikely scenario, I would have to claim them to be almost as cool as pee wee when he got caught wacking it in those private theaters. <br>
<br>
I mean really, it was just harmless fun, why should he be in trouble for simply doing something that while he was not 'allowed' to, he was still quite capable of.<br>
<br>
People who exploit bugs and then try to make it sound like it was totally ok make me laugh.<br>
<br>
On to a totally seperate issue..<br>
<br>
Meepo, you are dead wrong. Because while it was 'fun' for you, being the person who was breaking the rules, it was not fun for those who fell victim to you, abiding by the rules. This is something akin to robbing your neighbors, then saying 'aww, I was just having fun!!' when the police haul you in. <br>
<br>
I must say that you, sir, are a genius.<br>
