Grouped outside Paw last night with a ranger, cleric, druid and rogue (me).  The ranger pulls 3 gnolls at once.  ( runner was passing by and decided to join in the fun).  Ranger zones into paw.  We're all taking a pretty good beating.  Sddenly there is a second druid in group.  I'm down to 2 bubbles of health.  &quot;Run for the zone&quot;.  I reply, &quot;no sow&quot;.  Everyone was really low health at that point so I didn't feel comfortable trying to evade.  I'm running for the zone with 2 gnolls on my tail.  Under a bubble now and knowing I'm not going to make it, I whisper up a prayer to Tunare.  Then I see it.  That beautiful blue light.  One of the druid hit me with sow at last possible moment.  I zip into the tunnel and thru the zone.  Didn't even check to see how many hit points I had left when I got through.  Just started bandaging and of course, thanking that druid profusely.<br>

<br>
I was fighting in HH Pass last night with a small group.  We were the only group fighting Orcs so no competition.  Well, no competition means things can get a little out of hand every once in awhile.  We take down half a train and see 3 more orcs joining the fight, so I call for everyone to zone.<br>
<br>
I land one more backstab to get a mercenary off our cleric and head for the zone.  I see my health dropping steadily and it's nearly gone when I get to the zone.  Unfortunately I took one more hit and got knocked unconscious... Fortunately I fell into the zone.  After what seemed like an eternity I finished zoning to the welcome message of:<br>
<br>
&quot;Player is beneath world, moving to a safe location&quot;.  Safe location is subjective, I guess, but I landed about a 30 second run from the zone to Rivervale.  In Kithcor.  At night.  So I have 11 hitpoints, and all my buffs somehow disappeared even though I didn't die.  I make it to the rivervale zone and start bandaging myself...<br>
<br>
So my closest?  Knocked unconscious, fell into zone, woke up with a few hitpoints left in a high level undead-controlled zone (:<br>

Many of you might have heard something about me, the crazy Darkie who decided to get a Burning Rapier before he gets a last name.  The quest ineveitably brings me to Blackborrow.  And ineveitably I learn to hate the brewers, but being there does allow me to make plenty of jokes about the bad smell coming from the Barbarians.  Anyway, sitting there and waiting for a brewer to show up is boring, so I run into the commander room and kill him every few minutes, and then run up to the ledge above it and kill all the gnolls there.  One time after a particularly brutal fight with the commander I ran into three Elite Guardsmen up on the ridge.  No chance to back down so I fight.  One goes down, I am severly wounded.  Another falls and the thrid pounds me hard.  Then out of no where his eyes go wide as a blue aura surrounds me and heals all my wounds.  This one is not very brave and runs near the end of the fight and I promptly kill him in one swipe.  Out of nowhere I am hit in the back of the head.  Somehow another Elite made it up there and he hit me hard.  Down he goes and yet another arrives.  I am hurting and almost dead, victory in the vile things eyes when yet again a blue aura surrounds me.  I don't even give this one a chance to run.  I turn around to find my benefactor and I see a... WOLF!  I bow low to him, wondering why he would help my dark kind out and he speaks the words, &quot;Houma, I have heard of your goodness and this valient quest you are on.  I have helped but a little and only a little more can I do. Here.&quot; and I feel much much faster.  After riffleing through the fur of the unfortunates I through them into the water, keeping one of their skins.  I run down for my rendevous with the Brewer and he has the tenacity to jump on me!  Promptly he is killed, and alas, still no cask.<br>
<br>
Later that evening I was awaiting the arrival of the Master Brewer, having sent all of his underlings to the Abyss, when I hear a someones voice yelling &quot;TRAIN!&quot;  Knowing that they mean that a whole bunch of the ugly things were following them outside I promptly get into a corner and hide.  Watching them go past I wait for the gnoll commander and pick him out.  Low and behold another commander attacks me at the same time.  I slay both and sit down to rest.  I am feeling good about myself when an elite walks by and myself never passing up an opportunity I jump out of the shadows and place a nice hole in his backside.  Little did I know that this was the lead of the &quot;train&quot; that upon having lost both their commanders had decided to return to their posts.  Two of his companions joined him and the rest of the vile gnolls decided to cheer their comrades on.  I dropped the one and ran.  Near the entrance, never being one to back down from a fight I turn and dispatch andother Elite.  As the last one comes in, the smaller prey had fled away from me.  Praying to  Bristlebane to guide me in the hereafter I stab one last time and do a backflip.  Being the smart one I am I heard the gnoll fall but also I heard my own body hit the ground snf move half an inch backwards.  Then from the gods these words appear in my mind &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.&quot;  I have often noticed this in passing between territories and had just happened to be in the right place at the right time I guess.<br>
<br>
OOC: Both true though the druid had played another character I had helped out, he didn't say all that.  It was late at night when only about fifteen people were actually there.  And no... I still have not gotten my cask yet... stupid spawn rates.<br>

I have had several. One of my most notable was soloing Kizdean Gix, at 27 yesterday. I conned him and it said that he might pose a problem. So I snuck up behind him and backstabbed him and started meleeing. As the fight went on he got off 2 or 3 fears on me. I only feared him once. Long fight. It was real close right from the beginning. I mean it was exact amount of hitpoints graphically. I get down to a bubble, he is too, I start yelling for help. No help, thought about running, then threw that thought out and just kept fighting him. I had my SBD main hand and my new BR I just got two days ago (yay!) offhand. Finally my SBD proc sticked. He resisted two times earlier. Swapped my BR main hand. Melee'd him some more. I'm down to a quarter bubble. Double attacked, dual wielded him for about 40 damage total, got him down to a sliver of life. WHAM! He doubled on me, just knocked me unconscious. Darn! I thought. Started to cast a spell, I resisted his fear. I was going, what the heck? Fearing me while I'm unconscious? Haha! Bash! Ow, that hurt. Bashed me for 1. The killing blow... Kizdean Gix dies. Woohoo! I won... uh oh... is that a bear I hear? Please get up get up. You regain consciousness! You have hidden yourself from view. I turn around, a young kodiak was right behind me, right in aggro range if I wasn't hidden that is. Walks on by while I bandage myself.<br>
<br>
Another was in MM, some guy was fighting an enchanter in the tower thing I believe. I saw a 21 rogue backstab the guy while he was fighting. I was thinking, dueling at that place? Huh? Something or other begins to cast a spell. You are stunned! I was sitting down hidden waiting for full hp to take out an initiate. I was at 4 bubbles, get hit down to 2 bubbles in a few seconds, I'm charmed! I'm running around chasing some guy trying to stab him. Finally he zones, and I'm near the tunnel heading to the graveyard. I was thinking, okay once this charm breaks I've gotta be ready. Wait for a long while, charm breaks, I'm spinning in circles, get hit down to half a bubble while I am, speed strafe the heck to zone. I take the shortcut over the hill, I'm just barely running. 5 feet from zone, hit by more mobs, down to a sliver of health, zone.... into the middle of Lfay.<br>
<br>
Then later, I was fully buffed with symbols, bravery, and holy armor. A cleric, mage, and I were the only ones in zone. There was only one way to break a spawn (because of the darn pathing grr) So I pull a pledge, along with a garg, a caster, and an initiate joined in a repop. Big battle ensues. Bring down the caster real quick. Couldn't get off one spell.... ow darn damage shields. Garg goes down... then the pledge is next... cleric is OOM, I'm down to a bubble and a half. I tell the others to zone, and then I follow, get hit down to a sliver of health, zone. Into LFay at the MM entrance, only this time with no buffs.<br>
<br>
One lesson I learned, zoning when near death or dead is a very interesting experience and good for laughs a lot of the time.<br>

I go underwater, and of course it is dark. Not only that, but as soon as I am in the tunnel (with no way to surface) I am attacked by two swimming Tormented Deads. Freaked, I go further into the tunnel. I have about a bubble of air left when I realize I am going the wrong way, I frantically swim back, wondering if I am even going the right way, or when I will be able to breathe. All the while I am being attacked. I finally found the surface with only a sliver of air, and a bubble of health left, and I had been holding my breath (in RL, I was so nervous) that I nearly passed out before I surfaced in the game.

I was playing my girlfriends Barb Warrior the other night... she's level 12. I'm fighting in Blackburrow... and the only things I really fear are commanders and high elites. <br>
Random lowbie shouts &quot;TRAIN to zone!&quot;<br>
I'm near the bridge so I decide to stick around before beating a retreat. I see the aforementioned &quot;person of lower levels&quot; running from a group of like... a gnoll guardsmen and a coupla regular gnolls.<br>
&quot;Dang newbies,&quot; I scoff to myself, &quot;Thats not a REAL train.&quot;<br>
Wade into battle with my Shiny Brass Halberd swinging... then notice that the REAL train is the 2 elites, commander, and 3 guardsmen following a bit behind. I yelp somewhat loudly and quite unlike a warrior.<br>
I bellow my usual &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE... MOVE IT OR LOSE IT!!!&quot; a few times to warn everyone and then start my ascent to zone. I get out the top door... and get stunned BAD... 40hp to go... make it close to zone... 10hp... get stunned. *SMACK*<br>
Fall unconscious.<br>
Regain consciousness... and make it to zone... with ONE hitpoint. Meanwhile I'm praying to the Tribunal that I don't get smacked hard while zoning.<br>
Make it to the other side... fall unconscious... again.<br>
Pop up... and sit down. Chuckling to myself about &quot;Who's the newbie again?&quot;<br>

After a tough battle (kept losin sight of him) i won with about 1.5 bubs left..then i realized my air was out!! I swam straight to the surface Asap getting nailed for lack of air..i surfaced JUST as i ran out of HP and was knocked unconcious..but before i did i filled my lungs with air.  So i sank down quite unconcious, until i regained it..i swam up as fast as i could (having low sta because of the DEF=low sta thing) and jumped onto the rock..it was the most exhilerating moment in EQ yet!  and by the time i was regained my HP the item that i originally went to look for was gone..anyone know what shark bones are for? =)<br>

<br>
I was in Guk and no group. got bored went up to Upper with a friend my mine(me a 42 rogue him a 40 monk).  We think. Gee, we pretty strong and we kick arse, lets go camp GhoulBane. BAD IDEA.  No healer, just a monk and a rogue.  We fight our way to Barracks and clear front spawns.  Then we make a run for Lord area, taking all the center spawns with us.  We get there, and 6 more agro on us, plus the Skin Lord.  We think, ok, we cool, we can handel this.  After a short time, we kill the 3 shammies, then turn to Lord, get him down to 1/10 of HP, then DoH, Lay Hands, crap, back to full. Monk apolgizes then FD's. I haul major arse to zone.  Get past warder room with only a few agros, get to realist area, get turned around, been jumping so i had a little lead, but lost it here get hit, go to about 1 bub.  Turn around haul some more arse.  Get to scyer, guess what? scyer up, and he agros on me, starts trying to nuke me(resisted everyone though), and i get a drowsy(so much for every spell) from some nearby shammy.  Get to water, start swimming, got stuff beating on me all the way, finally, get to the top area, near zone, then <br>
A Shin Lord slashes YOU for 63<br>
A Shin Lord Slashes YOU for 48<br>
A Shin Knight Bashes YOU for 15<br>
YOU are stunned.<br>
crap.  a few seconds of stunned, then im off again at a crawl, probably could have sneaked faster than what I was going. 2 dodges, and a parry in a row then i zone.  Get to Inny, i have about 95 hp left.  <br>
<br>
When i zone I nearly went through the roof, biggest adrenaline rush i have ever gotten while playing EQ. The monk by this time had mended and made it somewhere safe and a guildmate ranger of mine had zoned in and taken out Lord. I was applying arse to ground in Inny.<br>

<br>
Pulling FM Giants at the fort with 3 other Guild mates, no healer no heavy tank. Doing ok with singles, till a second mob comes from nowhere, we start to lost it big time, and we all make a UN-SoW'd dash for FV zone.<br>
<br>
I'm about 3 steps into the lead, Ranger falls, keep running, other Rogue falls, keep running, Enchanter falls feet dont fail me now cause they are both after me now!!! I get far enough ahead that I no longer here them behind me, make it up the ramp to FV zone and run SMACK into a 3rd Giant on his way back from zone. WTF?!!! No where to go but straight between his legs, wham, run, wham, walk, wham, crawl, must, get , to, zone,,, wham, dead. LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br>
<br>
Show up in FV, run 2 zones back to FM, zone in and I am STANDING ON MY DAMN CORPSE!!!! Arrrghhhhh!<br>
<br>
The Ranger who died with me, also ran back to FM with me and commented &quot;Boy, don't that suck?&quot;<br>
<br>
I ran half way across a zone with 2 yellow pissed off Giants on my arse, and DIED ON the zone line... And lose 30 to boot!<br>
<br>
Btw: I got 30 back and change last night.. <p><body lang=EN-US style='tab-interval:.5in'>

Hm...I've had many close calls, but I think my deaths are actually more interesting.  For example, did you know that you can be killed in the split second between seeing LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... after zoning and your character actually dissapearing from the zone?  Figured that out with a daring charge at level 3 through the orc spawns in Highpass...and the time I was level 21 and was killed by (get this) a goblin scout.  Fighting in Everfrost out in the tundra, barely kill a shaman and I try to limp back to the Wall while poisoned.  I fall unconscious, and the poison wears off while I am about halfway down the bar (phew...) I limp again to the wall and have a seat, little knowing a scout is coming over the hill, and it charges me and gets in a hit for 8, knocking me unconsious again...what seems like half an hour later, it got a lucky hit for 3 that sent me to my bind spot *sigh*.  (true story, even though it sounds like a 1 in a million chance <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Ok on my ranger me and my friend who was also a ranger were in the northern desert of ro and both had no food or drink so we decided to head to freeport. <br>
<br>
We were completely out of stamina and a mummy attacked us! We ran like hell to the platform and people started killing it. However, it hits me and I topple to the floor unconcious, the mummy dies leaving my friend almost at death when a jackal bites him in the back and he also falls unconcious but luckilly the people at the plat kill it. Well, here we both are lying diseased and with no stamina. Hah it was great we sat there for like 5 mins waiting for a heal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
K the other one I was playing my enchanter with my friends necro and we were killing the bandits in Greater Faydark.<br>
Well one of them gets my enchanter low in health and stabs him in the gut, my friends pet destroys the bandit. Well I'm thinking &quot;No biggie, I'll just get up in a bit&quot; well I start sliding through the forest from when I was hit and when I wake up I'm at the PoD lift.

I am not a travelling rogue, but at my 12'th season I was getting a little sick of MT, I only found ur occasional blue spider or scarab ect. Needed group to hunt in orc camp, and gobbie  shams, which con BTM, spawn about once every 1,000,000,000,000 days. So I decided to go to a place I had been only a few times, most to meet a friend, almost never to hunt.                                                       heck I'll try to go there, get a group, or if noones there, I'll kill minor gobbies. Well, I was in luck, cause my levle 12 druid friend ( who I should mention has a very bad computer)( Takes him 5 *^%$in mins to zone!)is in the zone. we group, and share hunting with a half elf Druid 1 season our supieor. My friend went out to pull, while at the same time the Other Druid ( who I had made friends with sorta) went out to pull to. My friend comes back to ( I am in gorge for those who don't know) us with a muddite minor on his tail. not a problem normally. except that he had 3 mud elders on his tail, and we fought galiantly, thinking our friend would save us. Well, our friend came back, but with 3 other gobbies that conned Yellow to us, and soon more joined. I had a bub of hp, and was blinded. I circled around, hoping that might be enough to dodge some attacks. I regained my visionform a sec, but was blinded again and rushed the direction I had seen for a sec. it was the zone. I dived, and my computer seemed to freeze. I thanked Bristlebane, and sat, in about a minute I regaINED my vision and saw that I ahd about 12 hp, no granted, I was healing for a minute, so I figure when I ozned I ahd 2hp at max. When I was partially regained my strength, I zoned back into the gorge, only to find my friends ( 13 druid) corpse, with a dozen gobbie corpses around him, along with a lot of muddites. My friend was nowhere to be found. I could only gues he had paniked and ran into the depths of The gorge. killed somewhere along the way. I thanked the gods and camped. The next day I found out that my friend had gone LD! and the monsters had been drawn to the 13 druid, i think that is pretty good myself. <p>Dren, Level 12 Halfling rogue
