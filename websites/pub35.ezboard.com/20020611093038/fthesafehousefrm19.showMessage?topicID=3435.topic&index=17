<br>
How many times do I have to say it, before people like you listen? it isnt my fault for not having high envenom, you silly peep you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lets say enervating poison does hurt me that bad, which I dont think it does, what does that say?<br>
<br>
that says, that an infiltrator has enough points to have envenom, + CS, + weapon spec, + DW spec, + stealth, all high.<br>
<br>
SB's dont have that choice. How man friggin times are you and others going to say it is my fault for not having envenom? Lets say I drop my whopping 34 CS and put it in envenom, great, then what? He perfs for 500-900(according to other SB's, never been perfed by him, although have been perfed by a thrust infiltrator Nihmlan for 732) I would not have that option then.<br>
<br>
<br>
Close to damage? This log isnt close, he kicked my ass. Granted, I screwed up, he was dancing around and stuff, I wasnt ready, but hits are hits, and his are much, much better then mine. His OFF hand base can hit harder then both my weapons combined(base).<br>
<br>
<br>
he hits like that all the damn time too.<br>
<br>
<br>
So basically, his weapons, should not hit any harder then mine. Damage cap is 16.2 correct? Also, his main weapon is faster then mine, so less style damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as fully buffed to the teeth, I add 100 or over to all my stats with shaman buffs, I am buffed to the hilt as well.<br>
<br>
Basically, I am sub par in styled melee, sub par in perf damage, sub par in unstyled hits, no envenom, and probably got little less stealth too(who cares though)<br>
<br>
<br>
It was this way ALL ALONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
It was this way ALL ALONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
It was this way ALL ALONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
It was this way ALL ALONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
It was this way ALL ALONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
It was this way ALL ALONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
get it yet? The reason people didnt think so, is because they simply did not spec their characters right. Then thrust people come to this board, cry because they lose to a slash SB, say they are overpowered.<br>
<br>
<br>
How can anyone look at that log and say they arent harder hitting then me? Eh?<br>
<br>
<br>
Fix LA, put it back to pre 1.50, or,<br>
<br>
give SB 2.5 spec points<br>
<br>
I have to choose what i do, and still do it 2nd best. infils do my job better, and can do other things I can't. if you can;t understand that, then you seriously have an intelligence problem. All the nutcases that flame me with dumb ass lines like<br>
<br>
&quot;Mill you crack me up&quot;<br>
<br>
Must be smoking crack, ten years old, or simply not the brightest light bulb in the pack.<br>
<br>
I challenge anyone, to show a high spec DW/slash infiltrator EVER getting outdamaged by a SB in general melee. 100 bucks says no one will ever post, because it will not happen.<br>
<br>
Message boards are fun, I am always amazed that a person can post a logical, reasonable statement and have people just ignore all reason and post weirdness. It is funny. It is, however, still a game, and if it gets not fun for me, I will simply quit, no problem. Mythic, does have a problem though, if you think i am alone being disgusted with a totally pro-Albion company, you are wrong. I, and people like me will leave, which will give the zerg less targets, Mythic less money. If it isnt fixed, you lose as well, it will just take longer.<br>
<br>
Woot,<br>

Mill the correct<br>

we didn`t go that way cause of the style damage  alot of us had infils in the 20`s and were wondering why we could just solo greens so pow reroll, us infils have gone thru the grinder alrdy yea it may be ur turn and that sucks, i do feel for ya. not once have i ever said nerf, cause &quot; what goes around comes around&quot;, stay away from the nerf, stay away from the nerf, the only time i flip you @#%$ mill is when you run down the nerf infil road, any time you wanna talk i`ll listen, nerfs blow palin and simple way to much lost effort in char`s when they get nerfed, i feel for sb`s, i liked knowing what classes to stay away from and sb`s WERE one of them. i started another thread on possible use of 2hs for pa shot`s . do me a favor look it over and tell me what ya think about when i`m doing with my sb i`d like to know if it will work later on, i know what works in the bg`s doesn`t always work in rvr so plz just post ideas and decent comments and i`ll always do the same<br>

<br>
I'm really interested in seeing the results of that.<br>
<br>
If logs show that Nightshades based on slash can destroy an SB in the same way inf's can with their added spec points... maybe... just MAYBE...<br>
<br>
People will jump on the &quot;sb's need love&quot; bandwagon.  Public opinion is key in mythic's world.  No matter the logs, calculations, proofs, discertations, bribes, sexual favors that are presented... people still don't believe that shadowblades are not the end-all-be-all of assassins.  Until public opinion is swayed by raw facts, logs and anecdotes.... Mythic is going to ignore the problems as they always do.<br>
<br>
<br>
In all,  fixes to shadowblades is a long time coming, I'm guessing... I appreciate your aid in this... Mythic tends to listen to you.... they aren't too fond of me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Pre 1.50 Infil = SB &gt;NS    HA HA HA HA HA HA  Come on Mills its was clearly SB&gt;Infil&gt;NS and everyone knows it .<br>
<br>
Post 1.50 i would say just maybe . its slash infil&gt;SB&gt;thrust infil&gt; NS  with the differents being pretty small between infil and SB <br>
<br>
hey mills what i would like to see for you is screen shots of the weopons you are using, if you are in epic armor,screen shots of your skill page to see really how you are speced . the problem i have with your logs are as follow. A) its always agaist the same assassin and she maybe the best assassin on your server because of gear B) logs don't tell the whole story , like end,gear , buffs, keep/relic bonus and what is going on the other players side<br>
<br>
I would also like to see you come up with what you think need to be done to make it so that it becomes  Infil=SB=NS . Like  Bile Silhouette all i see from you is bitching sorry to say . Very few people here that i have seen say that SB don't need love . Fact is i think they have lost their combat edge that makes SB what they are .But if you are calling for DF to back to its pre-1.50 level i'm sad to tell you i doubt highly that will ever happen . <br>
<br>
<br>
Bile Silhouette LOL i'm sure that if we could swing it sexual favors would help you case !!! <p>Moonglum DAoC

Prove it. Show me the facts. You know, facts ? Facts that you ask for below.<br>
<br>
Like this:<br>

So basically you ask for facts but you yourself are never *EVER* able to provide any facts or backup anything you say, *EVER*.<br>

penetration is almost always buffed, u have to deal with it. i know i can never beat him but in some really situationnal occasions, and i deal with that.<br>
<br>
i know ,i destroy infs when i m correctly buffed and they r not.<br>
it s more a matter of uber buffs than a matter of specific classes superiority despite infil still do more damages than NS, but i don t mind, i took Viper to keep it up a bit.<br>
i think double frost still do more damage than garrote tho, well it does more than my PA usually on assassins.<br>

I bet if a Nightshade can beat either of the other assassins, it will be a Nightshade who is heavy melee and envenom specced, has zip in Critical Strikes, and has at least dodger 3. But who knows, maybe a Bladeshade could dish out some decent PA damage versus leather armor.<br>

i m a multi purpose NS (48stealth 50CS 50env 42pierce)and , i have to find yet an unbuffed infilt to see lol but i guess it d be close on the poison damages and additionnal crits.<br>

a SB if he keeps his2h is kinda dead, on LA, i doubt i can kill him and i ll rely heavely on poison to help me out.<br>
i don t look for PA vs assassins, i shout and go in straight fights, at least i don t have to deal  with their PAs.<br>

Ya know I dunno what its like to be lvl 50. But I have to say this.. if a lvl 50 SB, and NS can kill like that then ya know what -- I gotta say assassins are overpowered. But I dont think SBs and NSs can kill like that. Maybe Im wrong, I dunno. <br>

As for the fact that Left axe SBs before the nerf of DF where better then the other assassins , Its a alittle to late for me post Screen shots and logs now . So i guess you are right i have no proof other then my exp as a player. But i think you know me better then just to make up stuff to prove my point. <br>

<br>
&lt;&lt;I haven't seen anything in the 3 logs that Mill has posted to suggest that Penetrator even HAS Crit Strike, let alone any investment in it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
penetration is a slash spec,cs spec infil. ive been hit by penetration on openings from 500-891&lt;was best&gt; i think. agreed,the lack of total data tends to bias the judgement to one side or the other.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;On the subject of Mill's spec, Envenom is highly complementary to both Left Axe and CritStrike. It adds value to either of them. CritStrike is not at all complementary to Left Axe because the odds are fairly good that you WON'T get off a PA in a given battle and at that point you also are not going to be using Garrotte over Doublefrost, so CritStrike effectively adds very little to a Left Axe SB's melee ability.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
this is my exact point,you cant get it all as a shadowblade,given the limitatiions,even when you do as a 5 spec,you will end up waering all +skill items,meaning you hvae less resist,less stats then others.<br>
<br>
mill was set up as a shadowzerker,without poison,he used pure melee to win fights,so mills final choice,is either get CS to 34,or get poison to 34. its not a both thing.sb's by nature of having less spec points,and how LA functions,tended to specalize more.<br>
<br>
i think its wrong to compare your &quot;theoretic template&quot; to what is actually used in the game. <br>
<br>
I DO AGREE that the data shown,is very small,but based on my personal experiences also,i do think infiltrators tend to be overpowered in relation after the nerfs. i think alot of this is due to the requirements shadowblades have,with less spec points to use,as well as the fact that most infiltrators tend to go thrust,and basically refuse to listen as to why they are weaker against slash spec sb's.<br>
<br>
with the left axe change,and mythics responses,i dont think its going to get changed in any form,if dw/cd then get improved,to help merc/bm,who need improvement,it will basically put shadowblades down on the level of shades,with infils a large step above. in a game where albion already rules as a realm,that is a bad thing imo.  all it will,do is end up making more people leave.<br>

theres no way id ever hit half my cap on a level 50 inf in epic armor.  thats simply a blatant lie.<br>
<br>
And beleive it or not, yes, classes should get 2 shot with critical hits, its the nature of a dice roll.  I am sure we can dig up logs of infiltrators 2 shotting thanes without a problem.  a crit is a crit, it happens. <p><a href="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=38056&raceid=10&classid=44">Dither Disgustipated</a><BR>
