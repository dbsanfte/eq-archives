<br>
   While I like the idea of having multiple use poisons, I wonder how they would do it.  The biggest concern is time/DOT based poisons.   Currently when I hit a mob with the Paralyze line, it may last as little as 2 seconds or as long as 90 seconds.  In the first case this wouldn't be a problem, in the second, it would be no better than we currently have.  Not to mention the impact on DOT's<br>
<br>
   If they make it subsequent uses, while it will improve the usefulness of poison, wouldn't be much better than what we currently have and would in some cases decrease the effectiveness of some poisons.  Basically in this case, I would hit the same mob with the same poison 3 to 4 times in the first 2 seconds, which if using a DD would be lethal, but no other poison would gain anything.<br>
<br>
   If they make it a proc, it may be more effective or fas less effective.   Currently, with a 135 dex, I proc my BR approximately 8 times for every 5 mobs.  Some mobs get hit multiple times, some get none, however, some get hit twice in a single round.  As listed above, this could prove lethal for DD, but would provide no other improvements for any other types of poisons.  Further because it's a proc, it is possible that the poison never fires thus reducing it's usefulness.<br>
<br>
   Personally, what I think would work best, though it would be unfair, would be to make the poison a right-clickable effect on the blade with say a 1 minute refresh rate.  The way this would work;<br>
   1.  Apply poison to blade.  This would set a number of charges, say 1/25th of my apply poison skill, for a range of 1 - 10 charges.<br>
   2.  Right-click my blade to activate it.  At this point, the next hit will deliver the poison with the next sucessful piercing attack as current.<br>
   3.  Fight, pull, take a smoke break, etc for 1 minute or so.<br>
   4.  Repeat steps 2 - 3 as needed up to the max number of charges.<br>
<br>
   Prolly won't happen, but this would work great.<br>

Or to build on Aaeorn's idea...<br>
<br>
Make each vial multi-charged.  Based on your Make skill (and if the poison is trivial) you can make a vial with a random number of charges.  Don't make the weapon right-click, just make us apply each time.  Would stop the multiple hit problems, wouldn't help in a solo fight but would help us get more usage out of those components.<br>
<br>

Poison needs to be much more simple, more high level mobs should drop the ingredients as well as low level ones at the same time.<br>
<br>
All we really need is stackable poisons and and a slighly easier way to get the farmed version of the poison indgreds(more mobs in different zones higher drop rates vendors randomly having small ammounts of usually non purchasable ingredients).<br>
<br>
Two hours in lava storm mounts  running around looking for balisks is about the most anoying thing I can think of .. all for 10 balisk eyestalks for 10 slow poisons that ware off in 2 seconds.<br>

I am not talking about stacking.  Believe me, I would love to get stacking, but I honestly don't believe we will ever get it as VI claims that there is no way for them to do what they did for the Shaman potions. /boggle<br>
<br>
   What I was referring to was the second quote about poisons being effective more than once.<br>
<br>
   Personally, while I am not happy about having to carry my components with me if I want to use poisons, but I am even less happy about the fact that my blade only contains enough poison for a single use.<br>
<br>
   As I have stated previously, I like to solo once in a while, which is when I use poisons the most, however, currently, unless I get real lucky, it is not possible for me to poison my second mob if I should accidently pull two.<br>
<br>
   Further when dealing with things like the paralyze line, which can last from half a second to 30 seconds (tier I), it would make poisons more than just an expensive toy, if there was a way to use the poison a second time without having to re-apply it.<br>
<br>
Jess,<br>
<br>
   I do agree with you that it would add more tedium, but not as much as I suspect we will get if VI does implement stacking.<br>
<br>
  As for the components.  Oh Hell Yeah.  pharming cistern asps for 8 hours and getting 16 asp poison sacs, NOTE this means individual sacs - not stacks, was extermely tedious.  It would be nice if they adjusted the drops rate on some of the other poison components to say that of the Kobolds in Sol B, or even the death beetles in Unrest.<br>

Apply was instant and didn't require sitting, so rogues could go through several in one fight, which Verant found to be too powerful.  (Of course, back then you couldn't buy vials, and none of the ingredients stacked or could be purchased, so it was a huge pain to do this.)<br>
<br>
Any scheme that allows multiple doses of poison in one fight will be *very* limited.  Believe me: if I can have two backpacks full of instant-DD rusty daggers, I will.  Likewise, if I can give a mana-drain poisoned dagger to everyone on a Vox raid, I will.  But I don't think either of those will happen.<br>
<br>
Storage is the biggest issue I have with poison right now.  Half of my bank space is devoted to poison - and that's after trimming it way down.  I'd love to have &quot;stackable&quot; poisons, even if it is just a charged item that summons a 1-dose poison bottle, which then needs to be applied.  Safehousers suggested this to Verant folk a few Fan Faires ago and received encouraging reactions, but we haven't seen it happen yet.<br>
<br>
The other thing on my wish list is greater discretion about when we use poison.  Essentially, right now, we can only poison at the beginning of a fight.  (Unless we temporarily stop using our piercers - but poison doesn't make up for what that costs us.)  I'd like to save that big DD for when the enchanter is getting beat on and I need a taunt, or have a Spirit of Sloth ready just in case the druid's SoW gets dispelled after failing 6 times to snare something nasty.<br>
<br>
I have fun with poison as it is now.  It's just not everything I'd like it to be. <p><B>Bayler Briggan Soulblade</B><BR>

I think right-click would be the easiest way to remedy that (though, yes, a little more cumbersome).<br>
---<br>
As far as limited use in combat (balance), how about this:  Rogue applies a Tier IV poison and gets 4 charges.  Apply a Tier I and get 1 charge.  Simple enough?<br>
---<br>
Bakaduin, while your point is valid, I don't think there be much of a real market for it.  All I can see, for regular application, would be on raids - to be done at the same time that you get your junk buffs to be dispelled, regular buffs, &quot;..and melees see the rogues for poisoning.&quot;<br>
---<br>
And, yes, I'd love to see *any* solution that let us carry stacks - including the 'summoning' vial.  If they can make Crystal Globes that summon water, they can make Poison Globes that summon out the same type of poisons that went into making the globe.  Shoot, how about the Poison Vendors (Toxfodder etc) gives you a box?  Poisons in, &lt;combine&gt;.  It either becomes the Globe or you hand it back to Toxfodder to get the Globe of Poison. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unikatjef.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nikatjef</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://DragonHeim.dsldesigns.com/Rogue.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/24/01 5:45:37 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://DragonHeim.dsldesigns.com/Rogue.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some Nuggets of Information on Poison from Fan Faire</span><hr size=1> Bayler,<br>

<br>
   This is exactly where my suggestion is focused at.  Hence the 1 minute refresh.  I understand that VI doesn't want us to have the abiliy to apply 5 different poisons on the mob, but with my suggestion, we would be able to apply the same poison, the one applied to our blade in step #1, up to 10 times if our apply skill is high enough and if the battle lasts 10+ minutes.<br>
<br>
   And yes, I agree that putting the poison directly on to the blade would be horribly unbalancing.   But again, under my suggestion, the poison would not be applied to the weapon per se, but to the first sucessful piercing attack as it is currently, after the blade is right-clicked.<br>

<br>
This is one of the reasons, I don't think VI will ever apply the poison to the actual blade.  Just think 40 people with rusty daggers, all coated with Soul Burn (Contact IV) on one blade and Mages Bane (Feeble Mind IV) on another all hitting Vox, Naggy, or Cazic-Thule in rapid succession.  Needless to say no mob short of the sleeper would have a chance, thus ruining the end game.  <br>

I think being able to poison a weapon and keep it stashed could be ok if there are restrictions .. like 2 weapons with poison on at once .. and they would only proc for rogues.. because can you imagine .. how  many more rogue twinks there would be, getting high enough to make and aply poisons on weapons for their mains? needs to be kept rogue unique.<br>
<br>
I dont see why rogue poison has a random time effect on it .. this just sucks .. no random time would be sweet.<br>

Well I'll restate my idea to make poisons have &quot;apparent charges&quot;.  Have poisons remain just like they are BUT when you apply the poison the vial has a chance of breaking or running dry.  This chance of &quot;losing&quot; the vial would be based on your apply skill (and maybe to some extent on dexterity).  If you successfully apply the poison the vial it remains exactly the same... a one-use poison that remains in in your &quot;cursor-hand&quot;.  But if you fail it is poofs from your hand and inventory forever.  Thus a rogue with 250 apply might have a good run and get, say, five applications before running out of poison or breaking the vial.  Of course, he/she could also fail right off the bat with a 250 skill but it would be a more rare occurence than say a rogue with a 50 apply skill.<br>
<br>
Seems simple enough to me.<br>

   Agree, which is also why in my post I made it a right-clickable effect added to the blade.  Again note that I specified a refresh time.  This means that you right click the blade, and cannot again do so for at least 1 minute per my proposal.  Also not that with this, rogues would have a bit more discretion as to when to use their poison.<br>

   Hehehe, Actually, if you remember, until they changed the paralyze line from root to snare, all poisons were fixed duration, or at least they appeared that way to me, however, now, I see snare lasting anywhere from 2 - 30 seconds for a tier I paralyze.  The only reason it really became random is because a mob gets a chance to throw off the snare portion every tick.<br>

   I like it for the most part as it would allow me to carry a greater variety of poisons, however, it does not improve the delivery of the poison, which is IMHO the real problem with poisons right now.<br>
<br>
   My biggest concern with poisons is simply that it is a true one time effect.  Yes, with your proposal I can apply the poison from a single vial multiple times, however, I cannot poison consecutive mobs unless I wanna play caster and &quot;med&quot; between every mob.  How often does your group get single pulls?  I find it a very rare occurance.  With my suggestion, I would now have the ability to poison multiple mobs.<br>
<br>
   I had a long discussion not too long ago with a couple players, one plays a cleric, one a Paladin, and the third plays a chanter.  The discussion started as war stories and somehow got around to poisons.  When I explained the problems with poisons, all three said that poisons being single use wasn't a problem and that poisons don't appear to be any more expensive than say the rune and symbol line.  While I couldn't disagree with the comment about rune, the symbol line provides no comparrison.  The symbol line is, yes a single use, however, it lasts more than 3 minutes and does, when all is said and done, a multiple mob effect.<br>

What if the weapon already has a right-click effect? I don't know if there are any weapons that currently do.<br>
<br>
How about if, instead of a right click, you had to click the button for the Apply Poison skill to make the poison take effect during a battle. You would still use the current method of right clicking the poison vial to apply it to your weapon, thus sitting for 7 seconds when you first apply the poison.<br>
<br>
Then based on your apply skill and the type of poison you would get 1 to perhaps 5 chances to use the poison in a battle with the Apply Poison button before you had to sit down and reapply the poison to the blade. You could give a chat message when the last charge of the poison wore off the blade, or maybe you wouldn't even necessarily know when your poison had worn off until you tried it and it failed.<br>
<br>
To prevent encounters from becoming trivial by spam-clicking the apply button to dump all your charges of a DD poison into a single mob all at once, they could grey out the Apply Poison button for 30 to 60 seconds.<br>

   Doable, however, I think you would find too many rogues against this method for one simple reason.  Not enough skill slots to keep apply poison in their list, or if they do, they lose immediate access to some of their skills.<br>

   In my original propsal I sugessted 60 seconds, however, reading this I came up with an alternate solution to this, though along the same lines.  What about if, instead, at level 20, the delay started at 60 seconds, and then was reduced by 1 second per level til 41, then reduced 1 second per level afterwards til you get to a 30 second delay at level 60.<br>
<br>
   I did a great deal of thinkin about Quip's idea this weekend, and as I stated previously, I like it, however, I think there should be some kind of constraint on it.  Say a limit of 20 &quot;apparent charges&quot; or even 10 &quot;apparent charges&quot; per vial.  It would improve the value of poisons, but would not make it possible to have a single vial last for 21, or more, encounters, which seems to me a bit excessive.<br>

<br>
However..<br>
<br>
I think it very realistic that our Apply time should be based on our Apply skill as opposed to always takin 10 seconds.. *points to a caster's memming time of spells based on Meditate skill*.<br>
<br>
Ok so my 'apply poison' is at 190 something... a 5th tier Mind Melt could very well take 10 seconds of sitting to apply (being very careful)  but a 1st tier spine break? I would think I'm good enough by now to just dump that on the blade while I fight. Maybe a 2 or 3 second pause in attack but no need to sit down etc.. or something along that line.<br>
<br>
It really bugs me at L60 with near 200 apply to have to spend the same time and effort (sitting for 10 seconds) to apply the most trivial poisons as a level 20 rogue with 25 skill in apply.<br>
<br>
