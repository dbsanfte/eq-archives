I'm not going to bother cross posting to all the class message boards or anything nutty like that, but I would like to see what you folks here on the Safehouse think about such things.  Please direct me to correct my post if I have violated an esoteric rule.<br>==<br> <br>This board is visited by a large number of traders, and many of you could be considered the main contacts for the purchase of items on Solusek Ro. I imagine that a huge number of trades are made here every day.<br><br>I wanted to start a thread asking for some opinions on what the correct thing to do is in certain situations... maybe there are some unwritten rules that not everyone is aware of. I think it would be a good thing to discuss.<br><br>I know the official rules. They are very simple. I'm asking what the real rules are; GMs do not enter in to this realm, only reputation and honor.<br><br>When I use the word &quot;agree&quot; in the examples below, I mean that both the buyer and the seller state that they're okay with the trade and &quot;let's do it&quot;. The equivalent of a handshake or both people saying &quot;deal!&quot; Nothing less, no wishywashy maybes. Further discussion could be brought to bear on situations in which someone /auctions lammy 3k and is immediately sent a tell saying &quot;ok&quot;. I think that's an agreement but I'm interested in hearing what you folks think.<br><br>I've seen all of the following things happen at one time or another.<br><br>What would you do if you had agreed to sell an expensive MQ, and botched it? Wrong NPC, not enough faction, clicked early or late, charm broke. It's a total wash--all items involved in the MQ and the reward are considered lost.  What would you do if you were the buyer of a failed (expensive) MQ? Does it matter who was at fault?<br><br>What would you do if you agreed to sell an item to another player at a certain price, but then found out that you had made a SERIOUS pricing error and you stand to lose a good percentage of the item's value by selling it? What if you were the buyer?<br><br>What would you do if you agreed to purchase an item at a set price, but then the seller simply stopped communicating with you? Would you find another seller immediately, would you just wait, would you keep trying to contact them? What if this happened but this time you're the seller and you have several people interested, yet the highest bidder seems to have put you on /ignore ?<br><br>What would you do if you agreed to purchase an item at a set price &quot;tomorrow&quot; and tomorrow you find that the seller has changed their mind, and will not sell to you? How about if you were the seller, and intended to make a trade the next day but that evening were instructed by your guild leader that you can't sell for whatever reason?<br><br>What would you do if you agreed to purchase an item at a set price, and before you made the trade found out that the item was stolen, and does not belong to them? What if you had already purchased the item, and it was a good deal?<br><br>Yeah, I know... &quot;well, it all depends&quot;. To hell with your adult diapers, I'm trying to reduce the number of if/then statements and see if you folks are in agreement on what to do in these situations.<br><br>Digriz the Everlost<br>Cirque D'Elite <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umakabrei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makabrei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/13/02 8:45:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22809.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trading Etiquite</span><hr size=1> 1) If i lay at fault, i would pay. If it was their fault, they would pay. If i am forking over mucho PP then they better gurantee me safe delivery of my goods. I'd also make these expectations very clear befor any money changed hands.<br><br>2) <br>B: My item, my choice. They can cry me a river, but if im selling a 20k item for 2k cause i didn't know its value... hehe i want my 18k sorry bub. In the case of say a 3k item i agreed to sell for 1k, while not knowing it was a 3k item... i'd probably just go through with it... im a nice guy. =)<br><br>A: I'd probably be bummed out, but i would certainly understand if they stood to loose several K over a botched price. I wouldn't raise hell and just let them make their choice and work from there.<br><br>3) If i am haggling with you, you can do me the service of paying attention. If something goes horribly wrong and you need to leave the comptuer all of a sudden all you gotta do is type /afk oh crap the cats on fire! and ill wait. Now, if you simply stop talkin to me, tough nuggets. No item for you. If you go LD. Ill add you to my friends list and catch you some other time. If you add me to your ignore, odds are i dont like you and i have been letting you know why.<br><br>4) Trades set for tommorow should be carried out, unless a better deal is found. I personally inform potential buyers that i will contact them the next IF i have not found a better offer. Thats the risk they take when they dont buy it immediatly.<br><br>5) You cant steal things in EQ. People that get things &quot;stolen&quot; usually did something incredibly stupid. Now, im not advocating any behavior of this sort... (odd for a rogue forum) but if you fall victim to a trickster i blame both you, for being stupid, and the trickster for a being a noobish little llama. I probably would be on the ignore list of a trickster cause i dont like people that try stuff on me.... so i doubt i would be buying anything from one. And if he sent a tell like &quot;Heheh dude, i stole this item from a guy by blah blah blah blah.&quot; I'd probably think, wow your the biggest idiot ever... you should be shot.. then have a hot thing put in unpleasent places. And then i would probably tell him that... then i would be on ignore.<br><br>If i had purchased the item... well. I'd be pissed but i'd keep it. Shouting &quot;hey i just bought this stolen item, and uh... if the real owner steps up they can have it&quot; Wont work. And the llama that got it in the first place probably wouldn't buy it back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unortherner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Northerner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/13/02 9:50:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22809.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/sjgardner/Images/celeris2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trading Etiquite</span><hr size=1> If you click Trade and I click Trade then the deal is done.  Until then, it's open season.  Now, if you back out of deals regularily then expect to be thought of as "someone who backs out of deals regularily".  If you want to turn around after trading and say "hey!  I thought is was worth 4k and now I hear it's worth 59k!" then too darn bad.  I'm pretty easy going and will likely offer a five minute refund period but no one is obligated to do so.  Inspect the item, look at the cash in the window and then it's caveat emptor.<br><br>MQs are an exception to this rule.  The person offering to MQ an item has to be very clear on what they are doing and willing to do.  If person X says "/auc KK robe for MQ!" then they are responsible for being of sufficient level and be willing to travel to WK for the trade in.  If they give the robe to an orc pawn by mistake, no cash for them.  If however, they follow instructions properly and you screw it up by handing in an Oracle, SMR and a Mana Robe then frankly, you still owe them for doing their part. <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Blackguard of The Nameless<br></font></b><font color=CYAN size=2><i>"The church is near but the road is icy; the bar is far away but I'll walk carefully." ~Russian Proverb</i> </font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utaluracwnzeylon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talura cwnZeylon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/14/02 4:25:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22809.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trading Etiquite</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What would you do if you had agreed to sell an expensive MQ, and botched it?

I'll give a buyer 5-ish minutes to get back then it goes to the next bidder.
