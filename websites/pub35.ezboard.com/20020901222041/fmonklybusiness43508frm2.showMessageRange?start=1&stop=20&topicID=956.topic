I’m going to try to get a guide going for those that are not the most uber of the uber or hiding a secret duo box alt behind them.<br><br>You will need bandages and don’t expect to get rich off gem drops that sell for 2783420pp each, there are none.  These are just good spots for xp and incidental cash.<br><br>Also, forget SolB.  I know it’s on every guide here but those bats are not blue to me at 52, I don’t care what anyone says.  LDC’s are just to tough at this level, and there are not enough bugs and just to many gimps in the zone to be worth a trip there.  My guide focuses on nice quiet places to kill blues.<br><br>I did everything straight up melee, mostly Acrylia/Spore armor with SCHW and an IFS.  No ID kite/joust/fd bind crap.

They have guards in them!  If you get the hang of splitting them, and stay away from the named guys, this is a nice place to solo.  There is one guard, Guard Dunn that is a pain in the ass to split, and you can’t solo him at 51 yet either.  All the guards drop up to 5 plat and lots of weapons.  When you need to sell, just sneak behind the vendor by the Gfay zone line.  There are more guard huts then I could do and the respawn is pretty fast. <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Neriak Commons</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>I hear this is good xp but I don’t know the level/equipment requirements to do it.

Avoid the Errolisi Bloodthorn until 48-50 or so, they don’t run at 20% health and hit sort of hard.  On the ledge near FoB by the ruins and by the Dragon you can kill all the Frenzied stuff you can get you hands on.  Easy kills at 45 and the apes can drop up to 5pp.  The Trakanasaur are also good to hunt there.  After about 48 that stuff greens out and you need to go to the front of CoM or the TT for pulls.  The Raging stuff is blue until 51 and some to 53. Trakaraptor’s and Bloodthorns are good hunting till 53.  <br> <br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>City of Mist</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>48-55 in different spots.<br><br>You can split and pull the 5 entrance mobs at 48.  They will all be blue and are not that tough, some of the golems might be a bit hairy if you don’t have mend up.  At 50 the zone in and the golems will be easy.  I moved to the stable area to the left.  It actually takes some skill to single pull some of these and is good practice for close quarter dungeon splitting.  When I was in the stables I pulled the left side first (there are 7 spawns there, but I left the Behemouth/PH up the ramp alone) then moved to the right stables (also 7 spawns).  I never got any loot here except Wrath Bone Warhammers.<br><br>At 51 I moved to the goo huts and pulled the 2-spawn goo and the middle house goo’s on the ledge.  Leave the middle goo alone, its to tough (up to lvl 49 it can be).  At 52 I can kill all 4 Goo’s then evem try and pull some of the Golems or other stuff in the back.  <br><br>I suspect you can split all the way down to the locked doors if your good enough up to lvl 55.  For loot I’ve got a few spells, a Wintry Club and a Wu Stick.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> The Dreadlands</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>45-53 and maybe 54 but I doubt it.<br><br>Up to level 50 you can solo any of the crap that walks around there before it greens out on you.  After 50 or 51 on the Ragers and a rare chicken/Brute will be blue.  Ragers are an easy kill and there is a 2 spawn at the entrance to KC.<br><br>Deeper in the Dreadlands is a Glacier Yeti cave with 4 spawns and 1 roamer.  These are easy to kill at 51 and mostly blue.  I suspect that at 52 they will start to lblue and at 53-54 they will all be lblue/greenies.  No real loot but its easy to do.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>***UPDATE***</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>DL has had some new mobs added to it.  Drovlarg Protectors and War Ragers are all blue to a 52.  The War Ragers are a bit harder then Ragers, but if you can get off one or two ID’s on them to limit the damage you take you will be fine.  There are also a bunch of new skellies around the building Velsor is found at.  Protectors of Sathir or something like that.  DL is becoming a nice place for solo xp.

At 45 I could kill this stuff with little down time.  At 50 almost anything is fair game to you except the man-o-wars and some of the meaner giants and orcs.  Rhino, Mammoths and Man-o-wars should take me 52-55 and maybe even a tad higher.  The walrus on the south shore vary in level more then the ones to the north.  Some will still hand you your ass at 45.  Watch out for the Kromif Death Squad.  You have 1 second to hit FD when you see the ‘You have been ambushed!’  Message before 6 48+ giants kill you in a few hits.<br><br>You need to zone to bank/vendor but its not to bad.

At 51, the Taskmaster is a CLOSE fight.  You may need to FD/bind wounds.  He regens slow though so its not to bad.  Do not ID him, you will get adds and he will despawn.  His drops are great pp vendor stuff, up to 58pp for the whip, 8pp for help and crystal.  Once you kill him you can kill the Iksar Slaves.  They are easy to kill and lblue out around 51-52.  For some reason, even as lblues they are good xp.  The only lblues I know worth killing in fact.  I suspect the Taskmaster will be blue until 56-57 or so, but the Slaves will be all greenies at 54.

The room before it spawns with various mobs that are about 50% green, 50% light blue.  It's a good area for nice, easy exp.  The slaves are especially nice since they run when low on health (and if you ID them in the right spot, they seem to pace back and forth quickly -- meaning you don't have to chase them all over the place).  An added bonus to this camp is that every 1 in 10 kills (or so) of the Taskmaster yields a NODROP shissar organ.  Get three of those and you have a free EB item.

Have never seen this zone mentioned as an XP source as it's miles from anywhere, but at 52 I am easily averaging at least a bub per hour with non-uber gear (SCHW, RotLC, Shackle of Tynn is about my best gear) and using GSC + fist.  At 51 it was even better, and you could probably try it at 50.<br><br>To get into the hidden valley, you need to take a long swim through an underwater tunnel.  With a swim skill of around 180 though, EB is NOT required.  Just make sure you have no twilight sea minnows biting you on the arse as you swim, and you'll make it fine.  Don't try the swim naked though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Once inside the valley, unless you have killed aliens regularly before, the area is very safe for a monk.  You'll be almost guaranteed to have the area to yourself.  This is mostly good, but can be annoying if you need a rez.<br><br>There are 3 tribes (grol baku, cral ligi and vas ren), and five types - workers, warders and guardians are straight melee, and shaman and spiritwards are shammy mobs.  At 52 only the guardians and spiritwards are blue, and the warders and shamen mostly light blue.  If you haven't killed aliens before, you'll start off indifferent to all of them.  They do NOT assist each other, but be sure to pull your mobs to a zone edge to avoid a wanderer healing the mob you are fighting.  I find that the casters hardly land anything on me with an MR around 40, making them the easier kills unless they manage to land a slow.  The 3 tribes also have their own attack - grol baku proc a 87 pt DD, cral ligi a spin-stun (just FD until it wears off) and vas ren a slow (not too bad as they dont land it very often).  Cash is not great, but OK - they can drop up to 7pp, rubbish weapons, and runes/words as loot, and the odd chunks of condensed ice that fletchers like for magic damage arrows.<br><br>There are static camps and wanderers throughout the area - if you are trying to spawn rares for Luclin armor parts, just kill the wanderers as they don't spawn at the camps.  The rares vary from light blue to dark blue, and hit for up to 100 (sometimes with additional procs).  If a rare cons dark blue, it's probably a good idea to have mend and/or stonestance up just in case.  If you kill a cral ligi healer and you're on Quellious, I'll happily buy the jar it drops off you!<br><br>The only other mobs are rhino beetles (green/lt blue) and underbulks (lt blue/dark blue).  These are KoS and are straight melee, not too tough.  All easy at 52, some of the higher underbulks might give a bit of trouble at 50.<br><br>You can buy bandages in zone at the shop just opposite the Katta zone-in, and the bank in Katta isn't that far away.  Easy XP with little risk - I'm sure a fungi wearing, t-staff weilding monk could tear through the XP at twice the rate I am.  You may well be able to come here earlier than 50 and just take workers/warders/shaman if not KoS, but you'll need to keep an eye out for underbulks.  They can be FDed off eventually, some are more persistent than others. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uuglukson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uglukson</A> at: 5/29/02 2:03:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uyanbun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yanbun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/23/02 4:44:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=956.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Twilight Sea Hidden Valley, 50-52</span><hr size=1> Bloodgills kick ass.

No faction hits, easy exp and they dont hit hard.  Bandaids not far away.<br><br>Respawn time is 16 mins which is plenty to mend and heal in between and have a mend ready for the fight.  Since they don't assist you can bind up between each one if they hurt you bad.

Even though it is crowded and full of the clueless, there is a reason for it, mindless exp. Easy zone out (just be sure to warn others when training into KC). Also there is no need to bother 2 boxing a Shammy to help, they are always around. Every shammy I've ever dued with in DL has come back to me later asking to partner again because of the exp. And since this is a solo guide, thi is the spot to do it. Kill anything that moves around KC, then run back up to KC to BW before killing again. Mindless, takes no skill, but easy exp. Though I highly recommend that you leave every so often to go dungeon hunting as you will need to practice your pulling skills for later grouping/raiding, and DL will not teach you how to do that.<br><br>&lt;center&gt;<br><a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/q3.htm" target="new"><img src="http://www.mutedfaith.com/images/demi.jpg" border=0></a>&lt;br&gt;<br><a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/q3.htm" target="new">Find your Role-PlayingStereotype</a> at <a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com" target="new">mutedfaith.com</a>.<br><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/labile">[Angel.]</a><br>&lt;/center&gt;<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 2364<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/23/02 11:51:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=956.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kibadachi.homestead.com/files/groohead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well .........</span><hr size=1> Grrr.....your intensions where good, but they need to be added to the relevant threads. <br><br>Otherwsie, as shown it just degenerates into more "The Golins in LOIO are good...." <br><br>We know they are good.
