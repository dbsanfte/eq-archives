I have since talked to atleast 4 others who have also experienced the problem. Here is what happens. Normally in RvR you PA a player you attempt PA, you hit if in right position, then you are revealed. Ever since the last big patch I have it 'skip' the 'hit' on occasion. It says I am attempting my PA, then a 'you are revealed' message then a normal hit. I get no 'your PA has failed' message, no you must be hidden to use this style message, nothing, just like I never did it other then I can see it say I am doing it and that I get revealed. <br>
<br>
I have used the herald forum, emailed 3dKnight, posted here an have yet to get any form of feedback on the problem other then more folks are saying they have had it happen to them. Tonight I log on and my first 3 PAs all had this happen to it, and then another later in the night. So I appealed it to see if it was atleast on the bug radar.<br>
<br>
I get the CSR after 6 hours, one that says he plays an assassin, and I start explaining the problem and after a few exchanges he starts to explain to me how when you are 'revealed' by a player you are not unstealthed, but they can see you, so you are in essense revealed. No news there, thats pretty common knowledge for anyone with 1 RP. He then goes on to explain to me that this is likely an error message problem, where the player is revealing me, thus not allowing my PA, and its not giving me the proper error messages. At this point I asked if he was saying that in the last patch they made it so that players now can 'reveal' you from stealth, thus ruining the chance to PA. He promptly said he would report it as a bug and said goodbye, and put me on ignore (or logged but the CSR online count never changed) all within about 1-2 mins. There was a definate change of pace in the conversation.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what to make of that. A CSR thats clueless regardless of the fact that he claimed he plays an assassin, or someone accidently saying to much?  I probably wouldnt have thought much about it a month ago, but now with all the stealth nerfs, the things being unintended etc, I dont have a lot of trust in Mythic. Love to hear from anyone also experiencing the problem, or if anyone has gotten any feedback at all.<br>
<br>

<br>
PS - anyone heard anything on the LOS problems, ie will they be fixed, with see hidden, you can see them but you cant shoot them with your xbow.<br>

No &quot;miss,evade,tumble&quot; message, but just a normal hit instead ... VERY annoying since the followup styles then don't work as well.<br>

I am also  anoyed by the fact that I seem to miss my PA lots of times even while standing DIRECTLY in front of my enemy.

Unstealth, normal hit, both poisons proc (major cripp thank god), I run like hell.  Scouts have this annoying ability to spec shields and get stuns in.    ;)<br>

?????  I think no big deal I'll try it again.<br>
<br>
I repeated the process 3 more times due to this guy not leaving the area.. <br>
<br>
Each time was the same result, Perfect position.. not even a freaking MISS?  It just revealed me and i hit him normally.<br>
<br>
I then appealed it as a bug and logged off disgusted.<br>

1) it`s bugged and will be fixed right after the pet bug is addressed<br>
2) it was made easier to do. due to the fact that all assassin classes were struggling and now we at Mythis feel this feature of the easy PA is no longer needed <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 8:07:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3463.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah</span><hr size=1> Hmm, there are some rather unfair tactics that can make it imposible to get PA to stick (I wont reveal them here - you never know who is reading :P).

I know I should've taken a screenshot of this, but I didn't think of it.<br>
<br>
I had never seen this before.<br>
<br>
I was recently rez'd and was moving up a hill when I got shot by an archer.<br>
<br>
I got a message that said:<br>
<br>
You are in transition and would have taken 226 damage.<br>
<br>
Anyone know what caused that and why?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=czerisgawaine>Czeris Gawaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 10:41:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3463.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah</span><hr size=1> The failed PA with no error message/reason is not a new bug.

It is not a stealth change, new feature or bug fix, just an oddly recurring bug that they have no intention/capability of fixing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugalium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 10:54:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3463.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah</span><hr size=1> Hmm.. dont think I agree Czeris, while there have always been problems with LOS/to far away, and such with PA. The particular problem is not one I have ever experienced, I too have played since release. In the last few weeks I cant count the number of times I have had it happen, so without question something has changed. If it existed in the past it was on a much lower rate of occurance.<br>
<br>
This isnt against a particular target as was suggested, this is an in general cross the board effect, though I have yet to notice it in PvE, there if I am revealed I get the message and that I fail to hit my PA because I wasnt stealthed. <br>

I can think of specific instances months ago of experiencing this bug.<br>
<br>
One in particular...an afk tank near amg.  She was not moving, so it was not a question of lag, or position.  I saw she was afk, so I lined everything up very carefully.<br>
<br>
Hit PA, no message or anything, I am unstealthed, and just swing normally...tank comes back from afk and whups my ass.  This happens to me about once every 2 weeks (on average).<br>
<br>
Perhaps if it is happening more frequently they might get around to fixing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 8:41:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3463.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah</span><hr size=1> Just FYI, other classes are experiencing this as well.

<br>
Like Czeris said, this has been an issue in the past before 1.50. Perhaps its increased in its frequency.<br>
<br>
Im really beginning to think there is some sort of client/server sync issue here. Not only in regards to this issue, but several TLs have noticed an increased amount of general misses. I know the Skald TL and Thane TL are parsing a lot of logs about this right now.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvenomousb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VenomousB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 9:01:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3463.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah</span><hr size=1> Could this be related to the change for follow up styles and to cancel a style?  If you use a style hot key twice you will no longer be preparing the style.  When this change went in it annoyed me during PvP fights since there seems to be more delay than in PvE.  I would use a hot key more than once and then cancel the style. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3463.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3463.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3463.topic&index=15><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3463.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3463.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3463.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3463.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
