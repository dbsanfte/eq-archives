Just go about your business and leave each to their own.  The original poster was asking for information on others who got their epic, he/she didn't ask for some diatribe on how they are going to hell for twinking a cat.<br>

<br>
Yeah I guess if you are a cynic that could be an explanation.<br>
<br>
Or how about these:<br>
<br>
Dislikes current main, felt like swapping, SoL just came out.<br>
Likes the idea of the Vah Shir race. <br>
Purposely to piss Lannella off.<br>
<br>
My reason?  I spent 2+ years bringing my main to 60 and got god awful sick of playing a caster.  SoL came out with the addition of a new race that I thought would be awesome to play.  I ditched my monk twink (if cats could have been monks I would have done that) in favor of the Rogue.  Why did I pl?  Well because levelling the slow way sucks after doing it once, and I wanted to be back in the game with my friends who are all high lvl players.  Why did I get my RB?  Well, let's face it, it's not exactly all that hard to get for anyone (not just uberguilds, FYI, I'm unguilded and did it all with friends and did my general on a pickup raid) that has the faintest hint of motivation.  As for someone not needing the RB, that's true, but for such a simple quest that nearly doubles your DPS, you'd be stupid not to do it.<br>
<br>
Well, Lannella, those are my reasons.  Not that you care because your closed little mind is too lazy to open for a minute. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujaedengrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeden Grae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/8/02 10:35:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulannellavelglarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lannella Velglarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/hottopic.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 10:44:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22156.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitty with Ragebringer</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> he/she didn't ask for some diatribe on how they are going to hell for twinking a cat.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ironic that we got your diatribe on how you rationalize doing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujaedengrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeden Grae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 10:48:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22156.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.covad.net/~blcktail/2SDOGc.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitty with Ragebringer</span><hr size=1> Ahh no, mine was more targeted specifically at you, because you came into a thread and posted off topic and negatively. <br>

<br>
Whee!<br>
<br>
With the advent of Multiple Boxes and accounts. Leveling is easy.<br>
<br>
With items  never decaying. Twinking is simple.<br>
<br>
This day and age is completly different to when right before Kunark people were taking all the thief armour and making twinks. Now there is so much loot dropping from all places that are good that twinking is only hurting the experiance of the player.<br>
<br>
But when that player has been through the game from the start, what do you expect them to do?<br>
<br>
Mudflation is alive and well. Twinking is never ever going to change.<br>
<br>
I just hope that the twinks realize the fast game will never equal the experiances of the old slow game that the first thieves had.<br>
<br>
Kheety is going to make a damn fine thief. But she will never know the pain of a level 20 with Banded and patchwork leather. She will never have known the pain of 1 point backstabs.  She will never have known the excitement of killing a gorge hound at level 20 with 1 hitpoint left.<br>
<br>
That doesnt make her less of a thief. Just simply makes her experiances less with a thief viewpoint.<br>
<br>
For that I pity the twinks. They will never see the game through the old school thieves eyes. <br>
<br>
But I also pity myself because I will never see the game through the eyes of an old school druid Like kheety has.<br>
<br>
Think about it.<br>

<br>
Why does someones alt have to be a &quot;utility&quot; rogue?  <br>
<br>
A rogue that doesnt get played every day is less of a rogue?  Doesnt deserve an epic or whatver?<br>
<br>
Whats ironic about this is its tied up in a combo rant against both the twink cat and the guild that &quot;Could do ToV so doing the general for the pathetic twink alt is no big dea&quot;, but the N ToV guild has access to weapons better than ragebringers.<br>
<br>
Heres one to twist yer insides!  There are &quot;twinks&quot; out there with Vulak and Tunare daggers, put on alts because they wearnt needed by mains, just the same as the ragebringer in your example.  You hate them too I suppose but in what possible way does it impact your game?<br>
<br>
Sorry that there are level 60 cats out there with epics, and level 50s with epics but it really, honestly, isnt about you.  If they're having fun with a new class. Super.<br>
<br>
Incidently, on the topic of new rouges that &quot;missed&quot; the banded and 1 point BS phase you can rest assured that I/most certainly remember when the most &quot;uber&quot; rouges were running around with SBDs and a patchwork of Rubicite and mithril with no sneak vs undead and whatnot.  Course they could also pick pocket dragons so I dont think things were all bad!  Point is just because people wearnt playing the class then, doesnt mean the experince was somehow missed.  I dont have to shoot myself in the head to know it would hurt.<br>

But the reason for this post is not to show how big my *&amp;$&amp;* is, but to let you know why I did it. <br>
<br>
Basically, my main is a 60 de rogue which took 2yrs to get to. I simply made the cat and powered him for a change to enhance my EQ experience. Face it, we all have been burnt out on EQ at one time or another. This is just a way to change it up a bit with different stats/looks etc.<br>
<br>
Like the poster couple of posts before me said, I didn't want to level the &quot;slow&quot; way, simply because I already did that for 2 years. I wanted to play the cat for a change with the people I currently play with on a regular basis. Actually it's sad though..my cat has better equip then my de did *shrug*, but main thing is I'm having a great time playing him which is what eq is about.<br>
<br>
I was even petitioned by other people from other guilds because they thought I was exploiting somthing to have a 60 cat with ss armor and the assortment of other things. I even had my log out point camped at one point so someone could see if they could &quot;bust&quot; me for something. That's sad...Why people care so much about what someone else has rather than themselves. So after talking to several GM's about all the lame petitions they realized everything was kosher. But I simply don't play my cat now because of all the harassment he got from other players and would continue to get.<br>

I feel no need to brag, show off, whatever.<br>
<br>
I started my druid (Santerre) in July 1999, because a friend (ranger) told me &quot;SoW is the most desired spell in the game&quot;.  I've played 130 days on Santerre, he's 60, has epic, Velious quest gear but not NToV/God/Dragon loot.  Has epic.  And its... not a lot of fun playing him.  Despite the great great posts from Lotusfly on playing druids in the high end game, to me it still works out to buff, debuff, nuke, sit.  Kind of like a cleric, but without the responsibility.  I'm not playing my druid wrong; I play a damn good druid.  It's just not exciting for me.  Well, other than when I get to pull in Fear - but after 50 clearings, even that loses its luster.<br>
<br>
I've tried to counter this many ways.  I've played almost every class to a decently high level, or played them on other accounts as needed on raids since I have 2 boxes.<br>
<br>
When DAoC came out I left EQ for 2 months.  However, DAoC was missing content, so when Luclin came out, I came back to EQ.<br>
<br>
After 3 AA points in 5 days, I decided that playing a druid was still not going to do it for me.  My guild, my friends, urged me to do whatever was fun for me - powerlevel my 50war, play one of the guild wiz/enc/etc. on raids.  My decision was to make a Vah Shir Beastlord.  After reading up a little, discovering Beastlord was a pet class (basically), I decided I'd rather play a rogue - closer to my DAoC LW Hero, high damage less defense.<br>
<br>
I started Shash, a Vah Shir Rogue, on 12/13/01.  He's now level 55 and has a Ragebringer in 10 days played.  His gear is mostly Velks/Mrylo - my guild is still equipping 60s in HoT gear, and I still need to work on faction to even qualify for it.  I believe my RB was second on the Server to Vindraaz (Ayonae Ro).  Artfull, 54 Vah Shir Rogue and guildmate of mine, also got his general this Monday and is a Kedge Robe away from his epic.<br>
<br>
I did this because ALL of my friends are 55+.  I spent 6 weeks of my non-raid play time powerlevelling a kitty rogue so I would have a char that was fun to play - with my friends.  On Ayonae Ro, there IS no situation where I would be able to struggle with a group of ill-equiped 20s through Sol A, the server is too... buffed I guess.  And remember I did that 2.5 years ago!  I play the game to accomplish things with my friends - to us, getting HoT armor and epics is a significant accomplishment.  If I am not 55+, I am wasting my friends time.  So that's wrong?  I should not play with my friends, or play a class I do not enjoy, because &quot;powerlevelling is evil&quot;?  My 55 Rogue is an asset to my guild, and fun for me.  This is wrong?<br>
<br>
I don't get penis envy over things in game.  Am I proud to have one of the highest level Vah Shir on the server?  Sure.  Does it make me better than anyone?  Heh, I am an adult, and its more embarassing  than bragging to explain the amount of time I spend on this hobby to my RL friends and wife.  So before you go making jealous accusations to folks that made their &quot;Kitty twinks&quot;, remember... we didn't do it to hurt YOU.  It had nothing to do with YOU, whether you are the original beta 4 rogue that eats NToV for lunch and is wielding MDoV/Claw (which I will likely never see), or if you are a casual playing level 45 in Ravenscale wielding a Obsidian Shard.  We did it because it is a GAME, and it was FUN for us.  <br>
<br>
And finally, as far as learning your class... after playing 100+ days on this game, if you don't have a pretty good idea of what every class should be doing... chances are you aren't playing your own chosen class very well.  There are some tricks in the game sure, but all in all this game is not the hardest out there.<br>
<br>
So think carefully about what you are saying before you categorize people.  Your antagonism is clearly based on jealousy, and it really makes you look like an ass.  I'm a nice guy, a GOOD rogue (mebbe not the best ever), and by making blanket statements you are alienating me, and plenty of people like me.<br>
<br>
But yes... my swimming skill still sucks! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urenaebi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Renaebi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:26:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22156.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: For your perusal.</span><hr size=1> /agree Santerre<br>
<br>
Really just mental masturbation to just bitch and whine about someone being twinked and PLed.  I am somewhat disgusted that I have read this whole thread.<br>
<br>
As far as grinding through level 20 in banded, other than a purist, no one does that now on Innoruuk, as better armor is available much cheaper, hell.. high levels will just give you stuff now.  I created a VAH BST and was just handed gear every couple of hours by older ppl in the zone.  Nice gear just drops too quickly and is so cheap, why go banded?  And the bugs have been fixed so we can't experience them like the old school rogues, are us newer rogues just losers then because we didn't create our rogue 3 years ago?<br>
<br>
Now, what is a utility rogue, one u drag on raids to pick locks?  Wouldn't I still need to do damage and contribute to fights as well so as not to be lag fodder?  Well in the real persons game, a Ragebringer is the BEST weapon to get.  Hell, I have a friend w/ a Primal & Priceless spear, but when fighting... he still uses RB in the off hand.  Seems that its not such a bad weapon.<br>
<br>
Feh, wasted too much of my life on this thread already.  If you enjoy the game and your rogue then keep on playin. (c: If you enjoy getting bent out of shape because some rogue w/ 10 days played has better gear than you, well have fun then, but don't ruin this msg board for the rest of us. <p><p><div style="width:100%;font:italic 14px arial,helvetica,sans-serif;color:#66ffcc;filter:glow(color=light,strength=2)"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1700" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#66ffcc;">Shaerl</a><br>47 Rogue<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1069" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#66ffcc;">Renaebi Muranaga</a><br>54 Disciple<br><br>Officer of Battalion<br>Innoruuk</div></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujaedengrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeden Grae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:30:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22156.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.covad.net/~blcktail/2SDOGc.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: For your perusal.</span><hr size=1> Thanks Feather =D<br>

<br>
I get the "not a real rogue" bs a lot too, mainly by people who have never met me in game. Hi, I've played 3 non-twinked, non-PLed rogues and hell, my 1st character was a rogue. You think I never went through the turmoil of no gear? I've done it 3 times. Maybe not to 60, probably because my 1st was before Kunark, but I have definitely experienced those: "1 dmg back stabs", "banded", "living with 1hp battles", etc.<br>
<br>
I hear "twinking gimp" a bunch also. Wanna know something? I had a 60 wiz before I left for DAoC Beta. I had no intention of returning to EQ, so I killed my wiz (to save anyone from killing my name, I use the name "Rulu" in many things) and gave my account away. In DAoC Beta/DAoC I played a Blademaster, Thuergist, Scout, Ranger, and a Shadowblade all to 30-40+. <br>
<br>
DAoC end game got real boring (for me) and it seemed as if Mythic kept making the game "easier" and not "harder". So I took a look at SoL and went back to EQ. DAoC reminded me how much I missed being a melee and I thought Cats looked bad ass. I have played and enjoyed playing rogues before, a friend even suggested that I restart as a cat rogue. So I made one, logged on, and started exping. Spent 19 lvls in leather and some friends geared me up. So blame my friends for wanting to help me out so I can get back to raiding with them again and soon (grr, now to just get a comp that can handle their raids).<br>
<br>
I didn't PL, I lvled up normally. I only have 1 box and I won't use 3rd party programs (unless it's like, EQColor stuff). So I get petitioned enough. So I ask this... Have any of YOU had to endure the turmoil of having 5 GMs pop in on you in one day, because you MIGHT be exploiting to get exp? In all seriousness, if I weren’t a cat, many people wouldn't have a problem with it. Many, probably, would never have even noticed it. Know what? I WILL continue to play my CAT ROGUE. Because, even with all the BS and whiny, bishy people, I'm still having fun. Are you? =)<br>
<br>
PS. - To make some of you "real rogues" feel happy... NO, I do not have a RB or better then RB weapons! =) My friends are busy raiding and no guild = no RB. So yea, I'm still sitting at no KK Robe and no General (don't think my comp can handle General atm, anyway). *awaits the "HAHA U SUX0R" and "FEEL MY PAIN" posts* ;p<br>
