They rely completely on backstab so if you take that away from them they are whooped.&quot; This was stated after a friendly duel with my friend Troll SK, whom I got down to 60 health and I at 225, when he whips out a 219 HT. I'm suprised it was only that much considering he's level 32. I thought it would be 320. Well, gotta hand it to my resist gear yet again. (Dwarven ringmail at 30 baby! and I love it!)<br><br>   Anywho, this level 50 pally proceeds to state the forementioned quote. I would have challenged him to a duel if he wasn't 20 levels above me. I did duel a pally 8 levels above me and won, but she didn't use an LoH so I'm not sure if it was fair and square. Wandered off subject again. Anyways I definitely DO NOT rely on my backstabs. In my main I have a BR cause I really, really love that extremely low delay, and in off hand I have my SBD. I know, I know, use the lowest delay in offhand, but I've compared logs and I seem to be doing more damage with the BR in mainhand plus I love seeing the screen fill with yellow and it looks really odd wielding a large metal weapon in your non profficient hand and a little piece of bone in your strongest hand. I just love the look of BR in main and a little dagger in offhand.<br><br>    Dang, wandered off again. I have a two sets of armor for some slots. One for pure melee that adds agi and ac, and one for anyone who can cast which consists of a lot of resists. I use the resist one much more often and it doesn't leave much weight for loot with a Mith BP in my backpack (brand spankin new! made 1k profit in the last 2 weeks off of small wisdom deities. My level 27 friend made a profit of 5k in the last month and got himself a trak tooth, DANG!!! I wandered off again!) but it seems to work.<br> <br>   Because the BR doesn't do an incredible amount of damage and lowers BSes, people think I am weak. Hehe. Far from it. It's like that old saying on how to boil a frog alive. You put it in hot water and it'll jump out, but if you put it in cold water and slowly bring it to a boil, he's toast. They scoff at the beginning when they see me poking at them for around 18dmg, but that smile fades when they all of a sudden realize they are at 1/3 health and I'm at 2/3. It's incredibly roguish to me. Much more subtle than a huge harpoon bein thrust through your back. This is why that pally believed we rely completely on Backstabs. Nearly every rogue believes that they need to get one of those fancy harpoons when they get around my level and they trade low delay for visible damage.<br><br>    Now to wrap up this meandering thread, I'm gonna state the two classes I fear most, in increasing order. SK then Bard. Although I rarely duel bards. Never find too many bard jerks myself that are past level 20. Too challenging and rewards knowing your class, not for twinks. So when you do face a bard around level 30, be afraid, be very afraid.<br><br>Pedric Cuf, Halfling spy, err historian of the 30th keg, proud resident of Xev<br><br>&quot;Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am not a crook&quot;<br><br>EDIT: I couldn't think of the right word, and the second after I posted it I did! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upedriccuf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pedric Cuf</A> at: 5/24/01 10:07:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukambic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/01 10:18:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/Kambic/TRINITY.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Underestimated rogues</span><hr size=1> Um to say that rogue's suck in duels without backstab is like saying rogue's suck in PvE without backstab -- both of which are true, but are assanine statements.

Lifetaps.  A level 60 shadowknight can kill a level 60 wizard by just sitting there and casting his drain spells vs a level 60 wizard sitting there nuking.  A shadowknight and wizard on Rallos tried it.  Don't think the wizard sucked either.  He is one of the oldest players on the rallos zek server and pvps a ton.<br>2. Jousting weapon.  If they have their epic, they will be double attacking you for 200 a pop.  It also procs that lifedrain dot a ton.  Even if they don't have their epic, they have a slew of high damage weapons to choose from.  Your small chance of getting that jousting backstab in will not outweigh the big hits you take from those high damage weapons.<br>3. Shadowstep.  If for some reason they miss a ton and need to get away to med, rebuff, etc.<br>4. Damage absorption spell.<br>5. A couple of dots, one of which does around 200 in pvp which isn't insignificant considering they can cast it a ton if they have to (most don't).<br>6. Harmtouch.  The big daddy of pvp.  It recycles every 90 minutes, not every 4 hours.  With their high level discipline, I don't know the exact number but I want to say it does around 800 damage to a pc.<br>7. Hitpoints.  Again not sure on exact numbers but I'd say a high 50s sk would have around 2500 hps with halfway decent gear.  Add to this the 235ish they get every 2 minutes from casting lifeleech on you a minimum of 4 times.<br><br>These things do not paint a pretty picture for the adversary and are why most consider shadowknights to be one of the best pvping classes.<br><br>Disciplines are only good versus the unsuspecting.  Any decent pvper will just keep out of range for 10-15 seconds once they see you use a discipline.  Your poison isn't going to work at 55 they get a pr buff similar to dead man floating.  If you dispell it, they can just shadowstep and recast.<br><br>You may (don't think you would though) kill a shadowknight if the space was very small eliminating their ability to shadowstep.<br><br>As a level 59 rogue on Rallos, a shadowknight is one of the last people with which I choose to tangle. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugaaryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaaryn</A> at: 5/25/01 12:45:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulegnavalsharess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Legna ValSharess</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/25/01 4:27:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Underestimated rogues</span><hr size=1> Believe whatever you want. <br><br>True, I am not 59 yet.

That said the classes are waaaay more balanced than when EQ went live in Mar '99 but still some classes shine when it comes to pvping, pking, and/or dueling.  Each class has advantages based on where the fight takes place, what particular level the parties are, ease of acquiring epic, etc.  Of course every class can beat any other class given the right location, preparation of the combatants, etc...but to say that if you took equally skilled players and fought class vs class you would end up with anything close to a 50/50 split would just not happen (or at least that's the way I'd bet).<br><br>I hate to break out the 'I have played more than you so I know more argument' but you did call me an idiot;p  I really don't see how you can comment on high level pvp at 46...Have you looked at the shadowknight, shaman, necromancer spell list post 50?  There is a reason why they are feared... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugaaryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaaryn</A> at: 5/25/01 11:02:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uorec.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orec</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/01 2:32:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lirin, you talking instant cast or the new one?</span><hr size=1> To Cylant:<br><br>I have played five classes on pvp servers to my 30s and 40s and I can say with all honesty that not all classes were created equal. <br><br>Does this mean that you can't be an effective pvper with almost any class? No not at all. My cleric, 41st level, can stand toe to toe with any caster, wisdom or int based. One on one I can outheal and outmelee another caster (though necros with pets can be very tough). However I have absolutely NO chance to kill a melee class. My spells are all magic based so even the slightest magic resistance makes thier effects laughable. Even at base magic resistance I don't have the mana to kill a melee. I have tried meleeing them and using mana to heal and I have tried my direct damage... A monk at half health and near base magic resistance ran me out of mana (I rooted and direct damaged him) and I had to continue to root and med a bit more until he was dead. Now imagine me against a warrior with ever increasing magic resistance... with each level the disparity continues and I have absolutely no chance to kill a melee.<br><br>As for Shadowknights:<br><br>An intelligent Shadowknight should be able to beat a rogue by jousting them. Use a really high damage two hander and charge, swing and continue running. As an ogre shadowknight I use a weighted axe against melees... it cost me 20 plat but it has a damage of 45! I just swing it and with a double attack I can do up to 400 dmg (up to 200 a swing) in one charge. What will a rogue do? a couple slashes as I run by with two 10-13 dmg weapons?<br><br>If I make a pet (like a dot but can also bash which is huge!), use harm touch, use lifetaps, use QUICK dots like disease cloud and even shadowstep when needed then I doubt any rogue can kill me. Shadowstep can be used for escape but more importantly it can be used for maneuvering... it is a bit &quot;cheap&quot; but a dual weilding rogue will interrupt me over and over if I try to lifetap. If I shadowstep a bit away and cast I can usually get the spell off... Legna may laugh but it's VERY effective to use this for maneuvering.<br><br>Orec is a rogue and I am determined to be a skilled pvp'er with him and help to gain some respect for this class so don't think I can't see the power of a rogue. I think a well played rogue has a chance to kill anyone... but a well played SK will beat a well played rogue in a fair fight in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugsam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gsam</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/01 8:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Legna...</span><hr size=1> SK's are hands down the last class a rogue wants to fight with. Unless you catch the SK OOM with no harmtouch and get in some nice doubles your going to get beat. This is of course assuming the SK is a semi competent PVP'r.  Gaaryn is correct in his evaluation of SK vs Rogue battles.  Shadowknights got the perfect blend to pvp. They got the taps that heal and the HP to withstand an assault. They got the damage shileds also that will chew a rogue up. SK's are about the only class I wont fight 1 on 1.  <br><br>Also, alot of you are forgetting that certain classes peak much sooner than others. For instance a cleric is extremely hard to kill but is no threat offensively. Shamans are not much of a worry in the early levels but once they get 49 they can put an insane hurt on you. Necros are dangerous through all the levels, especially once they get touch of night and deflux. Wizards are dangerous at all levels. DRuids start slow but pick up speed at midlevels and stay strong to 60, the new heals made them very hard to kill. Mages peak very late in the game, around 44 their pets start being more effective in pvp against us rogues. Chanters peak late and once they get that unresistable mes you better watch out. Warriors/rogue/monks are very effective at all levels with some of the new weaponry around. Pallys are diehards, dont put out much damage but take a long time to kill. Sk's peak VERY late in the game but once they peak I dont think there is anyone who would dispute that they are the kings of pvp in the high end pvp game.<br><br>EDIT:  I am referring to rogue vs SK battles when the SK is 55+.  <br><br>Gsam / Tiig <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugsam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gsam</A> at: 5/28/01 9:00:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umorticusbelaern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morticus Belaern</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/29/01 3:41:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legna...</span><hr size=1> I'm 51 and I whooped a 52 SK Saturday night.

There is no way to set up a control to test the 50/50 hypothesis - but if there was, i would imagine not all classes would be completely equal, but they would be darn close.  After dealing with the constant debates in the various newbie zones about what is the best PvP class i'm sick of hearing it.  <br>There really is no best class.  Pick one you enjoy playing - learn how to play it effectively and keep going.  You'll learn new tricks as you go.  Oh.. and on the harmtouch issue.. i never duel a shadow knight with harmtouch up.  When i duel shadow knights - i do fine.  When a shadow knight trys to pk me - it's laughable.  If i'm not completely prepared to kill them i just leave, and they can't do a damn thing about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=280.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=280.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=280.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.threadControl?topicID=280.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=280.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=280.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm24">Realm Quests<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
