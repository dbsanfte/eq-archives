<br>
The ironic part about his whole rant is that while he does not understand him being a rogue radio DJ is an important part of our free democratic society just as the military is, the prior military individuals do understand that fact.<br>
<br>
The sad part of his rant is that he has so much absolutely incorrect information. He whines about how he and his friends are so educated because they are critical of the US. They might want to apply some of that education and critical analysis to some of those same old trite arguements (I did get a chuckle out of the 'All White Military' comment it was so wrong).<br>
<br>
Molt, <br>
<br>
If you are so repulsed by the 'American Dream', (to use a trite phrase) &quot;put your money where your mouth is&quot;, move. There are MANY places out where it is not even an option. You are more than welcome to do nothing but stomp your foot and whine incessantly about the injustice of it all. It just really shows a lack of commitment to your standards if you are unwilling to act on it.<br>
<br>
But I suggest that you do not knock it until you try it. I'm living and loving it. Making some serious green, 2 kids (daughters), house in the 'burbs. Soccer games on Saturday, Swim and soccer practice during the week. Date night with the wife every other Sat night or so. It does not suck.<br>
<br>
The one suggestion that I have for you in your agruments, is that you need to make a distinction between the military and the government. Remember that the military is the tool of the elected officials. Some politcan tells some guy in a shiny hat what to do, that guy tells someone with a less shiny hat, etc. My drill instructor told us in boot camp that the tip of our bayonet is the functional end of the US foreign policy. You also need to keep that in mind. If you do not like the fact that the military is turning Afganistan into a parking lot, don't whine about the military when the government should be your target. If you do not like getting stripped searched at the airport, do not whine about the military, the government is your target.<br>
<br>
A few of your comments that are directly related to the military.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> secondly the &quot;discipline&quot; is half the problem, your willingness ot do whatever a man says scares the FUCK out of a lot of people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Simple solution, do not join the military. <br>
<br>
Others have pointed out that a person is obligated to disobey an illegal order (and I would say 98% of all people in the military know what constitutes an illegal order). But if you cannot understand the necessity of WHY people in the military are trained to obey orders, you are clearly not as educated as you think you are. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> why do a lot of peopel join the armed forces now? so they can get school payed for. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Like I mentioned before you need to apply some of that critical analysis to some of your statements. This is a prime candidate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> i am a parasite becse the constition that you believe your fighting for, grants me the persuit of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. so then you fighting and saying i have to defend my constititinal rights?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not exactly sure of your point, a little more sentence structure helps in articulating your idea. But if you are enjoying the freedoms and are not willing to pay the price, then yes you are a parasite because you are enjoying the freedoms while not willing to assume the responsibilities (I know 'responsibility' is a ugly term lately, I should have chosen differently). <br>
<br>
But Zinj's point (I think) is that it is fine that you want to live off the work of others, just do not whine about those who are actually doing the work.<br>
<br>
And No, I have no intention of trying to change your opinion, time will do that for me. <p>Kurrlee<br>

lets look at ALL of the quote.  don't pick and choose.  if someone is willing to avail themselves of all the freedoms protected by our military, yet not willing to defend those freedoms themselves, then parasite is a kind name for them.<br>

<br>
I am sorry but until you can actually come up with something more than gibberish that you heard someone else say why bother having a discussion with you.  Every point you have brought up has been refuted and when that happens rather than defending it you throw out another red herring.  You have to love the mindless masses of the ivory tower intellectual(a term I use very loosely.)<br>
<br>
BTW, a couple of points for you:<br>
<br>
1)  The searches in the airport are conducted by the Federal Aviation Agency which is part of the Department of Transportation not the Department of Defense.  The men and women that you see there in uniform are there to protect you, the general public, if a radical were to try and hurt you.  Now believe me those citizen soliders, they are National Guard folks, would much rather be at home with their loved ones, going to their regular jobs, and making a heck of a lot more money than sitting their watching your sad self go flying off somewhere. <br>
<br>
2)  Hate to tell you but there are easier ways to get school paid for than going into the military.  <br>
<br>
3)  You have every right to stand on the street corner and yell at the top of your lungs anything you wish within the bounds set forth by the Supreme Court.(ie you can't yell fire in a theater.)  However, I also have to right to stand right next to you and to refute everything that comes out of your mouth and make you look like an idiot.  Your freedom of speech in no way allows you to inhibit mine.<br>
<br>
Finally, as to being a parasite on society.  Paying your taxes doesn't give you anything.  Sorry.  Voting is your responsibility and you should be damn thankful to the men and women of the US military for giving up their freedom, and lives to protect your rights.  <br>
<br>
BTW, if you don't know what a strong military provides look at history, damn I know I am asking you to do research and look up things for yourself again, and see when the US has been attacked both abroad and at home.  It has historically been when are seen as being militarily weak.  Quite frankly if we would have dealt with the terrorist problem in the 90's it would have never resulted in the tragedy of 9/11 and thus our incursion into Afghanistan but the Administration in power refused to take action prevent it so we have a bunch of dead Americans.  <br>

You made it perfectly clear that under no circumstance would you be a part of the military. That is failing to take responsibility. Saying that you would not join NOW, is not the same as saying that under no circumstance would you ever join. <p>Kurrlee<br>

<br>
What about the other times?  What about when Natural Disaster's hit?  Flood's, Hurricanes, Earthquakes?  Chances are when those things happen the Armed Forces in that area get tasked with A. Providing Order, B. Helping in Rescue and Life saving operations, and C. Distributing Food and Water.  Not only that they are often times tasked with cleaning up the damage.  <br>
<br>
Molt do you have any idea what military life is like?  Do you realize the hardships that the average service member endures?  The seperations from loved ones, the hours of tedium, the Monotony.  <br>
<br>
You think a Raster Camp is Hard, Try fucking training for a major inspection 12 hours a day, six days, a week for 2 and a half months at a time.  <br>
<br>
Want to see fucking Heartbreak, turn off the Friends Episode where Joey's pet iguana vomited up some catfood and watch a shipmate get told his wife and step kids were murdered by some drug crazed psycho while he was 3500 miles away.<br>
<br>
I served with a fellow who was in Beirut when some fanatic drove a vehichle with explovies into his barracks building when he was in it.  <br>
<br>
You know, I have never been shot at in my life.  Never once while I served have I ever felt my life was in danger and I have no fucking clue how I would react in that situation.  But I have stood 10 hours in the fucking snow with a gun in my hand in the middle of some sorry assed pier in South Carolina making sure nobody got to my shipmates.  I polished a chrome toilet till I could see my face in it.  And I gave up 9 years of my life to my country, made friends I will have for life, and regrets too.  Lots of Regrets.  <br>
<br>
And the pay.  Lets talk about the money.  95% of the military makes less then $25,000 a year (or did, havent kept up in the last 5 years since I got out).  Sure, you get free medical care, food (heh, if you can call it that) and clothes (actually you get a uniform allowance that does little or no good to actually keep your uniforms in the required shape).<br>
<br>
But your the Rebel Molt,  Its all the military's fault.  Not the Government you did or didnt vote for.  Not other countries that want to take whats ours.  Not societies whose fucking whims change with the channel on their TV.  <br>
<br>
Im not a Jingoist.  In fact I can't stand the flag, Im a reader, when I think of America the Image that comes into my mind is the heading of the Preamble.  Big Fucking letters WE THE PEOPLE.<br>
<br>
One thing I will never do is Disrespect those that serve.  Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, Red Cross, Fire Fighters, Police, EMT's or any other organization whether military or civilian, American or Foreign.  Any that serve their fellow men (women too) deserve consideration if not your respect.<br>
<br>
We the People Molt,  Your one too.<br>
<br>
But go on with your life, they got your back.  Hope you enjoy that pizza!<br>

<br>
i am saying the goverments/military is taking our rights away, and at an alarming rate. if you wanan join the army, KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF<br>
<br>
i dosagree wiht thier idealogy and thier  structure, does that make me the ONLY american that thinks that way?<br>
<br>
no<br>
<br>
does this make me in the imority here, and thusly peopel making huge illogical jumps?<br>
<br>
yes<br>
<br>
will you guys ever change my mind?<br>
no<br>
<br>
will you keep feleing better about your goverment  so that you don't notice these things, cause they don't happen to you?<br>
most likely<br>
<br>
will i ever say that the military is needed?<br>
yep, already have<br>
<br>
all i am saying is i dispise thie rlogic, thier stucture, they way they break you down  and the  things it did to frinds of mine.  i do nto liek the leaps the military is taking in keeping this &quot;quite&quot; just so  we can hav a false sense of security.  the military has NO RIGHT to tell me what i can and cannot do accouring to THIER laws.<br>
<br>
enough said.<br>
<br>
tell me i am wrong, i dare ya.  the laws as governed by the military/armed forces are different form ours(thats thier thing, fine, enjoy) butenforcing thier ideology on other american who HAVE THE FREEDOM TO FORM AN OPINION! is wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
you people are a prime example of why it is messed up,  somone asked my opinion i gave it, you all feel the need to say i am lazy and do not defend my &quot;rights&quot;   whiel i do not enter the military, these righst were given to me, and nowhere does it say to have these rights i gotta go off and train and die.  nope,  dare ya to find that one, CAUSE YOUR NOT.<br>
<br>
<br>
you guys are the ones operating off assumtions and what you &quot;think&quot; shoudl be right and hwo i should  defend my rights by having a gun and running across the ocean to kill a bunch of civilians and sometimes sme enemies.<br>
<br>
gee guys, sounds familiar, hitler made people join his army too.<br>
the beuty of america is that i don't have to join, the FUCK IF I EVEN WANNA.<br>
but if you do, go ahead, do it, you may learn somehting new, you may come back a better person, and you may be the happiest man/women alive<br>
<br>
the world is full of maybes, and you may die, and you may be booted out and you may  come back emotionaly scared for life and you may never see your family the same way.<br>
<br>
guys, your saying to have the righst the goverment gave me i have ot get a gun and fight, and thats so fundementally wrong.  find that part of the constitution, i dare ya guys.<br>
<br>
<br>
i am sick of you gys just sitting here spewing off the same crap andnot even bothing to see where i am coming from, i see your points, i even agree wiht some of them,  but you seem to thing that i am lazy, and eat pizza and play EQ all day(well i do play EQ)<br>
<br>
but yeah knwo what, i eat my pizza knwoing i am HAPPY, and the the constitution grants me that right to persue happiness,  so go off and eat dehydrated crackers and  sit in the dessert for a few years, hoping the goverment has not doen anything to you either, and be happy, cause thats yoru right,and my right is the right to say<br>
FUCK THE AMRED FORCES, they make you a 5 year old with a outfit, oobeying your father and never second guessing him, thats not my way, and it never will be, so you all can quit telling me i have to defend my rights, we live in a country that flexes and half of nicaragua can disappear.<br>
<br>
so once gaian, my rights given to me and i enjoy SO MUCH have absolutely nothing to do wiht the idealogy and structure of the military, nor does it have anything to do with you wanting to join the military.<br>
<br>
so quit trying to tell me i should.<br>
<br>

<br>
1. What do you want the government to do? How do you think the governement can be better? What is your great governing plan for all of us?<br>
<br>
2. Do you want the military to go away? What would you do to protect MINE and everyone elses freedom if the military was to go away. What do you want the military to do? How would you run the military if you do not want it to go?<br>
<br>
 Seriously, you complain and and make all kinds of negative statements about the government and military. What would you do to make it better? Never bitch about something if you cannot offer a better solution. You dislike all these things about our government and society, but have no ideas or solution on how YOU can make it better. This to me is the stupiest thing about your whole defense on your idealogy.<br>

<br>
I (and probably most people posting here) are very aware of your points. Simply because most people have heard them ad-naseum. The funny part is that while you think you are being orginial in your critiques of the military and government they are nothing but the same old trite slogans used for decades/generations/eons.<br>
<br>
Which points do you feel we are missing? <br>
<br>
The ones that are complete nonsense (e.g. the all white military-so far my favorite) or the ones using muddeled logic (e.g. you keep interchanging the military and the government).<br>
<br>
Just because we are pointing out the flaws in your agruments does not mean that we do not have an understanding of your points. Matter of fact, I would assert that in order for someone to properly refute an argument they must have a complete (or near complete) understanding of the opposing point.<br>
<br>
Can you say the same about the points we are making? I did not think so. <br>
<br>
Although since you dropped the 'all white military' argument, you must have some idea of the veracity of what we are saying.<br>
<br>
Like I said before, I am not trying to change your mind. Time will do that for me. <p>Kurrlee<br>

<br>
I never called you anything other than a member of the Mindless Mass of Ivory Tower Intellectuals which you have proven quite well.  You have not presented a single fact.  You have provided us with your opinion and nothing else.  You are welcome to it but it might help if you did some research and actually came up with some facts that you could state to back your opinions.  If you have presented some facts that I have missed please list them and supporting information that backs them.  You know like those used to refute your arguments....<br>
<br>
Molt Hypothesis - The military has been all white males<br>
<br>
Fact - There are many General Officers that are other than white and male.  Two cases in point are Chappie James(Black 4 Star General in the USAF), and Colin Power(Black 4 Star General in the US Army as well as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) both of which served over 35 years.  A little research on current General Officers will show men and women of just about every race.<br>
<br>
Molt Hypothesis - The military is searching people in Airports<br>
<br>
Fact - Searchs in the Airport are done at the direction of the FAA which is part of the Department of Transportation.  The people doing the inspections are either a) FAA employees or b) contractors working for the FAA.  <br>
<br>
<br>
You know Molt I actually enjoy reading your posts because they give me a good laugh that someone could be so confused and ill informed.  I know its sad and I shouldn't laugh but you are like those people on cable TV with the wacko theories about tin hats etc.  Your show must be a hoot to listen to and watch just for the comedic value.  We used to watch people like you late at night in college and laugh till our sides hurt cause of the off the wall and flat out stupid theories.<br>
<br>
BTW, please give me an example of the military extending its standards of conduct upon the general population.<br>

<br>
there are people like you, who think as you do, the world over...but only in this great country, the america you so despise, may they voice their ideas and opinions so freely.  and for that, you may thank the men and women of all nationalities, faiths, colors, and educational backgrounds who dedicated their lives, and in many cases, gave thier lives for you to do so.  yes, that freedom is recorded on a piece of paper, but without the &quot;petty&quot; military that stands behind it, that paper is meaningless.<br>
<br>
i wont try to change your mind.  i honestly dont care what you choose to believe in.  but each and every time i encounter someone like you, i appreciate the reminder of what extraordinary examples of human spirit we see in the armed forces of the united states: the bravery of the men and women who defend freedom the world over, the honor of the persons who fight for basic human rights for every individual, the dedication required for these people to spend a career in a job with sub-par pay to uphold the freedoms for which you show so little appreciation, and the strength of character it takes to do all of this so that even malcontent, uninformed fools may enjoy the rights that the military makes possible.<br>
<br>
my sincerest appreciation and deepest respect goes out to every man and woman who wears a uniform to serve the american people.<br>
<br>
and thank you, molt, for the reminder of just how valuable those people are.<br>

In the fall when I start looking into going to college are all of them full of the liberal bull shit? I mean come on without our military we would be living under a comunist government without ANY rights. Know that right you have to bitch about the military and all? The Military is what is protecting that right. Sometimes rants like this make me sick.
