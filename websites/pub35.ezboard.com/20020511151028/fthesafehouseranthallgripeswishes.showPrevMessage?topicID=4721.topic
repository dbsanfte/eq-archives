valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> To Law Enforcement</span><hr size=1> No doubt, tons of law enforcement will read this. Well, good.<br>I have something to say to you in general. You do a lot of good things, you catch murders, you help people in need, you<br>report on things like acciedents, you stop people for screwing other people through theft ect...Thanks.<br><br>But you also infringe on people's sense of security. Some of you go about your day waiting, and waiting for that one person you can stick it too. Yeah, its the law, thats fing terrific, stop and get into a civilian's shoes. How would you feel if you were doing something that everyone else in the city does, that by and large effects only the individual, and some guy who has nothing better to do than drive around waiting to screw people stops you. <br><br>Yeah, it's the law, but how often are we subjected to laws that are total BS. You as a law enforcement officer have a choice. Up hold the law to the T, or uphold the law to the fair. Yeah, you know what I mean. You can write that ticket for a front license plate, even though you cant put one on the car. You can ticket someone for an expired driver's license, even though it hasnt been expired very long. You can do all these things cause it's the LAW. But why do you.<br><br>You have the power to let someone know they are doing wrong, and to give them the chance to change it. Blah blah blah, it's the law you should know it, WHATEVER. You pull anyone over and 9 times out of 10 you will, and do, scare the hell out of them so bad that they change their ways. <br><br>Everyday law enforcement officers stop people, and make a decision whether or not to bend them over. <br><br>I'm writing this in the hopes that if you are a cop, and you read it, you think REAL hard next time about the precious letter of the law, and ask yourself if it is really worth screwing over another human being. Ask yourself if you are doing more good by letting someone know the f'd up, or by throwing the book at someone. If cops ever wonder why people dont like them so much, it's not because you are the guys that show us we are doing wrong, it's because law enforcement has taught us to be AFRAID of you.<br>We've been taught to see you guys as the individuals who are out to GET YOU. Well, next time you pull someone over, try NOT doing that. Try reminding people that yes, you are there to enforce the law, but you are fair. Dont screw someone over because it's the LAW, screw them over because they deserve it. <br><br>I hate cops, I wont deny. But I hate them because of the way I have been treated, and the way they treat their responsbilities, not because of what their responsibilities are. So please, next time you pull someone over, put yourselves in their shoes, imagine yourself, trying to live your life, and how it would feel when someone puts their foot down on your nuts and tells you you are wrong. Think real hard. <p>Nenjin Darkeyes<BR>55th lvl Blackguard of One Hundred Swords<BR>Xegony<BR>"Dont open your eyes, you wont like what you see.

I (28) don't mind police, in fact, I think it's GOOD when they do their job of making sure that folks on the road are driving safely.  I'm a good driver, it's the other folks on the road I have to watch out for, and it's the police that make my life a little bit safer by pulling over the folks that are speeding, have lights out, don't signal, etc.<br><br>Every time I've been pulled over I know exactly what the reason for the officer's pulling me over was for...and I have always been in the wrong when they did so.   <br><br>I've gotten off twice out of about five times that I've been caught (got off on running red light (in Raritan, NJ no less, where they live to hit you with traffic violations), riding shoulder to get to exit while in traffic...have gotten nailed on all 3 speeding violations).  <br><br>Maybe it's I don't do the typical female thing of pouting and crying (and if that's true, maybe I'd better start). I just pull over, have my license, registration, and insurance in hand.  As soon as the officer reaches my rolled down window, I hand him the paperwork, he goes back to the car, runs my info, and writes my ticket.<br><br>It's a little game I play called "Let's see if I don't get caught this time"... last speeding ticket I got was 69 in a 55... I was actually doing 78, but the cop was nice...plus I'd been going about 105 about 10 miles back ;)<br><br>But don't give them grief if they've pulled you over for a bad taillight, and notice that your license is expired, even if it's only yesterday.  How are they to know that you are actually on your way to the DMV right at that moment to renew it?  Besides, it is your responsibility to renew it before it expires.<br><br>Why don't you be fair to them and follow the law and not give them any excuse to pull you over and bust your unmentionables?<br><br> <p><center><P><font color="red"><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=39448><b>Delissandra Splitshadow, Wielder of the Rapier Wit</a></b><br><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=51508><b>Aileena Brellious, Kegmistress of Brell</a></b><br><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=114103><b>Yinka Din`Kadoo</a></b><br><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=117581><b>Arzza Mojomama</a></b><br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ualdarionshard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aldarion Shard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/1/02 2:24:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4731.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> amen</span><hr size=1> a-Fing-men.<br><br>my brother just became a cop... i havent spoken to him since.<br><br>cops do good things.  they (occasionally) catch rapists and murderers.  they (EVERY SINGLE @#%$ DAY) caus financial, personal, and professional ruin for people for such society-wrecking errors as:<br><br>jaywalking(hello, actually enforced in LA)<br>smoking a joint (umm who was hurt)<br>being behind on DMV paperwork<br>having empty beer cans in the car on the way to the recycling center (cost an ex-girlfriend over 500$ in fines, thanks NJ)<br><br>... cops are slime.<br><br>ya know, serial killers do as much good as cops... they occassionally kill people who deserved to die.  but ya dont see THEM gettina  discount on housing, insurance, travel, and food like cops, now do ya? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/1/02 2:27:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4731.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Law Enforcement</span><hr size=1> I've been into it with Law Enforcement since I was 15. I've seen, and dealt, with more cops in my life time than most people do in their, and I'm not even 21 yet. I've always acted my part, because I've never been stopped for something that wasnt my fault. And I've got to tell you, I've been through more sh*t because of my looks and my age than is fair. I've been deemed a criminal at first glance, and treated like so. To date, I've met 2 police officers I respect, and one of them is a relative. Why? Because they actually treated me like a person. They thought about my life, and what the impact of what they are doing. They have _compassion_. Maybe thats something that doesnt get you a job with the police, compassion, but that is one of the defining traits in regular civilians that makes you a decent person. <p>Nenjin Darkeyes<BR>55th lvl Blackguard of One Hundred Swords<BR>Xegony<BR>"Dont open your eyes, you wont like what you see.

If its serious enough of a law to get you seriously upset, I'm sure there are others who may disagree with it. there are methods to change what laws are on the books, etc.<br><br>It is really irrational to be mad at the cops, when they are doing what they are paid to do.

But what can you do? Like I am going to be able to change the multitude of stupid laws that provide money for the state. I was &quot;breaking&quot;, I know I stated that from the outset. Lets take a good example. Pot. 90 percent of this country smokes, uses it, and sells it like it's a cash crop. I have no doubt 20 percent of every police force in town smokes it. The vast majority of the country considers it like alcohol. <br>So some cop pulls you over. He finds the most miniscule, infentesimial roach in your ash tray. It isnt even enough to give a new born a body buzz. What does that cop do? He cites you for possesion under 1 oz, when in all actuality, it's possesion under 1 GRAM. Then, just to be a dick, he gives you paraphenalia, for the PAPERS its rolled in.<br><br>This is what I am pissed about. That cop could stop, look at that kid/person whatever, and say, Man, it's so small, I am just going to take it, send him on his way, and tell him the next time I pull him over, I will triple check for drugs. <br><br>Yeah yeah, he could be drug runner, but you can still search his car. Hell, having your car searched is enough to make most people this day and age crap their pants. You can confiscate whatever you find, but why turn them in? Why put them through that kind of hell? Why make them shell out that amount of money. <br><br>Duh, the law is the law. That doesnt mean it is right, fair, or JUST. Remember that word? Justice? Wheres the fing justice in today's law enforcement? Oh, getting money for the state is justice. Punishing people for something that is as common as road dust is justice. Being an @#%$, thats justice. <br>I dont expect cops to change the law. I ask that they remember the law is stupid in many many many places, and to make a personal decision whether to uphold that stupidity, or to make a life long believer in the goodness of law by having compassion. <p>Nenjin Darkeyes<BR>55th lvl Blackguard of One Hundred Swords<BR>Xegony<BR>"Dont open your eyes, you wont like what you see.
