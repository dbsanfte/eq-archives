Last night I had the most fun yet with this game.  It's completely recharged my desire to play.....  And It was all in Battleground 1.<br><br>I log on about 7pm (all times CST) with my nightshade and decide to run him up to Thid to take out some work frustrations on some infs.  I get there and the and we still hold the Center keep.  and we've had it for 4 or 5 days now.  very odd for my server (Galahad).<br><br>I'm running up the hill and get to the door only to find the Albions in the midst of a seige.  I die while zoning in, and get a rez.  Being not much use with my nightshade in this situation, I decide to get my ranger and pick on some casters from distance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That was fun, but there were too many of them... About 30 albs in total were at our front doorstep.  We had about 15 to 20 defenders.  It's a stalemate for roughly an hour when all of the sudden they have a RAM. oh shoot.  They get through both doors and we all flee to the throneroom.  Shortly before the doors fell I logged back to my shade.  We fought so hard and held the albs on the stairs for about 45 minutes. I kept running down the stairs and take someone out then run back up for a heal, rinse and repeate.   Finally I log off my Shade and log on my druid who is in Tnn and and armor crafter and buy some wood and start running that up to grab a port.  I make it into the keep with the wood, hand it to someone, and log my ranger back on.  Take the wood down and with another couple people also working on the doors. We got them closed again at about 11:45.  The albs didn't get the fort!   It was such an incredible time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    And we still hold it this morning.    <br><br>Just had to share.  cheers.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=servo>Servo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/02 11:14:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3625.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The most fun I've had yet in DAoC.</span><hr size=1> wewt, gratz..

The fun stopped for me when I became a mid 30's chump, too weak for the frontier and far far from it. The BG is cool and all, but can only satisfy so much, especially when there's a sick imbalance of realm numbers. Yep- levelling is unthinkably boring. Basically, the work outweighs the rewards in DAoC as there is very little to look forward to. ********oops tangent alert!
