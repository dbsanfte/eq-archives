It's great, isn't it? Well, use the console commands and load a level, move to a rather open area that isn't taking too much power (large simple rooms, like a hangar or so) and spawn 30+ enemies at once, e.g. Reborns.<br><br>On my 1200 Thunderbird with 768 RAM and a GeForce2 GTS with 64 MB I usually have got between 30-45 FPS when playing JK2... only dropping as low as 20-25 in Yavin Swamp. I am running on 1024x768 with all graphic settings set to maximum.<br><br>When doing the &quot;test&quot; I just described, my framerate drops to about 5-7 FPS... the engine just can't deal with more than 15-20 models at once.

If the majority of players are in a cluster it stutters down to 1-5fps for around 2 seconds.<br><br>Anaylasis =&gt; EQ is poorly writen.  It's not about poly count, or textures.  It's about too much being synced with the GUI (typing lag) and a Graphics Engine that needs about 3 more months of streamlining and beta testing to be where it was supposed to be when Kunark came out.<br><br>I think that pushing the 2D overlays throuh the 3d pipe (which I have heard they do) probaly slows down the inventoy keys, the life/mana/stamia bars and the hot keys more then is really nessary.<br><br>I know most of the people who play EQ are blubies, so you don't witness what it means to be in a PvP enviroment that often.  In a game like RTCW you get up dates on how players are moving fairly cosistantly, even the direction they are looking.  In EQ it seems that that information is updated about every 2 seconds or so in certain situations.  <br><br>There is a process called Z-bugging; to z-bug all a player needs to do is run up something to change there position on the vertical axis, and then change the direction they are running.  The charcter will track on the other players screen in the origional direction for a few seconds.  There are several people who are very proficient in using this exploit.  I watched a friend fight a cleric, and she jousted him, and used the Z-bug to get behind cover to cast.  Very efficent, and completly impossible to counter.  This is another problem with the engine.<br><br>Want more?<br><br>I am not asking that Sigil Games come up with something ground breaking over all.  Just something that brings MMRPG's up to the Techinical Sofistication of other gaming genere.  I would love to see Sigil be ground breaking though.  A game with out Absor?

I remember vividly how when I was 11 I thought saying the F-word made me sound more intelligent... I remember at 13 thinking that everyone was a moron but me... and I remember at 15 thinking that I was actually being clever by arguing a point by making fun of my opponent's gramatical errors.  Yep, that was nearly 20 years ago... but I can't get angry today when the next generation throws it back at me.  Trust me guys, at around 21 or 22 you'll realize you're not as smart as you think you are....hehe.<br><br>Anyway....<br><br>Number of players in zone is not a factor of how fast it renders.  I could probably produce a game with 30,000 simultaneous users all within 3 inches of each other... if they can all have one texture and be 6 polygons.  It's also quite feasable to create a single sphere that would guarantee that your 2gig processor only renders one frame every few hours.  It's not the number of objects... it's what they're made of.<br><br>SOL added TONS of textures and TONS of geometry to the characters.  It added it to an engine that was built... lets count friends... 6 years ago.  It's slow not because the programmers are morons... but because there's just a great deal to do.  The EQ engine was pretty darn cutting edge when it was written, and the task of revamping it last year was one that less than a dozen programmers in the world could have tackled.  That's not an exageration.  Imagine trying to make a formula race car out of a 1964 VW bug.  Again not insulting the original engine, but 6 years in computer technology is equivalent to 60 years in real life.<br><br>As far as the moving 2D into 3D... it doesn't slow things down.  Quite the opposite.  But your theory is well written... and I admire people who try and figure how things work (though turning suppositions and conjecture into factual statements is a stretch...)<br><br>The graphics engine is not sync'd to the GUI.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  The GUI lag is caused BY the video lag... not the other way around.  That should be fixed in the new UI [ coming SOON(tm) ].<br><br>As far as positional updates, they're nearly instant... AS FAR as the client/server is concerned.  Remember of course that you're on the internet... a lost packet or a lag spike or some crazy HatForPets.com router error can ruin your whole game.<br><br>The issue with positional updates along the Z border has to do with an optimization that was done quite a long time ago.  In recent history, the code was changed to nearly ignore the Z-buffer as far as position updates, and if that doesn't fix the issue I believe the Z check can go away entirely... so enjoy that &quot;bug&quot; while ya can...hehe.<br><br>Oh and your insult of Absor... jeez man.  Ever meet the guy?  One of the nicest fellows you'll ever meet.  Works his poor arse off to TRY and help the players.  Yeah, it's his job, but imagine if you did 4 or 5 times what your job required of you just because you wanted to.  So he doesn't know everything about EQ?  Well, maybe he WOULD if he played as many hours a day as a combined 30,000 players... but instead he reads messages like a madman and posts what he feels is helpful when he feels it should be posted.  Is he perfect?  No.  Does that make him a moron?  No... <br><br>... unless, like I said earlier, you're of a certain mental age.  Then have at it.<br><br>The people on the EQ team can't say it... but I can now.  The EQ team is some of the nicest most talented people you'll ever meet.  Yeah, they make mistakes... but they work damn hard at a job where they're accused daily of the most idiotic things from people who spend more time playing their product than they do practically every other activity in their daily life.<br><br>Heck I'll probably get a friendly email asking me not to post here anymore...hehe... but admittedly I'm a little bit defensive about the old team.<br><br>Gebron the Demented<br>original Keeper of the Faith,<br>former EverQuest code monkey and still a fan of the game<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2865.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2865.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showNextMessage?topicID=2865.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2865.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2865.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2865.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2865.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2865.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
