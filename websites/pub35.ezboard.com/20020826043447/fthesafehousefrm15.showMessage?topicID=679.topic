Overall, I'd say shamans are between so-so/alright PK'rs-- mainly due to the fact that the majority of their spells are so damn easy to resist.  Most spells you'd use in PvP are in themselves very very good.... just doesn't mean anything when you can't stick on anyone... However, you're one of the best in PK groups-- you can heal, melee buffs, SoW, resist buffs, enemy debuffs, DOT'S ( if you can stick them), etc etc.. <br>     By the way, I highly suggest keeping your defensive and offensive skills maxx'd.   I can really pay off when you're fighting a weak caster class : I've put a beat down on plenty of even wizards/chanters etc etc just using melee.   Things get better at 34 because you get a pet... an answer to opponents with high resists <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   .  And one more thing.... the one spell in your arsenal that's hard to resist ( save your level 60 Malo) is your Insidious Decay line of spells.  They check magic resistance, but however you'll probably more likely to land that on someone with a MR of 100 than landing Malisement if he has a DR of 40 ( from my experience)-- the spell lowers their disease resistance by quite a bit, allowing you to both stick some nasty disease DOT's on and making it more likely to stick Malisement ( which checks disease resistance) -- and if you do stick it, you've just made your opponent a caster magnet ( all resists down by at least 25, more if you're higher level) There's a lot to playing a shaman PvP, and I'll let someone else who can explain it easier do it.... this is just 30 second recap of what came to me soonest.<br>    Hmm... well, in retrospect, shamans are better PK's than ''so-so/alright''.... they have almost all practical utility spells, a lethal array of offensive spells ( but, of course, you're lucky to land them on people that are 35+), and one of the best defensive classes.  In other words, you can solo PK well if you're opponents are stupid and/or have bad resists, but you make an awesome group PK'r with just about everyone.<br>  Disclaimer -- my shaman played is only level 37, so I've only had experiences up to that point.<br><br>      <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lucasv>Lucas V</A> at: 5/28/02 3:16:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/02 8:02:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=679.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shamans and Pvp?</span><hr size=1> They get alot better when they get a dog. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/02 6:14:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=679.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shamans and Pvp?</span><hr size=1> Better when they get some of those high 50s-60 spells...<br><br>Malo neg 68(pvp) to fire cold magic poison, unresistable. <br>5 sec cast w/o focus.<br><br>Malosini neg 90 (pvp) to the same saves.

VERY seldom do shaman have pets up even when looking for pvp. Pets are a liability not an asset. Besides, there are ways to get around even a pet. Add in the fact that you can camp golemwands and buy counteract potions with a 2sec cast time. 2secs being low enough to drink without interuptions.<br><br>Not saying its easy to pvp a shaman, after all he can always run away, but you shouldnt die to one either.

Against a lvl60 melee, which is what i am discussing, the pet will never do enough damage to even overcome your standing regeneration. He might once in a while get in a bash or a hit for 1-10dmg. Not something you rely on. My pet has a bit less than 1000hp. A lvl60 melee will hit for close to max damage on every hit versus a lvl39 pet. Warrior friend of mine killed a shaman pet in 3 melee rounds last i saw. Well spent 650mana. Add in the fact that any zone with mobs of lvl30 or higher might mean my pet training me. Add the fact that zoning kills my pet.<br><br>If im looking to interupt a melee i have a bigger chance doing it myself with melee.<br><br>Pox has three resist checks because of 1) the dd component 2) the dot component and 3) the disease counter component. This makes it one of THE most resisted spells in the game. Pox is resisted about 50% of the time at 50ish disease resist, with resists at 10dr are not uncommon.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  If they stop to try to remove the diseases malo them and try to stick bane of nife for added fun.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>See above. Add golemwands/eggshaped. Malo is useless except versus people who are not geared for pvp. Such people i dont even need to use spells to kill.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2 seconds is NOT short enough when a single hit for 1 dmg interupts.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>At 1100ac+, which is pretty easy to reach for a lvl60 pure melee, my pet will hardly connect at all. I will connect maybe once every third swing. That works for interuptions, assuming im within melee range. Which i am not. I am going to try to stay the hell away from a melee as much as i can. 2seconds IS short enough time to drink a potion as it takes me more time than that to close up to you from max spell range.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Don't cry to me about how inconvenient a pet is. If you need to summon one near where your going to fight. If you don't have one up and get jumped too bad your own fault.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br><br>Have you ever played a shaman Aerimus? Have you ever played a pet class for that matter? Pets get the owner killed in pvp. Zoning owns even the nasty epic mage pet. Pets are completely useless in pvp unless you catch an unsowed class in the middle of west karana, and even then the shaman pet can be killed in a matter of seconds.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  I think the survivability of high end shaman is quite good. Especially with nice hp/ac chain gear.<br><br>Sowboots make it impossible to remove sow outdoors.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br><br>I totally agree. AC/hp and my 'Jack of all trades' spell setup is what makes me durable in pvp. Sowboots are clearly unbalanced and need nerfing, just like every other instacast item. I am very good at playing it defensive. But i have no halfway reliabe way of killing anyone with decent resists, the pvp gear and half a clue.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Runspeed does the same</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Every class gets this.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Sowboots + any other insta item makes it impossible to debuff by normal means.<br><br>If they dont' have golem wands simply burying your ds and healing via torpor and chloroblast will end a rogue.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>True. I always carry ds potions, but i never really use them. Killing a rogue using ds is not a kill in my opinion. Coldain ring is the bane of all pvp rogues. It should be given a cast time of at least 2 seconds. I sympathize with you on this. However, despite being started on the rogue boards, this post was not solely a shaman vs rogue thread.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Unresistable debuffs make it MUCH more viable to land dots</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>A little, but when your opposition has 150 unbuffed pr/dr it doesnt make any difference. Wasting 1/10 of my manapool on malo and then a further 1/10 on bane only to get resisted or have malo dispelled is not a winning strategy. Even should i land bane or pox, the melee can easily loose me in the terrain just like i can loose him (which you are very well aware of Aerimus since its one of your pet pevees(sp)) and then regen up. <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Pets make it impossible to use pumice or any non insta item.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Then you are lacking the items to take care of the pet. See above on my pets dmg output versus a pure melee.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  You should almost never be interupted without a bash especially with focus items.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>All shaman spells are notorious for their long cast time. I dont have a single offensive spell with cast time under 5 seconds, excepting insid decay which doesnt 'do' anything on its own. You would be surprised how often i am interupted. Max channeling, and heavily leaning towards spell casting channeling aaxp ability and getting Griegs boots with +10% channeling solely for pvp purposes.<br><br>As an example, i was pvping in Neriak yesterday. Two naked darkelf warriors (so no slam/bash) that were on LnS were playing around at zoneline and kept punching me while i was battling two fully geared people. I kept getting interupted by these punches.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Torpor and chloroblast can keep you alive a LONG time.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Chloroblast is not worth casting versus a pure melee if he is still onto me. A pure melee does more dps during the time it takes me to cast it than what it heals for. Torpor just barely keeps up with pure melee dps if i continuously jump around and the melee has a crappy connection. Remember torpor halves my movement speed. Torpor is also 6sec cast. That is a long time. Not whining about this since i have aaxp skills that can reduce it to 3.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  With insidioud decay followed by insidious malady if neccesary You can debuff dr by 90 (yes I know they don't stack I mean using the unresistable one to get dr low enough for the resistable one)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>In theory this sounds good, but insid malady has a +25dr modifier, making it a catch 22. If i cant land pox after insid decay then i sure as hell wont land insid malady either.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  With pox you have a formidable disease dot.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Pox does roughly 1380dmg pvp, which comes out at a bit less than 13dps. Formidable, yes in the long run. But in pvp versus a pure melee there never is a long run. Either you kill me pretty damn quick while i try to channel a heal or you get away and cure/heal up. Theres no way i can find you if you decide to break away, unless i catch you in the middle of west karana like previously mentioned.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Yes your dds suck duh. You don't really need them.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>You underestimate the power of the bracer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  With malo on and especially if a pet is keeping them from pumicing you may well be able to land spells like blind/root or at least slow. The last now cannot be removed without cure disease now /rude vi.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Root and blind stick less than half the times after malo AND tashstick proc. This is why my primary pvp stat is dex. Having jousted melees for 20minutes waiting for the proc, ive realized that i might as well skip the proc and just bring out a big 2hander and melee kill them instead. Which in my mind is only proof that melee &gt; caster.<br><br>Ok this pet thing keeps coming up. Maybe you pvp in completely different zones than me. Pets are dangerous to me. For a while i carried a backpack of instainvis potions to instantly kill my pet, but i quickly ran out of these and Dogdog got annoyed at being killed after 10 seconds in every pvp fight so i just stopped using him.<br><br>I know for a fact that either i go looking for pvp in which case pets are useless since travelling means zoning, and if i find someone to kill they will see be aware of me if i stop to cast/buff up a pet and med up again. If i get jumped in pvp i wont have a pet up either. Only time i ever have a pet up is if im soloing, in which case you will find me low on mana and in pve gear meaning im a free kill unless i manage to zone faster than zippydo.<br><br><br>As you know, much of the joy in pvp is being able to best someone who you know is skilled and has good gear/utilities. Ganking someone 8 levels lower without a clue makes me feel sick.<br><br>Looking at high end pvp opposition all my pvp options become a dead end. Even my most well thought out pvp strategy and combination of spells is countered by a single click of an item or disc. I often check on gear updates to find new pvp toys that when combined with my spell arsenal would give me an added edge. <br><br>Despite all the pvp luggage i carry around, I have no way of killing people fast. With fast being under 10 minutes. Its a battle of my manapool versus insane resists/resist rates and clicky items. A battle that is very seldom won by my manapool. You have dozens of chances of disengaging from pvp versus a shaman to lick your wounds and come back better prepared. Death by shaman pvp never comes fast a'la 'what the bloody hell just hit me' style.<br><br>Like i mentioned in earlier posts, dying to a shaman in pvp means you either have really bad resists (dr/pr, and in pvp versus a shaman with malo also mr) or you dont know when to run for it to recoup.<br><br>So, to sum up, when both parties have a clue and are modestly well geared,  melees &gt; shaman in pvp. Hybrids i wont even go into, you know the situation there.<br><br>Sorry if this sounds like a whine, thats not what i want it to sound like. Im perhaps a bit pessimistic, or rather disillusioned. But ive always enjoyed playing the underdog so i'll get by.<br><br>ps. The implementation of new 'focus items' may shift this balance. However, unless there is an item that affects resist rates, shaman pvp will not change much.<br><br>edit:fixed my bolds <p>--------------------<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16197> Asta Khaan</a><BR><a href=http://www.defiantvz.com> Defiant</a> Shaman, VZ</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uastakhaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AstaKhaan</A> at: 6/5/02 4:20:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uastakhaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AstaKhaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 4:59:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=679.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Asta/fullsize/swedchef.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shamans and Pvp?</span><hr size=1> I just saw the patch message.<br><br>4 sec cast time on golemwands.<br>3 sec cast time on egg shaped pumice.<br><br><br>I hope they implement cast times on all instacast items or this patch is seriously going to rework how the pvp game (doesnt) work. <br><br>If this is the only pvp change that they implement in the near future half my arguments in the earlier post are void and should be disregarded.<br><br>Going to blow to be a rogue going up against a druid or mage with a 60ds+ buried under instacast items.
