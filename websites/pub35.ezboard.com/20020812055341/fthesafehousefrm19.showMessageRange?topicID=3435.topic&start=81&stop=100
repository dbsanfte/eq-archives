<br>
Mill, you have ignored all of my questions despite claiming the above for everyone else.  Please take the time to answer them.  This main one is my problem once again.  You say <br>
<br>
This is the way it always was and that nothing has changed yet you also claim in the same thread that your damage has been HALFED.  Please explain.<br>
<br>
You show a log (first one) where you do equal damage to an Infil and you show a log where the infil gets the jump on you and does more.  You once again have stated in the same thread that your damage has been reduced by 50%.  Please explain to me how you still say that <br>
<br>
1. Things have always been this way.<br>
2. SB’s were never overpowered.<br>
3. Two fights are indicative of <br>
<br>
<br>
Also with openings like these <br>
<br>
Infiltrators are unbeatable, check this log out. <br>
<br>
If anything, this will show the disgusting damage a slash infiltrator can do. <br>
<br>
You are asking for some flames, not that I support the flames but they are to be expected.  <br>
<br>
Xumten, you are saying that an Infil wiped out a whole group in normal combat, not one at a time?  No offence but Mill can show us logs where he is round about equal to an infil.  You are telling us that a single infil can take on a whole group without problem?<br>
<br>
“This was a &quot;bust up in the middle of the group and drop everyone in one fell swoop&quot; thing. And like I said(which apparently you didnt comprehend) this wasnt a one time thing. He does this all day.”<br>
<br>
Was he dressed up as Batman?  Rofl.  That was a JOKE.<br>
<br>
Seriously though you are saying a single lvl 50 infil took out 48 Thane, 49 Shaman, 44 Warrior, 40 Healer, and 38 Skald and he does this all day long without re-stealthing???????  I will repeat what I said, you guys are doing something seriously wrong or this guys is cheating (which I doubt).  This is not meant as a flame in any way but I cannot understand how this can happen when everyone else, is saying that if at all Infils are only slightly better at melee.  <br>
<br>
Don’t take this as the word of an infil who is ‘apparently’ biased.  Look elsewhere, does anyone else see a problem with this?  Someone please explain if they are having the same problems as Xumten or they think that this is kinda offbeat.<br>
<br>
Baiul.<br>

<br>
 what questions havent I answered? I posted logs of pre 1.50 damage a while back, when I was level 43, I now do less damage at level 50, and posted logs as well.<br>
<br>
You really think damage is comparable with an infiltrator? Honestly? Then you need to reread this one and my other log post.<br>
<br>
I ran about 4 fights worth of logs through a parser and got these numbers.<br>
<br>
penetration average damage to me per hit.<br>
<br>
209.8<br>
<br>
My average damage per hit to him,<br>
<br>
121.2<br>
<br>
<br>
yes I swing off hand more, but still.<br>
<br>
ask me a quesiton, I will cerainly answer. I may miss questions hrough all the mill bashing posts.<br>

I DO NOT HAVE THE SPEC POINTS TO USE ENVENOM, ONLY INFILTRATORS CAN USE IT AND STILL KEEP THE SAME MELEE/CS SPECS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

Sorry for caps, but I have stated this dozens of times and people keep saying the same stupid thing. One of my points is, they can out melee me, AND use envenom, without sacrificing any critical skill lines. Jeez.<br>
<br>
Want me to use envenom? then give me 453 spec points extra.<br>

Can this please, pretty please be the last time somone uses the envenom excuse?<br>

As for the Mill bashing, yeah some people really need to calm down.  But you need to look at this from both sides too though.<br>
<br>
For damage being equal yes in the first fight I think the damage was equal.  In the second fight he clearly had the jump on you and pulled off more styles.  If however you are saying that with your damage doubled, this was equal then once again I have to respectfully disagree.   <br>
<br>
You say this is the way it always was and that nothing has changed yet you also claim in the same thread that your damage has been HALFED. Please explain.<br>

Here is a L50 Inf's disgusting damage against a L50 SB.  I'm taking the heaviest hit in his log here, which may or may not include a critical damage add.  <br>

<br>
Based upon this &quot;evidence&quot; Mill believes that the LA nerf should be removed so that he can be returned to his old non-disgusting pre1.50 damage.<br>
<br>
Here is Mill's non-disgusting damage against a L50 archer as a L43 SB<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I used to hit, at level 43, a level 50 archer like this: <br>

Hey, 295 on that high hit there.  Not too shabby for a L43 against a L50... with minuses too, wow!  That is more than the L50 infiltrator's disgusting hit against a L50 SB. <br>
<br>

<br>
370... against an orange con assassin at L43.  Well, that is not disgusting.  Not nearly disgusting as Penetrator's 277 hit against an even con assassin at L50 anyway.<br>

Of course we would have to see Penetrator's logs to know if he had a critical damage add and we also need to know if Penetrator is buffed or not.  I'll assume for now that Penetrator is buffed in those logs until convinced otherwise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushadowerbdc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowerBDC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/3/02 9:52:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mill</span><hr size=1> RaggokTP,<br>

For the millionth time.<br>
<br>
YOU CAN'T USE LOGS WHERE YOU ARE BUFFED OR DEBUFFED TO DO AN ACCURATE DAMAGE COMPARISON.<br>
<br>
It is unbelievable to me that you would try to pass off logs where either you are buffed or debuffed as some kind of scientific evidence for your claim.<br>
<br>
So in your grand scheme of balancing things we just need to automatically assume that the SB <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be debuffed while the opposing assassin will not be because.. hey <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   ALL</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> infiltrators have envenom and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   NONE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the SBs do!<br>
<br>
Quite frankly Mill, you are a joke.  You are not interested in class balance at all.  You are just interested in yourself.<br>

It is evident in every GD post you make. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uraggoktp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaggokTP</A> at: 6/3/02 10:06:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/3/02 10:34:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mill</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Seriously though you are saying a single lvl 50 infil took out 48 Thane, 49 Shaman, 44 Warrior, 40 Healer, and 38 Skald and he does this all day long without re-stealthing??????? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Here is what I saw that he did in the scenario I described. This was in DF. Again, as I said this guy is good, so Im not saying any Infil can get away with this. I personally, as an assassin was very impressed, but I also was concerned.<br>
<br>
So here is what happened... he kills the Skald and runs off. He obviously knows DF well, because he avoids all aggro. Skald is ressed. Then he basically harasses the group with his cross bow. Shooting from some stairs and running off. <br>
<br>
Im stealthing around trying to watch this guy so I can see how he does it. Im thinking hes just gonna harrass these guys. <br>
<br>
Shaman runs up the stairs where he was shooting from. He attacks the shaman... shaman is dead in a matter of seconds. Does he run away? Nope... he runs right thru the tanks(who are swinging at him and casting) and makes a beeline for the healer.... vanish... PA-CD healer dead... runs off and stealths. So now you got a 48 Thane, 44 Warrior and 38 Skald left. 1 or 2 mins later... with all 3 right next to each other he drops the thane, warrior, and skald without restealthing. Takes all 3 of them on at once. <br>
<br>
Now I have always felt my role as an assassin was to take out solo targets. I've never even considered looking at 3-5 people and saying &quot;Yeah, I can take them.&quot; But thats just me. <br>
<br>
And if you feel &quot;Hey an assassin should be able to do that.&quot; then thats your opinion. I dont share that opinion.<br>
<br>
His name was all over the death spam this weekend in DF. When speaking to the healer that died, she said that was the 5th time he had killed her right in the middle of her groups. It had actually been awhile since I had logged on to Guin, and quite honestly I had never heard of him until then, but speaking with many Mids that day, they were all too familiar with his ways in DF. <br>
<br>
And like I said in my original post. I have no idea what its like to be lvl 50. Maybe any lvl 50 can get away with that. I dunno.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A> at: 6/3/02 10:40:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulandril77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Landril77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/3/02 1:14:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3435.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Xumpten</span><hr size=1> 2 skalds and a healer and not one bothered to snare/stun/mez him?

<br>
Unfortuneately, many of my kills are due to poison, 1/10 of a second after I die. 8-p<br>
<br>
If I target a healer that is away from his group, even what many non-assasins consider a short distance, I kill them 8/10 times.  About the same as with group.  Thier survival depends heavily on what THEY do. Mez, Stun, Instant, etc.  However, I survive these attacks more often than not.  More distance is required for a skald group. (65% Survival)<br>
<br>
If I target the same healer, and he's well guarded, but I have a group nearby for support.  Again the healer dies 8/10 times. However even tho I'm often beat to a pulp, the added heals and or offensive support or Crowd Control Up my survivability to about even. (50% survival)<br>
<br>
Now note, the last 3 kills were essentially GREEN con. There's no reason a level 50 assassin can't take out 3 greens, the first green is gonna be a oneshot that really only leaves two to fight.the first target was an even con, I'd be lucky to survive (20%) unless I got him off from his group, then I would survive more often than not (65%).  The second attack was on either a low yellow or high blue. Survival would be between 20% and 50% due to blue con.  And the Third attack, against greens would be be about 80%.  So Survivability for this scenario is 65% * 35% *80% = 18% or say 1 in 5.<br>
<br>
Most assasins (and players in general) I know do you take on missions they know they can't succeed at. I on the otherhand Thrive on missions where survival is almost impossible.  In the end, I die as often as I kill, but when I pull off one of those impossible kills and live, nothing is better.  I'll take on that group of 5 every time, Sure It might take all day to successfully take them all down, but sooner or later, they are gonna mess up and I'm gonna live and have a tale to tell.<br>

Why the hell cant you use buffed people for logs? this is how we really fight, me, and him, buffed. Logging unbuffed would be me getting three hit and not hurting him at all. Pretty stupid actually.<br>
<br>
Why dont I log fights without armor as well? Using only one weapon?<br>
<br>
The most accurate representation of a fight is the actual fight, is it not?<br>
<br>
<br>
5 round fight, just the envenom is doing what, 350 poison damage and how much for the enervate? plus I am getting out meleed by a substantial margin, hmmm, lets see here, oh he perfs harder as well. So now I am supposed to drop CS line totally for envenom, then not be able to kill mages, and any medium target cause no perf/cd? Why is this fair?<br>
<br>
Am I missing something? this does not require a PHD folks.<br>
<br>
Hell, Elaa posts NS tests that show a NS out damages a SB, when is enough proof gonna be enough?<br>
<br>
If I will be a melee gimp, then at least give me 1000 extra spec points, to make up for left axe deficiency, and no envenom, fair right?<br>
<br>
And ya, I had some silly strong hits at 43. I did have 20% relic bonus for a brief period, may or not have been there. All I am saying, and sent those logs and new logs to Sanya per her request, is that 7 levels and better gear, and better buffs, and I hit for less then I did at 43, less then infiltrators, and I have no envenom, for what.<br>
<br>
I think, that if infiltrators, and NS have a better inherant duel wield skill, then SB's should have something to compensate, how can anyone disagree here? two handers? bah, two handers suck for fighting fast hitting people. Basically, most people here think SB should have the lowest melee damage of all the assasins, because they get a whopping 50 hps extra, is odd.<br>

Yeah, 35-40 after being debuffed with enervating poison.  LOL, you still don't think that is a significant fact...<br>
<br>
Also, what is the DPS/delay on your offhand weapon.  What is the DPS/delay on his offhand weapon.<br>
<br>
These kinds of things can't be ignored.<br>
<br>
Also note that Penetration's delay seems to be around 3 seconds, while yours is closer to 2 seconds.<br>

That can't be ignored either.<br>

1. I saw the logs...it doesn't seem that Penetration is really doing tons more damage per hit...Could the str/con debuff account for that much damage variance?<br>
<br>
2. All of this has been about Sb's and left axe. Are the Critblades that ignore leftaxe (and raise envenom) having the same kind of problems?<br>
<br>
I remember when they made the change to DW where it raised chance to swing both weapons based on level. DW styles have always sucked IMO and still suck. While the skill was made more effective (as a passive skill), people that had spec'd DW still suffered more then those that didn't. It almost seems to me that this is what has happened to the SB's. Most inf's have the same basic template...while SB's have 3 distinctly different ones.... just a thought.<br>

You also have to understand that Penetration is a specific case. Not all people play this game with buffs all the time. What happens when you come across a non-buffed slash inf. while your buffed? Like many people have posted up to now using buffs as an acuurate means of gauging a players effectiveness skews dynamics drastically. Last time I checked Penetration is in a nice guild with high lvl players with access to very nice gear and weps. I would say only a very small albeit percentage of the players on the server have access too. So not for nothing I would guess she has better gear than you.<br>
<br>
Since you seem to have affection for Penetration you should set up some non-buffed duels. Problem is even duels can be skewed as well unless you guys both just stand in front of each other w/o perfs and just swing away. Dueling with assassins is never a great measure since its hard to reliably gauge what the effect of a perf will have, so you end up having straight melee between classes, which in certain cases people have built templates around that perf. Still it would be interesting to see straight unbuffed dmg between you 2 minus a perf. <br>
<br>
It's also quite amazing how many people in the game just use /stick in rvr. Coming from UO and Eq(tallon) there was no /stick, so you had to use the mouse keyboard in tracking down players. Add the fact there is no collision detection and for the people who are &quot;twitchy&quot; there can be a decided advantage in rvr in DAoC.<br>
<br>
Still get some unbuffed logs would be nice to see. <br>
