This ability is too expensive in terms of RA it should have been an integral part of 'detect hidden' from the start.<br>

Additionaly archers are very dificult to see beyond about 3 horse lengths and short assassins... ummm I mean short rangers can still achieve total invisibility by hiding behind shrubery.<br>

Care to back this statement up with some kind of proof? Logs, RP scores for the last 7 days, something concrete?<br>
<br>
&quot;Rangers and scouts are no slouch in melee&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmmm.. I notice you don't say Hunters.<br>
<br>
How about True Sight gets made a passive 8 point realm ability and is changed to not see other archers, just assassins and minstrels?<br>
<br>
After all, not every class in daoc can get passive True Sight. Stealth for an assassin would  still be usefull against anyone who isnt a scout, hunter or ranger.<br>
<br>
i wouldn't say it negates a spec line, if anything, you dont need to put as much into stealth anymore, and can dump points into other spec lines<br>

<br>
Its not too powerful if it can be implemented properly, but it is right now.<br>
<br>
I like the way it works and I have had archers very close to me that I knew were there that I could not see, because their terrain use was good.<br>
<br>
What I disagree with is the fact that a low level assassin can see a high level archer just as easily as a high level assassin can. This is bad as it means that low level alts can be used as archer spotters at key locations, such as milegates. Seeing the MG gate open wont give you the name and level colour, whereas seeing an archer will.<br>

You cannot possibly compare the impact of being seen between a class that can use its primary attack at range and does not have to be hidden to do so, and a class that has to be at point blank range and without being stealthed its primary attack does not work at all.<br>

<br>
Actually, it can be compared. It's just the &quot;canned&quot; assassin response that it can't be.<br>
<br>
First- Only half the assassin builds rely on a stealthed 1st shot. Then there are The &quot;Bladeshades&quot;, &quot;Merciltrators&quot; and &quot;Shadowzerks&quot; who rely on poison and dual wielding to kill instead of the PA chain. Then there are the assassins who use the regular weapon styles to kill, as the Infiltrator who pretty much just uses Dragonfang.  So there are 3 sets of weapon styles (CD/DW/LA, normal weapon styles, and CS styles) that an Assassin can use to kill. So the assumption that all Assassins only use the PA chain to kill and need stealth to kill is false.<br>
<br>
Second- It doesn't matter if the attack comes at range or is in melee range, being seen causes BOTH to fail.  As it is now, only Archers can fail because of See Hidden, not Assassins. This is why the Archer classes are losing ground in the  7 Day RP rankings while Assassin Classes are pretty much staying at the top. <br>
<br>
Third- there are many balances on Archers that Assassins don't face. Blade Turn stopping Crits, Negate Sight, LOS issues, Detect Hidden and others.<br>
<br>
See Hidden pretty much destroyed any ability of Archers to scout or use stealth for pretty much anything. I see loads of Assassin &quot;bots&quot; who are gray or green to a 50th level being run around with the sole intention of ferreting out Archers and Minstrels.  Eventually some class like Archers or Tanks will be given a passive sight ability to see Assassins.  In your own words &quot;not every class in daoc can get &quot; it so it will not be overpowered. Only 2 classes will be able to detect Assassins. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=collainmacbain>Collain MacBain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 1:23:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3577.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Debate: See Hidden too powerful?</span><hr size=1> I have a level 37 Ranger, 43 shade and my first character a level 30 minstrel, to me See Hidden and True Sight should never have gone in.<br>
<br>
See Hidden forces the archers to either stand back and act as support fire within the crowd or team up with assassins. The previous role of solo RvR is no longer viable. The question is then, how useful is stealth then for archers? not very much, true you can still hide from other classes, but since you cannot solo RvR you are dependant on having an assassin or a group with you. In a non-stealth group stealth is of limited worth. So the result of See Hidden is that an entire spec line is very devalued.<br>
<br>
What they should have done was to perhaps double the range of the old 'Detect Hidden'. That would still give the archers a chance, and give us assassins a challenge.<br>
<br>
The result for the minstrel is very much the same as for the archer, the difference being that the minstrel is in better shape to defend himself. A well-played minstrel is a formidable foe, but far from over-powered. <br>
<br>
True you have pets, single target castable mez, short instant stun, stealth, two instant DDs, and chain armour. But the minstrel also have low hitpoints, relatively weak melee, pets are of limited use in RvR due to several factors, instrument swapping ( a major chore). In addition some of the features are mutually exclusive, for instance you cannot stealth and have a pet.<br>
<br>
If you perceive the minstrel as overpowered, how would you describe a skald then?<br>
<br>
Smite Clerics on the other hand.....that is what I call overpowered, some toning down was necessary there.<br>
<br>
As much as I love my shade, I would say that the 'See Hidden' went too far, and 'True Sight' is just silly.<br>

Yeah yeah, I know, assassins rules the world. That's why out of 200 people above level 40 on Percival every night, ~25 are rangers while 8 are nightshades.<br>
<br>
We're just so uber with out leet ability to kill someone and die without hope for escape. Archers don't have to rely on kamikaze tactics to have any effect on battles, so I wouldn't expect them to understand kill ratios of 10 deaths for every 1 kill. Yeah, see hidden hurt archers, but it's such an easy ability to work around: don't sneak about solo, that's the assassin's job.<br>

<br>
And almost all shades rely on stealth to get up close. Getting at max arrow range is much safer then getting at melee range.<br>
<br>
If an archer sees us at range or any class with a range attack we are dead. If we see an archer at range.. um.. we still have to go up close to them. Slowly unless you spents more points on stealth speed.<br>
<br>
So you really it's like apples and oranges. You can compare archer and assassin stealth.. but it'll be a poor comparison. <br>

<br>
What level are you?<br>
<br>
How are you specced?<br>
<br>
Tesfaye is the Number 1 RP earner and groups with a full enhance cleric so has crazy buffs. He also groups, not solos for Rp I believe. Using him as an example doesn't do justice to the Archer Classes.<br>
<br>
Your example would be like if I came on and posted that all Assassins PA for 1000+ damage, Dragonfang for insane damage, and use their shouts to kill me.<br>
<br>
Just as I did in the last Example, you are lumping all Archers into 1 instead of 3 seperate classes with different abilities.<br>
<br>
A fully buffed Scout will CS for 1000 damage if lucky. They can also shield stun if specced right.  This doesn't mean Hunters Crit Shot for 1000 damage or Rangers Crit Shot for 1000 damage.<br>
<br>
Just as Assassins try to rank themselves like Inf&gt;SB=NS or Inf&gt;SB&gt;NS, Archers can be ranked. It would be Scout&gt;Ranger&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hunter or Scout=Ranger&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hunter.   No one disagrees that Hunters are the worst Archer class.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Unless you have played as a high level Archer with See Hidden in effect you kinda have no idea how disheartening it is to have gray con assassins run groups to you and kill you or have a spec line ruined because of See Hidden.<br>
<br>
Play it off with the excuse that only 2 classes can see Archers or whatever you like.  It doesn't change how the mechanics of See Hidden are grossly overpowered from an Archers perspective and how it has reduced an Archers role in RvR.<br>

<br>
When it debuted, I thought &quot;Well, they(archers) will probably assume that most assassins will have purchased this skill, so the threat is there for them to stay in the group and not stray.<br>
<br>
Well out by the MG's I come near a 50 archer and since I had to use old school running around in circle techniques to find him again, it was my death sentence.  He true sighted me sometime and he and his buddies came charging towards me when i thought I was in the clear.<br>
<br>
So, I know have to put the RAs I want to get on hold, so I can get see hidden before them.  Was wanting to get MOP to II and at least Dodger to II before getting other skills.<br>
<br>
So I didn't even feel that I needed See Hidden, my roomate plays a 49 ranger and I've watched him eat dirt so many times from assassins and now it's worse.  <br>
<br>
So my bluff of having &quot;See Hidden&quot; is called and I lose.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~~~~~~ <BR>

<br>
True sight is killing more assassins as an active skill than see hidden is killing archers as a passive skill.<br>
<br>
The only archers that get "owned" by assassins are the dumb ones that think they can wander around solo. That's the ONLY situation where an assassin has any hope of killing and not dying. Every other situation the assassin will either have to bail before the intended victim is dead, or they will die to the intended victim's friends.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the archers continue to shoot and kill and run. They can take out see hidden the day they make bows only work from melee range.<br>

Jalena, 45th nightshade, 31, 000 RP (rounded up)<br>
<br>
This is correct?<br>
<br>
So you are basing all your facts off of being shot by an Orange or Red Con? <br>
<br>
Or are you basing it off what other people tell you?<br>
<br>
Let me tell you the truth from a 50th Hunters perspective with 50+14 bow skill.<br>
<br>
I hit yellow cons for 150-200 damage with regular shots. Epic Armor is 130-180 damage. <br>
<br>
The Crit Shots I have had in the last 4 weeks you can count on 1 hand because of PBT, LOS issues, Combat Mode, and other things. My crit is for 300-400 damage.<br>
<br>
This is using a 99% Quality 4 speed Bow. I would get slightly better damage with a 4.7 speed bow but use a 4 speed mainly for Caster interrupts and for fast shots.<br>
<br>
I get PAed by Nightshades and Infiltrators for more then my Crit Shots by a good margin and get hit for as much or more in melee damage from them versus my regular bow shots.<br>
<br>
Now factor in Envenom damage eating up my health.<br>
<br>
Melee spear Damage is 120-190 Damage roughly with a slow 2 handed spear. Nightshades and Infiltrators hit faster and for more damage in melee then I do.<br>
<br>
Assassins also get Evade 7 (35%) versus my Evade 1 (5%). In many fights with assassins I will be evaded 4-6 out of 7 tries at hitting them. Couple that with a very slow weapon.<br>
<br>
Tell me how overpowered my Hunter is over ANY Assassin. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ulupas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lupas</A> at: 6/20/02 5:50:43 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3577.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3577.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3577.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3577.topic&index=20><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3577.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3577.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3577.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3577.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousefrm31">Official News<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm30">Lesser Classes<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
