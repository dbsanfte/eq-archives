The Jedi are fighting for the wrong side they are working for Dark Sidious aka Chancellor Palpitine.  I liked the over all storyline of this one but some of the acting, I thought, was kinda bad. Sidous playing both sides to take over the republic is nice hehe.   Yoda with a light sabre was the best part of this movie hehe.<br>
<br>
About the bad Acting part.  Where i saw this MOST of all (distracting from the movie IMO) anyone else notice that Pademe doesn't like Anikien at all.  Even when she is saying she loves him you can see how fake it all is.  Was horrible no chemistry between them at all. <p><img SRC=http://eluminary.tripod.com/cgi-bin/sig.txt Height="239" Width="400">

<br>
 Overall, that movie sucked ass.<br>
<br>
  What I really did think was neat was, after Dookoo lops off Anni's arm, and gives him a force push, he appears visibly drained, has a lost look in his eyes, and shakes his head to clear it ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
  Now interpret that how you may, but my take is that Anikan (sp) had so much raw evil, so much hatred, so much of the dark side in him, that just being that close to Anikan, and having to fight him, physically and mentally drained Dookoo for a moment or three.<br>
<br>
<br>
   Its almost like Dookoo was thinking &quot; Holy shit, theres some serious Dark Side mojo in this one &quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
   on a 1-10 its barely a 3.5. Portman is really the only thing that makes you sit through it.<br>

<br>
I left with a mixed feeling about the movie, i just had a &quot;well, it was alright&quot; feeling about it.  Overall it wasnt that bad, but it wasnt that great either.  The first hour or so was incredibly boring, friend next to me fell asleep, and Anakins acting was horrible.  I think one of my friends said it best after we left the theatre, &quot;They could have replaced him with a can of corn, then had a monky read his lines and it would have been better.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Jackson could and should have been so much more badass, there was plenty of room for it during the arena fight scene.  It also bothered me that the jedi basically set themselves up to die in that fight scene.  Aw well.<br>
<br>
If you havent seen it yet, my opinion is that you see it for the yoda fight scene.  However, I dont see myself going to it again.  I think ill wait for it to come out on divx. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uwrathiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wrathiel</A> at: 5/18/02 12:23:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=young>Young</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/18/02 7:51:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=899.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Returning Balance to the Force</span><hr size=1> a couple quick comments<br>
<br>
1st on the balance to the force.<br>
<br>
Episode 1-<br>
<br>
-Qui Gonn: &quot;It is possible he (Anaakin) was conceived by the midichlorians&quot;<br>
<br>
-Mace Windu: &quot;You refer to the prophecy of THE ONE who will bring balance to the force.&quot;<br>
<br>
This strongly suggests that the prophecy refers to the one who was conceived by the midichlorians as the one who will bring balance to the force, that of course is Anakin who defeats the Emperor. (It also strongly suggests that he indeed had no father - he was conceived by the Midichlorians-and was destined for this path)<br>
<br>
The other thing about not everyone seeing Anakin turning yet. In Episode 1 Yoda says &quot;Hard to see the dark side is.&quot; The Jedi were unaware that the Sith had even returned. There is allot more continuity here than some of you are giving credit to. Also Mace and Yoda felt a disturbance with Anakin so they are aware of some trouble with him, though no one was actually present when he killed the Tuscan Raiders.<br>
<br>
I suggest go see Episode 2, go back and watch Episode 1 again, then go see Episode 2 again. <br>
<br>
I also agree with the individual who made the comparison to Nazi Germany and Hitler e.g Stormtroopers, and the Supreme Chancellory to Emperor. This is a major part of the story which had to be told.<br>
<br>
The dact of doing prequels is that we know 85% percent of the story we just dont know all the details. In the end its the movie's details as interpreted by George that becomes the SW's cannon and not various books etc.<br>

Granted there were some parts of the movie i didnt like, the cheesy ani padme love secenes, but they were necessary.  There were some things that Lucas could have done better but can you think of any movie that was designed to please people of all ages that was perfect.<br>
<br>
Whoever made the first reference that dooku should have made them fight for the wrong side failed to realize that the jedi already were.  Ok lets see palpatine with executive powers, big guys in white suits marching to the imperial march, the jedi are being played and if you couldn't see that you were probably asleep.<br>
<br>
I agree with most of the stuff Ed has said about ballence to the force and some other things with a LOT less intensity.<br>
<br>
For all the poeple that are complaining about minor details relax its only a movie even if i thought it was pure shit id only be out th 7.75 i paid for the ticket.  Why dont you complain that a bugs life sucked because some of the ants didnt have six legs.  Its a movie get a life. <p>Strago Magus<BR>

Anakin IS the one who restores balance. He falls to the Dark Side, but redeems himself by turning away and killing the Emperor. It is that act of self-sacrifice and redemption that brings the force back into balance. (as obviously by that point, it is very very heavily tilted towards the dark side)<br>
<br>
As for Episode 2... Well, it's obviously better than Episode 1. The simple fact that Jar Jar was only in this one for maybe 3 minutes alone would do that. heh. Though, I must say, it was interesting to see that Jar Jar was actually incorporated into Palpatine's plans, once he showed up. Needed SOMEONE to be the patsy, after all, to call for the vote for the emperor's powers. Padme already stated flat out in private she'd never have voted for the army, so her being gone was necessary, as was having Jar Jar available to call for the vote in her stead, after being told she WOULD have done it.<br>
<br>
Yeah, some of the love scenes seemed rather forced, and the fact his mother died in his arms RIGHT as he got there pissed me the hell off too. All that stuff could have used some serious work, I agree, and no, I don't think Hayden Christiansen was the best choice for Anakin. I mean hell, remember Episode 4, and Darth seems like he's 6'6&quot; easy? Funny, in this one Anakin is a short weedy little guy. I am sure some of the height stuff can be explained with prosthetics, but it's still a disconintuity.<br>
<br>
Some of the battle scenes were great, for sure. Yoda IS the Muppet of Doom. rofl. (do NOT fuck with the muppet!) The whole thing gives me a lot more hope for Episode 3 than I had for Episode 2 after seeing 1.<br>

Like so many others in the thread, you aren't reading.<br>
<br>
Both sides are &quot;wrong&quot;.  What Lucas could have *easily* done was made Dooku a *genuine* rebel.  In effect, the Jedi would end up destroying the only means to stop the Emporer.  That would have been *great*.  But Lucas blew it and nothing in Episode 2 or 3 now has any meaning.<br>

I did like Ep 2 better then ep 1 tho.

<br>
the yoda scene was awesome, though i would have liked it if it was a tad longer. when i went to see it the theater errupted when yoda pulled out his light saber. <br>
<br>
the romantic parts between anikin and padme did seem forced, like they were choking as they said i love you. anikin whined a tad to much for my liking, but haydn did a job of looking evil.<br>
<br>
Lucas did a good job of tieing many things together, even if he did smudge the facts a bit to make it work how he wanted.<br>
<br>
both anikin and obi wan had a weak attempt against dooku, would have been nicer if they lasted a tad longer.<br>
<br>
i found the JaJa scene wanting palpitine to have supreme power hilarious, especially when Padme was returning to Corasont to fight against it.<br>
<br>
the scene with natalie portman in the tight little white outfit was nice. /drool<br>

overall i liked the movie, i will go see it again in a few days<br>

<br>
Before phantom menace good &gt; evil<br>
<br>
so anikin has to be bad yo make good &lt; evil<br>
<br>
But in the in he turns good again making good = evil<br>
<br>
I think they should have make dooku a bad hero,  and not working for the emporer so that the Jedi would be way wrong in the end.<br>
<br>
Making him the emporers lil man, it makes no reason what so ever for him to tell obi that a sith lord, Lord Sideous at that to be in a high place of power in the senate. Considering how the emporer has been working before that is a hugh mistake.<br>
<br>
To make this work all they would have to do is have dooku do his own thing and have someone esle be the emps slave.<br>
<br>
The thing with natalie portman is that they are tring to convay love. Love in its purest form. The kind where you never have to say your sorry. He accepted that she is a polition, she accepts he is a Jedi, and that he is going thru a hard time. <br>
<br>
#1 problem with this movie is Tons of plot, and not enough action to back it up. and Of course they should have killed jar jar. Its a shame a light saber didn't slip last time and finish the job.<br>
<br>
BTW isn't mace windu supposed to have a awesome jedi ability where he can use the force to make his saber wrap around him, as a defensive measure? I remember alot of people telling me about it, and that being one reason why he is the jedi leader.<br>
<br>
<br>
And WTF is up with anikins mechanical arm. I mean really, Golden enourmous freak arm? I have no idea what they are tring to do there. I knew he was going to lose a limb if not a couple, but thats just weird.<br>

The acting was a little dry at times, and I agree that the &quot;love chemistry&quot; isn't there AT ALL.<br>
<br>
But the story fits fine. There is no right side here. Dakoo wouldn't go against the Jedi unless he was with the Dark Side. It'd be against the order for him to just deside to be a rebel.<br>
<br>
YODA ROCKS. Ok, screw Luke. Even at the end of RotJ Luke was no where near the Jedi Master that Yoda is. Yoda is along the same lines as Palpatine. <br>
<br>
Ep 3 should by all accounts be a tragedy. It really can't go any other way.<br>
<br>
-Pandme has to die.<br>
-Mace has to die.<br>
-Ani kills Dacoo, but turns to the dark side. (Probably due to Padme dying, and he'll blam Obi Wan.)<br>
-All remaining Jedi will die or be killed, except Yoday and Obi, who go into hiding/exile.<br>
-The Palpatine/Sith Lord abandons the trade federation and just takes over control of the Senate with his new &quot;clone&quot; army. Now we know where the limitless supply of Stormtroopers comes from.<br>
<br>
Not a heck of alot of good will come out of Ep 3. Ep 3 should be as dark and dismal an ending as Empire Strikes Back was. But then we all know that in the end, good prevails.

I disagree. I made my 1st post before reading all the other replies, I had to get to a event. But in review I agree with Leo when Vader kills The Emp. the Teetor todder is balanced with luke in the middle. But it is Anikin whos sets things right. Luke would be dead and the emp would rule on if vader hadn't interviened. <br>
<br>
So in the end there is no good or evil just the harmony of balance. <p>2 Ti 4:7</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/useravtrev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SeravTrev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/19/02 6:45:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=899.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hopefully..</span><hr size=1> Lucas will allow someone else with real talent write and direct Episode 3.  Remember, the only original Star Wars movie Lucas directed was a New Hope, not Return of the Jedi or Empire Strike Back, both of which were superior.<br>
<br>
The love scenes in Ep2 were equivalent to the Jar-Jar scenes in the previous movie.  A bunch of ridiculous cliches delivered in a horribly wooden and bland performance.  Remember the bit about sand.  <br>
<br>
The best(only decent, that is) performances came from Ewan MacGregor and Christopher Lee.  Considering that Lucas only got mediocre performances from two of the best living english actors, he could hardly do anything with the rest of the cast.<br>
<br>
And did anyone else find the Yoda fightscene ridiculous?  He's two feet tail, and he's flying around like a monkey on crack.  Have him move his lightsaber using the force or something, so he can retain a shred of dignity.<br>
<br>
The visuals were, overall, excellent, and there were some decent fight scenes(but why, why did Lucas have to kill off Darth Maul?), but they weren't good enough to redeem the atrocious dialogue and lack of any character development. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uzanch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zanch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/19/02 6:52:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=899.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/culhand/ro6060.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Ep 2 Rant - N.B. ***SPOILERS PRESENT***</span><hr size=1> &quot;A single action will not push you over, but butchering 30+ sandraider men in addition to their wives and children, he's getting pretty close.&quot;<br>

well i think i would flip out and go ninja on a whole clan of people if the starved and killed my mom too, only to have me come up and see her right as she died.  think about that.<br>

also if mace windu is so good with the force (enough to be the jedi leader) then why didn't he just crush all if not half of the droids with a single thought in that big arena scene.<br>

that scene with yoda made me just want to piss my pants.<br>

all in all i say this was a really good movie.  maybe not worth the 7 25 to see it but pretty dam close.  if you don't like it well thats your opinion well you can go jump off a roof or something cuz i don't know what to tell ya. besides i have yet to see any of you make that good of a movie yet.<br>

About the only Star Wars fanbois stuff I have is a hard back graphic novel of A New Hope I got back in 79 or so.  Stormtroopers being clones is mentioned right there, so it's hardly a new concept.<br>
<br>
That's why Leia says &quot;aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper&quot; - they are all the same height, as they are clones.<br>
