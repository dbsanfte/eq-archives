So I have just a couple of questions:<br>
-Are there any set rules for PvP servers?<br>
-Where could I find a list of them if one exists?<br>
-Are there different rules to different types of PvP servers?<br>
-What do ya mean by &quot;blue&quot; server?<br>
-Are there any major &quot;unspoken rules&quot; that most players in PvP abide by, so not to build too terrible a rep?<br>
-How does exp loss work on PvP servers when dueling?  Is it the same as all other servers, like you lose exp if you died from a DOT, pet, or damage shield?<br>
<br>
Thanks very much in advance for answering any of these questions =)<br>

Heres a short list of rules... <br>
      For rallos zek players..<br>
         -you can kill anyone, as long as they are within 4 <br>
          levels of you.<br>
         -as long as you did any ammount of damage to the <br>
          deceased player, and the player was not killed by<br>
          a dot or a pet, you may loot one item that is not<br>
          in any of the hand/melee slots, and all of their <br>
          cash.<br>
         -you cannot fear or charm a player charachter.<br>
         -you are not allowed to do any ranged attacks on <br>
          players near a guard.<br>
2. Blue server refers to any non-pvp server.<br>
3. Unspoken rules on rallos zek are as follows..<br>
         -if you bother me, my friends and i will kill you.<br>
4. From my experiences you do NOT lose exp from a dot or pet in a pvp situation.. but i'm not exactly sure.  If a DoT or pet kills you, nobody gets to loot your corpse.. a major plus.<br>

<br>
Here is an excerpt:<br>
&quot;When one makes the decision to play on a PvP Server, they are in essence agreeing to play on a server where compromise is decided on the basis of who has the power to kill whom.<br>
<br>
By the same token, we expect that the people on those servers will apply PvP ...as a resolution to the problem. As such, the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will decline to intervene in cases where a PvP alternative exists...&quot;<br>
<br>
Official rules also speak against causing experience loss and of bind point/corpse camping.<br>
<br>
The reality is that aside from these official rules, each of the servers has developed their own set of &quot;player&quot; rules.  Terms include Loot and Scoot (in which a fallen player must vacate the zone for a period of time, usually an hour.), and different &quot;rules&quot; on who is on what team.  You can read the message boards of each server to get an idea of what exists but it may be easier to just make a character on the server(s) of interest and observe the action.  This will be hard on Rallos, however, as the newbie levels involve a lot of random PKing (PK=player killing).<br>
<br>
For an example of rules on Vallon Zek, feel free to visit the <!--EZCODE HTML START--> <a href="http://talonguard.org/shanks">Shanks</a> website and read our Battle section (a big update to the site will be coming this month btw).<br>
<br>
Regarding experience loss: you do not lose or gain experience when fighting a player.  One of the official rules in fact is that you do not cause experience loss to another player by deliberately training them, etc.  DoTs will NOT cause you to lose experience either (this was fixed in one of the patches).<br>
<br>
Blue servers are indeed non PvP servers.  PvP servers are sometimes called "Red" servers.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you, and if you fancy making a Barbarian, I hope to see ye on Vallon Zek<!--EZCODE HTML END--> <p><p=center> <IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/fricka_on_vallon_zek/frickaface.gif"><br><font color=990033><b>Fricka</b><br>

You can be killed, and you will be killed.  Often, Repeatedly, Undeservedly, Horrendously, Slowly, and Painfully.  You will be killed, your money will be stolen, you will be embarassed, and you will lose face in front of your friends OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  That is the only thing that is set in stone: YOU ARE GOING TO DIE.  It occurs extremely often, and if you whine about it, it will occur twice as often.  And, contrary to what Verant believes (Or cares, for that matter), you will be Experienced Killed almost as often.  Just watch a Darkie Raid on FP sometime, and you'll see it only lasts 10 minutes or so until someone trains the guards on them.  If you are foolish enough to make a character on a Red Server, you are going to die.  Probably by one of the very people you're talking to on this website.<br>
<br>
Now, if that doesn't bother you, then you're all set for a PvP enviroment.  Personally, I like PvP MUCH more than any Blue Server (Blue Server= Servers set aside for Cowards and Weaklings who can't take the PvP enviroment.  As you can tell, those of us from Red Servers despise you people, and you are often the blunt of our most horrendous jokes or insults).  PvP invites a sense of danger, a certain flavor to the game that the other servers sorely lack.  No duel can compare to the satisfaction of hunting through a dungeon or zone specifically to kill all those in your path.  Even if defeated.  It's much more realistic, and I love it.<br>
<br>
Now that I'm done preaching, here are the Player Rules (You probably don't really need to worry about official rules, because the ones you can break no one gives a damn about anyway.  People will get more upset if you break a Player Rule than an Official Rule, including GMs, and Official Rules often have some program built into them physically- so to speak- stopping you from commiting them).<br>
<br>
1. Loot and Scoot: If you are killed in a PvP fight, then you are allowed this one freedom- after awakening at your bind point, and safely traveling to your corpse (Most often by yelling &quot;CR&quot; every time you enter a new zone), you are given time to loot your corpse, and leave the zone without being harrassed by other players.  Once you have looted, you must shout out &quot;Scooting&quot;, and then leave the zone for a period of time (1hr standard).<br>
<br>
2. Corpse Runs: After you die, you must travel to the zone you died in (Unless certain caster classes, and then you're probably bound in the same zone).  When you do, shout out &quot;CR&quot; (Corpse Run) everytime you enter a new zone, and most people will let you be.  This is for PvP *OR* normal deaths.<br>
<br>
3. Greenie Killings: This is not actually a rule, but it is considered disgraceful (At least on TZ) to kill anyone that /cons a low-green to you.  You will be looked upon distastefully by everyone you meet, killed more often, and have a harder time finding groups if it becomes common knowledge you often hunt greens (ESPECIALLY if you only hunt greens).  And, eventually, those greens WILL grow up, and then you're screwed.<br>
<br>
4. Out of Range Healing (OOR Healing): This sucks, and if you do it, you suck.  'Nuf said.<br>
<br>
5. Deleveling to PK: This also is not really a rule (Like the last two), more of a majority opinion.  If you delevel yourself to become a better PK, then you are a shitfuck. (I know that got sensored, but basically I said you're a S---F---.  Yes, that's right, a cross between something you flush and something you do with your date).  Everyone's going to kill you when they see you, and you have No, I repeat, NO chance of getting in a group to level yourself back up again.  (What would you do if someone in Planes Armor and a Sirname asked to join your WC Dervish Group, or maybe your Lavastorm Group?)<br>
<br>
And that's all I can think of right now.  If you do decide to play on a PvP server, take notice that each one is different.  Here are the below differences (From my personal experiences, and those of close friends).<br>
<br>
Rallos Zek: This server is the most commonly frequented PvP server, for one reason- Disgruntled losers from Blue Servers often make Twinks on this server, and when they get their asses kicked on a Plane Raid, they come here and take it out.  The loots are Coin and 1 Item, 4 level limit, no teams.  This means people from your own race can, and will, kill you.  This server is often refered to as &quot;The Murder Server&quot;, as that is what happens quite often.  People kill you for no reason, or they kill you cause they like your shiny new cloak (ie: Don't let them examine you, or else).  One Side Note- GM's don't do S*** on this server, except sit on their asses and get paid.  You think your server's bad?  Try /petition here!<br>
<br>
Tallon Zek: This server is less frequented, but it often has more people on it at one time than Rallos Zek.  This is a PvP Teams server, meaning that there are certain teams that can PvP each other (Darks- Dark Elves, Trolls, Iksar, Ogres; Elves- Wood Elves, High Elves, Half Elves; Humans- Humans, Erudites, Barbarians; Shorties- Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes), and only each other.  This is Coin Only, and the level limit is 8.  This server is much more roleplayed than Rallos Zek is, because you are forced into a method of roleplaying (Darkies vs. Everyone Else), weither you want to or not.  This server is the second most &quot;Hardcore&quot; PvP server, although deaths are most often roleplayed than some pimply-faced 13 year old getting off from causing others pain.<br>
<br>
Vallon Zek: This server is closer to a Blue Server than any of the other PvP servers, in my experience.  I only have one character on this server, and he is a lowbie, so I can't say too much.  This server has more dedicated players than the others, and has a *Somewhat* civilized appearance.  This is a Coin Loot server, and level limit is 8.  This server is the least &quot;Hardcore&quot; of them all, but don't let it fool you, try telling the Shanks that their server sucks and see what happens.  This is a PvP Teams server as well.<br>
<br>
Personal Opinion: PvP is much better than Blue Servers, but it has it's drawbacks.  Rallos has the potential to be the best server in the entire game, just becuase it's the most realistic.  Things could easily be done on Rallos in much more Epic way than any other servers, if only they could get rid of the said 13 year olds who come there to give themselves a boost of confidence (And probably a &quot;Woodie&quot;) by killing the real PvP players.  Because of those little twits Rallos is the last PvP server I would ever play on, though thankfully the majority of them have never bothered to level their characters past 20 or so.  It's assholes like them who ruin the game for the rest of us, and they love it.  That's the one major drawback to PvP.  That and those dumbass IRC people, hehe (You can take your dr00d and your sux0rs and shove 'em where the sun don't shine, hehe), although their just irritating (I would rather some IRC person than those Twits).<br>
<br>
Warning: Leveling on a PvP server is alot slower than leveling on a Blue Server.  I started my life out on Innoruuk (And founded a guild there too- Knights of Brell), before moving to Tallon Zek.  Leveling on a PvP server is slower because almost (If not more) half of your time is spent in PvP situations.  The economy is drastically different, as well.  Items go for much less platinum, because it's rare to find anyone with alot of platinum in the first place, in the bank as well as on them.  Items are most often traded for, because your chances of making it to the bank after people notice you have stopped auctioning are Zero to None.<br>
<br>
Well, that's all I gotta say.  Need to run now, I think I just pissed off about 90% of everyone on the Red Servers, hehe.  Bye!<br>

It changes somewhat beyond that, though you should of course always be wary.<br>
<br>
ANY environment death doesn't result in exp loss on PvP servers. This includes: DoT's, pet's, drowning, falling, removal of HP gear (a very useful tactic if you've got 55hp rings on hehe), and maybe others (not sure about lava).<br>
<br>
Oh, and the favorite thing about Rallos...NO TWINKS =) Well, some people try it and get raped.<br>
<br>
One more thing, loot and scoot isn't followed at all on RZ, and if you tried to get someone to follow it they'd not take you seriously and probably kill you in spite of it :)<br>

There is a loot and scoot policy for us that if you loot your body after being PKed and leave the zone for at least an hour after. The prob is if the PKer doesn't care and corpse camp you ya gotta get a GM to help who will just give a warning, or if you choose not to scoot you can be repeatedly killed.  The server's light vs. dark trend makes who you kill pretty much set but there is always exceptions and 4 teams mean you can always put a jerk in their place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

<br>
Loot and Scoot brings back a bit of the &quot;reward&quot; of the GAME by giving the victor zone control.  The team servers are coin only loot which often will mean no loot since most players take care not to carry money on their person.  Zone control through Loot and Scoot is a civil way of giving the victor a &quot;reward&quot;. And today's victor may fall tomorrow of course.<br>

Rallos Zek, a one item plus coin server, has a different PvP flavor; however, as the victor of a contest can gain an item as a reward. <p><p=center> <IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/fricka_on_vallon_zek/frickaface.gif"><br><font color=990033><b>Fricka</b><br>

<br>
On Vallon it's a show of honor.  You lose a battle, you leave (as if you're dead).  But believe me, it's not a server-wide thing and not all guilds follow this policy.  Most of the good ones do though which is refreshing.  <br>

In the end, they either get Gang Raped (Not literally- it's a term meaning 1 person vs. 20 people), or the GMs are called in.  SOMETIMES, they actually do something about that, even though it's a player rule.  I have seen cases where the offender was even stupid enough to mouth of to the GM, and one case where the moron took a swipe at the GM.  Well, in both cases the GM's made use of their nifty &quot;Kill&quot; commands, and that was that, hehe.  I don't think I've seen either of those retards since.<br>

I wish I could loot the GM's stuff, hehe.  I got to examine Jubi (A GM on Tallon) two or three weeks ago, and now I want his sword SOOOO bad, hehe.  It has &quot;Powerword Kill&quot;, so to speak, hehe.  Instand ban.  Oh what I could do with that in PvP, lol!<br>
