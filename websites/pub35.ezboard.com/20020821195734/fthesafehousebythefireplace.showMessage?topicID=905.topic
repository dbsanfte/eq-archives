He placed a hand on the cool, rough stone that made up the wall and glanced around, his blue eyes darting around, back and forth, searching the streets.   Hearing footsteps off a few feet away, he was alerted, but, even with his keen Half-Elven vision, he could not see the person or animal.<br><br>He quietly yet quickly drew a scimitar - one from his youth, back when his father trained him - from its sheath and crept over toward the thing, making very sure that whatever it was, it could not see him.  The thing had stopped moving altogether, cautiously sniffing the air.  Mylek had suspected from the beginning that it wasn't a Human, Half-Elf, or even one of the few Elves that roamed the small city.  It was late during the night and Mylek was sure that he was the only one - besides his Rogue brother, Bolep - that was awake. <br><br>The animal stepped out into the radius of a torch's flickering, dim-glowing light.  Baring it's teeth and letting out a small, low growl, Mylek knew right away that it was a renegade Gnoll that came to wreak havoc in the city of Enorian. <br><br>The Gnoll had bluish-brownish fur, matted with blood - probably from fighting with other Gnolls - and razor teeth coated with yellow plaque.  Its eyes burned a color of fire, a mix between red, orange, and yellow all at the same time.  The disgusting stench of his breath drifted over to Mylek as a cool breeze swept by. <br><br>Deciding the time was now, while Mylek was still down-wind of the Gnoll, he lunged toward the beast.  It turned and its eyes widened as it began to understand its horrible fate.  Mylek was now running at full speed at the beast. He jumped up, kicked it in the face, and gracefully landed.  The thing staggered back.  He thought about howling, but knew - from his friends experience - that it would only bring more townspeople and make it harder for him to escape.  Mylek pulled another scimitar out and held them defensively.  The beast turned to run, but Mylek had the advantage.  His father, Anudar, had trained him to always find advantages in battle.  The stupid Gnoll had left his back open, a sight Bolep would have loved to see. Mylek plunged the scimitar deep into the foul creatures back, a few inches to the left of its spine.<br><br>The Gnolls last cry came out gurgled, a series of barks and howls.  It sank to the ground in a pool of blood.  Mylek withdrew his scimitar and wiped it on the matted fur of the Gnoll.  He then sheathed both scimitars and simply left the scene for peasants to clean up in the morning.<br><br> <br><br>While he walked back to his original destination - his home - he thought about all the good times he and his family had.  Day after day Anudar would train Mylek, pointing out minor flaws until eventually he could almost beat the old but skilled Human.  His brother, Bolep, was kind of a loner, but was always very friendly and it surprised Mylek when his brother stated he was going to train at the rogue guild.  Bolep seemed too nice to become a cold-hearted rogue.  His brother could make his own decisions, though, Mylek had concluded. He thought then of his mother, Drusilia.  She was always a very cheerful person.  Mylek loved to spend his time with her. Being a bard, his mother was - and still is - always very good at storytelling.  She would sing songs and reminisce about adventures she had before their father was even born. It still pained Mylek to think about his father.  He had died only a year ago, and his mother was very distressed.  A slight frown formed on Myleks face as he stepped up to his door. <br><br>He pulled out his set of lock-picks - a gift from his brother - and started on the lock.  No key would work in this door, and only Mylek and Bolep knew where and when to turn and twist the small metal picks.  Mylek had to be careful when he opened his door - it was lined with traps so that if someone tried to break in through the front, they would surely regret it.  His brother gave him many tips on locks and traps, and Mylek used his siblings advice.  He walked into his house and took off most of his equipment.  It had been a long day, and he wanted to get a good night sleep.  He took a deep breath in through his nose, smelling the scent of home.  He plopped down onto his bed a few rooms back and fell asleep.<br><br> <br><br>______________________________________________________________________<br>There's chapter one, will write two later - <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubolep.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bolep</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/14/02 6:06:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubolep.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bolep</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 6:55:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=905.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Y'know how I said that I was gonna write a story?</span><hr size=1> (This message was left blank) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubolep.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bolep</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/14/02 10:35:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utrolojesterkinng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trolo Jesterkinng</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 7:00:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=905.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Aaron/fullsize/rmdance.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Y'know how I said that I was gonna write a story?</span><hr size=1> Oh la la!
