If we look at the &quot;big picture&quot; of the scenes that the Sniper is &quot;shooting,&quot; we can see the emergence of a primitive commentary on contemporary semiotics. These &quot;snipings&quot; can, by some, be seen as brilliant satirical commentary on modern pop culture.<br>

I can do that with a pistol, its not that hard. <br>
<br>
If he does stop its going to go down as the perfect crime.<br>
<br>
Think of all the other crazy people in teh country who want to go out and kill others but just didn't have the guts.<br>
<br>
Now they are showing with a sniper rifle, once you learn how to use it you can get away with murder too.<br>

I think they will catch him sooner or later even if its really not the guy who is doing this if you get my drift.  <p>2 Ti 4:7

Someone in the news gave some outrageous range that the sniper could be shooting from. I believe they said 600 or 700 yards. Making a shot from that distance is a miracle with a .223 round like the sniper is supposed to be using. A .50 caliber sniper rifle can make that kind of shot, but not a .223. At least, not any .223 rifle I know of can do that. A more realistic range is 100 to 200 yards. Within this range, a moderately skilled marksman with a decent weapon will hit his target almost every time. Three hundred yards is kind of pushing it. Anything more, and we'd probably be seeing more of a 25% or 50% kill rate instead of 80%<br>

<br>
Just clearing some mis-information...<br>
<br>
An &quot;amazing&quot; shot with a .50 caliber sniper rifle (in competent hands) would be one in excess of 2000 meter. A 6-700 yard shot would be similar to throwing a rock and hitting the side of a tractor-trailer rig. On the note of the .223 being a poor performance bullet over long ranges...<br>
<br>
While working at Edson Range in Camp Pendleton, CA I got to take part in a little &quot;show&quot; that the local sharpshooters put on for some visiting high brass. These individuals put on full combat gear, including Alice pack, web gear, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> NBC protective headgear, and consistantly fired rounds into 1 1/2&quot; targets from 600 meters...with an unmodified M16A2 rifle. They were also doing this with the M14, and a few other weapons.<br>
<br>
A couple more examples of .22 caliber rounds used in extreme distance shooting:<br>
<br>
.220 Swift - Very, very fast round. Decently consistant.<br>
.22-250 - Very, very fast round. Very consistant under the right conditions.<br>
.222 (Hornet? Can't remember at the moment) Never used this round much.<br>
<br>
As to the sniper, I can't imagine what the people living there are going through. A few of my in-game friends live in the area, and one lives within walking distance of the gas station in one of the more recent shootings. Hopefully they'll find the bastard doing it before he ruins any more lives. <p>Blaesteil<br>

I did not say the shot would be amazing with a .50 caliber.  I said it would be amazing with a .223 (referring to a 600 or 700 yard shot).  I meant that if you wanted to do that kind of shooting (600 to 700 yards), a .50 caliber would be a good choice.  There are also some mighty fine .308's out there that could probably do the trick as well.  <br>
<br>
I saw a thing on television last night about the sniper.  They indicated that none of his shootings was made from over 200 yards and most were closer to 100 yards.  That is not very far.  I could teach almost anyone to shoot that well with a .223 caliber rifle with a scope in a day or two at the most, even if they had never touched a gun in their life.  Many could achieve that level of skill in a few hours if they had the knack.  All it takes is good eyes and a steady hand.  If it were me shooting at that range, the fatality rate would have been 100% barring a freak accident.  As it was, I think two of the victims survived.  At 50 yards with my .223, I could hit a quarter 19 out of 20 times, and the one I have is not a particularly accurate gun (by my standards).  At that range,  I put consecutive bullets through the same hole in a paper target maybe 50% of the time.  At 100 yards, a head shot would be really easy.  I will give the shooter a little credit.  If he is shooting from inside the van, and the motor is running (lots of &quot;ifs&quot; there), then there will be some vibration, which makes accurate shooting a pain.  The shooter is probably not good enough to make a shot at 600 or 700 yards, no matter how good his equipment is, if he is letting 20% of his victims survive at such close range.  Odds are good that you could read a book on shooting and achieve that level of accuracy practicing by yourself in a week or two.  Learning to shoot without any assistance is an unsafe thing to do.  There are all kinds of gun safety rules you need to learn before you ever touch a gun.  <br>
<br>
The military's top snipers can make shots at 1000 yards that are almost invariably one shot-one kill.  Of course, they have years of training and are the best of the best and have some pretty darn good guns and scopes and ammo as well.  This guy is not even close to their league.  They typically do not use .50 caliber rifles though, because of the size and weight.  They have to travel long distances on foot to do their jobs and a .50 caliber rifle is too much to tote around that far.  I seem to recall that the .308 is their caliber of choice.  I have to qualify that statement a little.  There is an actual official sniper school in the military.  This is what I am referring to right now.  Those guys are awesome.  They go out into the field solo or in pairs to do scouting and sniping deep in enemy territory.  Technically, anybody that snipes is a sniper, even if they suck at it.  Some military snipers do use .50 caliber rifles.  Navy Seal snipers often use this weapon.  However, Navy Seal snipers usually get inserted reasonably close to their target (rarely more than a few miles) and go in as a team, so the size and weight of the .50 caliber are not as big a hinderance to them.  <br>
<br>
I can't believe the ignorance of the newscasters with regards to guns.  They actually asked people to start reporting anybody they knew with a .223 rifle to the police!  Do you have any idea how common that caliber is?  There are probably 20,000 .223 rifles in the United States (just made up that number, but they are quite common).  Odds are good that you know two or three people that own one.  If you know a guy that owns a white box-style van, has a .223 rifle, likes to mess around with tarot cards, and lives in the northeastern part of the U.S., then you should definitely call the police.  If the only thing linking him to the sniping is his ownership of a .223 rifle, then don't bother.  The reason .223 rifles are so common is that it is one of the main military calibers used in the world today.  This makes the ammo cheaper because it is produced in tremendous quantities compared to some of the other calibers.  Also, some people have a fascination with things military in nature and like to have a gun similar to a military weapon.  The M16, for example, uses the .223 round if I remember correctly.  Another popular round is the 7.62 mm round, which I think is the one used by the AK-47?  I'm not sure about that and am too lazy to look it up.  <br>
<br>
And yes, if he stops now and gets rid of the gun, he'll probably never get caught unless he does something really stupid like bragging about his exploits.  There's just too many potential suspects.  If he keeps doing it though, eventually, someone will happen to be close enough to the van to get a license plate number or he won't get away in time and the police will catch him or somebody will notice that their next door neighbor's white box van has been missing from his driveway every single time someone got shot.  Maybe he'll shoot at the wrong group of people and one of them will whip out their own rifle from their vehicle and shoot right back at him.  Or he might end up leaving a piece of forensic evidence, like a shell casing.  Unless he takes pains not to, he will leave fingerprints on the casing while loading the weapon or the clip that goes with the weapon.  When the brass cartridge ejects upon firing, sometimes it is hard to track down.  I know this, because I save my brass sometimes for reloading and I almost always end up losing a few pieces.  It would be really easy for the killer to lose track of a piece of brass in the sand or grass.  Of course, if he is firing the weapon from inside the van, then he probably won't lose any brass.<br>

Yes the AK-47 does use the 7.62mm round as well as SLR's G3's etc. It is very popular as a lot of army's in the world still use this as their standard calibre. We used SLR's when I did a stint in the army in NZ, packed quite a punch and could hit targets at a reasonable range without any special training. <p><select name=Cebi Majere>
