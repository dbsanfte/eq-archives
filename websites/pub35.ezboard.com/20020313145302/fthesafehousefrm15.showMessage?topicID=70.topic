<br>
I was just wondering if some of you RZ folks could give me some information about your server.  After about 9months of blue, and 3months of TZ/VZ... I left eq for a while.<br>
<br>
Coming back now I have started a Rogue on a blue server with some friends.  Yet my hunger for combat is coming back.<br>
<br>
At the time of my leaving TZ/VZ the coin only had recently been implemented and the crossteaming was growing ....<br>
<br>
<br>
My character experiences include most all classes into the teens, my high been a 30wiz.  I am quite familiar with the harsh reality of PvP, and even with the 1 item loot.<br>
<br>
I was just wondering what life is like on RZ, on the team servers it was obviously team driven combat, with some multi-team guilds (grrrrr bastards)<br>
<br>
What typically determines combat on RZ?  Im sure you have your lot of lvl 5 newbie hunters, but beyond that... is it guild driven?  How much random ganking occurs at higher levels?  I am not afraid of losing items, not that It thrills me.. but it adds the element that was lost on the team servers.<br>
<br>
I also really like the 4 level limit... it sounds to be much more fair.  Not much was more annoying that having a caster 8 higher than you drop you like a fire beetle =)  4 gives both parties a fair shake.. after that, its up to skill.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, any info would be great... I am also debating what class to make there if I start.  My experiences as a wizard might come in handy, but I'm leaning toward rogue, or perhaps Necro....<br>
<br>
Thanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucoyoteblack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>coyoteblack</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/10/01 8:40:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tell me of Rallos</span><hr size=1>      I will try to answer you questions. First I am in my 32 season as a Rogue on RAllos. It is all for nothing server if you don't like them and they are in your level range you can kill them. The first 10 levels are a test of your will to succeed as everyone from 1 to 5 seems to think it is Quake. And 5 to 10 at least you can defend you self better but it is still the same.<br>
<br>
    As far as class play with what you like the best. I find the zones with the least pking(although still there)<br>
are Misty Thicket and Everfrost, the most pking is at Freeport and Quanos.<br>
       If you where any gear at a low level I promise you it will be taken, the good thing is that the enemy is not wearing much either. <br>
<br>
Good luck<br>

I'd like to say that guilds are heavy past 20, nearly everyone has got one for support and their own contribution. There are several great ones out there, and of course some nasty ones.<br>
<br>
It is a dog-eat-dog world however, and trust can get you killed, though it's rare. A necessary evil, I'm sure, as it happens. You obviously have to group with someone a first time before grouping a second, of course :p<br>
<br>
As I haven't played on any other servers past 10, I can't really describe the differences from other servers. Just be wary, that's good advice IMO.<br>

I started on rallos, I could pretty much tell who was my enemy, and I could size up an oppenent.  No one was twinked.  Now you got twinked pks, or pks that have purposely lost levels to max their abilities for prime pking.  It gets less rough as you get past 35/40.  But even then its pretty bad.  51+ pvp is a joke, as 1 or 2 spells will kill most people.  <br>
<br>
rogue on pvp server, or any melee for that, and you have to watch too much.  It gets annoying after awhile.  Random ganking is the most common form of combat, even in &quot;guild wars&quot;<br>

until 46 o played naked with a militia tunic and some str ring cause wasn t tanking and i was ekipping once deep in dongeons.<br>
now i focus on resist gear and with the blue diamond jewerly u can have your resist up to 100 without buff,well being paranoid is good too but as u get level u know who is a PK and who is not, just make a / from time to time and get jboots/ 10 charge sow potions.<br>
I like rallos and i don t even plan to change to another server, my rogue is my primary and main carac and i m proud of him,i m not the best ekipped, noone cares but some uber rogue twinks..<br>
Like they said above the first ten levels r a test between lv 1 to 5 u ll probably get pkilled 20+ times especially if you start around main cities.<br>
basic things is to not play in a dungeon at the zone, u ll be ganked like in lower guk.<br>
PvP on rallos is 90% ganking ( one bulb left, massive DD, dead)or 2/3 on u with ice comet or high end spells (overkill)<br>
but rallos is a crazy server that s why i like it even with that, just be careful and look around u u ll avoid many troubles.<br>
and get a see invisible item lol, u ll see PK at zones.<br>

If youve ever seen that movie &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; and replace New York with Rallos Zek when the narrator talks about loving and hating it equally you have a pretty good idea of most of the players views. Im a 51 Rogue on RZ and its been tough going. Im also in a high level guild (in relation to the server as the 55+ population is nowhere near the same as a normal blue server) that happens to be a pvp based guild he fights most of the jerks,dupers,random pkers, 12 yr old wankers, etc. on the server. So not only do I deal with random pk attempts every few mins, I also have people that arent random beating down doors to get to me because of the guild wars. I like Bomban (btw bro your guild name still cracks me up) Ive been around since the beginning (well about 4 months after the beggining, I started as a cleric leveled him to 30 in the first few months and got bored and started the rogue). The community and politics are probally the biggest soap opera this side of daytime tv on the server. But on the other hand, I could never play on a blue server so RZ will be my home to the day i quit. 1 to 10 are the worst levels in terms of getting pked. People blow off steam killing newbies in gfay,freeport,queynos so for a new person to the server it could get very frustrating. Things stay bad till about 35. Then you get a break to 47 when the 51 wizzies get torrent and show rogues and other melees a hearty ass whoopin. Once at that level snare poisons are a must, youll never land normal snare/root item or engulfing darkness proc on people then. People keep the MR too high, My MR is 115 in normal hunting gear and thats still way below most people of the same level. 50-60 is pvp hell time. Unless you feel like sacrificing your dignity and join one of the bjs for loot and protection organizations your gonna end up in guild wars and random pk target to the portal campers. The server is fun, its got the edge alot of people crave, and the feeling of waxing that smack talker and taking his fbss is the greatest thing in the virtual world. Ya gotta be thick skinned to play this server, and if you can take it its great fun.<br>

     I was having a conversation with a 53 rogue that said we could not lay the smack down on a druid or necro. I of course argued we can. But I am only level 33 so I have no idea what goes on at higher levels. <br>
     <br>
    Now assuming that some Rogue replies with: hell yes we can take beet a necro with the remains of his own pet and give a druid a nice nature like dirt nap. Exactly how do we beet them. <br>

<br>
All good advise but if they get a winged death off is it easy to pumice it off? Again being only 33 I have no idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uproztorvalds.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Proz Torvalds</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/01 12:27:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> that 53 rogue you were talking to was me :P except im 51.<br>
<br>
<br>
as for pumicing WD it depends on alot of things, mostly how many buffs or dots ya have on ya at the time, wether your using old pumice, new pumice, or golem wands.<br>
<br>
If they have the pet facters in to since it will interupt new pumices hella bad unless you kill it first while the druid dot/nukes you.<br>
<br>
Its not impossible to kill a druid or necro 50+, but its damn hard. Its not to terribly hard to make them gate if your prepared and are good at pvp, but a good necro or druid will almost always be able to get away from ya before dying.<br>

Sure you beat them and made em run, but now your prolly at 20% life and at the mercy of whoever comes by you. Its kinda like being in a high level zones (i.e. Helots in HS) and something gates, sure ya beat him but now your low on life and hes bringing some friends to kick your weakened arse. Kinda works the same way if your fighting someone thats guilded or has a strong friend networked, hell come back for ya, and theres no real way for a solo rogue to heal up quickly, not including uber regen items that your not gonna be wearing if your at 20% on RZ. Your likely to see 2 more people gate in and gank you hard assuming another random didnt see you first.<br>

<br>
<br>
Tell ya of Rallos huh well personally my advice would be a) don't come to Rallos, ever,its insane b) don't make a rogue , being a necro is about 10x easier on a pvp server<br>
<br>
However if you wanna do both one or both I'd be happy to have your company lol.<br>
<br>
I hate Rallos sometimes but don't plan on moving to Tallon Vallon ( or worse a blue server) any time soon.  I guess most people probably think pretty much the same thing.  Its a hard server to play on but victory or loss does mean something more than losing face here.<br>
