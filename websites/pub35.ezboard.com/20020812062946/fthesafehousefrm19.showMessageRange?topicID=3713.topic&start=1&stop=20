One was greifing ligen today so I go out perf, creeping, garote and land disease, dot, and enervating and maybe get another swing or 2 in. The misntrel is at 20% life and he does the usual cc and runs away. I see him a few minutes later, perf, he EVADES my creeping and im screwed. He spends the next 10 minutes chain ccing me to taunt me and I cant really do anything about it. Finally he finishes toying with me and get a pet to attack me, now what do i do? chase him and let the pet DOT me to death? fight the pet and he gets in a shout then runs away and remezes. Minstrels are way too powerful. Who is supposed to kill them? None of the shades on my server are comfortable doing it. Even sitting, a level 50 shade vs a level 50 minst in epic the minstrel will STILL escape if the shade does everything perfectly. I believe that with the nerfing of smites minstrels now are the most overpowered class around. NS and SB, or Hunters and Rangers need to be given the tools to destroy them. Now some of you will say take purge. I admit that is an option but should that be a requirement for every shade to take? And if they dont should minstrels be allowed to run all over the frontier taking people out? Usually when people are being taken out they call for the shades but are sadly dissapointed when all the shades say &quot;sorry we cant kill even con minstrels.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uaeolion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeolion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 2:11:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3713.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why cant assassins kill Minstrels?</span><hr size=1> get a partner, I've had a great deal of success killing minstrels with both a skald sitting some distance away and with an archer, you just open up with a snare poison and call the reinforcements.

If you dont get it off, you can still win but it will be a bit harder.<br>Try and make use of the reactionary stuns from pierce/thrust/left axe if you cant get CD off<br>2) Poison is important, go with DoT on one hand and enverating on the other.<br>3) Most important! Stay behind them! their spells work on a 180 degree arc. This is the tough part but make heavy use of /stick.<br>4) Switch weapons in mid fight to get a double dose of lethal on them.<br><br>These fights I would say I have won about 3 out of 4, as I will run up against a few minstrels that really know how to play their class well.<br><br>Usually two things will happen when you hit a minstrel<br>1) You open up on him and they immediatly run...if so have a snare poison on hand and work him down from behind.<br>2) You open up on him and he trys to get a bead on you, and you nail him with CD. At this point get your free shots in, switch weapons and STAY BEHIND him.<br><br>There is a third case but I am not going to put it out in plain view for all the lurking Misntrels out there, but its the case where things go bad. <br><br>Keep in mind this is not a sure fire thing, but it will greatly improve your chances. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 6:08:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3713.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Minstrels</span><hr size=1> Nice advice guys thanks<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I will try this next time.<br><br>Mel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uosteon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Osteon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 8:30:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3713.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Minstrels</span><hr size=1> All good advice but I am a bit confused. The minstrel I fought today had zero trouble at all surviing my perf + creeping + lifebane+ diease long enought to get off his CC spells. He then was able to use his CC to keep me immobile and unable to attack by staggering his casts for several minutes. I would estimate at least 3 straight minutes and he was able to heal to 100%, regain his mana, get a pet, and come back at me, this time without me being able to perf or reapply poisons.

But in the 1-vs-1 scenario mez/stun/root are what make or break things.<br><br>So, my private Jihad for the Thrust 50 Infs hold true here too.  You will find that even if you get your Perf + CD off vs. the Inf that when he evades his long stun will give him enough time to kill you.  Considering that the things you will be fighting (primarily other stealthers = Thrust stun, Archers = shield scout, and casters = insta mez/root/stun)... Purge is gonna be the way to go for you regardless of how you think about it.  With resists to effect duration, this may change, but until it does, Purge is gonna be the best point spent... especially if you are solo (which Mythic does not approve of &lt;grin&gt;).<br><br>The advice about staying behind the Minst was good advice, they rarely use stick cause they want to get away from you and CC...
