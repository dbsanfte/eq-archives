You and most of your warrior ilk have missed the whole point as to why monks are upset about this nerf.<br>
<br>
The nerf was aimed at the top 5% of monks, who, through Verants own shortsightedness, were able to increase their hp and ac to &quot;tank-like&quot; proportions by the acquistion of end-game ALL/ALL armour.<br>
<br>
Instead of changing the gear, Verant changed the inate defensive abilities of ALL monks.<br>
<br>
The result?  End-game monks (the minority) have been nerfed a little.  The rest of the monk population, who were NOT the intended target of the nerf, have been totally shafted, and a play style that had been in use since EQ was released, has been destroyed, THREE YEARS later!<br>
<br>
And you're telling us we deserve it?<br>

I just like the truth, and the truth is, stupid itemization caused the need for the issue to be looked at and the solution was through itemization.  The truth is ALSO that your melee damage output is significantly higher than that of warriors and stating otherwise is nonsense and should be confronted by *all* those who give a rat's ass about honesty in debate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unoqture.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Noqture</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/20/02 11:23:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=482.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Simple Truth</span><hr size=1> I have read and read and read and read some more, day after day. I was one of the ones hoping for the best or at least not the worst when this patch was even mentioned. All this came about because Monks could tank high end mobs, but AC and midigation had little to do witht it as the fact that they had the &quot;HIT POINTS&quot; to cover the wave of hits till a Complete Heal could land. Simple solution, if AC and midigation will not solve it, Nerf the HPs of the high end, put a cap on Monk HP so they can not pass say 4K or so. The only way a High End Monk is able to Tank &lt; In any situation &gt; is to have the HP to cover till a heal lands. Take away a good chunk of the HPs that alow this to happen and problem is fixed.<br>

Wait until you are nominated to pull the crypt guardians on the way to the arch lich or some such, and tell me that (tank or no tank) your HP should be capped.<br>
<br>
The issue at hand is that our parses suggust that our AC has been invisibly lowered.  Where it used to be 1000, it still says 1000 but it's actually 800 (random numbers, work with me).  The difference between 1000 ac and 800ac is huge, and you're gonna notice it.  The problem arises when the endgame monks, who were supposed to be nerfed, went from 1500-1600 buffed AC to maybe 1300-1400.  That's still past the point of mattering as far as AC goes, they mitigate just as much as they always did.  In fact, VI hinted that avoidance was increased...so we mitigate as much, and avoid better.<br>
<br>
Basically the crux of the nerf is that all you without NToV gear and Ssrae toys are hurting bad, and everyone with the nice gear doesn't see what the big deal is.<br>
<br>
Monks vs. warriors...I dunno about you, but in my guild monks have 16/19 and 17/20 and 17/19 weapons, and warriors have 16/20 and better that they use quite often.  What's the DPS difference between 17/20 and 16/20?  I'll give you a subtle hint...   FIVE PERCENT.  Use a couple 17/20's or a couple 16/20's, and you're gonna get 105 DPS or 100 DPS respectively.  Ambidex raises our damage a little bit.  Our damage tables raise our damage a little bit.  All in all, a monk should do approximately 120% the damage of a warrior in same level gear.<br>
<br>
Again VI has their head up their ass, it's a lot easier for a low end monk to outdamage a low end warrior by a hell of a lot more than 20%.  But believe me, I do parse fights and our warriors keep up nicely.<br>
<br>
So I addressed monks tanking and warriors doing damage, and the fact is the endgame monk still tanks well (saw one tanking vindi post-nerf, not having much of a problem) and outdamage warriors (though not by the huge margin some of you seem to believe), and not-so-endgame monks get hit like epicless wizards.<br>
<br>
Nice job, VI.  Now that you know that side of the story, everyone needs to stop bitching and either play their gimped monk or start a new damn class.  Maybe, juuust maybe, you should let a warrior tank until you have the gear to do it yourself. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=102236">Sensei Reyn</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unoqture.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Noqture</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/21/02 12:18:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=482.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Simple Truth</span><hr size=1> 4 K was a suggestion, you have a better one shoot.

Without a (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> proprotional</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->) damage upgrade post-nerf there isn't a reason to take a monk over a warrior or rogue (or indeed ranger and they get spells etc. as well).<br>

Class balance based on items would be fine, to an extent, if those items existed.<br>
<br>
Search Allakhazam.<br>
<br>
Monk wearable armor: 720 items<br>
Warrior wearable : 1588 items<br>
on just those 6 slots I checked.<br>
<br>
(note: not saying that is a full item list, or all the equipment listed therein is actually useable / desirable for either class.)<br>
<br>
So, prior to the unbalanced endgame item introduction Monks were limited to less than half the equipment and vastly inferior ac value compared to available warrior upgrades. (arguably even the endgame items seem close except for the point at which ac matters.)<br>
<br>
Plus, we are severely limited in our income potential to purchase such limited content because of our weight restrictions. No, I did not filter out no drop items, so whittle the total tradable content down from there.<br>
<br>
I do not want to tank for a group, but being able to survive an occasional aggro shift in pre-nerf designed gear available to mid levels is important.<br>
<br>
If you won't fix the big toys, put some smaller toys in for this new gadget class you've created. I'm trying to come up with some constructive ideas myself.<br>
