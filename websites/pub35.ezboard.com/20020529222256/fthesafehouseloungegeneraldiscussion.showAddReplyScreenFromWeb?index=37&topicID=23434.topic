I am not sure where you got that information, unless you are talking about the beta test.<br>
<br>
I have played this game since Beta 3, and the only time I remember twinking as not being &quot;allowed&quot; was in beta.  (I believe there was something to do with exploiting bugs or whatnot or they just wanted people to level up normally....  I've no idea the exact reason.)   In final release it was &quot;frowned upon&quot; and then finally was just accepted as normal progression.   Character hits 50 (and later 60) gets bored, and makes a twink.<br>
<br>
EQ2?<br>
<br>
Doesn't sound good to me.  Doesn't sound fun.  It sure as hell LOOKS good if those preview screens are in game screens and not special high detail renders.  Remember SOL graphics pictures pre-release?   for some reason the graphics  didn't end up looking as good.  Expect the same here.<br>
<br>
What's wrong with EQ2 as it is described?  Lemme count the ways  : P<br>
<br>
<br>
First and Foremost.  It is a NEW standalone game.  It is NOT an EQ expansion.  Those 200 days /played?   (for some, this tops 500 days /played across multiple characters)  You cannot take them with you.  Junk it and start again.<br>
<br>
Bad move.<br>
<br>
This should have been done as a MAJOR EXPANSION of the current Everquest.   Consider the following as a possibility:<br>
<br>
You have EQ1 that we play now.   Al Kabor (that dude is nuts) falls off his toilet and whacks his head.  When he comes to, he draws up the flux capacitor.  Gets on the phone and calls up Gimblestan and has him tinker the thing up.  Al Kabor then calls up whoever the token druid is... Leafy McFly and asks him to cast 1.21 Gigawatts of lightning into the thing.  BOOM   They shoot into Norrath 200 years into the future.  <br>
<br>
Great Scott!<br>
<br>
The world is much the same geography wise, but things have changed.  Wars have come and gone, gods have changed bits of the countryside, and halflings are flying everywhere on hoverboards.   Al Kabor spends much time here.  He learns new magics which allow him to explore alternate progressions of his mind.  He acquires new artifacts of great magical power.   Big Al then decides he will head back home and loads up his 8 backpacks with uber &quot;future stuffs.&quot;   Tosses a bananna peel in the improved flux capacitor and he's off.....<br>
<br>
Al Kabor arrives back in old norrath, but he finds something isn't quite right....   His items from the future are missing, and he cannot seem to remember anything he has learned while there.  Panic stricken, he fires up the time portal again.  Upon arriving in the future he finds that his items are again with him, his advancment is back... he remembers everything.   You can take it forward, but you cannot take it back.  Such is a problem with Norrathian time travel.<br>
<br>
/silly story mode off    <br>
<br>
What exactly am I saying here?  Time portals.   Link EQ1 and EQ2.  I'm sure it could be done.  EQ2 can be created independently.  You could travel between the two timeframes of Norrath, and you could bring anything FORWARD in time from EQ1 to EQ2.  When you go forward in time to EQ2, your character is saved in EQ1.  Upon returning from EQ2 to EQ1, your character is saved in EQ2 and you revert to your character in EQ1.<br>
<br>
Sound silly?  Why do this?  The massive player base of EQ1.  People will be far more apt to buy this game if they do not have to throw away hundreds of played days and create a brand new character for a 50% &quot;same&quot; game.  Link them up and you likely just sold as many copies of EQ2 as you have subscribers for EQ1.<br>
<br>
Why make it so you cannot bring advancment backwards but you can bring your old world stuff forwards?  This would allow them to tune EQ2 independant, without concern that it would trivialize EQ1.  I'm no programmer, but conceptually this does not sound particularly difficult.<br>
<br>
The non linked banks....  I dont know the dynamics behind this.  I am not sure why there cannot be a seperate bank server or whatnot for each farm handling bank info.  I am not sure why they must split the banks or else load them in every zone creating server burden.   Non linked banks sound like a real pain in the butt.<br>
<br>
Breakable items?  Forget it.   Oops you just broke your blade of carnage!  Your staff of the shissar has 43 charges remaining!   NO THANK YOU : P   Don't go down this road.  Realism is not always a good thing.<br>
<br>
Focus on trade skill items and not on dropped items?  Bad.  So now to get some of the best items in the game you do not have to assemble 50 people and work together for months honing tactics and gearing up for that uber encounter.  Instead you have to run around town for 3 weeks sticking metal bits in the forge, and farming rare components for the armor.   Once again... realism does not always = fun.   This may be fun for SOME, but for the majority of the people that play EQ, based on the people I know and play with, this is not their idea of a good time.<br>
<br>
One of the main draws to EQ is the WOW of some of the ITEMS.  You do not get this &quot;wow&quot; factor with tradeskill items.   Someone has a Cloak of Flames?  (yeah yeah I am old school I still think CoF is cool  : P )   There is a WOW you killed Nagafen!  Associated with that.   Someone has a smithed +36% splint haste cloak that everyone with 200 smithing  ( and since everyone is going to be forced into trade skills.... everyone will get one) ... it's not gonna be &quot;WOW&quot;  it's gonna be &quot;oh.&quot;   Sure... there may be drops, but if the focus is on tradeskills that spells doom.   EQ1 has the right idea.  Tradeskills should be used in questing, and not as a staple for the provision of armor and weapons to the community.  Cool stuff should require some fancy kills.  EQ1 has this done right, and I do feel this is one of the main contributors to the success of EQ over other games.<br>
<br>
<br>
The skill advancment system doesn't sound promising....  ever heard of the famous &quot;fighter mage&quot;?  It'll end up like that.  Limitless possibilities of advancment always have problems.   EQ's strict molds based upon class choice is a good thing.  With skill type advancment comes regret.... &quot;crap I shouldn't have put those 3 points into 2H skill way back when... now I am gimped&quot;  &quot;damn I should have trained some healing better around level 10... now I'm stuck with weak nukes and heals and mediocre melee&quot;  &quot;ugh I never should have trained poison.... that skill isn't even working and my melee is so bad because of it, I am useless&quot;    Not good.  Maybe Verant will pull this off but it would be one of the first times I have seen it.  There will be the &quot;uber&quot; combination, and once it is found, if you don't restart and go close to that route, you will find yourself inadequate in the high end game.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've played the current EQ for 3 and a half years now.  No game has ever kept my interest even 4% as long.  Nothing.   The current EQ model WORKS.  There are shortcomings.  Expand on the CURRENT model, work on what it is missing, add content, keep old content, make it work together, and you have a game that will hands down remain the champion over other games that hit the market.<br>
<br>
Make EQ2 standalone, and change the game as much as it sounds, and people WILL try the other games out there, which is a bad thing.   There is no draw back if another game isnt so much fun.  People come back to EQ because of time invested.  Try DAOC?  Fun for a month... gets boring... come back to EQ.  Try AO?  Fun for a month... gets boring... come back to EQ.   If EQ2 is not the DEFINATIVE best on the market, the competition will gain bits and pieces and greater chunks of the pie.<br>
<br>
Anyways... I'm rambling  : )   Lots of bad moves with EQ 2 it seems.  Many things, in my opinion, should be reconsidered.  I don't have a shred of experience in game design, but I've played far too many games for far to much time for my own good  : P  I know what I like.  I know, for the most part, what those I have played with for years and years, like.  I hear no excitement about EQ2 from those around me.  None.  Talk to your players Verant.  Work with them.  See what they want.  See what they like.  And make EQ 2 as close to that as possible.<br>

A lot of the skill system is based on DAoC's style of skill system, right?  Well DAoC had no problems divulging the skill information for players to pore over and &quot;pre-design&quot; their class...  VI on the otherhand, rarely leaks even the most basic of information.  This means a lot of gimped characters with screwed up skillsets because they had to blindly drop points into a skill and hope something good comes of it...<br>

They just don't seem to work.  If people want to be able to play more unique types of classes let them, just use sub classes to do that.  From a balancing standpoint it will be much easier because you know what you are dealing with.  <br>
<br>
Thats the major reason I've left dark age, I got tired of remaking my character due to mispent points.  I liked being Gaav the Rogue in EQ, not Cessation the 37Sword, 34CS, 20Envenom Shadowblade.  (made up numbers, I cant remember what I really had)  I like knowing that what makes me better than the other rogue standing next to me is my knowledge of the zone and pathing.  That I can control my aggro and won't be a mana drain.   <br>
<br>
I don't want to be forced plan my character so much, and study it so much to insure that I build him correctly.  The game isn't fun when it requires that much worrying.  Its fun when I can get online, do some dungeon crawling in a lesser used dungeon, camp and item with my friends.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvariavespasa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VariaVespasa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/25/02 6:47:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23434.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ2</span><hr size=1> Tilara may be right about the bank thing.

1) Item wear sucks, if u think its cool, u have never played a game with it long term.<br>
<br>
2) Houses suck also, they clutter the beautiful landscapes, and require guards. Paid or non paid,  PC or NPC are gunna try to steal from u or break into them.<br>
<br>
3) Non global banking sucks, but is tolerable since it can allow u more bank space for storage (and u gunna need it cuz your stuff wears out).<br>
<br>
4) Item breakage sucks.<br>
