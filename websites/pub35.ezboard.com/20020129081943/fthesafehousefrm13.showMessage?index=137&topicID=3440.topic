I think this was mentioned in this thread twice.<br>
<br>
Heres a summary I cut/pasted/altered/tweaked/added to from information posted here and myself doing the quest.  Hopefully this will alleviate repeat questions and allow us to focus on finding Valdanov.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Summary</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
The Vampyre Threat <br>
Name: Phenic Dionicas <br>
Location: Main castle, top left side 'church-like' room, upper Katta <br>
Summary: Long quest in which you seek to eliminate the Vampyre threat to Katta <br>
Reward: Unknown</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Step 1: The quest starts with Phenic Dionicas in the Castle in Katta Castellum. You say, 'i will track down the defilers' Phenic hands you a note which he asks you to take to a record keeper in Shadow Haven. Go and see Record Keeper Ajar in Shadow Haven and give him the note. He returns to you a list of names. Go back to Katta Castellum and give the list to Phenic. Phenic then gives you a medallion. He tells you to go ask Nathyn Illuminous about a person by the name of Valdanov Zevfeer. <br>
<br>
Step 2: Nathyn is located in a small house near the ramp to the lower area of Katta, its guarded outside by a couple Sonic Wolves. Give the medallion to him and he cooperates. Ask him about Valdanov Zafeer. Go through his dialog and he sends you back to Phenic with a report. Phenic then sends you out to the Tenebrous Mountains to give a set of orders to Legionnaire Falion. You may have to wait a while until it's his shift, but he is right by the gate to Katta on the right side if you are facing Katta <br>
<br>
Step 3: Give him the orders. He tells you he's seen a strange Vah Shir walking between the Cotierie Village, and Katta Castellum. The one you're looking for is a cat person named Kerzar Clawtore. He will be indifferent, and roams near a tower filled with named vampyres and coterie generals and centurions. The Vah Shir is a timed spawn. 30 Minutes after you turn in your note to Falion, he will spawn over by the Vamp Castle and roam. Give him the medallion. You will get the medallion back. He will then attack you. Kill him, and he will drop to his knees. At this point he invis's himself. Just put see invis on, and you'll see him again. Ask him about Valdanov. Go through his schpiel and ask him 'what abilities' and he will despawn, leaving an &quot;old bone key&quot; on your cursor. 4 coterie generals will spawn and start to beat on you. You can run if you want. Head back to Katta Castellum. <br>
<br>
Step 4: Go back to Nathyns house. On the first floor, right hand side there is a secret wall. Inside is a locked chest. It's actually a mob and will accept trades. Give the chest your old bone key. The guards in the room call you an idiot, and an autarkic shade spawns. Blue to 60, casts what looked to be necro spells, Scourge and Fear being his favorites. Was very easy to solo. When he dies, he drops a Autarkic Shade Lord Belt and a worn research book. Opening the book reveals it's research done by Valdanov on vampyres. <br>
<br>
<br>
Step 5: After killing the chest mob, give the book to Phenic. He'll send you to the Magus building so they can conduct the seance/exorcism. You need to find Lathin Firetree. He is on the 3rd floor (click the sumbol on the wall twice). Give him the Shade Belt and the instructions from Phenic. He gives you a pottery sketch and a bottle of Glaze. You need to combine the sketch, a flask of water, and a Large Brick of Clay in a Pottery Wheel. Need over 100 skill. Combine the resulting Idol with the Glaze and a HQ Firing Sheet in a Kiln for the final product. Return to Lathin and give him the Idol. He gives you an Idol back, and I believe Enchanted Records. <br>
<br>
Step 6: Lathin tells you the ceremony has begun. 3 mages are gathering on the first floor of the Magus building. He tells you to give the Idol he just gave back to you to Theurgus Ajeea Pulaja. Give her the new Idol and the summoning Ceremoy begins. Do not attack the Shade immediately, there is some dialog and then when done he repops (with 3 friends) and aggros you. The best thing to do is have a couple friends (or 1 with fear) waiting outside the Magus building. After the Lord repops aggro pull them to the group 1 at a time and kill them. Each of the 4 has a Robe. <br>
<br>
Incantator Jak Masric says 'Eliminate the shades and I will get Ajeea to safety and concentrate on a ward to prevent any further intrusion and stifle the shades power! Seek me out and bring me the robes of these shades when they have been slain so that we may research a more permanent ward against such creatures on the Conlegium.' <br>
<br>
Give the robes to Jak Masric to receive your Magus token <br>
<br>
Step 6: Return the Enchanted Records to Phenic. He goes thru some dialogue and tells you it is almost complete. He tells you to return Valdanovs Ashes, your Magus token, and your 3rd Medallion to him for an honorable reward. <br>
<br>
Phenic Dionicas says 'There is much that is disturbing about these revelations. I will make sure the Validus Custodus is alert than they already are to the presence of powerful vampyre among our citizens. If you can find this Valdanov Zevfeer slay him and bring me his ashes your Katta Castellum Badge of Service, and your Magus Conlegium Token I will bestow upon you an honorable reward. <br>
<br>
The whereabouts of Valdanov are unknown.<br>

It later says &quot;I shall continue my experiments&quot;.. as in, he never began the study of Akhevan blood, and was in the process of doing so.<br>
<br>
Now, from that information at hand, my speculation is that Valdanov and the Shade went into Akheva, and the Shade turned against Valdanov, perhaps because he knew vital information about the Akhevans. There are reports of locked chests being in Akheva. Perhaps the Shade locked Valdanov in one of the chests, and stole his journal to continue the experiments alone. Phenic later locked the Shade in the chest which is inside Nathyn's towers, forever locking away the studies of Vampyres in Lucin.<br>
<br>

Where did you get the Enchanted Records? And is it really necessary since all turning in the Enchanted records do is reveal the final 3 items to complete the quest.
