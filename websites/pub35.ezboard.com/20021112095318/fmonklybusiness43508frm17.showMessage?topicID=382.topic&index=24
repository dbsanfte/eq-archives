VI can ramp up or down what percent chance stun has of happening on a successful kick.  Already we miss quite often on our FKs, so that will cut down naturally on how often we get a check for the &quot;bash/stun&quot; effect.<br>
<br>
The plate classes just got an increase in this last patch to some of their defensive skill caps.<br>
<br>
In recent patches SK's got harmshield, all casters got better stacking potential of their dots on mobs, Plate classes got a vastly improved bash (95 damage is avg now, with interrupt/stun), Casters have steadily been given more and more and more goodies with focus items, great aaxp to cut down casting times, mana costs, do insanely more damage (60 wiz I know with 70 aaxp crits like every 3d cast, does 3551 dm on some of those crits of sunstrike, many many insane dm crits)<br>
<br>
Monks on the other hand, have gotten jack and sh$t.  The majority of the aa's VI offered the monk class to purchase are based on tanking/melee defense: Double riposte, return kick, etc,  and then they go and nerf our tanking role after setting us on an aa path with these aa's based on tanking.  <br>
<br>
Make it up to us , Verant. At the least give us a &quot;bash&quot; ability on our flying kicks. That would be one thing that could help alot and in the process give us a little hope on the pvp servers too that we might survive some of these encounters with the uber super powered casters ( seen the latest focus item for epic mage pet? in duel vs another epic mage pet without the effect, it chewed that pet up and still had 60% life, and regenned at 7 percent a tick. 7% !!! If you have ever had an epic mage pet on your ass in pvp, you know that they were serious, fatal trouble to begin with. And now this! Give the monks a bone! give us  stun!)<br>

Your optimism is impressive. This is, as far as VI is concerned, a desperately needed re-balancing to bring monks back in line. As such it doesn't entitle monks to anything.<br>

And most other classes seem to agree with VI.<br>

<br>
My votes goes to:<br>
<br>
1) Chance of stun on flying kick (or any special attack)<br>
2) increased run (eg. run 4, 5)<br>
<br>
preference for first... The problem with just giving better AAXP skills is that MONKS BELOW LEVEL 50 ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY NERF!!! So by giving all monks a chance of a stun it would help all monks attacking ability... restricting any bonuses to solely &gt;50 means many monks have to put up with broken class for 50 levels!<br>
<br>
Others have made excellent arguments why stun on special attack would be great (and balanced since many other classes already get it...), so I won't add to it... Verant need to throw us a bone to placate us (even a little one) and this sounds as good as any. <br>
<br>
Increased run skill makes sense too...helps newly broken FD pull... we have a low weight limit so why shouldn't we be able to run faster than plate wearers? (at the risk of bringing reality check arguments in).<br>
<br>
Verant have stated we should be balanced more at offence than defence...yet we get defensive AA skills... well prove it Verant! Now is your chance...you have obviously completely stuffed up monk class design so far... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulaughingowl2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>laughingOwl2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 8:11:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Changes.</span><hr size=1> 1) My preferred.  Look at what they said they wanted, look at the results and change patch.<br>
<br>
Maxxed out gear monks are reporting little change (where the 'problem' was,  normal to low-end gear monks are reporting being slaughtered.  Perhaps somebody made a mistake in how the patch was applied?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2)  If they patch really needs to stand (especially as is), the look at increasing the offense of a monk. (especially for solo).<br>
<br>
My preferred is either through /disc's  or as natural check on our specials give them a low chance to have an 'effect'.<br>
<br>
Give tiger claw a small chance to have an attack debuff (as you strike their eyes?)<br>
<br>
Give Dragon punch a small chance to stun.<br>
<br>
Give us an attack that cripple a mob (chance to snare effect)<br>
<br>
Give us an attack the staggers a mob (slows).<br>
<br>
Now I would see all of these special be like ID, in that the effect lasts barely longer than the recycle timer.  No way that you could get more than one effect on the mob (especially with the occasional resist), but you could perhaps keep one on during half the fight (presuming 50/50 resists).<br>
<br>
Grouped it would unlikely change the monks role.  I would see these effects be far inferious then the 'spells' of other classes, and grouped a monk would not be doing them to avoid aggro (especialy post nerf).<br>
<br>
Solo however it might allow us (the normal monk) to continue to slowly eek out expierence.  As other have mentioned I solo for two reasons<br>
<br>
1)  a lot of my play time is for an hour here, 30 minutes there, very non-conducive to grouping.<br>
<br>
2) A lot of my group play is pulling for raids.  Well as puller, I die alot (no big deal and I will die before group) and am rarely in the expierence group (since alot of times I sit out of the fight lying FD some place.  So short story a lot of my group action I LOSE exp,  how do I regain.....  slowly pounding out the very low dark blues (which already have had exp nerfed) to rebuild (and or gain exp).<br>
<br>
Please give me a means (short of dedicating myself to an uber guild to become major puller, and so I get PL'd to 60 with a few score AAs, and then do nothing but pull for said guild 24/7  (with occasional time out of game for food).... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utibbil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tibbil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/18/02 5:52:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes.</span><hr size=1> You have a point about the lower monks feeling the nerf more then higher ones. But please, alot of people here are exagerating the nerf. I had the same trouble soloing before the nerf that i do now. &quot;Oh because you have a fungi!&quot; I tried w/o fungi and still had the same trouble, fungi only really helps me in soloing for downtime. People complaining that they cant solo anymore barely could in the first place. They saw the vision of soloing barely in thier grasps and now they are whinning that they need to wait longer.<br>
<br>
The only way to do what VI visions us as is to nerf our gear. Reduce our HP/Stam ration, reduce HP on our gear.  Geeze ive said this all before. Notice how these changes would nerf my ability to solo too. OMG a monk thinking outside his class, riot!<br>
<br>
All of these effects on our hits... I doubt VI would impliment them, and if they did they would be AA skills. You complain about how you die alot in exp groups and you find it hard to keep up with exp? /shrug I know alot of monks who die alot in raids but still keep ahead of me in exp. You need to think about your playstyle a bit. gasp maybe your guild sucks and its making you die alot?  Not sure but that exp thing just doesnt sound right. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=139385>Sionistic Triplefist</a><Br>
