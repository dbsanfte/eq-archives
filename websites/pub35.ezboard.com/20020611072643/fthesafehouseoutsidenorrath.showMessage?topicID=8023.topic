IE she pulls you into the office and yells at you or writes you up (meaning your failure or whatever is noted in your file...enough of those and you are fired), you do something she feels you shouldnt be, you are reprimanded in whatever way she deems fit (again write ups, cleaning bathrooms, back to back shifts of closing one evening at 11 then being back to work to open at 8 am etc etc). She has also has been known to take out her problems on the workers...especially the ones she knows will not fight back...if she is having trouble with her home life she will bring it to work and make us all miserable...if she is late to work and someone else is late to work she will pull them into the office and reprimand them for being late even though she was late (this has happened to me on one occasion and a fellow worker at least once that I know of) these are just things that come to mind right now...there are a whole slew of other things she has done or does...<br>
<br>
<br>
What I fear is she will use this new system to basically put her thumb on us and perhaps go so far as to falsify something to get some of those, she does not like, fired or make them quit.<br>
<br>
I am curious as to what exactly this system can be used for and what the legal limitations on such a thing are...<br>
<br>
(I appologise if it sounds like I am on a warpath against her or that I wish to have her removed from her position)(I do not...I am just curious as to what the rights of the worker are in this situation)<br>

Sounds like she's got her issues but it sounds like, as far as monitoring your activities, she's within her rights.<br>

You should read some of the other threads right now about how some folks co-workers aren't pulling their loads.

Those very politicians that rely on corporate funding to sponsor their campaigns.<br>
<br>
In corporate america the individual has very few rights pertaining to privacy. Now mind you this is not legal advice, but they have the right to monitor your phone calls, read all your emails, watch what you do on your computer and monitor you with video survailence 24/7.<br>
<br>
What they cannot do is monitor you where you have an expectation of privacy. i.e. in the bathroom or a supposed private conference room if you are visiting your lawyer or spiritual advisor etc. Quite frankly if they want to watch every little tiny thing you do with a camera 5 inches from your face they can. If it is really getting to you I would suggest complaining to management that the adverse work conditions are effecting the employees abilities to work effectively and is hurting the bottom line.<br>
<br>
This woman sounds like a real jerk, and if she is really that bad you might want to talk to her about it. If that fails go over her head and file a complaint against her. If you can get enough employees to file complaints she will have to undergo a change of attitude. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.aodoctors.org/Cross.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 12:08:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8023.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.myezboard.com:81/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/aodoctors/images/weeee.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need some help finding Information</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What they cannot do is monitor you where you have an expectation of privacy. i.e. in the bathroom or a supposed private conference room if you are visiting your lawyer or spiritual advisor etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Why would I want my lawyer or pastor to come see me at work? That seems like something to be done on my time, not my employer's time.<br>
