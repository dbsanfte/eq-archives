Well, when evade was changed it was changed to a level that was fairly effective at the time.  As damage ramps up it has certainly become less and less useful.<br><br>I can recall clearly using evade when I wanted to, to try and maintain near aggro without actually tanking.  This was tricky at times but allowed me to grab aggro off of a caster if needed while still not becoming a manasponge for the healers.  Frankly, these days, I pretty much evade every time it refreshes and go from there.  Without any fancy weapons (RB and Fleshgrinder) I still end up with more aggro than I'd like and I'll certainly end up tanking for stretches (or, more likely, end up not attacking for a while) if the tank is a few levels below me or is underequipped.<br><br>Remember when evade dropped you to last on the hatelist?  That was deemed too powerful, although I'm still not sure the solution was a fair compromise.  Monks can now do this fairly reliably and Rangers can at least adjust their aggro to the situation with good success.  Present day evade though is either a set amount (and that becomes less meaningful as raw damage numbers increase) or a simple drop in place, which is really often temporary.  As more and more high-end Rogue weapons rely on procs and as MOBs increase in raw HP, evade is becoming watered down as it would inevitably do.<br><br>Either a percentage hate reduction instead of a flat amount or an adjustment, based on level, in the success rate would be something to be considered.  Perhaps even the placement drop could have a chance of dropping you to 3rd, 4th or 5th even.  I could even live with Rapid/Improved Evade as an AA ability, although I am not certain we should need to spend AA points to maintain parity in evade with the mudflation.  We were once the best at controlling our aggro and we certainly no longer are, in my opinion.<br><br>Without any changes, I'll get by ok.  It *does* effect the DPS that we are putting out though, skewing not only backstab availability numbers but also the amount of time we can be attacking at all in many situations.  When balance is considered, this is a contributing issue. <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Blackguard of The Nameless<br></font></b><font color=CYAN size=2><i>"The church is near but the road is icy; the bar is far away but I'll walk carefully." ~Russian Proverb</i> </font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufabcorpse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FabCorpse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/29/02 4:11:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23086.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://bloodlust.tromaville.com/rathole2/bentface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: evade success, needs upgrade, thoughts?</span><hr size=1> I think evade is fine the way it is...sure, it makes life harder for us, but it also forces us to play the game more. Whenever I see high-end rogues (I'm 47 now) bragging about how much damage they do per second with procs..etc...I am glad that the agro factor is there. As it is, the group has to work together a lot more. If we could evade easily, then what fun would it be? For me, I enjoy having to constantly think about whether or not I am going to attract the mobs anger and adjusting to it...<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubayler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bayler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/29/02 4:19:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23086.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: evade success, needs upgrade, thoughts?</span><hr size=1> A couple thoughts:<br><br>1. Client/server timing.  Evade has a lot of steps for such an essential tool: make sure you're not moving, wait until the button pops, turn off autoattack, hit hide, turn on autoattack.  The problem is, sometimes the packets carrying these messages arrive at the server out of order, or before the server's timers are up.  This happens particularly when your ping times are varying a lot, or when you're getting a lot of packet loss.  If you're failing on evade a lot, try playing around with pauses between steps.  Yeah, it will slow down your damage output, but not nearly as much as tanking for 30 seconds does.  (I find that in raid situations, I often have to wait a full second from when the button pops to when I hit hide, in order to be successful.)  Evade *should* work 2/3 of the time.<br><br>2. Procing weapons.  I'm a long way off from NToV gear, so I can't claim that I know the options, or even what game play is like at that stage.  But I wonder if it would be viable for you to get a proc-less weapon?  I'm sure the proc adds to your combat effectiveness one way or another - either damage or debuf, or whatever - but if it's creating so much agro that you're a mana sponge and can't backstab, it sounds like it's probably not worth it.<br><br>I don't know if any of this is useful to you.

Procing weapons are a big factor but probably the most important thing is letting your tank get some agro before you engage.  On uber mobs, if you dont let your tanks gain agro for at least a few seconds before you start poking I can gaurantee you that you will out agro them.  During normal grinds, give your tank maybe 2-3 seconds just to let him hit taunt first and get a few hits in.<br><br>Procs also play a role and some weapon procs agro alot more than others.  If you have a Willsapper and a SoD youre going to get agro.  Salindrite Dagger and a Smoulder and youve got a bit less chance.<br><br>The other thing to keep in mind is who is pulling.  Its at least twice as hard (for me anyway) to lose agro if I was the one pullling the mob.<br><br>Evade is fine the way it is, I only ever get agro on certain mobs and even then only under awkward circumstances, such as Dain catapulting all the tanks, tanks dying, etc.  What  needs to be looked at is the stupid rampage list.<br><br>Tobie Baine<br>Assassin<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=23086.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=23086.topic&start=41&stop=59>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=23086.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23086.topic&index=21><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=23086.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=23086.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23086.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23086.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
