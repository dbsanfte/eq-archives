I was thinking Critical Strike should be just that, massive strikes that inflict deadly blows at high cost to the assassin.<br>
<br>
Ponder this: if CS did 2 or 3x the damage it does now, but cost 3-4x the endurance, would it be more in line with the way most of us wish to play our classes?<br>
<br>
If the PA/CD/SS chain took ALL our endurance, but each style did 2-3x what they do now..<br>
<br>
If Garrote/AH did 2-3x what they do now, but we could only throw about 3 or 4 of them...<br>
<br>
This would make the normal melee styles useful,and make our CS moves &quot;finishing blows&quot; or &quot;crippling attacks&quot; as many of us would like them to be.<br>

No way there should be a damage increase. If there's something that needs to be looked at, it's how close you hit to the maximum damage cap, since it seems pretty much impossible to hit for more than 40-50% of the cap on epic armor.

I hear them whining about Left Axe, and frankly I don't see why any of them would bother with it any more than Infiltrators would with dual wield.<br>
<br>
I spend quite a bit of time in Caledonia, and in my various dealings with SBs I've come to realize a few things as simple realities.  I'm level 34 currently and most of the SBs are level 35.  I maxed my dual wield, stupid me.  <br>
<br>
1) If they crit me before I them, I'm dead.  They crit for at least 630 damage, each individual is very consistent in their damage (plus or minus 20 damage).  I get the impression that they DO hit near or right on their cap every perf vs. a blue Infiltrator)  For a frame of reference, I hit blue con players wearing chain (weak to thrust weapons) for 320 damage MAX.<br>
<br>
2) An orange con SB can do twice as much damage with a non-crit style than I can do with a perfectly executed perf. This isn't extra critical damage.  They do it on every hit.  Trust me, this is something I'm overly familiar with.<br>
<br>
An example of the best-case scenario drag-em-out brawl with an SB:<br>
<br>
I find Jarran wandering alone on the battlegrounds.  He sucks, so I perf him, around 130 to 150 damage, off-hand weapon does another 13 damage.  Two poisons successfully applied.  His blinks and casually opens with some unknown axe style.  The one he always uses, for around 270 damage.  I swing both weapons two more times, around 20 to 30 damage on main weapon, 10 to 20 on offhand.  He's at about two thirds life.  He swings again, another 270 damage.  One more round of that, he's still got more than half of his HPs, I'm dead with about 150 damage overkill.  Of course, I never hang around anymore so that he can do this damage.  I'm not stupid =)<br>
<br>
Everyone in Albion, irrespective of class, reports insane amounts of damage from these freaks of nature.  Why Mythic has decided to let one class remain the one-shot crit masters of the game is beyond me.  I rather like how my class has turned out.  I don't think giving me a two-handed weapon would be reasonably fair to any of the people I battle with every night.  I need ideal conditions for a clean kill that will take 3 or 4 rounds of hits, and that gives them a sporting chance to survive if they didn't run far out of range of any assistance.  This is rediculous folks.  Everyone but an SB will tell you the same.  I'm sure they love slaughtering people like cattle, but it gets a little old when you're on the receiving end. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/02 10:21:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3691.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> once you grow up to be a big infil then you can say how good or bad critblades are. until then,its rather silly to equate how good a critblade is to the joke that levels 0-35 are.<br>

critblades are absurdly easy to defeat,for other rogues. <br>
<br>
they also wont one shot in most cases as they get to 40+,yes it can happen but generally not against even con players.<br>

I don't normally flame people, but your kind of posts piss me off. Your talking about nefing a class, when you are totally uninformed, and basing all your information off BATTLEGROUND experiences. Let me point out some flaws in what your saying:<br>
1) Yep if a 2h SB crits you, your dead. Lets analyze why. Well, he crit'd you first of all, and you didnt crit him. Your specs are probably gimped if you have DW maxed at level 34. Hes a level higher than you. And you are using thrust with a - to him, hes using slash with a + to you. What.... you think you should be winning these fights?! OH, and about your bitch on your perf cap vs his. Find a slower weapon. Odds are the SB is using one at least 2 seconds slower than yours. Thats good and bad. He is trading front loaded damage for a huge delay. His odds of getting CD off are a lot lower than yours. (oh your specs are gimped, I forgot - you probably dont have Critical Strike maxed and have CD, even though your complaining about not match a crit blades perf). <br>
2) QUIT COMPLAINING ABOUT ORANGES. When you have serious problems with even con people and you have a decent spec come back whining to these boards. You are at a huge disadvantage one on one when there is a con difference - regardless of how many levels it is.<br>
<br>
Strike what I just said. Dont come back whining to these boards until your 50, and you've respeced, and your 2.5 spec points per level have caught up, and you have Dragonfang, and have a clue how this game is played, and have some RvR under your belt besides the battlegrounds!!<br>
<br>
I have a lot more issues with your post. Like that you totally ignore the fact that you actually can attack chain wearers - including midgards tank classes. Guess how well that sword the SB is using does against any other melee target other than you?<br>
<br>

I think as it stands, the PA combo<br>
<br>
<br>
PA/CD/SS takes more than enough endurance already.<br>
<br>
Testing shows you can get off 6 Garrotes, but only 5 Garrote/AH chains.. <br>
<br>
Critical Strike line DEFINATELY uses enough endurance.  If anything, I'd like the PA to get some sort of ignore % absorb.<br>
<br>
Not a full ignore, but enough to make this strike DEADLY. <p><p><p style="text-align: left; font-size: 80%; font-family: Verdana">Balor Gafdan Nightshade of Guinivere<br><i>What life brings, is it ours to take?.<br>Your pain feeds my soul, feeds my hunger<br>Shadows dance about my tortured being.

<br>
There was a time... way back pre 1.50... but that's long gone.  Now they are just like normal rogues with a slow 2h sword (not that 2h is bad).  Evade fixes and realm skill points, as well as epic armor and one shot nerf pretty much destroyed any crit spec person.<br>
<br>
And people complaining about not being able to kill oranges have issues - seek help.  Yellows, I can see if its a 50/50 thing, blues and lower is justified by captain obvious, but oranges - no way.<br>
<br>
And really, just to pick at somethings in the previous post, Its not too hard to land a CD with the improved /stick and snare poison, even with a slow weapon (actually it gives more time for stick to work)<br>
<br>
If midgard had thrust, you still wouldnt be able to fight any tanks other than mercenaries, well that is if you want attack bonuses.  The other 2 classes in the entire game that you would recieve attack bonuses too  have insta mez / stun.  Coincidentally, all of these classes are in albion also, so you are out of luck vs hibs.  That sword SB does just as well vs heroes / champions / druids as i do.<br>

Dragonfang requires lots of levels of dodger to make viable (i have it).  Even then it cant be used after CD, making it a risky thing to rely on.  Ignore pain &gt; Dragonfang + dodger also.   I would much rather blast somebody to pieces on a perf chain, than have to wait for them to start swinging so i can use Dragonfang, which doesnt necessarily guarentee me a win because it still takes about 6-8 rounds of solo attention to finish the person (epic armor person).  If they have IP up, its over also cause my dodger spec is soo ridiculously high that I dont have the extra 24? pts for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uanduinlejeune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anduin Le Jeune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/02 2:54:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3691.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> *sigh*  Well I wish I could say I didn't see this coming.<br>

&quot;Your talking about nefing a class&quot;<br>
<br>
The word is nerf.  I'm asking for reasoning between the vast difference between an Infiltrator and a Shadowblade.  I'll have to assume that an educated person can tell the difference.<br>
<br>
&quot;when you are totally uninformed, and basing all your information off BATTLEGROUND experiences.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh sorry, I didn't realize the battlegrounds weren't a part of the game.  You're right, let's just give SBs polearms through level 35 because the battlegrounds don't really matter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your specs are probably gimped if you have DW maxed at level 34.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riiiiight.  Everyone knows that you can't raise TWO skills to max.  Especially not with that extra .5 points that Infs get.  Hmmmmmmmmmm.  Can you say &quot;red herring&quot;?  I wish my logic classes were that easy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Find a slower weapon.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm using a gladius.  If you find something slower, be sure to let the world know.  Guess I could use a shod staff if there was a fletcher around to make em.  Lol<br>
<br>
&quot;2) QUIT COMPLAINING ABOUT ORANGES.  You are at a huge disadvantage one on one when there is a con difference - regardless of how many levels it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I didn't have the same problem with the single yellow con Shadowblade I've ever run into on the battlegrounds I wouldn't have worried about it.  But you didn't ask did ya?  Nooooo just flame away.  Don't worry, I don't mind.  I enjoy it =)  <br>
<br>
It's not as though I just spent my first night on the battlegrounds with the firecrackers going off.  I have 2 level 35s and a 34.  Every class but one on the other realms I appreciate.  They seem to be rather balanced.  Even the long duration stuns and mezzes can be dealt with given a reasonably larger attacking force on your side.  But an SB?  You're still talking 170 damage vs an even con PALADIN in full platemail.  Perf damage is about 3 quarters of that Paladin's HPs.  I'd like to see an even con SB lose to someone one on one.  Really.  The experienced Inf community on the battlegrounds (screw &quot;real&quot; RvR, some people have lives and can't get to level 50 overnight.) recognizes SBs as a force to be taken in overwhelming numbers.  You take them 3 to 1 , MAYBE 2 to 1 with skilled players and a little luck, or you don't take them at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, Im wasting my time. Im done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Friend, you've wasted the time of anyone that bother reading this thread.  You should owe money.<br>
I'd argue the point a bit more thoroughly but it's obvious that my comments have fallen on the ears of ego-centric level 50 Shadowblades that don't want to see their one-shot kills threatened at the cost of game balance.  Ohhh surrrrreee you aren't an SB, and I bet you'll even claim to not have a single level 50.  We believe you.  Really.  I dare you to claim it.<br>

As for your experiences in BG, I don't see much of a problem - you say you're hitting for 270 in 2 swings per combat round to the 270 of your opponent's one swing, so basically you're doing the same damage.  I don't know your envenom spec so no assumptions as to how much damage your lethal poison is doing.  Ditto your opponent's envenom.  You say at the end of the fight your opponent is only 50% health, is he wearing a lot of +hp, +con gear?  Are you?  Fighting oranges doesn't help your case, try picking up a season and going back to the BGs to see if anything is different. <p>------------------------------<BR>

<br>
You mentioned several statistics about your level 34 infiltrator. I too had a level 34 infiltrator, on Guinevere. He is thrusting specced, like you. I believe his cs/thrust was 33/29. You said your offhand hits for 10-20? I don't recall my offhand ever hitting for less then 35-40 in RVR with this character, using a main gauche, and often more in the realm of 50. My main hand was a crafted guarded rapier (3.6 dly), and a garrote routinely hit for ~120. Perfs, if I recall correctly, capped at 372. For comparison, my L35 Shadowblade on Nimue, when he was L35, capped at 646 with a 5.5 delay greatsword. If a shadowblade ever got the drop on me, I could expect to be soundly destroyed, but if I got the drop on them, the same would happen. My current main is a slash specced Infil on Percival, which, incidentally, owns SB's like red-headed step children.<br>

Frankly, even though you &quot;can&quot; raise DW to level, it's one of the only two ways to effectively gimp an infiltrator (the other being max speccing both weapon types) in relation to the other assassin classes.<br>
<br>
As many here have said, judging class capabilities at L34 is a Bad Thing. <br>

It's true, in the grand scheme of things, they really don't. They are a good place to learn how to line up a perf on a running player, or how to hunt archers, but they are *not* a good place to base class balance discussions.

<br>
I'd love to see shadowblades running around with two-handed weapons on Percival. At least then there would be an even con I could kill.<br>
<br>
The battlegrounds only matter in one respect: they are filled with pouty cry-babies who, through their ignorance and whining, managed to jolt Mythic into implimenting  poorly thought-out, knee-jerk reaction, gameplay destroying nerfs.<br>
<br>
Since the introduction of the battlegrounds Mythic has been doing nothing but wasting valuable developer time handing out nerfs in order to appease the moronic masses that base their entire pool of knowledge on one foray into the level 20-24 battleground.<br>
<br>
Instead of getting disguise like we were promised "by the new year" we get a sack of nerfs. Oh sure, it's tough being an Infiltrator and Shadowblade... try being a Nightshade--a class that still has difficulty soloing blue cons in PvE even with 90% weapon spec. Look out! My perforate artery did 112 points of damage! I'm crrrrrrrrrazy!<br>
<br>
Ask me if I hate the battlegrounds. ;)<br>
<br>
I'd like to thank every whiny little caster for getting my Nightshade so heavily nerfed that now there is no one who can reliably kill casters and they can singlehandedly kill group after group. Thanks for getting archers nerfed to the point where they're too frightened to leave the keeps and scout so now the assassins have to. Thanks for getting the only light tank that was scary (berserker) nerfed to the point where I managed to kill one in a poisonless, berserk-less melee (with a little help from a druid). Thanks for getting poison damage nerfed after it was just increased in power two months ago. Thanks for screaming and moaning about how all-powerful assassins were and convincing Mythic that your class needs more attention (and unless yer a blademaster or mercenary, yer wrong).<br>
<br>
The basic balance "range > melee > stealth > range" is now "range > all" thanks you to battleground babies. Not just any range though, nope, just spells since the arrow miss rate is still somewhere around 33% misses against an even target.  I'm sure casters would through a fit if even cons resisted their spells 33% of the time. Not to mention if there were a level 19 skill that would make assassins and archers immune to the first spelled cast. I hope you're happy with the game you've ruined, battlegrounders.<br>
<br>
No, go on, ask me how I feel about the battlegrounds. /flips off the battlegrounders<br>
<br>
The single worst thing to ever get put into the game was the battlegrounds. It's been nothing but nerfs since the patch after they went in. I'd pay to have the battlegrounds ripped out and for the frontiers to be restricted to levels 40+.<br>
<br>
Maybe then I'd get disguise, a house, and spellcrafted weapons.<br>
<br>
Bitter? Me? Yep. You try struggling through 45 levels of assassin life with hopes of being, well, an assassin only to find out you're a suicide bomber--and 50% of the time you can't even kill your intended victim.<br>

Not only do I agree that making up the issues of BG imbalances with lowbie items, but how about this...<br>
<br>
Implement a new sem-epic lvl quest called &quot;Coming of Age&quot; and have 3 parts, one at 24, one at 30, and one at 35 to coincide with the high lvls of the Battlegrounds. Offer the quest to all classes/realms like the epics, but provide in it items that can help level the playing field in the BG to help reflect real RvR more.<br>
<br>
One thing I did in the 24 BG for fun was take my Skald, and give him a full set of emerald DF stuff.. Sure its all purple to him, but most of the magic works.. What did this do tho.. Well I literally spend his last two nights in the Battleground, for over 4 hours total killing and only came close to death once or twice, never in fact dying. Would I expect to do that in real RvR, HECK NO.. But sure was fun while it lasted.<br>
<br>
The flip side is my Critblade/Env spec'd blade hit the BG's, and went probably 50-50 kill wise.. I could take out casters easily, but due to the fact that I was autotraining stealth I was assasin bait. However any assasin that didnt kill me got a nasty surprise with my rather high env skill (was 25ish at the time with items) in the 24 bg.<br>
<br>
How do these characters fare now? Well the Skald is still a lowbie, and really just a BG/For fun character, while my SB just turned 48! At 48 I have lifebane, Decent Weapon/CS spec, and 50 stealth with items. The kicker is this weekend I managed to either kill, or unstealth to their deaths just about every 50 stealther on the other realms. And imagine some of their surpsie that a Critblade was hitting for 70+/tick from pioson.. Its all due to a planned out spec, otherwise had I just been a &quot;Critblade&quot; or &quot;Shadowzerke&quot; I would probably be back to my RM main by now with all the nerfs. As it is, I earned 19k rps this weekend, not bad for a level 48.<br>
<br>
Anyway back on topic, low level specs really, truely make no difference unless you've totally gimped yourself, by level 50, and really, you can fix just about any gimp spec you may have at level 24, it just might be painful till your 40ish.<br>
<br>
I wonder if new &quot;Epic&quot; quest thing would fly? Hmm.. could be quite fun... I know I woulda done them for that little bit of an edge..<br>

Honestly, sure specs, weapons types and all that other nice stuff adds up.  But in the end its the player behind the character that makes a big difference.  Long long ago, there was an infiltrator (on percival) that wrecked havoc on everyone, his name was Vestige.  Vestige sold his account to someone, no idea who.  Ever since he was sold, I have never had trouble facing Vestige one on one.  He has practically died to me every time I've encountered him unless someone else assisted him.<br>
