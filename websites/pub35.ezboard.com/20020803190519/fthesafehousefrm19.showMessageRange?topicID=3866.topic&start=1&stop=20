Slash is evenly distributed, and Blunt uniquely has two vulnerabilities, which is a non-issue because there aren’t any Assassins that can use blunt. The reason why Assassin resist tables to each other are very important is because unlike any other class, Assassins have to encounter other Assassins more than any other class, and is the reason why each will debate for pages endlessly about Assassin vs Assassin balance. This thread will have nothing to do with balancing the fact that Infiltrators have 2.5x points or Shadowblades have Doublefrost and +50 hit points or Nightshades with their shout. This is a completely independent look at armor resist balance. Assassin vs Assassin class balance issues should probably be discussed elsewhere.<br><br>I worked with many modified tables and charts yesterday trying to make out something fair for all Assassins. I tried everything possible, but one Assassin class would always receive an extreme disadvantage compared to the others in Assassin vs Assassin combat by a factor of –4 or more (I’ll explain factors later on). This was because of the difficulty of trying to balance Infiltrators or Nightshades that had access to 2 damage types and Shadowblades with 1, which is also why Pierce Nightshades were the only class to receive penalties in the current patch. So I started thinking, since Blunt damage is no longer a superior damage type against all classes after the armor resistance patch, why not give it to Shadowblades?<br><br>Bingo, now I can play around with each Assassin having 2 damage types. But the only problem is the extreme power of a Hammer Shadowblade, who would get full bonuses against all Assassins, Plates, and Reinforced. I also wanted to improve Pierce Shades from being at the extreme negative end of the spectrum, which is a very imporant issue, as the Slash resist benefit would also decrease by being vulnerable to Blunt.<br><br>By making Infiltrators vulnerable to slash and removing their blunt vulnerability, and removing Shadowblade vulnerability to slash and changing it to pierce, I started to see the puzzle pieces fit into place and a much more balancing picture emerge.<br><br>Old Table<br><br>Typ / T / S / B<br>Inf / - / = / +<br>SB / - / + / =<br>NS / = / - / +<br><br>New Table<br><br>Typ / T / S / B<br>Inf / - / + / =<br>SB / + / = / -<br>NS / = / - / +<br><br>And there it was, no damage type was of full extreme benefit (SB Hammers), and none at an extreme negative (NS Pierce). I made a hexagonal chart to compare each Assassin vs Assassin damage type scenario using damage arrows, and it was much more balanced than the current model proposed by Mythic.<br><br>Thus, Shadowblades no longer were in the red, Axe/Swords can be used to hunt Infiltrators, and Hammers for Nightshades. Nightshades can Pierce to hunt Shadowblades, and Blades for Infiltrators. Infiltrators will Thrust against Shadowblades, and still make the best choice against Nightshades. The only downside of this armor resist table is that the benefits of Thrust and Slash for Infiltrators swapped positions, so the weight of the benefit goes more towards Thrust now than it did Slash, but the same can be said that all Assassins will have a damage type not geared for overall Assassin combat.<br><br>If you will now observe, EVERY Assassin class has a potential specline that has a single vulerable Assassin and a neutral Assassin. Thrust Infiltrators +1.5 factor against other Assassins, Blade Nightshades have a +1.5 factor against other Assassins, and Hammer Shadowblades have a +1.5 factor against other Assassins. Each Assassin from each realm now has a unique damage type that yields the most benefit against other Assassins with the new resist table and giving blunt access to Shadowblades.<br><br>Note there are 2 major changes here.<br><br>1) Granting Shadowblades access to Blunt<br><br>2) Change in Leather armor resistances<br><br>Both changes must go together in order to be balanced. It does not work if only one or the other get implemented and would continue to make things just was bad or even worse than they are.<br><br>Remember, this post has nothing to do with class stats, abilities, specialization points, etc, those are separate issues that need to be addressed at some point. This is strictly about armor resist and damage type access balance. <br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 8/1/02 1:22:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 1:45:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3866.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.52h Assassin Leather Resist Proposal to Mythic, Hammer</span><hr size=1> Wow,<br><br>Nice work and I think it looks great as long as the other points you aren't addressing are looked at<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Mel<br> <p>The only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the government.

Simply because of the nature of the new armor resists, there is no single damage type that is overpowering. Before the armor resists, if someone ever suggested giving Hammers to Shadowblades, I would have said &quot;What? Are you F%$#%7 nutz?!?!&quot; And now I'm actually in support of it because it does carry it's share of benefits and drawbacks.<br><br>After balancing Assassin resists and damage types, I checked the larger resist table to make sure nothing was dramatically altered. All non-Assassin armor resistences were not changes, so target selection remained the same, but Shadowblades benefit from having a new set of targets to choose from based on their specialization choice. Slash and Crush is abundant in every realm for tanks, and Infiltrators and Nightshades are each weak to one of those damage types. Thrust is primarily found in Albion and Hibernia and not in Midgard. Shadowblades do not have an extra benefit because they still face 2 realms that have Thrust, like every other Assassin does to their own weakness.<br><br>The solution in this proposal isn't perfect, but it does the best job so far to even out the playing field between Assassin damage types and resists much better than Mythic ever thunk of. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 8/1/02 2:13:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 6:09:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3866.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.52h Assassin Leather Resist Proposal to Mythic, Hammer</span><hr size=1> This is the most logical, well thought out and best proposal I've seen.<br><br><br><br>I pray they listen and give it a shot.<br><br><br><br><br>I fear they won't.
