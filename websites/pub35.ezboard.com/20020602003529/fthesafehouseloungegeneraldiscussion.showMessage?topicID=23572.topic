Enjoy (or else!) *Remmi scowls)<br><br>(unless you already own it) Drive to CompUSA and shuffle through the Bargain Bin until you find &quot;Thief: The Dark Project&quot;. Bring it home, install it, and play Garrett for a little while. (I know I'm preaching to the choir about Thief: TDP here at the Safehouse but...)<br><br>Ahhh....ooohhh... Now *that's* a thief. Garrett's got everything, he's a near perfect role model for an MMORPG THIEF design:<br><br>1) hide in shadows <br>  - Must stay in shadows--this is not complete invisibility in broad daylight in the middle of a field!<br>  - The faster you move, the easier you are to spot.<br><br>2) move silently<br>  - noise is a factor when trying to remain hidden<br>  - slower he moves, the more silent his footfalls. Faster he moves, the easier he is to detect<br><br>3) knock out<br>  - a single well-placed blow with a blunt object (club, sap, etc) knocks the target unconscious for a short period of time<br>  - conditions are: target must not be on alert (e.g. combat stance), thief must be undetected, must attack from rear and hit the target perfectly<br><br>4) backstab <br>  - same as knock out but the target suffers real damage<br>  - conditions are the same as knock out<br>  - results (e.g. damage output) vary based on skill and other factors<br><br>5) capable swordfighting ability but a single trained fighter usually spells disaster. If Garrett gets into a swordfight that means he's done something seriously wrong...he's made an error somewhere...his mission has failed...<br><br>6) ranged attack<br>  - Garrett has a short bow but knives should do the trick too<br>  - different types of arrows; rope, vine, moss, poison, distraction, etc<br><br>7) pick locks<br>  - a Thief that picks locks?! Go figure... (that was sarcasm aimed at EQ and DAOC)<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   pick pockets<br>  - this guy's good--he can even snag a money pouch as his victim falls to the ground unconscious...<br><br>9) He's got some cool toys<br>  - spying orb<br>  - multiple lock picks<br>  - grenades (poison, stun, explosion, flash)<br>  - he even uses disguises a couple of times<br><br>10) He's stylish, witty, and incredibly cool.<br><br>That's about as close to the perfect Thief you can get, IMHO. Why can't I play that guy in an MMORPG? Why do I HAVE to be a mini-tank or poison-using assassin? I want a Thief! *Remmi scowls*<br><br>Disclaimer: There are many role-playing variants to the Rogue class but what I'm talking about here is a pure and simple THIEF character. I am NOT talking about a swashbuckler, a pirate, a ninja, a con-artist, a ranger, a scout, etc.. So don't go get yer panties all in a wad if it looks like this description of a thief doesn't fit every variation--because it's intentional! *Remmi scowls* This is a THIEF, after all, someone who slinks around and steals from others, avoiding detection and confrontation when possible. So please don't misunderstand; the perfectly viable &quot;rogue&quot; variants do not apply to this context so go easy on this ol' dwarven thief, eh?<br><br>Edit: Bah!

Thief is a different game, that focuses on that companies idea of what a Thief in their world would be.  A rogue in EQ is not the same.  Try to remember EQ does not revolve around rogues.<br><br>Next point, the shadow thing would be really fun for about 10 minutes until you had to shell out money to necros/sks everytime you needed a CR.  Also, dynamic shadowing as you would need and some measure of sound would cause unreal lag to everyone.

Try to think outside of EQ for a minute--it doesn't matter what you know about EQ rogues or EQ's universe (eg corpse retrieval).  It's irrelevant. Remember, I'm not talking about EQ.... I'm talking about the possible implementation of a single character class in some future MMORPG.<br><br>Implementing 'hiding in shadows' doesn't have to be as difficult as it may seem. All calculations could be done on the client to see if the character is &quot;successful&quot; or not while moving around. Only when he fails a roll locally does the client then send the &quot;detection&quot; signal to the server, thus revealing the character's position to others nearby.<br><br>DAOC uses a similar implementation with its Stealth skill.<br><br>Same goes for sound. <br><br>It *can* be done if someone would only care enough to try...

This is really the total tunnel vision view of what Remmi sees as the perfect thief.  I'd like a little broader definition of a thief myself.<br><br>What about that wizard who waits until you are low on health, nukes the crap out of you, and then steals your valuables?  Isn't that also a thief?  How about the guy who goes around ganking lowbie players for quick loot?  That's a thief in my mind.  Anyone who is stealing stuff from other players or NPCs is a thief.  (excuse the UO examples which barely apply to EQ or DAoC since you can't ordinarily loot other players.)<br><br>Then there's the many examples from fiction and real life.  Look at Conan the Barbarian; there's quite a few tales of his days as a thief.  Could he hold his own against a skilled swordsman?  Hell yeah he could.  Was he still a thief?  I don't think there's any doubt about it.  What about the greedy old man who wanders the streets pickpocketing anyone he sees?  He's a thief but odds are he will get his ass kicked by anyone who catches him.  How about the lawyer who embezzles millions of dollars from their clients?  What about the punk shoplifting at the corner market?<br><br>I'd like to see a thief defined more loosely than a lot of other rogues I guess.  In my mind anyone with the ability to steal stuff is a thief.  I don't think they should be forced into the cookie-cutter mold of having to be a weak meleer who sneaks up behind their victim and uses poisons to get their point across.  People should have the freedom to choose to be a master pickpocketer w/ no combat skills but excellent evasion and unobtrusiveness skills.  You should be able to become a brutal swordswinger who occasionally supplements their income by holding up travelers.  You should be able to be a stealthy cat burglar who keeps to the shadows with excellent climbing and trap detection/disarming abilities.<br><br>There is no one perfect thief.  There are many kinds of thieves, and an ideal system would allow for this.  In my mind there's no difference between the cookie cutter half-assed current MMORPG rogues and Remmi's definition.  You are still forced into someone else's *vision* of what your class should be.<br><br>I'm a rogue.

Noncombative even.  I'd say quest exp for them all the way.  Person in town wants an item, the item itself is not worth anything, but can be obtained from sneaking into a dungeon, slipping past monsters and traps, and then pickpocketing it from a mob, or stealing it from a chest.  Then, upon returning with said item, you get big fat exp reward.

Now as far as hiding in the shadows. WTF? To be a thief hiding does not jsut consist of &quot;shadows&quot;. Hiding in plain sight is one of a thiefs main attraction. You can meld into a crowd, you can hide behind a box, hide into the darkness, in a sewer, whatever gets you out of the line of a persons sight is called &quot;hiding&quot;. Which would help a bit. I also think they should make stealing from anyone common practice though with certain circumstances: Since thieves ARE generally found in towns and not the wilderness you would get a negative to stealing outside of towns. You shouldn't be able to steal in a fight, in a bank .. some other things apply to make other classes able to trade freely but if you decide to roam into the bad part of town with 5024590248 plat than you damn right better expect I'm gonna try to take your money. Another implementation should be the hide/stalk (as aposed to hide/sneak) where you would follow the person around for a time regaurdless of their speed and be able to pick pocket them. This iust brief but theres more to a thief then just hiding in the shadows.
