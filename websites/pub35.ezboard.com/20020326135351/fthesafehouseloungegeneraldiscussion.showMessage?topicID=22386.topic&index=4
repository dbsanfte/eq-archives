The loud but vocal minority or the quiet majority ?  Verant isn't in a enviable position.  No matter what they do, somebody's going to complain, whether they NERF, enchance or do nothing.  <br>
<br>
And just WHAT is balance ?  Are rogues unpowered because they can't solo, or overpowered because of the damage they do ?  Are mages underpowered because they can't do massive damage all the time, or overpowered because with wise chain casting, they can solo something that a group of just plain melees would get wiped out with ( such as a Black Reaver in CoM, I've seen it done by a mage before ) ?  <br>
<br>
There's a lot more to balance than meets the eye, and you can't discount other useful abilities just because you can't do what other classes can.  Each class has their own unique abilities, and it's a shame to hear someone whine about their class, when if they took the time they could see just how great their class is to play. <br>
<br>
Granted some classes have a harder time getting into groups than others, so you'll have to work a bit on your rep and be desired in groups just for that.   Even in places like Sebilis, I'll take the druid I know with a good rep, over a cleric I know to be a jerk, or a necro I knew from way back with as a good group player over the enchanter that I know isn't.  If you're likeable, you WILL eventually get picked for groups a lot no matter what your class.   Balance will always be skewed against people with bad attitudes. <p><img src="http://www.twilite.org/~chrome/images/sigs/larcensig.jpg" border="0">

You can nit-pick and complain/whine about this and that OR you could play the game and play it to the best of your ability. Maybe you are right, maybe they are right, in the end laying blame goes no where. Honestly in the end they will do what they are going to do and class balance is looked at differently by them as it is by every other person. I am not saying you can't give constuctive critisism but it is the same issues over and over, get over it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79722">Tillain Invictus</a><BR>

There are reasons a Wizard will never do the damage output of a Rogue in every fight.<br>
<br>
However, raids are way different than exp grouping.  <br>
<br>
On raids, a lot more spells are resisted than normal (and this is even with them reducing the magic resistances on some stuff) which really penalizes how much damage you can do on a mob.  Pets are just a liability and cause more trouble than they are worth - This pentalizes the pet classes b/c they are going to be doing half the damage they normally do.  Various things set raids apart from exp groups.<br>
<br>
However, I think more people would rather themselves balanced so they are wanted in groups (which does include more damage dealing) than being balanced against how much damage another class does.  Every class needs at least one thing that they are wanted for in a group that another class of their type doesn't have.  No one should say, &quot;Gee, we have a rogue, do we really need a ranger?&quot;  IMO if they can't get all classes desirable in groups, they should give the least desirable ones a grouping bonus.  For example, grouping with a Magician increases the amount of exp you get by 3%.<br>
<br>
I also agree with the list above though.  I mean, every company is allowed to have mistakes, but some of the ones Verant has made are just so laughable.  Another thing though is the way Verant chooses to address these issues.  A few people complain for a couple months with no one listening, then more people chime in and more and more and more til finally whatever class board these peopel belong to are just fuming with grief til Verant finally says, &quot;Oh yeah, we finally looked into that and yeah, it is broken!&quot;   <p><div align="Center"><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg" alt="Cantatus - Phantasmist and Artisan of the Karana Server" width="253" height="75">

Balence is all in the eye of the beholder.   Maybe you have class envy?  Maybe you have lewt envy?  Maybe your content?  Whatever. . .<br>
<br>
Do you have XP envy?  Do you have DPS Envy?  Are you just plain pizzed cause you get owned in Duels?  Do you kick &quot;Sparky&quot; because some other class is able to do shizz you &quot;think&quot; is specific to your class. . .yet doing it better?  Do you cry tears of sorrow because your level 60 and arent the Best at every thing.<br>
<br>
A lone tear stains the side of my cheek . . .<br>
<br>
I guess it just depends on who you are and what you do in the game.  Against mobs that push you to you or your guilds limits you see the balence.   Every class contributes and every class is necessay.  Balence is there - Im not saying Balence is Perfect. . .I guess it all depends on what part of balence your bitching about. . .<br>

<br>
Balance is thing with two sides as I see it:<br>
<br>
On the one hand classes must be balanced against the xp game at the places it takes place. On the other hand, classes must be balanced for raids on the highend game. <br>
<br>
This all means that no player of a class should have to rely on friends or his guild more than any other. How can it be that whole raids or xp groups have to wait for for Clerics and Enchanters tp show up and to quit because a player of those two central classes has to leave while they can start without even caring about a Necromancer, Hybrid, Magician or whatever being there or not.<br>
<br>
And how can it be that whatever VI introduces, the coreclasses' skills don't get touched? Where is the Mezmerisation upgrade for Necromancers? When do Druids finally get a healing upgrade to be at least 80% as efficient as a Cleric?<br>
<br>
Did you ever wait in Sebilis for a Enc/Cle to show up so you could start to play? Did your raid ever break apart because one of those had to leave? How often did that happen when a Ranger left? Did you ever (assuming your rep is fine) wait 8h to get a group - being LFG in several highlevel places because of gates?<br>
<br>
Only if those things won't happen regularily anymore, class balance is achieved...<br>

Wizzes port<br>
Necros solo their but off<br>
Mages have no shortage of gimmicks<br>
<br>
My point: the above have entertaining elements above and beyond their DPS.   I mean i told a wiz we didnt have a root parker he reminded me he could do that.  So thats got to come into consideration when talking about how much damage they do.<br>
<br>
A rogue is only DPS.  unless you consider opening locks and sneak hiding to be on par with porting (snarfle)   That has to be considered when &quot;balancing&quot;  Personally i think they just need to get rogues more tricks then they wont bitch about DPS.   More cool and powerful right clicks might do it.  Most fantasy games and novels (D&amp;D for example gave rogues a chance to use wands and scrolls)  have the rogue with trinkets for effect (for a basis).<br>
<br>
Further  the ability to control when and where and how you rage out damage will always be a force multiplier.  That has to be considered in balancing.  ie  if you can pick the minute you do 6k worth of damage but not do any the next minute that will certainly be more valuable then doing 3k a minute.  <br>
<br>
The above isnt true in exp groups you might counter?  Naw it is.  Do guild exp groups.  Most stops to action occur on a nasty pull.  A wiz for example has the ability to end a nasty pull before the healers mana gets eaten to nothing.   In a pickup group sometimes you arnt honed enough to see how a wiz is every bit the equal to a rogue.  if not superior even for exping.  And its because of that principle above: controling damage output is a force multiplier.  (that is you may do less damage over time but it will SEEM like more as far as results)<br>
<br>
What was a saying above:<br>
Rogues need to rock on damage clearly above other classes unless they want to dole out rogues some more non-damage oriented tricks.<br>
<br>
Thats balance.<br>
