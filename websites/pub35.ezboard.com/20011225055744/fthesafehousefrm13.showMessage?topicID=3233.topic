<br>
A few previous threads to check out before starting here... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3034.topic">pub13.ezboard.com/fthesaf...3034.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
and maybe some others after i search for awhile more. <br>
<br>
It has been found that a large group of evil creatures have built their camp in Rathe Mountains known as the Primordial Malice.  The DE's that have recently resided in West Commons have seem to disappeard over that recent patches and the camps are empty.  A while ago i remember when something to do with this whole ordeal happened in befallen and can't exactly remember the whole situation but i was there fighting with some friends trying to do some gm quest. <br>
<br>
So now i start the thread... I believe that the boisterous shouts in the heralds found throughout Norrath might hold part of the key on how we can break this quest. I for one will begin recording my readings from the news and copy them here for you all to see. If you come acrosst one in game and haven't seen it posted here please copy it down ( best way is to use the /log text command and just retype it the copy and paste into this document.)  and post it here. <br>
<br>
Also a note on the subject ~ as of before patch the quest was broken.  I was going to do it today but didn't get the time and we be trying it tomorrow to see if i can get further then i have before.  <br>

<br>
Dark Bargains.<br>
<br>
Danak Dhorentath, the famed Iksar loyal to none other than Venril Sathir, has taken it upon himself to seek outside assistance in fending off the defenders of Balance and all that is holy, good, righteous, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.<br>
<br>
Having still in his possession the Lifeguide, a powerful artifact rumored to have been given to Firiona Vie by Tunare herself, this Iksar fanatic and one of his henchmen lackeys, a Teir'Dal Wizard named Vahlai Ka Izal, have apparently employed the aid of Tserrina Syl Tor. A most mysterious and quite ancient being who inhabits the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  Tserrina is known to hold quite a collection of souls-- namely those pitiable unfortunates who fell when the Eruidin loyals so ingeniously created what is now known as The Hole. We believe that it is her specific knowledge of the imortal spirit that Danak has sought to emply to his cause.<br>
<br>
A most marvelous decision, if we do say so. It appears that those who have been at a rather dull stalemate for these past months have finally achieved a bit of intelligence in seeking outside aid-- for it is most apparent that they simply cannot handle their own battles. The exact intentions of Danak Dhorentath and Vahlai are unknown, though I am sure that such information will become rather public in the weeks to come.<br>
<br>
(Note: I have been in ToFS recently and there was shouting acrosst the zone about stuff such as tortured souls as well as I will be heading to the hole Friday. If i notice anything I will let you all know. And also this is not directly related to Malice but might be of some use to other questers, etc. At the very least enjoy the reading and let me know if you can pull anything out of it )  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Volume 7: Issue 2.<br>
<br>
&quot;Official Word on the Whereabouts of the Lifeguide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Missing for some time now, the King has released an official statement confirming that our spies have kept track of this precious artifact of Tunare. At this time, officials would only confirm that the staff last seen in Velious near the Tower of Frozen Shadow, thought it was unclear whether the actual Lifeguide was seen or only those believed to be in possession of it.<br>
<br>
Palace staff wouldn't comment on neither why it was believed the staff was taken to that location, nor whether Firiona herself, chosen of Tunare, had returned to Velious in pursuit of theives.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, rumors imply something that resides deep in the Tower of Frozen Shadow may have the power to strip Tuanre's influence from the staff. Such a notion is obviously riduculous, but there remains the possiblity that the soundrels in possession of the aritfact might have been attempting something toward that end.<br>
<br>
Palace staff assures us that the Lifeguides's return to the sanctity of Fewithe is imminent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Strange Reports from Antonica&quot;<br>
<br>
All over Antonica, phenomena as yet without explanation has been reported. That in and of itself is nothing new, but the alarming degree to which they occured in such a short span of time is noteworth. Indeed, it would seem that on the very same night, no less then six major stories of monster attacks, cultist uprisings, undead invasions, and more were coming from all over.<br>
<br>
Even the newly formed Primordial Malice, a gathering of disillusioned Teir'dal that preach the return of lays T'Vyl, had something of an active night.  <br>
<br>
We urge all citizens to remain alert while it is determined if this is an alarming new trend, or if there was just something in the air that night. <br>
<br>
(the question here becomes what happend to make the PM have such a busy nite and why has the PM disappeard from WC?? hopeufully in the next few weeks i will along with yer help come up with some usefull answers to solve this quest.) <br>

While looking around I found a Necromancer named Kazzel D`Leryt who was dubious and would only say to &quot;get away from him&quot; or something to that nonsense. Being a goodly race i wasn't to bothered by it but recorded the loc... he was a wander and had his pet up with him.  I will check it with the rogue as soon as servers come back up.  <br>

This is where you initially speak with Captain L`Rei to recieve the quest. I will also try to accomplish this with my rogue sometime tomorrow and let you all know how far i got with the quest before it was broken! <br>

Also the whole of PM was ready to attack and being mostly red i dared not to go by them with my lvl 32 halfling druid. <br>

<br>
[Mon Oct 08 23:21:00 2001] You say, 'Hail, Izera N`Kar'<br>
[Mon Oct 08 23:21:01 2001] Izera N`Kar thumbs the pommel of the large dagger fixed to her belt as she studies Aluvinn , clearly unimpressed. 'Most fortunate for you, I am currently not in need of Half Elf flesh. Move along, before the need for such an item arises.' <br>
<br>
She is a dark elf in gold velious armor.<br>
I am scowling to her. She cons blue, but will not attack.<br>
<br>
Roams north of the tower South into the forest... then back again.... rinse repeat.... was not up for about 20 mins when i got in the zone... so i started killing stuff praying for the AC... guildmate told me she spawned. sure enough, just north of the tower. there she was <br>
<br>
Hrmmm....<br>

Thanks Aluvinn for the quote <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Also while looking through other quest info i found the quote, &quot;Take this message to Izera N'Kar. She can be found in the southern desert during the evening hours. She will provide further commands as to your duties. And mind her well, outsider, for she is equally as deadly with her poisoned dagger as she is knowledgeable in her art.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks Mojak <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
What has been said is that she will not attack back you can hit her as many times as you like and she will not attack back. This is known so plz don't post about that in this thread keep it to quest info only plz.  And yes you can practice yer skills on her for as long as you like with no response.  She also does despawn at a certain time in game and respawn... &quot;only during the evening hours.&quot; and also has been noted to move every three hours game time to a new posistion before despawning. The exact spawn location of this npc is unknown so having a trakable friend to help you would be a good idea probably. <br>
<br>
Also CT Genam posted<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't know if this is significant or not or if it even applys now after the patch but while I was in East Karana/The Graveyard of the Dead this past weekend with my bard I'd keep getting a red conned Izera N'kar on my tracking. Went to the spot she was at but no sign of her. I'd also lose the track after about 30 seconds, then she'd pop back on track after a minute or so.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the post above the News Letters, which were found on FP guards after killing them in WC, said something about the PM having a busy weekend.  Maybe this has something to do with the quest and because I didn't take the time to find the notes today and turn them into her I don't know if she is still spawning in S Ro. I will find out tomorrow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

This is all that i have found about Izera N'Kar and will be adding to it as i do the quest. <br>

<br>
and please remember this quest was still broken as of Nov 7th 2001. Althought now that alot of the stuff is done with the recent zone changes (also noted in the News letters above) hopefully verant will have some time to either 1) fix the quest or 2) already have and run the patch to fix it after making sure it works <br>
<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:12 2001] You say, 'Hail, Captain L`Rei'<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:12 2001] Captain L`Rei narrows his eyes sharply to the Dark Elf standing before him, his lip giving a gentle curl of his unveiled irritation. 'By your abrupt and careless approach, I see that you have yet to become acquainted with the ways of the [Primordial Malice]. Such an offense shall be disregarded by an outsider only once, and be grateful that it was I and not [his grace] to whom you presented such audacity.' <br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:23 2001] You say, 'what primordial malice?'<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:23 2001] Captain L`Rei releases the soft hint of irritation from his features and briefly waves an armored hand toward the camp. 'We are the Primordial Malice. A group of loyal servants dedicated to the [restoration of our Dark Lady], Lanys T'Vyl, and the preservation of her irreplaceable glory through the burning spite that binds our loyalty. Though we are few when compared to our enemy and this small temple is all we have retained after the Dark Lady's loss, our faith and the strength of our blades are not to be trifled with.' <br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:27 2001] You say, 'What about his grace?'<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:27 2001] Captain L`Rei says ''The Archon, Mardeus N'Vidi, is our sovereign leader. He is the one who gathered us when Innoruuk condemned the Dark Lady. However, you are an outsider to us and it would not be wise to approach him. He is our loyalty, our faith, our distrust, and the voice of Malice.' <br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:39 2001] You say, 'what about the restoration of our Dark Lady?'<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:39 2001] Captain L`Rei smirks darkly from the corner of his lips and shakes his head gently. 'Such information is not privileged to outsiders. However, you seem to retain some interest in us and given our numbers and the [Call of Malice] that guides us, we are always willing to extend our sermon to those who would heed the call. Perhaps you would be of a mind to attempt to [prove yourself to our ranks] and in turn for your success, devotion, and sacrifices. . . the call may seek you.' <br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:51 2001] You say, 'What call of Malice?'<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:24:51 2001] Captain L`Rei closes his eyes and bows his head briefly as if in recognition of something sacred before quickly returning his eye to (players name). 'The Call is not for my voice to speak, nor is it for your ears to receive. When and if the Call beckons, you shall know it as no other.' <br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:25:28 2001] You say, 'I will prove myself to your ranks'<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:25:28 2001] Captain L`Rei says ''We shall judge your actions as they come to us, Mojak . Seek out Xjari V'Iyr within the camp and give her this letter. It is my recommendation for your trials.' <br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:25:55 2001] Acolyte Xjari V`Iyr reads quickly through the note before nodding sharply to Mojak . 'Well then, I see you have caught the eye of the Captain's recruitment. You are most fortunate to be considered for these trials, outsider. However, do not think for a moment that your collective tasks will be of any ease. Take this message to Izera N'Kar. She can be found in the southern desert during the evening hours. She will provide further commands as to your duties. And mind her well, outsider, for she is equally as deadly with her poisoned dagger as she is knowledgeable in her art.' <br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:26:19 2001] You say, 'Hail, Archon Mardeus N`Vidi'<br>
[Thu Oct 11 14:26:20 2001] Archon Mardeus N`Vidi narrows his eyes in a very quick and brief study of Mojak , his bitterly emotionless demeanor unchanged as he speaks in a calm, dark tone, 'We are not impressed by your presumptuous behavior, outsider. The arrogant and obtuse are blindly bold to approach the anointed Archon when the Malice that he governs has yet to find it suitable for a grant of trust. Both characteristics that you have exampled are unwelcome in our domain. Move along, Mojak . Continue your search for the Call in modesty and obedience. Perhaps then you may find yourself at our service in due time.' <br>
<br>
I am assuming at this point upon researching through the many materials and looking for some hours at them all and otehr quests that Archon Mardeus will eventually be part of this quest... he speaks to Mojak so therefore must be associated.  Upon proving yourself to Izera N'Kar in S Ro and doing the trials perhaps you have to then speak with Archon about another add on to this quest.  Many of the quest VI are coming out with lately seem very lengthy... <br>
<br>
examples (ring quest)(shawl quest) and from back in the day(monk quest: freeport monk guild) you can't get sashes (i think they were) till you get the previous sash of training etc. Maybe Izera is just the broken link along with the note (which they fixed) in one of the last patches. After you accomplish what she needs you to do you then become applicable to talk to Archon. Just a thought <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukilaytecc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilaytecc</A> at: 11/8/01 7:23:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukilaytecc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilaytecc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/8/01 7:29:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> extra info!!! </span><hr size=1> In another post Natal says&lt; <br>
<br>
I made some further progress on this quest. It seems that there at least two new mobs in Norrath, A DE in Nek forest (a tier'dal surveyor) who drops a &quot;priest of innurok's heart&quot;, and a troll SK in Inno swamp who drops &quot;arterial blood&quot;. When you ask Izera about these things she responds with some backround text describing the mobs they dropped from, so they are definitely related to the quest. The implication is that at least these two (perhaps more) items need to be collected and handed in.<br>
<br>
Looks like we are getting somewhere in all of this and wondered what the background text for the items and their holders were.  I will try to collect it while I do the quest tomorrow. <br>
