Searching for the bottom of the bottomless pit, which somewhat resembles my rogue life...<br>
<br>
It all started long ago when I was just a young halfling playing at the thicket. My father would watch me attack bats and such with a great big smile on his face. <br>
&quot;With that kinda Speed son you are gonna make a great warrior some day, just like your ol man&quot; He would tell me time and time again. He would often leave me be to attack my young foes. He would say that he had some business to attend to. Coarse I knew what he was doing since he would return with belts from the nearby goblins. What he didnt relize was that whenever he left, I would run over to the fools gold to do some &quot;tasks&quot; for the men there. I felt so special there, that I belonged there. Deep down I knew it was not right, and that they were just using me so they didnt get in trouble themselves. My first time I got into trouble was by mangler... the beast protected a mans coins that he &quot;owed&quot; to the fools gold men. I snuck past mangler  and reached for the coins, soon as I did... I sneazed...&quot;great&quot; i thought and dashed for the door, hurdling the desk at full speed. I sqeezed through the door and slammed it shut just as mangler plowed into it. knocking me to the ground as the door swung open. Mangler takes a leap at me, and just has his fangs are inches from my face I get lifted away from the ground and land a few feet away face first into the dirt. I hear Mangler yalp and run away... I turn to see an even worse beast staring me down. My father. <br>
&quot;WHAT! where you doing here?&quot; he says.<br>
&quot;The guys in the fools go.....&quot; I started to say and relized my mistake. His eyes glow red as he says.<br>
&quot;If I EVER! see you in there again...you'll be sorry.&quot;<br>
So starts my Rogue life.<br>
<br>
Against my fathers words, I returned to the fools gold. Searching for my father in the presence first of coarse. I walked to the fools gold door as I heard poeple shouting in the distance. I run to the sounds to find a man... a rather large man, in yellow plate armor and the words &quot;high pass&quot; on his tunic. He was bleeding from many wounds on his body. A crowd of halflings surrounding him. He starts gasping and spits out a few words. &quot;Gob...lins...........basement........ need.....hel......&quot; Then he dropped his head to the ground and lay dead. My father was on the opposite side of the crowd. I shouted for him but he was busy talking to other Halflings in shiney armor.<br>
&quot;Son.... be brave... and.....take care of your mother, I may not return....run home now son.&quot;  he says.<br>
&quot;but pa.....&quot; <br>
&quot;Do as I say son, now run home.&quot;<br>
I never seen him again, and I swore my vengeance on any goblin that walks the grounds of norrath.<br>
<br>
 Fighting the infestation in high pass keep for many seasons... I have made many friends whom share the desire for goblin blood. They seem to take more precision and skill at it though. I cannot seem to match the damage taken in or delt by these great sorcerers and knights whom kill these nasty creachers who call themselves goblins. Try as I might to take shots when the beast are not looking seems unsuccessful, and angers them greatly. I also remember my teachings by the brothers at the fools gold to take what need... which seems to help, but angers my foes whom would like thier share. I taught myself to use poisons from the local snakes which seem to rarely drop thier sweet nector. allthough this fails for if i do not sit while applying I will spill. Yet if I sit during battle, I am smashed by a goblin fist to the helmet which takes in much more damage. If i do succeed to do this... the goblin seems to reject the poison and continues to fight.....&quot;what is the use&quot; i would repeat to myself, only to try again later. The great warriors slam thier opponents to the walls of the cave as I sit thier and watch, feeling helpless. Often times I see my father in thier eyes, telling my &quot;why, WHY have you betrayed me.&quot; <br>
<br>
I try to get away from all this by making money at the local market...only to be HAD multiple times. Much of my hard earned money to thieves... Not even in training, yet thieves they are. Gulyen, the name is now the meaning of the devil. Ainamaf, his advocate. Thier sting worse than any poison.. more powerfull than any magic, they are the straws.....and I am the camel. <br>
<br>
My friends... been there for me when I need you, esspecialy my love, whos eyes when stared into, make me dream of heaven.  My pals who stand beside me in battle to protect me during battle and to protect as well. I will miss you most of all. <br>
<br>
As I searches many times for a worthy opponent my weak skill in falling from hights... I have only found one so. I snuck past the scarey looking guards of the grand city of paineel, to the ledge I sit....staring...searching for the bottom of the pit, which somewhat resembles my life as a rogue... Have I betrayed my father? the answer rests along side me at the bottom of the pit.<br>
<br>
<br>
I wish not to be forgoten... only to forget. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/urazenvanguardveeshan.showPublicProfile>RazenVanguardVeeshan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/22/00 8:58:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=243.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: R.I.P                     Speedie Gonezales</span><hr size=1> Goodluck Brother,in the name of the Rogues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showPrevMessage?topicID=243.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showNextMessage?topicID=243.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=243.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.emailToFriend?topicID=243.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.threadControl?topicID=243.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=243.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=243.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing>Retirement Wing</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
