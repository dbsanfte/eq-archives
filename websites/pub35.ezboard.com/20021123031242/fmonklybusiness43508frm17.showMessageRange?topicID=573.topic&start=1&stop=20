<br>
Well, here are my impressions of the nerf.  First, I'm coming back from a year off.  My monk is a Kunark era level 54, has 939 unbuffed AC and 1550 HP, no AA.  Virtually every piece of equipment on my monk was looted of the warm corpse of my opponents, and much of it was acquired solo.  Yeah, his gear sucks.  Completely ghetto.  And I'm proud of that, or at least I used to be.  <br>
<br>
The monk class used to be defined by skill, not gear.  I'm currently wearing AC5 Drakehide Leggings.  I could have upgraded to Gatorscale - AC7 - but hey, it didn't really matter.  The monk was a minimalist class where cash and equipment were secondary to knowledge and skill.  Kunark introduced a few nice items - T-Staff, Fungi, IFS, Jade Mace, Wu Stick, and the epic - but all in all, the monk class wasn't fundamentally changed IMO (with the possible exception of the fungi - but I like the idea of high regeneration on a monk, personally).  It took a while for Verant to introduce the upgraded damage tables that allowed the inherent abilities of monks to keep pace with the gear of the other melee classes, but it did eventually happen.<br>
<br>
Then things changed.  Velious introduced a lot of new monk gear.  Luclin introduced even more - weapons and armor that have fundamentally changed what a monk is capable of doing.  A naked monk used to be able to fight nearly as well as a fully equipped monk - but no longer.  Still, the innate skills of a monk were hidden underneath, and to some of us - that mattered.  Those innate skills were what allowed a ghetto monk like me to survive a tough pull, or to solo when needed - despite our old school gear.  I guess it got to the point, though, where the innate skills of the monk class combined with some of the incredible gear that Velious and Luclin introduced allowed a few monks to become melee monsters.  Typical Verant screw up, and I guess I see why they had to fix it...<br>
<br>
But nerfing the innate abilities of the entire class is so contrary to the nature of the monk that I can't understand it.  Weren't those innate abilities the entire point of being a monk?<br>
<br>
What impact has the nerf had on me?  I have been unable to solo anything higher than a light blue - and most of them pound me to a pulp.  Low blues can take me down two full bubbles in the first few seconds of a fight.  I don't have parses for you, because I can't actually kill much of anything.  I cringe to think what would happen if I tackled a high blue or even con.  Oh, I'm the master of all that is green - if anybody cares.  The bottom line is that my skill as a player and the innate abilities of the class no longer count for much.  Loot rulz, and the old school monk is dead.<br>
<br>
Of course, it's possible to adapt.  It seems I need a bunch of new gear to survive - and it's not optional.  Verant has turned my monk into a loot whore.  I've gotta go pharm plats.  Without my worldly possessions, I'm screwed - and until I buy a new suit of armor and weapons, I'll just run like a coward from the low blues that used to give me decent XP and a little bit of pocket change.  I guess this change is more obvious to me, since it hasn't been gradual.  Still, the solution is obvious - if I want to play the game, then I must adapt and survive.  The question is, is the character I invested so much time into still a monk?

I truly feel sorry for those with not so great gear now. The nerf was probably desirable for the top monks, but it's not like other classes aren't overpowered in uber drops, and that applies to casters as well as melee /snicker.<br>
<br>
The way the nerf was implemented was simply wrong. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A> at: 10/24/02 10:08:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=catterly>catterly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 688<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 10:14:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=573.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nerf = Death of the Old School Monk</span><hr size=1> Blazyn I agree with you.<br>

Post nerf they need to do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (not all, just one) of the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Increase avoidance so damage taken is same as pre-nerf, only more is avoided now mitigated.<br>

2. Increase inate monk damage (either through upgrading the damage tables again or something like an offhand damage bonus)<br>
<br>
3. Give monks some group utility.<br>

There are perhaps other options but any of those would fix the problems.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=korph>Korph</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 503<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 10:36:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=573.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nerf = Death of the Old School Monk</span><hr size=1> 4.

<br>
But tonight, finally logged in for first time after patch.., been building new PC,<br>
<br>
greater warbone in BW (light blue) took me down 3000hps before biting it.. (I had aego)<br>
<br>
Was at 1094ac (with epic effect) using epic/sos, sotd+epic (64% haste), and fungi...  <br>
<br>
Used to be able to do em with 1 yellow with aego up..  and most light blues (GWBs undercon so not same) with nil hp drop after fungal regrowth... Heck even drolvarg gnasher (green) took me down a bit now..<br>
<br>
Even worse, this was with AEGOLISM up.<br>
<br>
I didn't expect the patch to hit me anything like this hard, I though reports were exaggerated =/  The last time I played Herrick, I pulled a huge train from Warlord room in KC down to the basement room where verix kylox's remains spawns, for a 60 enc friend to have fun with in our group... I took a helluva beating getting it there.. but with stonestance.. made it np..<br>
<br>
Now? I doubt I would get through the upper level of basement alive =(<br>

We've changed dramatically over the last two years.  A long time ago I used to teach classes in West Freeport to young initiate monks (then we did not refer to our brethren as &quot;noobs&quot;) and I remember asking them in these classes...&quot;What's my most prized, most valuable possession?&quot;  They'd answer &quot;Robe of the Whistling Fists&quot; or &quot;FBSS&quot; or the like. ( The correct answer was &quot;my reputation&quot;)   I can't imagine anyone taking that answer seriously now. Sigh.<br>
<br>
I used to say items were not important, but now know you need to stay current with the new items just to keep up and still be able to play, especially if you solo a lot.<br>
<br>
Its a shame, with this armor/weapon/item dependency,  we've lost something of great value.<br>

<br>
Yea, ok bud.  Ride them out til the time is right?  WTF is that going to be?  When EQ2 is out, and there's noone important paying attention to EQ1 to listen?  You don't make this kind of a drastic change 3 1/2 years into a game.  Feign Death might have been our class defining ability, but the dmg output and largely the tanking have been what's kept people here.  The ability to solo well is what's kept alot of people coming back to this class, regardless of new or old school.  <br>
<br>
I find myself FD'n less these days, since I am never the puller on any raids I go on.  How many of us these days actually are main pullers for their guilds and have to split shit and what not.  I definitely don't have to, and I find myself using FD less and less.  My enjoyment out of this game and my class revolved largely around my tanking ability, and secondly my dmg output.  I'm rambling on here, but i'm just depressed, and I won't be going back to my monk for a long time.  The class is beyond broken now.  I still love it, but i've put alot of time into my character to lose to this BS.  /sigh...... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36545"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Anomalos Malakas - 57 Iksar Monk</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56948"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Quant - 55 Ogre Shaman</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=218254"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Squeaky Kleen - 54 Halfling Druid</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrisda>Mrisda </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 397<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 7:41:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=573.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nerf = Death of the Old School Monk</span><hr size=1> I actually think the &quot;old school&quot; monk died when Kunark arrived (well, after the patches fixed it).

(i got nothing against iksar monks, I'M one myself, it's just that 16 minutes after kunark came out, 7000 iksar monks entered Norrath.)<br>

Kunark put the death sentence on the Old School Monk.

I think I will give you a little overview about my monk. To tell it before, i wont play him anymore now after nerf.<br>
<br>
Fungi or PSC<br>
Primary: Whistling Fists 12/20 Effect Johnathans Whistling War Song<br>
Secondary: Knotted Knuckles 18/27 some stats<br>
Hands: Celestial Fists<br>
2HB (used before i got Ambidexterity): Amygdalan War Staff 37/36 some stats<br>
Bracer of Quickness<br>
Runebranded Girdle<br>
Shackle of Tynnonium (yeah, did it twice)<br>
White Lotus Pants<br>
Frozen Turban<br>
White Lotus Arms<br>
White Lotus Feetstuff<br>
and so on.<br>
<br>
And here is the point, even with this stuff i cant solo anymore. The Mobs in VL meanwhile Lightblue to me and i cant stand a chance against them (34 AA Points total)<br>
<br>
I know, this is not the most uber Gear, but i thought it is ok and it was ok for me pre-nerf. But even with this gear you wont be able to really solo. You wont be able to even take a few hits from any mob on a raid, cause the cleric will get mad. Pre-Nerf i pulled for my guild in ToV - HoT...these days i wont get any mob back to them alive. So i decided to quit playing my monk and switch to a class that is usefull for a group and can solo a bit if i dont want to group (sometimes this happens). Regardless to say that the PoP-AA (mostly tuned Reposte-Abillity) is completly BS after the Nerv. What Devil did VI ride as they decided to make monks unable to tank any mob and on the other hand give them a hell of a lot AA Abilitys that need you to be hit????<br>
<br>
Thx VI for making my lvl 61 Monk completly useless for soloing and making him completle useless for any xp group cause i cant take a single hit from lightblue mobs without the cleric or dru cast his healspells instantly on me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Well, you're probably right.  Unless you risked life and limb to kill frogloks for mesh, it's probably not even quite fair to claim to be &quot;old school&quot;.  Still, my point is the same.  The equipment dependence for monks is something that Kunark introduced, but it has just gotten crazy with Velious and Luclin.  My monk wasn't my first character (which was a ranger), so I had a notion of what I was getting into when I rolled him.  In particular, I just wanted to play the game - without being caught up in the equipment rat race.

I object to this.. I played Herrick for 3 years because it was FUN.  That is why I play computer games.  I do not play them out of a masochistic desire to prove I can still play a character that has become pretty damn worthless for either soloing or xp grouping.  <br>
<br>
Sure I can still contribute DPS on raids, but that is all I can do.. and for me personally, its not enough.<br>
<br>
If it is enough for you, then that's great, I am glad you still enjoy playing your monk.<br>
<br>
I think I'm going to buy Elder Scrolls - Morrowind.. I need a break from all this =D<br>

<br>
I logged on last night for the first time in 3 weeks ... my telephone line was shut off because roomate missed bill payment =/<br>
<br>
Anyway, I went to Velks and took down some spiders.  Blizzard spiders used to take about 1 1/4 health from me -- now they take 1 3/4 (about 10% more dmg taken).  Shard spiders do about 15% more dmg to me.  <br>
<br>
Didn't come accross any Hunters ... I used to be able to solo them if full hp ... so we'll see next time I find one.<br>
<br>
Generally I could solo 3 in a row pre-nerf ... now I can safely do 2, but 3 would be too close for comfort.<br>
<br>
Overall, I'm relieved that the difference wasn't worse ... but it still definitely sucks.  I'm interested to see how well I do in Kael Arena -- used to MT there for pickup groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showMessageRange?topicID=573.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=573.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=573.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=573.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.emailToFriend?topicID=573.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.threadControl?topicID=573.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=573.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=573.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17>Monk Change</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
