<br>
There's not one component in that system, except perhaps the case but I don't know cases very well, that you couldn't buy yourself.  What you're buying is their labor to assemble it, the cute little logo, their support and warrenty.  That's worth it to some people.  <br>
<br>
If you're interested in trying your own hand at building a system I'd go spend some time reading at www.tweaktown.com.  Especially read about cooling.  <br>

If either of those apply to you, sure, go ahead and get the Alienware. It will impress your friends. But, to be perfectly frank, you can build an identical computer that will perform equally as well (or better) for far, far less money.<br>
<br>
For anyone who is interested in a high end, high performance computer, I highly, highly suggest looking into building it yourself. It isn't difficult, and you'll learn a lot in the course of your research. I assure you that you will love the finished product much more than you would an OEM system. Even if you don't, do-it-yourselfing gives you flexibility in price and choice of components that you don't get with a big company building for you. And hey, even if you have the money to burn, why not make the most of it? Build your computer yourself and buy a nice 22&quot; monitor or a set of 5.1 speakers with the money you'll save. It really is worth the effort. <p><center><img src="http://www.ikonomi.com/images/ditasig2.gif"><br>

<br>
Well, I can't argue with that!  But some people seem to think that Alienware or Dell or other brands are so good because their components are mysterious and godly.  They aren't, you can buy the same components pretty much anywhere and a lot cheaper than they're going to sell them to you for in their pretty packages.  <br>
<br>
I assert, what you pay all the extra money for is their labor in assembling it, testing it, and their warrenty and the pretty case and the fancy boxes with the cute logos.  I have no problem with people doing that, it's part of our economy.  I just think a lot of people have the idea they have some special mojo to make better computers.  You might even be able to buy the exact same computer from some Mom &amp; Pop electronics shop somewhat cheaper, in a plain looking case.  Might even be a better product because M&amp;P might not scrimp on things like cooling to make a better profit margin to make the stock holders happier.<br>
<br>
It's like today in the Bazaar.  There was some guy there selling Large Blocks of Enchanted Clay for 100p each.  I was talking to him about that.  I mean, clay costs a silver or two, and it takes an enchanter 60 mana or so to enchant it.  You can create your own stack of enchanted clay with a level 12 enchanter in probably under 1 minute.  Yet he was counting on the fact that people would be ignorant of what goes into making enchanted clay.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I didn't mean to start a holy war of &quot;build-your-own&quot; versus &quot;buy-a-package&quot;.  There's different right answers for everyone.  I'm an inbetween kind of girl.  I like to have some of the bits put together for me.  But I'm really confident I can install things like memory, cards, disk drives and such.<br>
<br>
To the person who asked about the motherboard, it's a EPOX 8k3a+.  I was looking for a different version which would've been cheaper, but they didn't have it in the configuration I wanted.  When I designed my pc I wanted, fast but inexpensive so I had to make some tradeoffs.  I got a lot of useful ideas from:<br>
