<br>
now,if your saying the changes were made to try to keep people intersted,then i can accept that. but drastic changes tend to cause more problems then they fix especially long term.<br>
<br>
the safehouse is a perfect example of the state of daoc,for the first 3-4 months,it was very active. then it started becoming less and less active,now its almost a ghost town in reality.<br>
<br>
im not saying everyone who left,left because they quit daoc. but alot of the people no longer post here,because they dont play the game anymore.<br>

<br>
Is the game so delicate that small changes make such a difference or is it that mythic makes huge moves without really thinking about how it will impact balance?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thoughts:<br>
<br>
Having played UO since Beta, AC since Beta, you name it- I began to really see things differently after a period of time. Much of that perspective came from Raph Koster. I will share with you a few of his thoughts and the thoughts of those he learned from:<br>
<br>
- Depth is the key to an online game’s success. <br>
<br>
It becomes more difficult to administrate the game as the game gets deeper. The amount of interactions makes rule balancing extremely difficult, and perfectly logical actions (such as normal laws of physics) may result in undesirable activity. Houses in UO, which could be broken into by any number of legitimate means, are a great example (healers ressing through windows, for example). What’s more, these are very hard to fix.<br>
<br>
- Dynamic world<br>
<br>
Another Holy Grail. Players want the ultimate. We gave them crafting of leather goods, they wanted lacquering and embroidery. We gave them herding of animals, they want animal husbandry and a genetic system for animal breeding. Why? Because they want to shape their space, and leave a lasting mark. You must provide some means for them to do so. <br>
<br>
<br>
My own thoughts are that ofcourse Mythic thinks about balance. However they have some challenges. When you are working on a game, you have time to make changes, adjust those changes and really test those changes before a game goes beta. While they are making those changes, everyone realizes &quot;Hey, we are just trying this out&quot; and they expect the game to change and find that &quot;delicate balance&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well, when you release a game two things happen. Players become this HUGE QA team you never had and the game you thought you had balanced becomes a 'work in progress'.<br>
<br>
So using the numbers before them, they begin to try and manage a delicate multiplayer ecosystem if you will. They see some species dying out and others flourishing. In addition, to keep the game 'fun' and 'exciting' they try and add some new content.  As they work on both of these you are sorta right on both accounts: YES, they can be 'huge' moves and YES 'small changes make a big difference'.  <br>
<br>
As I was saying about it being a 'work in progress', they have to make some changes, test them, test them with the player community and then eventually let the massive community load test them as well. Sometimes they will get a reaction they didn't expect- after all it's near impossible to predict every relationship to the game code.  Remember this is a service- and just as any company would, they want to minimize their exposure to failure. If they find a huge bug, yes they will simply reverse the code or bring the game down. However, for features added to the game, they may just figure out a way to add another feature to reverse it.  It's a 'work in progress' with an audience and although it seems to us an obvious 'about face', it was probably planned that way after realizing their delicate ecosystem was disrupted with [enter an ability here]. I hate to say that because I dread to think our world is unbalanced at any time. However, the cold hard truth is that at times it will be- no matter how small or massive that unbalance is. Sometimes we just have to wait and hope they keep making adjustments. This may be the way it stays, this may not be - on any facet of the game. The hardest and inevitable fact is we will have to wait and see. <br>
<br>
I too have been on the 'we have a cool feature' and the 'crap we just lost it' train. I have played a Hunter to level 50 (still play him on Palo), a Shadowblade (Palo) and a Enchanter on Andred and I know very well the excitement and feeling of &quot;Holy Cow we are going to own with this&quot; and the huge disappointment of seeing an apparent strength &quot;removed or negated&quot;.  Some of them I understand why - some I don't. I think only Mythic and those in the staff meetings will truly understand but you can rest assured that they know there is competition coming, they know this is a business and a service and we are the customers, and they know they have to make a game that retains you.  The best advice I can give you is to try and realize that they do listen to player thoughts and feedback. Sometimes they will read yours specifically, somtimes it will be overlooked unfortunately - but if you provide them with well thought out and well written constructive criticism they will consider it. They have the bloodhound senses when it comes to rants, whines and attacks though so you better make sure you have thought out your argument ahead of time and try and really provide them with a sense of balance in your feedback. Just as we expect them to be balanced - they expect us to be as well.<br>
<br>
To help you out, you might take a look at one of the best resources on the web - Raph's webpage regarding online gaming. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/">www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I hope those reading this enjoyed the thoughts and are walking away with the idea they will come back with better feedback for Mythic.  Although I don't think Camo is unbalanced I am always personally wanting the game to be balanced before I see any of my own characters flourishing and yet the game failing because of it.<br>
<br>
