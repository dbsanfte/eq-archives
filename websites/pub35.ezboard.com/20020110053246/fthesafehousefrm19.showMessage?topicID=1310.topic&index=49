Here are mine :</span><hr size=1> yes if u think your evading 1 out of 2 times in RvR you are crazy................................................................................................................................i posted this a few days ago. and yes i have seen evade happen in RvR now. too bad i had to scroll back to see it after the fight was over. problem is alot of RvR is large scale and often i never even see if i hit or been hit til after the battle is done. the battle spam is that great................last 2 nights 8 hours of RvR. total amount of times i could of pulled this combo off=zero.<br>
<br>
i can't belive how many people are looking forward to the 4 move combo based on evade. it baffles me and i keep wonderign what level are u guys that you think this will be helpful. i am going to break it down and its lack of being useful.<br>
<br>
i am a lvl 38 shadowblade. i have good amount of experience in RvR and XP groups. RvR=player versus player or realm vs realm, PvE=player versus enviroment. yes some people still don't know what those stand for. <br>
<br>
RvR- while i would say i evade 1 out of 3 times in PvE, in RvR evade is almost non existent. i have 5000 realm points and to this day i have rarely seen evade actualy occur for me in RvR. but the text flys so quick in large scale RvR that its possible its happened on occasion and i didn't notice. <br>
but for argument sake lets say evade happens 1 out of 3 times in RvR. this is what would have to happen for you to be able to use the 4 move combo. <br>
to use your combo you would have to be attacked in melee range so u just made these combos useless against casters and archer types which means you will only be using these against warrior types or other rogues. now after taking this into consideration once u are attacked you will have to evade the attack before starting your 4 move combo <br>
which would happen on average anywhere in the 1st 3 times we are hit. HELLO mythic. once i am hit in RvR i last about 2.5 hits before i am dead. who the heck is going to do a 4 move combo in this amount of time. how you going to pull off this 4 move combo when a warrior type is hitting you for 150 to 300 pts of damage per hit, all i can say is you better pray you evade there first hit. which to this day in RvR i have yet to notice a evade against a player character of another realm while fighting and i am lvl 38. this combo is very useless in RvR. i paid attention last night how many times i could of used this combo in RvR and the amount was zero. even if evade worked i could of never got past the 1st 2 parts of the combo. wouldn't of lived long enough. grade for RvR -F [very useless} <br>
<br>
large XP groups. while i really do like evade in PvE it happens alot. on one occasion i evaded like 7 times in a row on a purple. i might find this combo somewhat usefull if it wasnt for the fact one of the combos you won't get til your lvl 50. in which case xp wont be desirable anymore. in XP groups you generaly don't want your assasin type character getting aggro. and to pull off these chains you must gain aggro. and completing these chains will increase the chance you have aggro on you. generaly healers don't like there rogues getting aggro, we take alot more damage than tanks meaning we need to be healed more increasing the odds that the healer will get aggroed on by the monster. grade for large xp groups-D <br>
[i don't see this being usefull in large groups] <br>
<br>
XP 4 person or less groups- this is where the combo can be usefull. i am ignoring the fact that at lvl 50 when u get the final piece of the combo xp won't be important anymore. but in 4 person groups where a assasin would be in the group. the group will msot likely consist of a healer type, warrior type, bard type and of acourse the SB. and most likely you will be fighting reds or less. where the damage done to us won't be as great if were hit as it would be in a 8 person group fighting purples. taking aggro against reds or oranges and evading and using the 4 move combo might be worth a little aggro. i will have to wait and see how much damage these combos really do before making that decesion. but i can see how this would be helpful. but in 4 person groups the goal is still to keep aggro on tank. GRADE- B- [while it now has a use. goal is still for tank to have aggro] <br>
<br>
SOLO- this is a no brainer. in soloing this 4 move combo will probably happen every fight and would be a every battle use for your everyday assasin. it would maybe make soloing a possibility for rogues if it werent for the fact again that the 4th link in the chain is at lvl 50. GRADE-A <br>
<br>
OVERALL- in my opinion the strength of DAOC is RvR. most of us will be lvl 50 within 6 months of playing DAOC. where this game stands out is the fun of RvR.and i think that is why this combo will not work. even if they fix evade and make it 1 out of every 3 times in RvR like they do in PvE pulling this 4 piece combo off will be very tough. <br>
pulling this off in groups or large scale wars won't happen. we wont live 4 hits once we are attacked and we must be attacked to pull this combo off. only possible time we can use this combo would be when soloing in RvR and as is we can kill greens and greys in 1 shot with perf artery. the only time we will ever get this combo off will be when soloing a warrior type. a caster once we hit them will run assuming they live.. they wont attack. - GRADE-D- [i didnt give it a F because its better than when it was based off parry. which made it totaly useless.] <br>
<br>
SUMMARY- RvR better find alot of blue and yellow tank types soloing if you want to use this combo. oranges and reds usualy kill me in 2 to 3 hits when i attack them and i have all orange armor. hardly enough time to get the combo off. and greens and greys won't live long enough for this combo to matter either. <br>
<br>
SUMMARY-XP. this new combo could make the assasin type a person who could solo. but again once we attain the lvl to do the combo xp isnt a factor anymore <br>
