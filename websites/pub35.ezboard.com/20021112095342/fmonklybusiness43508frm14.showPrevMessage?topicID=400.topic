Started going off on a tangent, and decided it would be best to start a brand new topic.<br>
<br>
Console games for a long time have held the field in the video game industry.  Then PC became more and more advanced at displaying colors and running more powerful graphic applications.  This led to the advent of designated video cards whose sole job was...to render video.  PCs took a heavy share of the video game market.  Incompatibility problems, buggy games, and constant need to upgrade has always plagued the PC market however.  But with that constant change came innovation, and the desire to reinvent the wheel.  Every year something new came out that just made our jaws drop.  Graphics have not yet grasped life-like quality, but I would say we are very close.<br>
<br>
Console games are of course not without its’ perks.  I've always viewed console games as something I can quickly get into for some easy fun.  Do to the nature of the system, you do loose customize options, but with that you get stability.  That I believe is far more important, and it is something I wish the pc game market would learn.  While it isn't always entirely their fault since they have to design a game to be compatible on 100 of different possible hardware and software configurations.  It is a well-known and commonly accepted practice however, of releasing software that is buggy and incomplete.  Verant is one <br>
<br>
There are companies that do take the quality of their product seriously, such as Blizzard.  They have a &quot;we'll release it when it's finished&quot; policy, that I greatly respect.  Companies like that though are rare, and when I buy a new game, before I play it, I usually go online and look for what patches are available.  Sad but true.  Console games are not without their own skeletons in the closet though (the translation for FFVII was just plain awful).  They are far less common however, and not on as grand a scale as some of the bugs I’ve seen in the PC industry.<br>
<br>
All right, so which is better: consoles or PC?  Each contender has great games for its class that appeals to a different gamer.  Personally, I'm a PC gamer.  I like resource gathering and strategy games that test my skill and wit.  But I also have a PS2 and GBA, and looking to purchase a Xbox in the near future.  Why?  Sometimes I want to log on for a game of Everquest, maybe play some Empire Earth, be a naughty God in Black &amp; White/Dungeon keeper, or raise a hero in Baldur's Gate.  Sometimes though, I just want to run around kicking some ass in GTA auto, be mildly annoyed by Tidus in FFX, or try for a 8 second run in GT3.  While bored at work, I'll play Golden Sun, or Zelda, and pretty soon, the FF remakes.  Every weekend, there are guys down in my dorm day room playing multiplayer Halo that'll I'll go join, or mingle who the curious females who come to watch (and sometimes even play).<br>
<br>
My point is, like women (la~), I don't limit myself to just one type.  You'll end up missing out on a lot of great choices.  My friend is always sending me pics of new Xbox titles coming out and trying to tell me why the Xbox is a superior platform to all others.  While those pics look great, I just want to grab his Xbox and beat him over the head with it, and let him know all the great titles he's missing out on.  It seems while the hardcore console gamer fusses over graphic quality and deformable terrain, the PC gamer fusses over game content and customize options.  <br>
<br>
The new Mechwarrior for Xbox has listed as its features the ability to destroy just about anything you see.  I have to admit the exploding building effect was pretty cool.  But, if I can't customize my mechs with new skins, download new maps, and campaigns, and hack the crap out of the game, then all that glittery tingly class will lose its appeal before it even hits the ground.  That's probably why Morrowind is such a great game still.  That game is as open ended as you can get.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to wrap this up I would say that in my opinion pc games are known for replayability, and console for quick and easy fun.<br>

<br>
PC games do have the keep playing value to them regarding games like everquest, UT etc. Console games are great, I love the ability to BEAT the game, get all the items, side quests like in FF series. As of late though not many games have caught my eye, I stick with everquest, cosmic rift etc until a game for PS2 comes out I like then im all over that game usually until I beat it. <br>
<br>
I'd have to say that I'm the kind of gamer thats 50/50 between consoles and PC games. I like the interaction on online games that you can't get on console games, but I also love the linear quality to most consolers.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60806">Baron Grad Kitano</a>

Show me a game worth Playing Ill play it.  But 90% of any platform (this includes PC) is pure crap, 9% of it may be good but just not your cup of tea.

And basically it's useless to state 'halo is bad' like a fact, since that's the farthest from the truth you can get, and basically only the most anti MS fanboys will agree with you.<br>
What kind of games do you like? I can easily recommend more (i own 16 xbox games but I've rented probably 75% of what there is...obviously avoiding things that are OBVIOUSLY shitty). <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

I don't know what 'amazing' FPS you've played with a better story than halo or with better graphics (discounting the obvious UT2k3). Not to mention halo has the most fluid FPS controls around without a mouse and keyboard. My accuracy is probably 1% less deadly with the halo controls than on a PC, and that's pretty good.<br>
Crazy Taxi 3: I'm a big fan of crazy taxi and I don't see how a fan of 1 or 2 can dislike this game. I mean it basically has 1 and 2 IN THE GAME. The Crazy X has some very cool missions, although I found the Crazy Pyramid harder, and the new cabbies rule. Glitter Oasis is like a bonus. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

It would have been way better if it was on the pc orginally.  I just believe all FPS function way better with a mouse and keyboard.  There are a few exceptions, but not many.  It still succeds as a game though.  The graphics and attention to detail in the game is just gorgeous.  Just take a sniper rifle and zoom in on the grass, or on the suits and you'll see for yourself what people rave about.  The fact that there IS a coherent story for a FPS is another shocker.  I just believe Halo has been used as the sole arguement for the Xbox for too long.  &quot;What console should I buy?&quot; &quot;DUDE, get an Xbox!&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Um...Halo...duuuh&quot;.<br>

And FDer, if the controls sucked do you honestly think you'd be able to shoot anything? let alone the hordes of intelligent enemies you're faced with?<br>
The controls are fine, it's the player who isn't willing to give them a try that sucks. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

First few times you play halo the controls are aggravating, but once you get the hang of it they are perfect.  Turn the sensativity up to a 7 or 8 and youre good to go.  It has a great storyline, not just a &quot;Uhh theres badguys over here you should blow them up&quot; kind of thing, and the graphics are amazing. <p><center>

There is nothing wrong with the controls. You just arent used to using two sticks to moving instead of 4 buttons and a mouse. Get over it, the theoretical functionality of a mouse and an analog stick are exactly the same. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

Not enjoying the game.  Not liking it.  Wishing someone would come up behind me and shoot me in the back of the head........I generally form the opinion that the game sucks.  If the controls take more then 5 hours to get used to.....They suck.  Buffy has a similer control scheme and I got used to that in less then 2.  Onimusha has a weird control scheme (weird in the way that the controls remain true to your characters view and not which way he's facing *or something like that*), See its not soley the controls.  Its the whole package!  <br>
<br>
I cant spend a lot of time defining why I dont like the game, because unless your me (and your not) they wouldnt really apply.  If you Halo, Lovely.  Have a ball.  If you dont like it....Theyres nothing wrong with you....just move on to another game.  This is just someplace where our roads divide.<br>
<br>
And Yang.....Get Help, really!  Your fanatatical Devotion to Halo is really unnerving.  I keep expecting to see a TV news report of some strange individual in Master Chief's armor harrassing woman in a Food mart.  Let it go man.  Its just a game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showMessageRange?topicID=417.topic&start=21&stop=29>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=417.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showNextMessage?topicID=417.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.emailToFriend?topicID=417.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.threadControl?topicID=417.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=417.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=417.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14>Other Games</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
