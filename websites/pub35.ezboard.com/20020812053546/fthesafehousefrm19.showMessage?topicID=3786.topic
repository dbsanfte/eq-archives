I go through about 75gold worth of poisons for an 8 hour session.<br><br><br>Okay: Typical nightshades, on my server Galahad, go the melee/MG camping template. Medium CS, High Pierce, as low as they can get on Stealth and Env yet still hit 50 with items. Oddly enough, sense the time of one-shots being taken out, I have really only seen one person succeed with this formula, and I think that has alot to do with him solo'ing alot and having purge <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>I approach combat differently with the above template. I *always* try and land PA in every fight, and I almost always switch to my 3rd weapon in fights where I'm little more than a glorified blademaster for that extra dot kick. Baring instant heals... I drop my first target.<br><br>But where this template truely shines is in anything related to forts. As I've recently found a very good way to defend forts as a nightshade, I've increased my enjoyment of them significantly (also made my name infamous to a few people, always a warm fuzzy feeling). So lets break down the fort fighting.<br><br>Attacking a fort:<br>Hib forts are by far the easiest to attack, most every assasin knows this. But, if we stay around we die, if we get stuned, we more than likely die. So its usually 'one hit quick' and get the hell out of there. My template maximises on this strength, high CS with high Env + poison crits. Climb up, PA + LB if I get a sizable crit on a rezzer type, punch viper. If I have haste and no instant stunners are around I might stick around to CD my target. But regardless, while I'm ditching the bowmen agro and climbing back up, my LB is still doing my work for me. And in a fort defense, unless its an Armsman type who I missed my PA on, every defender is *only* thinking about how my LB is effecting their health and survivability. But by this time, my 10sec is up and I'm already over the edge with poisons reloaded. If my target was dumb enough to not seek healing help, he is dead this time around. If he did get healed, I go for the next Target of Opportunity, or I nail him again to prove a point that he needs to get off those ramparts.<br><br>Fort Defense:<br>Without giving up too many of my secrets (although my tactics are becoming well known to those that have fought me recently), I merely use the Tank Gatekeeper technique with more OOMF. Tanks like to port out, smack some people around and port back in, hopefully not dying, but if they do they die inside. Well.... our damage is front loaded right? Soooo use the gatekeeper to deliver. Stealth out, pick a target, PA+LB (CD if you didn't walk very far) and bingo you are back inside. Again, emphasising CS, Env and Wild Arcana Skills. Unfortunately, this is very defendable: and the attackers have many tools to destealth/kill you as you are trying this. Its self balancing thankfully -- at least if you play against a smart enemy. Combined with other defenders, and some bait to keep the enemy assasins busy on our ramparts instead of coming to end my life in the CY, I typically use this with some success -- its fun regardless.<br><br><br><br><br>In these situations, I'd say the Nightshade excells over our assasin breathren - especially if they put some points into Wild Arcana. I went this path merely on a fluke suprisingly... my first Realm spec went horribly wrong, so when they put respec in I decided to buy Viper, cause if I didn't buy it now, I probably never would -- and I always had a respect left if it sucked. I spent the next few realm levels getting generalist skills like MoS1, long wind, etc.<br><br>But then it hit me. I spend 5 points to get WA (1pre-req +3pre-req +1) to be able to crit on all 4 of my poisons where I would NEVER be able to otherwise. Hrm... okay. I figured that 5% over nothing is better than an increased 5% if i went the Mastery of Pain route. Plus I my fighting style favors my envenom use, so it was a natural conclusion for me. I just got WA3 last night, but even with WA2 I would noticable get crits on all 4 of my poisons (highest dot so far is 312/tick -- vipered of course)<br><br>But the problem in shades - and my template points this out - is that when we get into melee combat, we get owned. In any situation when I can't PA, can't repoison, I am a weak blademaster. Its all over. I don't have the str/con to live long and go toe to toe -- I don't have the weapon spec (a template choice), and I don't have any toe to toe Realm Abilities, besides the generic dodger 2 (IP, Purge, MoP, etc)<br><br>Unfortunately, most assasins go with melee templates and fight solo around the PK/MGs cause they see big numbers. Woot, solo kill netted me 800 RPs, weee. Yet in the same time he waited for that solo kill, I've gotten 6 150rp kills at a fort.... And some do succeede, but far few do, cause our brother assasins perform MUCH better in this role.<br><br>I am *very* happy with my Nightshade. I also think that the lifetap on our shout would be the minor fix that we need to bring us inline. It won't really have much effect on me at all, but it might help those shades that melee more than I do and address our con problem w/o having to resort to timed buffs or what not.<br><br>So in conclusion, I have found a template (self-proclaimed Venomaster) that works for my style of fighting (grouped, and fort) that puts me on par with my assasin counterparts. However, I am acutely aware of our difficiencies in other areas of fighting.<br><br><br>This something along the lines you were thinking of? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Grollo, 50 shade, Galahad... aka <p><img src=http://www.pakcafan.com/daoc/images/cougsig.jpg></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucougarpak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cougar Pak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/23/02 12:14:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 12:32:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3786.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'll bite</span><hr size=1> Yes.

Naturally speaking, it's actually stacked in favor of Shadowblades and Infiltrators:<br><br>1) Shadowblades will always swing with both weapons<br><br>2) Infiltrators will have more specialization points to take up Envenom<br><br>When looking at Realm Abilities, Nightshades have some unique potential. But it is not free and comes at a cost where SB/Inf can spend their points elsewhere. Instead of analying it from the perspective that it increases your Envenom damage, I calculate things purely as a damage add, regardless of the source. On a per point basic, investing in Wild Arcana is not as beneficial as MoP, DR, or Dodger, but it does increase some damage overall. I didn't have much success with my Viper/WAIII Nightshade. I can see situations in hit and runs where chance strikes lucky in your favor and you make off with a critical can be beneficial in things like keep defense. When it comes to overall damage, your weapon damage will always be a higher percentage of your overall combat damage, more than poison. It is easier to see why MoP will add more damage since it focuses on the melee aspect of damage which occupies a larger portion of combat. If you do not stick around for combat, WAIII/Viper may work in your favor, but I found it mostly to get purged anyway and the target I went after was going to die anyway, Viper was only the final blow.<br><br>In other words, for the same points that it takes a Nightshade to obtain WAIII, a SB/Inf gets more damage with MoPIII than a Nightshade with WAIII. The moment you start to say Nightshades are better at Envenom, you must equally say that SB/Infs will be better at Criticals or Dual Weapons. There is a tradeoff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 5:53:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3786.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshades</span><hr size=1> Good points Elaa.  Although an infiltrator has more spec points, neither the Inf nor the NS will likely take their envenom past 39.  Granted, this is a choice each must make, but since this is the standard, I like to use it as a constant.<br><br>WA affects envenom, but also affects the DDs I believe.  In every encounter I've had with NSs the DDs do get used, so there is another potential strength.<br><br>NSs also have access to MoP and Dodger, so I think in the long run with all of these abilities, perhaps the NS is a bit ahead in envenom.  Additionaly, with a DW of 18 I seldom have to go past my Creeping Death to apply two poisons, and feel that the SB swinging with two weapons is not much of a balance in this area.<br><br>Also, the Thrust Inf needs to take thrust to 50 to get Dragonfang (and I think most probably do); I wanted to keep my Thrust at 39, but that gave me little chance in 1v1s. A NS can be content at a lower number (39 maybe?).  This difference sucks up 445 spec points which is almost all of the difference between 2.2 and 2.5.  I'm not sure what slashers do, but since Diamond Slash has such great damage, I imagine many slashers to that route. <br><br>Of course, having a higher weapon skill will mean more damage for those infiltrators. So the Inf should be ahead in pure melee damage.<br><br>Infiltrators have been somewhat forced into being a melee class with envenom.  This is pretty much true all the way through the Infs career.  Would it be fair to say that early in his career, a shade is a melee class with a little envenom and a couple of spells, then later becomes an envenom class with decent melee and a couple of spells?

What does MoP and Dodger have to do with envenom?<br><br><i>the Thrust Inf needs to take thrust to 50 to get Dragonfang</i><br><br>But do they have to have Dragonfang? Diamondback, the hibernia evade/stun pierce style is a great PvE style. But come RvR time the usefulness is limited. It can be parried, blocked, evaded, or bladeturned.<br><br><i>A NS can be content at a lower number (39 maybe?). This difference sucks up 445 spec points which is almost all of the difference between 2.2 and 2.5.</i><br><br>This is assuming an infiltrator has to have 50 thrust spec in order to survive, which they don't have to have. Let's say that infiltrators could only spend their extra spec points on weapon skills. Then their advantage is 20% more melee damage and a evade/9 second stun style. Still sounds better than a 60 damage shout and inferior str/con, doesn't it? But Infiltrators aren't forced into only using their extra spec points for weapon skill. They have options.<br><br><i>Infiltrators have been somewhat forced into being a melee class with envenom.</i><br><br>All the assassins have been forced into being a melee class with envenom. Critical Strikes is nearly worthless in PvE, and has dubious value in RvR. For the spec points we spend on Critical Strikes, we get half the value of Archers speccing Bow.<br><br>2.0 spec points were fine. Critical Strikes should be a unspecced skill (level based) skill. But I disgress.<br><br><i>a shade ... becomes an envenom class with decent melee and a couple of spells</i><br><br>Envenom is still more useful at low levels than in is at high levels. Envenom, by itself, is never a good substitute for melee damage. As I said above, all the assassins are forced into being melee classes.<br><br>The Infiltrators happen to have more spec points to fulfill that role--they can choose to be better at melee or better at dual wielding (realistically since stealth, envenom and critical strikes will likely all be high).<br><br>The Shadowblades have marginally better hitpoints and better weapon selection to fulfill that role (slower weapons are almost always better, midgard has the slowest offhanders).<br><br>The Nightshades can try to fill that role, but do the worst job at it of the three assassins. Nightshades have a few additional options with RAs and poisons, but the options are all costly and as there is a limit to how many RA points you can get there is a tradeoff if a Nightshade chooses to go the Poison route.<br><br><i>And have the NS spell variances been fixed yet?</i><br><br>Yes! 3 casts of my DD plus 1 shout DD is better than my Perforate Artery now. Ashame I can't use that to pull in RvR. ;) All the more reason why I hate Critical Strikes though.<br><br>As I've said other times, I don't mind being the weakest of the assassins. I want some nifty spells to make up for it. Supposedly that was what Nightshades were going to get for being weaker in melee: spells.<br><br>P.S.

Well, the Nightshade has random crits with the poison, and double dot damage every 30 minutes, but the Infiltrator has augmented hit points, an out of combat heal, and purge. The Nightshade also has 4 points which give him NO return at all, with being forced to buy Aug Acuity. The Infiltrator will have better overall melee by virtue of having more spec points to play with, and also has 2 ways of dealing with the Nightshade's supposed strength: you can heal some of the damage from the poisons with FA, or you can purge the effects completely.<br><br>Here's another example:<br><br>Nightshade: 22 points<br>Aug Acuity 2 (pre-req, does *nothing*)<br>Wild Arcana 2<br>Viper<br><br>Infiltrator: 22 points<br>First Aid 2<br>Vanish<br><br>Here, the Nightshade has superior poisons. The Infiltrator can negate some of the poison damage with an out of combat heal, AND has the ability to instantly stealth to either: help with a getaway or to get in a second PA. It's also worth noting that the infiltrator could also choose to save up ONE more point and just get Ignore Pain. <br><br>Basically, Nightshades are being forced to buy their way to equality...unfortunately, all they are equal to are assassins with NO RA's. Infiltrators can merely use their RA's to continue to widen the gap.<br><br>I think that's a problem.<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3786.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3786.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3786.topic&index=12><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3786.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3786.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3786.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3786.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
