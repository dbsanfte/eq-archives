  This thread is now the official public notification thread of what is going on.  Distribution has been shutdown.  The history of the whole discussion is contained in this thread.<br>
<br>
  Please be sure to read the history to keep yourself an informed user regarding tools of this nature.  I feel that since I released this software initially, it is my duty to inform the user base of its status.<br>

  Using them apparently *can* put you at risk should Sony attempt to try and enforce it.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
  I am purposely posting this here since I could really use some of you rogues to help test my damage parser out.  Specifically to test out the backstab and proc portions to make sure it is catching everything.<br>
<br>
  If any of you want to get down to the nitty-gritty and do comparisons of the values shown/said in the program to your log files -- great!  Let me know if I'm missing something.  If not, I'll gladly accepted *** ZIPPED *** versions of your eqlog_servernumber_charname.txt files and do it myself at <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: eqannounce@hotmail.com"> eqannounce@hotmail.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END-->.<br>
<br>
To all the sceptics:  We are *proudly* Sony approved.<br>
<br>
For those not familiar with EQAnnounce: it is a FREE in-game NOTES.TXT and log file parser. Based on commands issued to it via the /note command, it provides the user feedback using the Microsoft Text-To-Speech engine. <br>
<br>
Features: <br>
<br>
o Timers (&quot;Spawn&quot;, &quot;Spell&quot;, &quot;Skill&quot;, generic &quot;Event&quot;) <br>
o Keyword &quot;watch&quot;es, for words when they appear in the log file. <br>
o Damage monitoring and statistics <br>
o Voice settings (selecting the voice and speed of speech) <br>

<br>
You have no idea how *@&amp;!^ing pissed I am about this.  I got authorized by someone at Sony, and now the left hand isn't talking to the right hand.  How does that suprise me...  /e rolls eyes.  And miraculously &quot;we don't know who that individual is&quot;, yet I call his friggin voice number at work, can leave a voice mail, press 0 and it rolls over to Sony's western region operator.<br>
<br>
I am seriously contemplating just open sourcing it.<br>
<br>
In the interim, if you are scripting inclined you might try EQWatcher, does some of the same things but you have to use scripts.<br>

<br>
Distribution shut down per request of Sony Online.<br>
<br>
Over the last day or so I have spoken with the Director of Legal and Business affairs both by email and voice.  I might add that he was very personable.<br>
<br>
These were not his words verbatim, but I will give you the run-down.<br>
<br>
In summary, Sony is not in the business of evaluating third-party software.  Period.  The End.  As a systems architect/developer in real-life,  I wondered why they would devote manpower to evaluating third-party applications on a regular basis.  This doesn't make a whole lot of business sense, personally.  When I received the initial approval, I was so ecstatic I didn't take a bunch of time to focus on that.  That should have been my first clue.<br>
<br>
To make a long story short, someone impersonated someone at Sony and gave me an email authorization.  This individual worked for a different division of Sony.  Even had he not been impersonated, he didn't have the authority to grant the approval.<br>
<br>
After ironing out the &quot;unofficial&quot; approval problem we talked about where we go moving forward.<br>
<br>
Sony would prefer that I just cease distribution.  Which I am doing.  Since they don't evaluate third-party applications (to make sure there are no trojans, etc.), we will not be evaluated.  He did mention he wouldn't mind evaluating us should this policy change though.<br>
<br>
I then briefly explained what the application did and that I felt it didn't constitute any violations of either the EULA or Rules of Conduct, only that the distribution of it might open me up personally lible for Article 14 of the Rules of Conduct.<br>
<br>
Ok, so I can't distribute it.  Can I, me personally, still use it?<br>
<br>
He was then very clear in indicating to me that &quot;the use of a third-party tool&quot; including this one would be considered &quot;in violation.&quot;  The basis for this being because what it does violates, or if it just being &quot;third-party&quot; violates was not confirmed.<br>
<br>
Not threateningly, he mentioned that while my account could be flagged so that it is watched if I wanted to continue trying to using the tool, that it just would be much simpler to not.  I have to agree.  If they could detect it running or not, I don't care, it really isn't worth it to me.<br>
<br>
Ok, so now I can't run it either.<br>
<br>
This basically answered my next question:  If you are concerned about trojan horses, how about I just release the source code to the public and they can compile it themselves?<br>
<br>
Well, if *I* personally could be in violation if I run it -- yours truly would be if you compiled it and ran it yourselves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  SO...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> we are shut down.<br>
<br>
At least until (if ever) they begin evaluating third-party applications.  I feel confident that I'll be one of the first considered since I did everything &quot;above-board&quot;, but most likely if that day ever comes I won't be playing EverQuest then so it will probably be moot.<br>
<br>
So, it is my unfortunate duty to inform all the pleased users that they should not run the program if they have downloaded it and that if you do, it is at your own risk should they put up detection systems for it.<br>
<br>
/e sigh.  Guess it's back to my monk...<br>
<br>
TO ALL THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ACTIVISTS:<br>
<br>
Don't even begin to go off on the usual &quot;Lets rally to the cause against the evil Sony&quot;, I'm not going to waste my time fighting this.  It's just not worth it to me.<br>
<br>

<br>
Not to insult Glimwin but I told him in the beginning which man to talk to at Sony, and what the response would be.  He knew that email does not constitute &quot;express written permission&quot;.<br>
<br>
Before this gets out of hand, keep in mind there is nothing wrong with using real-time log parsers.  Mr. Legal Director knows this, but if problems arise they have the option of jumping on anyone's EQ account who is distributing EQ software -- this includes EQCASTER, EQWATCHER, any EQCLIENT.INI EDITOR, *anything* that is written for EQ.  These are ALL &quot;third party&quot; and like the man says, Sony is not a business of evaluating third party software.  Using it isn't even against the licensing agreement unless you're using something like SHOWEQ, or any of the &quot;hacks&quot;.<br>
<br>
Quite honestly, they probably wouldn't even had said anything to Glimwin if he hadn't spoke first.  I highly doubt the guy who made EQCASTER got an email.<br>
<br>
Anyway, keep fully informed and don't be starting new rumors.  Not to plug my software but EQAnnounce was designed to be like it, feel free to take a look (we use the same news sites so if you've seen his news you've probably seen mine).  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqwatcher.freeservers.com">eqwatcher.freeservers.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

I should have got a piece of paper in the mail, but oh well - kinda doesn't matter now.<br>
<br>
I agree that log parsers should not be blacklisted.  I don't feel they violate.  Hell, I doubt Sony even does.  I do, however, understand where Sony is coming from.<br>
<br>
When speaking to Mr. Director -- I didn't get the impression that he found anything really wrong with what we were doing, but that the concern was for the user base being mass-infected by a malicious third-party program by a trojan.  There are many computer illiterates out there that play the game.  And while being very proficient (with high level chars, and much at stake) in the game -- they aren't with stuff of that nature.  I felt his concern was more for the user base and not &quot;the money machine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since Sony isn't in the business of evaluating third-party programs, the only thing that will make them work then is their user base and their reputation for quality.  EQWatcher has always had that.<br>
<br>
EQWatcher has made great advancements and from what I have seen easily surpasses what I was doing.  From the beginning I tried to shield the user from a lot of the techno mumbo-jumbo.  I'm sure EQWatcher has this thing well oiled now.<br>
<br>
His scripts that come with it most likely cover anything I was doing.  If not, scripters could write their own to have it do even what mine did.<br>
<br>
He's pretty much the only one on the block now.  Too bad I don't even dare run EQWatcher in case they are watching me now.<br>
<br>
Oh, EQWatcher -- a new thing I added was capturing data into a grid (specifically damage related), but could be used for any information.  This could then be copied to the clipboard to paste wherever you wanted.<br>
<br>
Your users might find this helpful.<br>

<br>
Since EQWatcher has censored my comments on his message board because it does not fit his *vision*, I will post them here.<br>
<br>
I think it is not only irresponsible but reckless to hide the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Director of Legal and Business Affairs'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> position on the matter because it doesn't fit your mold.  It doesn't get much higher than that.<br>
<br>
*AND* EQWatcher, we both know the .opt editor *IS* a violation.<br>
<br>
To anyone out there using third-party utilities regarding EQ you should do so at your own risk.  I don't think Verant has a legal leg to stand on, but if you really get down to it -- is it really worth it?<br>
<br>
At least here hopefully the &quot;third-party&quot; user base can make an intelligent decision based on the facts.<br>
<br>
As to the reason why I was not banned, I do not know.  I guarantee you I have not ran my program, nor will I ever again though because it is EXTREMELY clear to me Sony's position on this.<br>
<br>
Now, on to the discussion...<br>
<br>

Before anyone decides to flip out about this topic, here is the story as it should have been told in the first place.<br>
<br>
EQAnnounce created a mockup of EQWatcher using Text-to-Speech, but in Visual Basic and making it convert the TTS to .WAV first .. <br>
<br>
He spoke with someone at am.sony.com via email and the guy didn't exactly &quot;authorize&quot; it, but said something more along the lines of &quot;this should not be a problem.&quot; Furthermore it wouldn't be &quot;express written permission&quot; anyway since it was given in an email. He sort of fudged this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
*Regardless* Using EQWatcher, or EQAnnounce, or any other third party software related to EQ, is not in violation of the EULA. Did you know that EQCLIENT.INI editors and EQCASTER, and all of those programs must follow the same exact rules we follow? It's like the man said, they don't evaluate third party software -- they have no reason to, being capitalist. Unless a problem arises with a piece of software, such as SHOWEQ, etc., there is no reason to make a big deal of it. Ever.<br>
<br>
Now. EQWatcher, and EQAnnounce for that matter since it was based on EQWatcher, are designed (just like eqclient.ini editors and just like eqcaster) so that usage does not break the rules laid out in the EULA and Rules of Conduct. None of the above have &quot;express written permission&quot; to distribute their software (Rule of Conduct #14 says we must have this permission to distribute it, or our EQ account is in violation). Also partially because Sony is a capitalist business, they have no reason to seek us out and kill us just because we're distributing some free software that does not allow the user to break the agreements. If we charged for this software, they would come at us with a dagger and sword. I have no intention of charging for EQWatcher.<br>

No, the guy authorized it.  And the guy worked for Sony Electronics Corporation of America.  The parent to SOE.<br>
<br>
Now, to get the facts straight...  The guy that actually &quot;evaluated&quot; and &quot;approved&quot; it was impersonating a guy out of the office at the time so that he could get a copy since I had pulled the plug on downloads until I could get an authorization.  This impersonator went so far as to use this guys email and work phone number. <br>
<br>
One of three things occurred:<br>
<br>
1)  Someone framed this guy to get him in trouble once I started saying I was approved by Sony from &quot;joe blow&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) The impersonator just wanted to get a back-door copy after I had shut down the downloads.<br>
<br>
3) Sony realizing what had happened, coached the guy into playing dumb when I called him up and asked him about it all.<br>
<br>
In the end though, EQWatcher is completely right in the following...<br>

It should be pointed out EQWatcher that Mr. Director made it very clear to me in saying &quot;Should you decide to continue to run it -- it is your 'call'.  It is up to you to decide if you think we can detect it or not, however, you would be in violation if we caught you and you would be subject to discipline.&quot;<br>
<br>
That kind of sounds like they feel that running *any* third-party software that is in direct relation to EverQuest is a violation.<br>
<br>
Take that for what it is worth.  Does it suck?  Yes...  Should it be the case?  Hell No, we both know that...<br>
<br>
We both know Sony would have a legal wrangling if they decided to mass-enforce that, but quite honestly I have neither the desire, time, nor money to be some cause's martyr.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit to add following comments </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Unless you want to fight a legal battle, don't be surprised if they decide to start banning on these third-party tools.  Especially those that run while the game is running since that would be their detection point.<br>
<br>
Offline Third-Party EQ tools might be safe, but that could even be scanned if they chose to.<br>

<br>
If you would care to explain why an .OPT editor would be a violation, please do so.  According to the terms I agree to when I play EverQuest, there is nothing that says anything about it.<br>
<br>
There is no &quot;approval&quot; unless it is &quot;express written permission&quot;, if you cannot accept this, I do not understand why you try to explain to me anything from the EULA and/or Rules of Conduct, because you do not understand them yourself.<br>
<br>
And as I mentioned in the thread I directed you toward, REGARDLESS of what they &quot;FEEL&quot;, you do NOT agree to Terms of Service/End User License Agreements that do not exist.  They SAY it is a violation because in general, tools that people would want for EverQuest involve cheating in some form (showeq, everbot, &quot;hacking&quot;, etc), and they want to deter people from using those and from downloading software that might contain viruses.  They do not GIVE express written permission TO DISTRIBUTE because, just like you said he said, they are not a business of evaluating third party software.  If they DID give this permission, both you and I would have obtained it.  <br>
<br>
NOBODY including the creators of EQParse, EQclient.ini editors, etc., have permission to distribute their utilities.  None of these authors have been contacted in regards to their utilities, because usage of these utilities do not violate the agreements.  We all know the authors of ShowEQ and similar utilities HAVE been contacted, because use violates the EULA.  We all know that people HAVE been banned for violating the EULA by hacking/modifying EQ (&quot;make all classes have mend&quot; &quot;run 50 times normal speed&quot; etc).<br>
<br>
Now.  What you are doing on my message board, and here, is whining that I deleted your silly post (and my own).  This type of whining is dumb and not needed on anybody's board.<br>
<br>
What I am explaining to you and the rest of the community, is that you are blowing up your situation to try to get everyone else to stop.  Obviously if they wanted to ban people for distributing EQ log parsers they would have done it already.  They won't, not until someone starts trying to sell one (why waste their resources otherwise?).  Which I do not intend to do.<br>
<br>
They (Verant/SOE) have shown for the duration of their existence that they will not ban or suspend people for using utilties that do not violate the agreement that you click &quot;I AGREE&quot; to every time you play EQ.  The terms are pretty specific on what is allowed and not allowed, and I'm sure you have read the explanation.  Follow this link and your druidic wisdom will increase by one point: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqwatcherbeta.tripod.com/eula.html">eqwatcherbeta.tripod.com/eula.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Note that they cannot scan for programs without your permission.  It doesn't make good business sense.  They have tried to implement that before, but promptly removed it after the masses of EQ customers complained. <br>
<br>
Again, the terms of service/end user license agreement is a legal agreement that you (or your parents if you are not of  age to enter a legal agreement) agree to the terms explicitly defined.  There won't be a legal battle, because they know I am correct.  The legal director will back down if you show him the EULA, and point you to Rule #14 which says your account is not in good standing if you distribute EQ-related software.  Usage has never been prohibited.<br>

Every EQ parser and .ini editor are completely offline utilities.  If not and are ran in real-time, two networked machines are used.

  It is possible to detect a log parser by scanning the executables currently running on a system at the time EverQuest does it's scan.  This is cake to do.  If this is how they detect stuff, I have no clue.<br>

Sony *does* have Big Brother tendencies.<br>

There used to be a restaraunt in NYC called &quot;Sony's&quot;. It was named after a person.  It was in business for a few years, when Sony lawyers got wind of it and had it shut down. Their 'legal' reason? Sony Corporation might at some time in the future want to open a restaraunt. And they might want to call it &quot;Sony's&quot;.  Never mind that Sony corporation has never been (and likely never will be) in the restaraunt business. They crushed a small business owner for absolutely no reason, other than a power trip.<br>
<br>
To us, EQ is fun and a game. But to Sony, EQ is money and power, nothing more. If you are going to deal with a powerful entity like a big multi-national corporation, it is dangerous not to understand their mindset.<br>

<br>
First off if they try to detect other software you have on your computer to see if you are running a program that is doing something with EQ, then that violates the constitution in America.<br>
<br>
Sure they might think they can shut down some people doing it and get away with it.. but eventually they are going to hit someone with power and money that plays the game.  And that is when they will be sorry for doing it.<br>
<br>
If these programs automates some form of the game I could see it being a problem.  But since the user has to take the information the program gives, and react in game to it, then it isn't altering the gameplay and shouldn't be any problem.<br>
<br>
Besides that ... if they did detect something running on your computer they have know way of knowing what exactly it is doing without hacking the program itself. <p><img src="http://www.swhweb.com/MenaanSig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufarly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Farly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/17/02 6:04:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *NEWS FLASH*:  SONY HAS SHUT ME DOWN.</span><hr size=1> 1st, Grazel...I do not look at it as crushing a small business owner. It is unfortunate, but his restuarant name could easily be misconstrued as being part of the Sony Machine. Should he start selling &quot;aborted fetus burgers&quot; - it would end up on Sony's doorstep. Fair? no..but the way business works.<br>
The &quot;legal reason&quot; given for shutting them down and the actual reason are rarely the same...<br>
<br>
As for this whole EQ Watcher / Eq Announce thing:<br>
EQ Watcher seems to have done his legal homework and, having read and approved many contracts in my time, I agree with his views.<br>
Glimwin, I have to add that you are not helping yuor credibility here withyoru posts. I make no claims to know anything about you beyond the name you use to post - but you come across like a child shouting &quot;not fair!&quot; with this whole thing.<br>
<br>
Let it die, people can choose to use the software or not - it is not your job to get on the soapbox and spout fire and brimstone warnings.  It is the individuals responsibility to read teh EULA and decide for him or her self if what they are doing is in violation. Should Sony decide it is a violation - I am sure they will make it very clear that parsers of any kind are not allowed.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, let's be honest - in a game of &quot;my stick is bigger then yours&quot; - which is what EQ is for far too many people, taking away their ruler does not make a whole lot of sense. Especially not in the more competative MMORPG world of today. Parsers are a huge part of the game at this point, people want to see how much damage they did to Uber_Mob_01 or how much better a jade mace is then rusty mace. It is an integral part of a large percentage of the base' enjoyment of the game - and it does no harm to the game or it's &quot;balance&quot; at all.<br>
<br>
Parsers give no &quot;unfair&quot; advantage, they do not modify the game in any way and they do not impact the servers...end of story...<br>

I have read the EULA much more than you have :)  The words you bolded specifically say &quot;The Software&quot;.  A configuration file is not software.  You write software, you'd think you'd have a better understanding of what software is.  If .OPT files were software, then you'd probably be paying Microsoft monthly payments on half of your hard drive.  There is a VERY GOOD definition of &quot;Software&quot; at www.dictionary.com, the third one down (which is taken from The Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing).  Editing the .OPT file is the same as editing the EQCLIENT.INI file (with the obvious exception that one is in text format), and they TELL you to use third party software to edit that (such as notepad, dos EDIT, etc).<br>
<br>
(By the way, using 700 quotes in a thread is annoying as hell, if someone wants to read it they can scroll up 2 inches. ouch)<br>
<br>
Banner traffic makes me zero money, as it says quite plainly in my documentation.  I do not make one single penny from distribution of EQWatcher.  The banner ads come from using free sites as hosts, and they make their money off of the banners.<br>
<br>
I make no decision for my users about whether they use this software or not.  I make it clear what the EULA states.  They are free to have their own opinion, however wrong it may be.  I cannot stand people who are wrong and claim to be the authority on the subject and/or try to lead movements.  You can call it downplaying all you want, but there's no reason for them to sit around and argue about the EULA when they hit I AGREE to it every time they play and some random Joe comes around and says hey, I feel you are violating the EULA because you stepped on my shoe.  Is stepping on your shoe in the EULA?  NO.  Can they ban you for it?  Use of third party software that does not modify the software is also not in the EULA.  Can they ban you for it?  Why sit around and contemplate this, when they obviously have no intention of doing so.<br>
<br>
The intent of Sony management must fall within their limitations.  They limited themselves as well as the EQ community within their written agreement that you click I AGREE to every time you play.  End of that story.<br>
<br>
There is no reason to force anyone to back down, because there's nobody up on anything other than you I suppose.  If you hadn't made a big deal of yourself in the first place you probably would never have heard from them.<br>
<br>
And about scanning for running software.  It is generally accepted right now that #1 if this type of scan is done no information can be sent back to the company, and #2 you will be told that this scan is taking place.  As I mentioned before, any long time EQ player should remember the time they made a huge announcement about wanting to scan for running software to make sure people werent using macro programs and other methods of &quot;cheating&quot;.  They removed it after what, 1 or 2 days?  If they wanted to detect notes file parsers, they would simply send information to the server when you write a note.  Could this be in place now?  Sure.  Could they already know thousands of people who are using EQWatcher?  Sure.  Has anyone been banned?  Nope.<br>
<br>
I don't really want to argue this topic much longer so if you reply to this trying to refute something I said with little or no evidence please make it short :)<br>

At least one of you was willing to use full disclosure while the other hides behind anonymity in an attempt to protect his own EQ accounts that, according to him, will never be in jeapordy by use of this software. /snicker<br>
