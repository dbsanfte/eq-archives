<br>
It was to be an easy raid, a late night attack onto the city of Freeport. Kill a few &quot;Humunz&quot;, loot their homes, and then head back home. It had been going well for a while, for many human corpses lay littered around the mighty Ogres; until HE showed up, that is.<br>
<br>
A dark man, dressed in a glossy, midnight-black armor, wielding a great two-handed sword of Puresilver (Mithril), and nothing of his face showing under his helm, except two firey points of light...<br>
<br>
He descended upon the stunned Raiders like a storm in the night, slaying all who stood before him with one single massive strike from his great weapon. A pair of mighty Ogres tried to raise a simple defense against him, attacking from the front and the back, but He was too smart for that. Before they knew what was happening, the Ogre flanking the Man lay gasping for air as the Unholy spell sucked it from his lungs, and the Ogre in front lay dead, his head a scant few inches away. The Man's helm swung from side to side, staring at the piles of corpses for any sign of life, for more victims, for anything, but he found none. Slowly, the sound of dry laughter rattled across the desert lands before Freeport, originating from the shadows of His helm. It was heard in the very city itself, causing nightmares for the sleepers, and shivers for the awake.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the laughter was cut off, as the Sword was swiftly drawn, and He spun around. Standing before him was a figure almost as frightening as himself, with his own, bartone, laughter escaping from his horrid face.<br>
<br>
Before the man stood the leader of the Ogres.<br>
<br>
Dressed in armor much like the Man's, the Ogre's was a deep crimson, the color of fresh blood. Held in one of his hands was a sword mimicing the mans, exactly, but the Ogre swung it with greater ease than the man ever could, even one handed. The laughter slowed, and finally stopped, as the Ogre appraised his new opponent. Both combatants stood and stared at the other, mirror images of Fear and Death in the night. Suddenly, the Ogre noticed the corpses of his companions, and roared in bestial rage.<br>
<br>
Immidiately, the Man dropped to one knee, and brought his blade to bear, like a pike, as the gigantic creature charged forward, powered with his rage, and his own combination of blessings from his great God, Cazic-Thule. Blade of Fear met Blade of Death then, and black and green sparks flew as the two evil forces battled into the night. Blow after blow was met with corrupted Truesilver blade, spells of Fear and spells of Death flew through the night as each of the Dark warriors called upon their gods to help them in their time of need. Those who saw the battle might even swear that the gods themselves were battling, high in the Planes of Power, and that these two were only mirrors of the greater battle.<br>
<br>
Eventually, even the great Ogre tired, and the swings came slower and slower, and the time to call upon their dieties became longer, and longer, as the two slowly began to realize they had met their equal. Staring at each other, they pondered what to do. Swiftly, the Man swung his blade again, aiming for the Ogre's neck.<br>
<br>
And it hit.<br>
<br>
Enraged again, the Ogre stared down at the new dent in his Crimson plate, and roared in the Man's face. Pulling together a trick he used back home in the Feerott, he used his body wieght, and slammed the smaller Human onto the ground. Roaring in triumph, the great Ogre lifted his blade to finish the fight, and the Man's eyes glittered with hatred over his defeater.<br>
<br>
Then the Ogre stopped, and cocked his head to the side. Listening for a moment, he gave the prone Human one last kick in the sides (Knocking his wind out), and sheathed his blade. Growling quietly, he wandered off into the night.<br>
<br>
Before he could even stand up again, the man knew why the Ogre had so suddenly left his victim behind, as a troup of the imfamous Freeport Militia came storming out of the gates, heading right for the Shadowknight of Death. Cursing under his breath, the man quickly muttered the appropriate incantation, and smiled grimly as he dissapeared into the night.<br>
<br>
This was not over....<br>

<br>
Slowly, the large Ogre drew his giant sword from its scabbard across his back.  Holding it up to shine in the orange torchlight, he checked it’s Mithril blade for any dings or chinks, any flaws on its flawless surface, although he knew there would be none.  He had done this countless times before, after countless battles.  The sword never required any maintenance, never needed to be sharpened, only polished for the ultimate effect of its shine.  Slowly, he drew the great blade across the underside of his arm, drawing a bright red strip of blood in its path.  Satisfied, he resheathed the blade, and looked up to where his men watched him.<br>
<br>
Gigantic Ogres, all of them, they were still a head shorter than their terrifying leader, and all cowered under his gaze.  And gaze he did, taking his own sweet time on each of their faces, waiting for them to look away first.  They all feared him, every last one.  Everyone feared the giant Ogre, except one.  Except….Him.<br>
<br>
Upon the thought of the one man who was not afraid of him, the Ogre let a slow growl escape his throat.  At this deep sound, the other ogres jumped as one.  Except for one, one who wasn’t paying attention, and when he heard the growl drew his blade two inches out of its scabbard, before he realized his mistake.<br>
<br>
But it was too late.<br>
<br>
The Ogre dropped like a stone, clawing at his throat, trying to open up his air tubes as they magically contracted.  It was a slow, and particularly painful way to die, taking almost 10 minutes before the Ogre’s great lungs were fully depleted, before his brain reconized that he was dead.  Kicking his legs, he made a pitiful whining noise at the large Ogre, his eyes pleading for release.  Growling again, the Ogre released him, with his sword.<br>
<br>
Wiping his blade clean, the Ogre dismissed the others, allowing them to return to their stone shanties and shacks.<br>
<br>
<HR><br>
<br>
Silently the man slinked away, his mission accomplished.  He had located the party of Ogres for the man, found their hidden homes, deep into the jungles of the Feerott.  He had also done more than that, he had actually gotten close enough to witness a meeting of war between the Ogre captains, knew where they planned to attack next.  Smiling, the little thief thought of the reward he knew would be forthcoming from his Master back home in Freeport.  The Master always paid well.<br>
<br>
And then the fear hit.  His mind clouded with fear, his eyes darted back and forth, trying to find the source of this sudden horror.  Terrified, he darted off into the woods, running through bushes and around trees, darting under fallen trees, and leaping the wildlife.  Somehow, he knew that wouldn’t help.  And when he looked up, he knew he was right.<br>
<br>
Standing before him, dressed in the blood red armor of his station, stood the Lead Ogre.  Grinning wickedly, he drew his giant Two-Handed sword from his back.  Suddenly, his arm shot out, and before the man knew it, he was lying on his back in the leaves.  He knew this was it, the sudden weight of his impending doom landed on his shoulders...<br>
<br>
The sound of his scream echoed across the small valley that made up the jungle of the Feerott.  Small birds flew up from the trees, and spider monkeys screamed in the trees.  The lizardmen looked up from their work in the ancient temple to their god, Cazic-Thule, the same god whom the Ogre worked for—the God of Fear...<br>

<br>
He hadn't heard from Jeryl since he sent him down to the Feerott jungle, and that made him nervous.  Sending the son of his sister was the last thing he wanted to do, but the man had to admit, he was good at his job.  The problem is, what will he tell his sister if he doesn't return...<br>
<br>
Shoving such unpleasant thoughts out of his head, he concentrated on the matters at hand again.  Glaring at his visitor, sizing him up, the Man was silently surprised.  The young Shadowknight seemed to be perfect material for an apprentice: He was strong, smart, and fast.  His was as quick on his feet as he was swift in the head.  The only thing that remained was to drain him of some of his pride.<br>
<br>
Almost too fast for the naked eye, He drew his great Mithril blade, and swung it in an arc at the young man, aiming for his neck.  Seeing the blade coming, the young human easily swiped it aside with his odd two-pronged spear, tipping his head slightly to the side to avoid scratching his cheeck.  But he failed to notice the boot approaching faster than the sword.<br>
<br>
<i>THUD!</i><br>
<br>
The man dropped like a rock, gripping the spot where his legs met his torso, face turning a purplish color, almost matching his magical armor.  His Spine Piercer clattered to the ground, and he made a high-pitched squeak, before losing consciousness.<br>
<br>
There, that was taken care of.<br>
