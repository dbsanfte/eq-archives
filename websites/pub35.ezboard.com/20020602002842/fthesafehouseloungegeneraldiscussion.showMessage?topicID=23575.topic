And I respect that and I respect them. I left, and then decided to start a new, smaller company, and have been staffing it up with people who want to make a new game, and people who share certain game philosophies with me, who have the same goals and vision. EQ's still a fantastic game, I'm still very fond of it, and while I don't necessarily agree with all of the decisions being made, the game still has a very, very special place in my heart. And I'm not going to make a habit of armchair quarterbacking, nor second guessing people.<br><br>Also, again, these are my opinions. This is me looking in from the outside now, and while I certainly still have friends there, my views aren't a result of any special insight or insider information. Rather, this is just my perspective as both an EQ player and one the old-school architects behind the original vision and design of the game (which, arguably, had at least something to do with the product's success <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br><br>So, let's see, some of the more recent changes made that you mentioned above:<br><br>1. Soulbinders. No, these came after I left, and no I don't care for them. To me, interdependece is very important for community building, and creating an environment where people had to go out of their way to talk to people, get to know them, and ask for things (binds, CRs, rezes, etc.) is important. The seeds of friendships often form around these interdependencies... people remember the kindly mage who bound them, or the cleric who rezed them. Maybe they pay back that kind deed in the future, and help that person with a CR. Maybe they become casual friends... maybe they end up in a guild together. Sure, looking for a bind can be frustrating, but I never truly found it that difficult, and it's always been and will continue to be my opinion that the positives as they relate to community building outweigh the negatives associated with the occasional frustration of finding someone to bind you at the early levels.<br><br>2. Hell level removal. Hell yeah! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I emailed Scott Hartsman a big congrats when they found a solution to this. Pretty much everyone had wanted these gone for a long time, but a clean way to do it, combined with the time to both implement the fix and test it thoroughly (something you DON'T want to do is screw up a bunch of character's experience points) just never surfaced while I was there. A lot of running an MMOG is about managing the resources you have and prioritizing them. You have all sorts of pressures to get new content in, to balance the game, to work on the next big expansion... And because of that certain items on the task lists would often perpetually slip, replaced by items deemed more important or urgent or easier to implement (more bang for the buck) or less risky. From my perspective from the outside, it looks like, probably because of the continued unprecedented success of the game and the window of opportunity they had in-between finishing Luclin and starting PoP, they finally had the time and opportunity to really look into hell levels and fix them the right way. I applaud their efforts in a BIG way. In fact, the change went in right as I was hitting level 40 on FV, so I was selfishly very pleased as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>3. More hybrid/class options. Hrm. Mixed feelings on this, and this was an old topic... people have always debated adding new class options to different races (heh, I remember a big push by a group of players to put in gnome monks in beta), and sometimes we did (for example, Erudite Necros with the addition of Paineel). I guess my feelings boil down to this: I'm for more options when they make sense, and when they don't dilute the value of races being purposely different. Adding Erudite Heretics made sense when we added Paineel as a new, free zone. Adding some of these new race/class combinations recently made less sense to me and seemed a little arbitrary. But that doesn't mean I think it was a huge deal -- certainly nothing 'threatening' the long term health of the game by any means. I just would have prefered a big story or a new zone or city or something that went along with the special introduction of a new race/class combination -- an in-game RP reason, if you will -- that's all.<br><br>4. The Book/medding issue. Ah, this is a really old issue and a really old debate. The original intent was influenced by D&amp;D and some earlier MUDs; that being, that it made sense that a caster had to focus very intently when memorizing spells and/or regaining mana. In fact, very early in beta, you couldn't even talk when medding. What this quickly turned into was one of those 'realism vs. fun' issues, and typically fun should win when it comes to games. So, in 20/20 hindsight the book was a bad idea, but by the time we really realized this, it was part of the game, so we changed it later to disappear at 35. The idea there being that while it was a pain, it was also an incentive to level -- a reward for getting to 35, and rewards are good(TM). But we still weren't satisfied with that, and neither were the players. So we came up with a plan with two goals: 1. eliminate or at least significantly reduce the hassle of the spellbook but 2. keep the carrot out there -- continue to reward the caster for leveling. What we came up with was going to be part of the new interface that was to be incrementally patched into the game, and that was to have the book start out opaque at low levels, and then slowly but surely become more translucent as you leveled up. The idea was to have it fairly quickly cease to be in the way, but also be something that simlultaneously visually communicated continual advancement to the player. Unfortunately, we didn't have the time to get this in as I was leaving, and while Jeff was going to try later, finishing Luclin just became a huge priority. I would have liked to have seen it implemented right after Luclin, but my understanding is some other issues came up, and the decision was made to just turn it off. I guess that's fine too, but it eliminated the reward and positive feedback portion of the plan (though it certainly removed the hassle). So, a good thing overall, but I'd rather have seen a more robust implementation/fix.<br><br>5. No CR's at lower levels. This was something that specifically came up after my departure, but is part of a larger goal that had existed for quite some time, that being to work on making the first 10 levels or so of the game more user friendly... to reduce as many barriers to entry as possible. We knew that over time, even though the MMOG gamespace was (and is) growing quickly, that more and more new players were less 'core' gamers and more 'casual' gamers. Therefore, a variety of ideas were continually tossed around as to how we might do this. Like I said, though, the removal of CRs idea came up after I left (and after Jeff left as well, I believe). Here's my take on it: an admirable goal, but a flawed execution. Yes, CRs at low levels, for a new player, can be very daunting and have probably turned quite a few newbies off, perhaps even causing them to quit the game. When you don't know the surroundings, and you die in the middle of Qeynos Hills, it can really be a pain trying to get back to your corpse. And the premise behind CRs was never really about having to FIND your corpse, but rather, having to fight back to your corpse, thereby creating a dynamic aspect to the death penalty. In other words, dying in the depths of a dungeon ought to be scarier and more painful than dying just outside a city on the top of a hill. The experience and treasure should be better in the dungeon, and therefore so should the CR be more difficult (risk vs. reward 101).<br><br>The problem, however, with removing CRs at lower levels is that CRs are an integral and fundamental part of the game. In my opinion, flat out removing them at lower levels is really doing the newbie a disservice. He or she begins playing the game, dies, doesn't have to CR, loses no experience, etc., all the way up until level 11, and then bammo! 'what the heck happened there?!?' Where is my body? What's up with this experience loss? I'm not prepared for this at all, and now at level 11, well, losing my stuff and this experience loss rather hurts!' (Whereas, I'd argue, losing your corpse at 4 or 5 isn't nearly as painful).<br><br>So the solution I advocated was to keep the CRs around, but to lead the newbie back to his corpse. In other words, introduce him to a fundamental game mechanic, but also realize that he or she doesn't know the lay of the land, especially in some of these larger outdoor areas, and often has NO clue where he or she died. So, in summary, I wanted to see the same code used in Tracking used to lead the new player back to his corpse. If you were not in the zone your corpse was in, it would tell you what zone your corpse was in. And then when you entered the zone your corpse was in, it would lead you to it using the same messages Tracking uses (e.g. 'your corpse is ahead and to the right'). To me, this would have eased the frustration associated with lower level CRs, removed some barriers to entry, but still prepared the newbie for a fundamental component of EverQuest's death penalty. Unfortunately, however, I guess it was a lot easier to just 'turn CRs off'.<br><br>6. Raising the price/Premium Servers. Well, this one's really controversial, and I'm just going to speak generically about the issue as a whole and as it relates to the MMOG genre: players want more and more with every generation of these games, and the developers want to deliver. We all love these games, and realize their short and long term potential. We want more detailed worlds, more dynamic worlds, more interactivity, more in-game events, better customer service, etc. Once upon a time, a long time ago,<br>EA/Origin decided to charge 10 bucks for UO. This sort of set a standard, and it was sort of an arbitrary decision too. I guess my opinion is this: if we (developers and players) want more, we're probably going to have to pay more. These games simply cost a LOT of money to make and maintain, and will probably get more and more expensive over the next ten years or so until they even rival movie budgets. To me, that's extremely exciting and why I'm dedicated to this genre for the long haul. But, consequently, I see the $10/month standard going the way of the dodo.<br><br>Anyway, I really don't want to sound too negative. A lot of great changes have been made to the game as of late, and a lot of great changes and additions to EverQuest have been made throughout all of its history. The game has gotten better and better, and will probably continue to get better. That's what's wonderful about MMOGs -- you can patch! These games evolve and players' ideas and developers new revelations can be added in after launch, and while mistakes are made, and sometimes developers over react, overall, when looking at things from the 20,000 ft. view, I think the various MMOGs have by and large improved over time.<br><br>I'm also very excited about Planes of Power, much of which was planned while I was there, and IMHO if they adhere to what was planned back then, then wow, this is going to be a great expansion. For me however, as I've posted in the past, it's time to move on, skip a generation, and head right into the third generation of MMOGs. It's far, far too early to talk about our plans, but I can say that the team that's being assembled and the designs being discussed... well, this genre hasn't even scratched the surface yet in terms of what's in our future <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>- Brad McQuaid<br>President &amp; CEO<br>Sigil Games Online, Inc.<br>www.sigilgames.com<br><br>(disclaimer: I no longer work for VI/SOE and my opinions are just mine) <br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=155036"><center><img src="http://gforti.homestead.com/files/joofhead.gif" border=0><br><img src="http://gforti.homestead.com/files/rarrow.gif" align="center" border="0"> Joof Soulstinger <img src="http://gforti.homestead.com/files/larrow.gif" align = "center" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufricka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fricka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/2/02 6:17:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23575.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/sig/5fricka60x56.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Brad Speaks about EQ</span><hr size=1> Interesting read.<br><br>For those interested in who else has Brad at Sigil this is in the News Bulletin:<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2865.topic">pub35.ezboard.com/fthesaf...2865.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p><img src="http://www.thesafehouse.org/%7Efricka/sig/DAOCsig.jpg"><br><b>~Fricka</b><i>Fricka curtsies elegantly...while picking yer pocket.</i><a href="http://www.theshanks.org">Shanks</a>,<a href="http://www.offlinetshirts.com">Off-Line</a>,<a  href="http://www.geocities.com/fricka_on_vallon_zek">Sig Gallery</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usquinkmcpoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Squink McPoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/2/02 6:46:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23575.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Brad Speaks about EQ</span><hr size=1> I must disagree with him on the newbie CR thing (regarding the tracking he was trying to put in).<br><br>Because, I remember when I was new to the game.

I think Brad made a huge mistake but I'm sorry to say I think Brad leaving made a lot of changes possible.  Also notice that after he left Customer Service got better, GMs became better.  Example of GMs being better, boats were down and I was on my warrior.  Instead of the GM telling me to deal with it they offered*I refused* to summon me In 2 years of playing no kindness of that level was ever shown to me on any petition I ever sent in.  A friend's items were stolen because someone he trusted took his stuff.  GM gave him a lecture and helped him get his stuff back.  3 people I have known had this happen preBrad Departure...Nothing was done for them.  Another example, I got dropped into some box in GD, now about a year ago I ended up under the world because zone crashed during port in.  Prebrad took me 7 hours to get out, postbrad 10 minutes.  Now notice that brad took someone who was the #1CS guy with him.  Now CS is better.  Gee I wonder if these are related in anyway?  Not bashing Brad really just saying things were very stagnant before he left.  Now things are really getting better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/3/02 10:03:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23575.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Brad Speaks about EQ</span><hr size=1> Brad knows something.

You should come away from the experince of a good role-playing game with a smile on your face generally.  But the game itself should be, above all, involved, engrossing, complex, full of LIFE.  <br><br>Deaths in EQ these days are not very frequent, and don't suck too bad when they happen.  Who among you has a character that has died in the last month, and you basically just said, oh well res inc, what's in the fridge?   Fun, eh?  Well better than when you died and you were bound on another continent and your friends were by your corpse, and there was a cleric two zones away you had to BEG to res you, cause you didn't have any plat, or your plat was so precious to you you couldn't bear to part with it, so you would rather BEG this dwarf to run over and please please res me, yada yada yada.

The simple solution to the problem has always been there... and when he was around, he never made sure it got implemented.  Shaman alchemy could easily have made bind self potions that only work in places you can bind others.  It would have solved the problem and kept player interaction higher.  The potion should have been a low level one, of course, keeping it's price down.  Player interaction would have been there.  Melees would have had an easier time binding in funky locations.<br><br>Never happened though, even though players suggested it often during Brad's reign. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=23575.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=23575.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23575.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=23575.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=23575.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23575.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23575.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
