I am a relatively new Iksar monk. I just got to the moon and I must say that the exp up there is beyond belief! I have done the &quot;newby area - oasis - LoIO - OT - DL - KC - 50!&quot; progression and I am looking for something different in Luclin.<br>
<br>
Okay so far I have done the following.<br>
levels 1 to 18 - Field of Bones (much better than &quot;goody&quot; newby areas)<br>
levels 19 to 25 - Paludal Caverns - AWESOME EXP!<br>
<br>
Paludal bandits and Patorg fiends (stupid disease - hate them) are almost all light blue to me now at level 25. Combat skills raise very slowly on light blues if at all. So its time to move on. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1) What are the next recommended zones for progression?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Netherbrain Lair? Crystal Caverns? (Velious I know).<br>
Grouped or Solo, I don't really care. I am biased towards soloing since I play off-peak times. I believe I have average-okay equipment for a level 25 (Wu's, Crystal Covered shroud, fighting baton, CoT), so I wont avoid fighting tough mobs if the exp is good.<br>
<br>

If possible, try to camp Fungoids.  They drop reasonable cash (up to 4pp or so) and some drop Spore Covered Armour, which you may find useful.  Mature Fungoids also drop a Khatar, which may be an upgrade to your Ulaks.<br>
<br>
From there you could move to Marus Seru.  Get a friend and pull to your heart's content.  You can easily make 35 here but if you're soloing and not in too much of a rush, there's still exp to be had at 38.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I can't help on the ranged weapons question.  I normally just run up and hit things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for other H2H weapons, by your 30's your fists are getting to be quite good, so I personally wouldn't worry too much about it (although I'm sure somebody else here knows something I don't)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

<br>
Trogs drop the most plat, on average, that I and my many alts have seen. But Nethers and Fungoids both drop some nice plats as well. So mix it up and wander around in those caves. I know them blindfolded by now.<br>
<br>
After you get tired of Netherbian, go to Marus Seru. A monk's SOLO haven! XP drops from the sky. Adds can sometimes cause problems for other classes, but not monks.<br>
<br>
That'll get you into your low 30s. <br>
<br>
Then for an extra challenge, Tribals in Dawnshroud (where those Polished Steel Ulaks drop, actually). Can get you all the way up to and even past level 35 if you're patient enough. Just in time to start exploring Veilous and Kunark zones. <br>
<br>
After DSP dries up, you CAN try Sonic Wolves in Tenebrous, probably with a group. But XP on the moon gets tougher to grind in your 40s as it's hard to find a pickup group there since a lot of people either don't LIKE the moon, are too lazy to TRY the moon or have lag issues, and thus Luclin is grossly unpopulated ... AND the mobs on the average have a rep for UNDERCONNING, and have a TON of hps and hit DAMN hard ... why I remember this one owlbear fleshrender that lived up to its name, and really ticked me off because he conned blue ... anyways, it gets to a point that you'll see some amazing camps and spots on the moon and just not have the people around needed to kill that stuff. It gets annoying. Grimling Forest pops to mind.<br>
<br>
Weapons-wise, I've seen MANY a monk in their 30s and 40s use Goranga Spiked Club MAIN, open FIST in OFFHAND to keep h2h trained up. (Eventually the PSU just won't put out enough damage and your fist will have a rather ok ratio so don't diss the fist). So, that's an option if you don't wanna go KD. But there's a problem with the KD for h2h: I was using one up until right before the most recent patch, and it was a 1 hand BLUNT weapon. Maybe this changed with the last patch? Dunno.<br>
<br>
For throwing items, a vendor in Shar Vahl sells throwing knives. It's on one of the maps I have printed out somewhere, so try eqatlas.com.<br>

<br>
First is adds.The netherbians, trogs, and feinds love to roam. Best advice is to pull into the corridors. Less likely to get ads, but since its an undercamped area, you will get roamers who add.<br>
<br>
2nd. They dont hit extremly hard, but have a lot of hp. There are times you'll feel like you are chopping down a redwood tree with a butterknife. Figure as a solo about 1 maybe 2 mobs when you have a full health bar. and using mend once before you need to sit (or feign) to raise your health.<br>
<br>
You are going to be spoiled from the xp you got in PC. Its only half as good in NB.

Anyhow I did marus seru from 28 to 36 solo and it was heaven.  Being human sanctus (for the most part) liked me and I got my bandages on whenever needed. Do hoppers until they're light blue, then stones avoiding beetles until lvl 35 as they are undercons by a good bit.  If you pick up a greeny zelniak or crawler run it to the guards, it's far easier, they seem to remember you for ages and have a re-aggro radius of a few miles.  The guards only kill zels and crawlers so drag your exp mob there and you dont have to worry about KS.<br>
<br>
At 36 I went to CC and I dont regret it one bit.  Tons of money, great exp, and it's fun to run through the tunnels and jump down the main hole.  Around 40 get a partner that can heal and clean the geonids for a while, great gem VT for 20-190pp each on the named.  I stayed there until around mid fourties, the later levels requiring terrors and geos to still be getting exp (the orcs went green). <p><BR>

One odd thing about this zone (Marus Seru) is the odd spawning. It seemed like it was either all hoppers, stones, or zelniks. Like only 1 at a time could be up.

I did lv 29 in 2 hrs 15 minutes solo and 30 (when it was still a hell level) in about 4.  One thing to note is around lvl 30 and up, most zelniaks start to green out.  In this zone the guards will eat zelniaks and lightcrawlers up! bring em back to the guards if you're pulling stone bringers  and let the guards take care of the trash.<br>

There are plenty of stonegrabbers wandering by so you won't spend much time pulling (although you will have to feign off the occasional stonegrabber add... switching to third person view helps so that you can move if another stonegrabber is approaching).<br>

<br>
Get a Ranger with Panic Animal and Snare then send him out to pull.  Wolves won't aggro on him and he can track (Large Zelniaks give good exp even at 45).  Now, get him to pull back to you Snare the mob then Panic it.  <br>

Only way to make money is on recusos. they drop a plat plus each. But all the weapons are lore no drop/no rent/no sell/no nothing. And starting at full health you can solo 3 blues using mend once.
