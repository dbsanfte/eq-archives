When you're in RvR, a good bit of your time is spent running around with your group, so what with Crit lines being so End-intensive, this means that by the time you get to your next encounter you'll be full (and avoid the dreaded sitting-down in the frontiers).  I'm not certain, but it also _seems_ to increase the End regen when sitting.  When I'm in a group and everyone says OOE after a fight, after resting I'm always the first one standing with full End...<br><br>Regeneration:  Well SBs aren't supposed to be hit, but in the case that you are soloing, this will GREATLY reduce your downtime.<br><br>Long Wind:  This allows you to run just that little bit longer so that if a person is right behind you, you'll get a bit farther so that when you stealth they are not right ontop of you.  This also helps you catch up to your group if you drop out of run-speed aura range (coupled with Tireless means that you'll recover End after a little running around).<br><br>Without doubt, See Hidden, Dodger, Purge, and IP are highly desirable RAs, but some of them are pretty cost prohibitive to all but the extremely successful toon.<br><br>Like for IP you need to save up ALL your points till RR 3L3... jebus that would gimp you for so long.<br><br>So take the quick wins to enable you to get RPs, then when you've got enough do your /respec RA and buy the cadilac (IP).<br><br>I agree that See Hidden is due for review... bigtime, I haven't taken it.<br><br><br><br> <p>Cheers,<BR><BR>Steppin Razor, BORS/Mid [Lvl 44 5-spec SB (mostly good at all, master of none)]<BR>{Appeal to all Infs out there to drop their Buffbot handjobs... you don't need it, not by a mile}<BR>http://www.geocities.com/nage42/Steppin_Razor.html</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/02 11:10:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3761.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> First Aid 1 is a 30% heal for 3 RA points. First Aid 2 is a 60% heal for 6 RA points. And then Ignore pain is a complete heal for 14 RA points.<br><br>Being able to regen means nothing if you do not survive.<br><br>Tireless 1 is next to worthless unless you have some special reason you want to regen endurance while moving.<br><br>Regeneration 1 is actually noticable, but only when sitting down.<br><br>Long wind is a very handy ability. There's a study on critshot.com about what each level of long wind can do. At long wind 5, you don't lose endurance while sprinting. :) (not that anyone would actually want to train it that high)<br><br>To not have First Aid and Ignore Pain on a PvP server would gimp you more than waiting to get them. Thus both abilities are overpowered--you will never defeat an opponent with Ignore Pain if you don't also have it. You cannot say the same about regeneration, long wind, or tireless.<br><br>EDIT: Dunno why I got it in my head that this was for a PvP server character... Yeah, get stuff to help you in PvE such as regen and stat boosts. I still don't recommend tireless. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A> at: 7/17/02 9:34:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzaboja.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaboja</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/17/02 9:31:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3761.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> <br><br>I should have mentioned that I got tireless 1 and long wind 1 with my first two points.

That is usually good for an extra 100+ damage every time.  I also crit on my Perf about 25% of the time.  Not anything you can rely on, but the damage is great when it happens.<br><br>It could be that with only mop 1 you get low scores on crits, I ent straight to MoP2 then later bumped it to MoP 3 because I was so happy with the results I got from MoP2.  I have even considered taking it to level 4, but it is getting very costly and I would have to sacrifice too much in other areas to do that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzanthiathenightshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ZanthiatheNightshade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/18/02 2:14:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3761.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> Tireless is extremely useful in PVE solo. You can launch your most devistating crits over and over, and the rate at which you regen end is GREATLY increased, so even less downtime. However, if you're a rogue class trying to gain levels soloing, mental instability from endless killing  lame mobs will probably be a bigger problem than downtime. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uentreriii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>entreriii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 9:26:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3761.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realm Abilities</span><hr size=1> I am 42 ns. I have dodger 3.<br>It is so good I don't even have any piercing styles( garrotte )<br>on my hot keys.  When I solo yellow mobs I evade so much its crazy.  Since it leads to the evade moves hamsting and leaper( I plan on getting the 3rd one at 44 ) its like getting 2 for 1.  What is so nice also about these moves is they cost next to nothing in end to use unlike garrote.  Its not unusuall for me to evade 5 or 6 times in a row against a yellow mob.  I first had master of pain but repect it at level 40 to dodger.  Being a shade I think it is better to have a mob miss you 2 or 3 extra times in a fight then have the small extra damge you do from mop.  Some of my fights against yellow mobs in cm ( solo ) last so long that I am getting off my 4th damage shout spell.  This is starting the fight with a spell pull.  Evade is also based on quickness and when i have a high level buff for quickness ( around 220 quickness ) I can solo orange mobs starting with a spell pull easily. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzarlaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zarlaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 5:39:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3761.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RA</span><hr size=1> I have dodger 3, mastery of pain 3, aug dex/quick 2, aug str 1, aug con 1, see hidden, tireless 2.<br><br>I love dodger and mastery of pain i get huge crits nearly every time.
