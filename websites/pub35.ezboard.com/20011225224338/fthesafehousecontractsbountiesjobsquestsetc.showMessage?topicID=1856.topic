<br>
A story written roughly 3 months ago, on a Message board unaffiliated with Sony or Verant Interactive (VI), was anonymously forwarded to VI.  The VI staff found this not to their liking and banned the player who wrote it.  Admittedly, the post is graphic and controversial.  But it was well written and in character.<br>
<br>
This has caused a huge outrage within the Brell community and at large.  <br>
<br>
Beyond the banning off Mystere, it has raised a whole series of other role playing issues:  <br>
<br>
What are the acceptable guide lines?<br>
How CAN an evil race be played?<br>
Should RP writing, out of game, be a ban-able offence?<br>
Who is next?<br>
<br>
The biggest question on all of our lips is this: How does activity on a non-VI or Sony Message board warrant banning?<br>
<br>
Abashi has responded thusly:<br>
<br>
Like all other account issues, this is a matter between us and the owner of the<br>
account. It's not something that we're going to discuss or justify publicly. <br>
<br>
We make determinations based on information at hand regarding who is or is not having a positive affect on EverQuest's community. If we determine that one person's actions make EverQuest a game that other people do not want to play based upon those actions, we will exercise our right to refuse service to the extent necessary to provide a reasonable and enjoyable gaming environment.<br>
<br>
This is the extent to which we'll address this specific issue. If people have general questions not related to the specific issues in this case, I'll be happy to field them tomorrow. This issue is however closed.<br>

If we're all supposed to play &quot;Sweetness 'n Light&quot; characters then why are the following items in EQ:<br>
<br>
1) Tortured Dwarves hanging from chains and hooks<br>
2) DE rogue quest to kill and behead a pregnant woman given by the FATHER of the child<br>
3) Vivisection tables in Neriak necro guild<br>
4) Troll vendor that sells HEHE meat<br>
5) Legends that tell how Innoruuk captured and tortured High Elven royalty for 300 years to form the Teir'Dal<br>
<br>
This list could go on for days, but these are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. <br>

(meant as a reply to another thread)<br>
<br>
I don't read those unmoderated boards much, because the posts can get very offensive at times, far more offensive than the post that triggered all this.<br>
I read the post. It was deliberately shocking, and offensive, not my cup of tea, but not without artistic merit. I was truly repelled, as the author intended, and impressed by the the way he used reader emotion to develop a palpable presence for his characters. <br>
<br>
I play in a strict one-race guild on the racewar servers and I roleplay my barbarian as half racial supremacist and half crooked cop. A good deal of my fun comes from satirizing these two stereotypes, since in real life my convictions a are in diametrical opposition to these stereotypes. There will always be fools who don't understand the difference between fantasy and reality, but a company whose flagship product is a role-playing game should have a clue.<br>
<br>
I've been roleplaying in Tolkien-esque realms for <br>
decades now, and its a life-long hobby for me. <br>
In everquest, the roleplayer is practically persecuted for trying to infuse some flavor into their gameplay. To have Verant weigh in on the side of anti-roleplay, in such an arbitrary and dismissive fashion, is more than I can stomach. <br>
<br>
I think Sgean summed up the impression I'm getting well with the following quote:<br>
<br>
"All that being said, I do not believe that Sony, or any other cooperation will ever give a damn about roleplaying. A company is a machine that makes money. The tool is EQ, and it makes far more money when operating as an obscenely addictive Pacman video game, rather than a roleplay game. Roleplay gaming is just a small slice, in the online gaming pie."<br>

<br>
First the disclaimers:  I have not read the story(ies) that lead up to this.  From what I hear they are not in a style that would be my taste, but I thought it was important to point out I hadn't read them.  Please remember that as you read.<br>
<br>
Sony and Verant OWN the EQ world.  They can ban anyone, at any time, for any reason.  Period.  Several legal precedences exist for this, most recently the Boy Scouts banning of gay scout masters comes to mind.  Private organizations do not have to allow anyone to participate, and are NOT RESTRICTED by anti-discrimination laws.  Sony/Verant is a publicly traded company, it doesn't make it a public company.  Only the stock holders can really force them to take other actions.<br>
<br>
So the banning is well within the rights of Sony/Verant to do.  Whine all you like, they can and will do that.<br>
<br>
Freedom of speech is not threatened here, they didn't try to stop the post from being read, sue EQVault to have it removed, or sue the author for any reason.  They simply banned the person who wrote it from playing the game.  I *presume* they did so because the subject matter made them wonder if the author really thought that way or was just &quot;expressing an alternate view&quot;.  They are a company who exists to make money, and the chance (albeit small) of being legally exposed if this person was to actually pursue these activities in RL (ok, I'm NOT saying this person would do that, but Sony Verant has no proof of that) is too much risk for Sony/Verant to take.  The author has every right to write these stories and post them to places that will have them up.  Sony/Verant isn't even close to challenging that, they are simply removing the person from playing the game to avoid corporate exposure.<br>
<br>
Now if you're going to get worried about the moral or ethical implications of the action, I won't defend Sony/Verant on any count, nor will I cast any stones either.  I can only speak for myself in those areas, and as I've said I hadn't read the stories, so I can make no comment. <p><B>Jordinn Spiritstalker</B><BR>

Contact the administrators and track me down so they can ban me? Or are they just going to ban every Koru character playing EQ? Is it right that they could track me down for something I'd posted like that even though I'd done no wrong? What I'm asking is where does it stop? Obviously both he and I have it clear whom we play and where we play, what if the next &quot;offensive&quot; story is posted by someone annonymous though? Will they track them down or will it be a case of &quot;You can say what you want so long as you say it annonymously?<br>
<br>
This just annoys me, they have pretty graphic scenes in just their own game's background. C'mon, torture someone for 300 years? That's not exactly nice. And where are those ogres supposed to get HEHE meat? From willing donors? Lol, I doubt it somehow. They don't exactly have a rating for the kiddies on their game, yet they ban someone for posting a short story on a non-Sony board. If they want to be bastards then fine, but cut out the damned propaganda and just come out and say &quot;If we don't like what you write, what you say, what color your skin is or anything else about you we'll ban you&quot;. But they won't, it will come down to how they're protecting themselves and blah blah. Yeah, like a short story by a single customer on a small 3rd party message board is going to kill the game. Sure. Wanna buy a bridge cheap too?<br>
<br>
So the story had some unpleasant scenes, maybe even some that make people uncomfortable and wanting to ban the writer. But there's this horrible thing in most western countries called freedom of speech unfortunately that prevents that. Of course all this freedom also means that someone can be say a racist and not allow any blacks into their store, but then they shouldn't be surprised when people treat them like crap for that and neither should Verant be surprised that people have no respect for them or their new policy of &quot;We don't like you or what you write anywhere we can possibly see it = we ban you.&quot; It's their right to be pricks so long as they're not infrindging on my freedom of speech or freedom in general. Just as it's my right to call them @#%$ing stuckup bastards who have their heads up a certain orifice and generally treat them unpleasantly for their views. I'm just wondering what would have happened if he'd posted the stories under an annonymous login name - I dislike the idea that a company would go out of their way to track down writers of short stories that didn't match their views to ban them. Would be kind of like tracking down every closet gay to ban them IMO but thankfully that situation hasn't come up yet... I think. Frankly their actions in this disgust me, and it takes quite a lot to disgust me. <p>Koru <br>======================================

<br>
You make some very innaccurate statements regarding discrimination law, but they are irrelevant to the topic.  The <a href=http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6102849>post</a> <b>has</b> been removed, and freedom of expression is exactly what this is about.  Verant is within its <b>legal</b> rights because they can selectively choose to invoke their copyrights, but this isn't about legality.<br>
<br>
If, as has been made patently clear here, I am being threatened with recourse, for the purpose of limiting the range with which I express myself, then my freedom of expression is being curtailed and I am going to think long and hard about removing that threat.  <br>
<br>
I've read the post, and I've visited another unmoderated forum on the same board.  These boards are full of obscenities, threats, ... you name it.  The salient differences between this post, and the myriad of other offensive posts are:<br>
<br>
1. The intent was artistic, with the intent to entertain rather than to insult or anger people.  <br>
2. It was in roleplay<br>
3. It was coherent and evocative<br>
4. Operating from memory here, since the story was censored, I think that the victim/victor of the story was described as being 14th seasons, as in level.  <br>
<br>
I can see Verant's motivation here, trying to avoid getting lumped in with the child-pornographing terrorist perception of the internet.  But I think that items 2-4 are the reasons this one post was selected.   <p><font size=5 color="gray"><b>Wotan</b><font size=3> Shaman Elder of the <a href="http://galaxy.apropos.org/shanks"><font color="red">Shanks</font></a> <br>

<br>
"Their User agreement is a contract and, as with any contract, there are expectations that are held by all parties concerned. To say that Verant's can ban anyone for any reason, diregards two key issues. The first being the laws dealing with discrimination. Second are the expectations that can be reasonbly assumed from the wording and intent of the contract itself.<br>
<br>
The individual that was banned, could have grounds to persue the issue in a court of law, on the premise that, any reasons that Verant would have in banning an account would involve actions within the game itself or on the official message board.<br>
<br>
It could further be assumed that only in extreme circumstances, where a clear and obvious attempt to adversely affect the level of participation in the game or a malicious attack were made on the company itself, would actions outside of the game and not on the official message baords, be cause for account banning.<br>
<br>
If, these can be held as reasonable expectations on the part of the user, then Verant violated the agreement that it had with this individual." <p>Majestyk, <a href="http://Server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse">Rogue</a>, <a href="http://galaxy.apropos.org/shanks">Shanks</a>, <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5034">Vallon Zek!</a>

&quot;I'm posting this on behalf of our General Counsel: <br>
------ <br>
<br>
I want to thank everyone for their fervent opinions on this matter. <br>
<br>
We aspire neither to be censors nor the guardians of the Internet; we desire to be the developers of a great game which fosters a vibrant and dynamic community. Fortunately, the body of intellectual property law that has developed over the past 225 years -- the laws governing the use of copyrighted material, derivative works, trademarks and trade dress -- gives us the exclusive right to permit or disallow the outside use of our intellectual property so that we can properly manage our business and nurture the EverQuest brand. <br>
<br>
Among other things, the story author used our intellectual property -- without license -- to create what the law calls a &quot;derivative work.&quot; The law gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to create and distribute derivative works, so that the copyright owner can control the manner in which its property is being used. If this story were about Luke Skywalker or Mickey Mouse, you'd certainly expect Lucas or Disney (respectively) to resort to their legal rights to protect their valuable property and good name; this is nothing different. <br>
<br>
This is not about the first amendment -- this is about infringement of our intellectual property rights in a patently offensive manner that tarnishes the Sony, Verant and EverQuest brands. It almost goes without saying that we cannot tolerate our intellectual property being used in a story depicting the violent and explicit rape of a child. <br>

Seems to me that a dark elf torturing/raping is very IC for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> both</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> d&amp;d AND norrath (by their <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> own</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> backstory, talk about being a hypocrite).<br>
<br>
<br>
This story (I read the torture one, the other one had already been taken down...but if the torture one was any indication it was well written, and not anything different than you would find in a good book) was on a 3rd party site. It had absolutely nothing to do with The Station or any <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sony</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> servers.<br>
<br>
They were dark elf roleplay stories, and were very accurate. They the story was of a child, but I think they're just using that as a smokescreen for dirty underwear. The story said &quot;14th season&quot;. If that were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> real</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> years then the child would be 3 years old...<br>
<br>
It is blatantly obvious that the author meant 14th level, seasons is a very common way to say levels IC.<br>

I love mmorpgs, and hopefully will get a job developing them. But I would never work for a company that shows such blatant disregard for customer service. They are now blacklisted in my book. <p>Ditton Rumblebelly<br>

<br>
Though i havn't had the pleasure(displeasure?) of reading either of these stories, i have gathered as much information as i could about them.<br>
<br>
In my own intellect, i believe that Verant/Sony is taking their power a little too far.. .. Seeing that the post was IC (In Character) and that it was posted on a board in no way affiliated with Sony/Verant. All it was was a player RPing the role of his character and friend, going about the sadistic ways that most people talk lore of about Dark Elves. And just because some people found it offensive, they went to the extreme and banned Mystere.. <p>Samea Murasame<br>
