I understand the part about needing to earn the title &quot;Orc Bane&quot;, but still I am a little confused..  To many boots to the head.<br>
<br>
My Goals.<br>
Not be KOS in Freeport<br>
Be able to Train in Freeport<br>
Sell and buy in Freeport<br>
Bank in Freeport<br>
<br>
<br>
My questions.<br>
<br>
1. Can someone point me a to a nice page with this documented with a simple step by step, so we don't have to re-event the wheel here. <br>
<br>
2. How many different KOS factions do I need to worry about?  I read some posts and didn't realize there are guards in North Freeport that are different from the ones at the gate.<br>
<br>
3. Who do you turn the Deathfist belts into?  I was turning my belts into a guy &quot;I forgot his Name&quot; in the warrior guild on the second floor by the arena, or Number 6 on WFP map from EQAtlas.  He was giving me experience, some faction and gold, but is it the faction that I need.<br>
<br>
4.  Never been to Nektulos Forest before, but in one post someone mention that there is a camp with around 13 Orcs in it. Do these orcs drop belts?  Are these the same Orcs as in EC for faction hits? <br>
<br>
5. Will this same method work for a Troll Shadow Knight and an Iksar Necromancer.<br>
<br>
6. How many must DIE!!!!!  I have kill what seems like to me a lot with my Iksar Necro and my friends Troll SK grouped. We got 2 levels by  just killing them and only them.  Still we canâ€™t get into town.<br>
<br>
7.  Add anything thing that you think I missed from this list and would help me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help,<br>

<br>
1 - Try this:<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://perso.respublica.fr/fayguardians/Guides/Factions/Factions.html">perso.respublica.fr/faygu...tions.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Anezka has a summary guide for many cities<br>
<br>
2 - There are 3 key factions to concern yourself with.  The Freeport Militia (the Guards of West Freeport and the Warriors), the Ashen Order (freeport monks) and the knights of truth (North Freeport Guards and Paladin Guild).  You will need to do both sets of guards to have safe access to the monk guild and the bank<br>
<br>
There is also 2 further factions for merchants, but you can buy from them with sneak, or get basic necessities from the merchant in the Monk guild when you have done monk faction.<br>
<br>
3- You can turn the deathfist belts into the Captain in the Warrior guild on the second floor - can't recall his exact name.  Note that this will WORSEN you faction with knights of truth though.  Paladin and Warrior factions are frequently opposed.<br>
<br>
4- Haven't hunted in the revamped Nekt - can't answer<br>
<br>
5- should do - except he will not be able to trade with normal merchants via sneak and may need to repeat quests or make kills more/less times than the monk.  He will also not be able to use the monk quests to accelerate the time it takes him.<br>
<br>
6- You are talking 100s of orcs to be able to enter town with wolf-form on.  100s more again to do without.<br>
<br>
My advice is this:<br>
<br>
Kill as many orcs as you need to be able to get into town with a wolf form (obtain from a 39+ Druid - ask one nicely).  This is going to take you a LONG time.<br>
<br>
Do the first monk headband quest repeatedly, hand in at least 2 backpacks worth of components).  This quest gives plusses to monk faction and to paladin faction.  Note enough faction to pass the guards safely and not get attacked by the monks in wolf form is not necessarily enough to do the quest.  If it doesnt work go back and kill more orcs.  Note that you can often buy the items for this quest in large volumes either from newbies in WFP or from the ogre or the gnome merchants, who the newbies frequently sell stacks of these items too.<br>
<br>
Do this until you are well liked by both.  You can then do the Warrior guild version of the DF belt quest to sacrifice some of your excess paladin faction for warrior faction until neither is KOS to you.  If you go too far repeat the monk quest some.<br>
<br>
Not the only method but I found the quickest for a monk.  Your troll friend will need to do additional faction work. <p>Tarrask, 49th Swifttail of Saryrn

Take as many packs as you can carry with you there and just start killing orcs (keep count, you're going to need 1400 orc kills to get dubious with NFP guards, and amiable to the monk guild)<br>
<br>
While you are killing orcs loot all the deathfist belts that drop and when you are full run them to EFP and give to the captain in the militia house...it may take 100-150 belts to get dubious to them, once you hit dubious you are good to go.<br>
<br>
Now keep killin those orcs so you can get amiable to the monk guild, once you have done so you can do the white sash quest over and over and everything gets really easy from there, once you hit ally (which comes quickly) at monks you'll be good to go in NFP. <br>
<br>
HINT: when doing the white sash quest run around ec and wc and buy all the deathfist pawn scalps, bone chips and snake fangs you can, makes the faction raising much quicker.<br>

 A nice addition indeed, so long as the faction wasn't a fluke! Which has happened to me before. :P<br>

Wait a second... when did the warriors become allied with the militia?  Any time I've ever turned in belts I got faction up with Steel Warriors and Knights and down with Militia and at least one other faction.  I used to use that to counteract the bad hits I was taking with NFP guards.<br>
<br>
Ok, just so you note:  Killing orcs will NOT enable you to walk into town.  It has no faction hits with the Freeport Militia.  You will have to wolfform and turn the belts into the militia captain.  (On the balcony near the forge in the Militia house if you have trouble figuring out which one he is)<br>
<br>
Any negatives you take from giving the belts can be mostly counteracted once you can do the white headband quest.<br>
