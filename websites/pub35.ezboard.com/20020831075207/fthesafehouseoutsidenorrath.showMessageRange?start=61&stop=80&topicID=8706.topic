<br>
First of all, I'm very disappointed that Psycho has only been mentioned once - I haven't seen anyone mention the original Halloween OR Jaws.  I'll certainly go along with the original Shining (not the tv movie) and the original Nosferatu (although Werner Herzog's 1979 remake is pretty damn good)  Silence of the Lambs and Se7en are excellent choices as well, which leads to an interesting point: are you guys counting thrillers?  I regard those two along the same lines as The Conversation and Marathon Man; they give me more of a chill than Friday 13th or Final Destination.<br>
<br>
But for splatter you have to go with the original Evil Dead, it was more horror-oriented and less subject to self-mockery than the latter two (of course they were ALL great)<br>
<br>
And then there's the 'Eerie/Creepy' movies, of which some pretty good ones have come out recently, i.e. The Sixth Sense, and Donnie Darko<br>
<br>
And, of course, the classics, like Bela Lugosi as Dracula, Boris Karloff as Frankenstein and The Mummy, Lon Chaney as The Phantom of the Opera (if you like silent flicks Glip, that's another great one), and his son, Lon Chaney, Jr. in The Wolfman.  And Claude Rains's film debut The Invisible Man <br>
<br>
There's a lot more, but I feel lazy right now... <p>Siblin Blottoe<BR>

<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps someone here has seen it and can fill us in on the &gt;&gt;&gt;details. <br>
<br>
Yes! Ring is a pretty creepy/scary movie, although I haven't seen the sequels yet. I believe it is Chinese, so you'll have to get it subtitled (which I'm ok with, I watch a lot of foreign movies).<br>
<br>
Also, may be worth mentioning, an American version of Ring is due out in theatres around Halloween this year, but I have no idea if it will be as good as the original.<br>
<br>
I definitely recommend seeing the original, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvorashus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vorashus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/21/02 7:52:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8706.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ring</span><hr size=1> wasnt my cup of tea, but if youre looking for that scary date movie type thing, House on Haunted Hill was pretty decent.<br>

It's super-hard to find on VHS, but I just looked and lo and behold it is being released on DVD next month!<br>
<br>
This is a real scary movie because, you know, it's all believable and realistic.  There are some sickos out there in the world and this film documents what they can be like.<br>

If you do see it, get the DVD; the backstories are very interesting.<br>
<br>
And I don't care what anyone says:  The Exorcist sucked.<br>
<br>
Does anyone remember the movies with an antagonist named "The Tall Man?"  May have been "The Grey Man."  Anyway, these shiny orbs would go into peoples' heads, which effectively zombified them.  It was a series of movies.<br>
<br>
Is there anything wrong with a man who can sit alongside his father while watching "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ... with both of us laughing?  The thing that makes this movie great are the details.  Did anyone else notice the flayed skin lampshades in the house?<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way, the official title is "Killer Space Clowns from Outer Space."  The redundancy alone makes me giggle.<br>
<br>
Other remotely scary movies I'd recommend:<br>
<br>
The Blair Witch Project 2: Book of Shadows (MUCH better than its clunky predecessor)<br>
Cannibal! The Musical (maybe not, but it is damned hilarious)<br>
Children of the Corn movies<br>
Dead Alive (funny gorefest .... hard to believe Peter Jackson directed it)<br>
Dee Snyder's Strangeland (Strangeworld maybe?)<br>
Fallen<br>
Hellraiser flicks<br>
Idle Hands (more for teenage audience)<br>
IT (Book was great; movie not so great, but moving pictures like Georgie's scare the life out of me)<br>
Necronomicon<br>
Nightmare of Elm Street movies<br>
Primal Fear<br>
Puppet Master I (the rest portray puppets as good guys)<br>
Re-Animator<br>
Seven<br>
Tales from the Hood<br>
Texas Chainsaw Massacre<br>
Thirteen Ghosts<br>
The Cell<br>
The Ninth Gate<br>
The Shining (both old and new) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 1:30:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8706.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I need a scary scary movie.</span><hr size=1> I know alot of people think it sucked, but I was actually scared watching the Blair Witch Project.<br>

The movies with the orbs is the &quot;Phantasm&quot; series.  First couple were ok.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to bother to recommend any movies since they've all been named already ... but I have to say that 13 ghosts was pretty bad ... except for the ghosts themselves.  The designs were awesome and I would have loved to have seen a lot more about them. <p><CENTER>

As someone also mentioned, Ravenous is an extremely creepy-scary movie that is pretty good, although not very well known (but that means you probably haven't seen it).<br>
