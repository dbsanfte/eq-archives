West Wing respawns on a 72 minute timer.  A full set of plate armor should take only a few hours to gather; it won't all go to the same person, but neither will drops from North.<br>
<br>
Long ago we did HoT (East ToV) as a guild for a week (one or two rounds every night and a couple of rounds in the weekend), and got over 15 BP's/tunics/robes -- not to mention the other armor.  We did this to up the baseline of our guild abit, you can't really it that easily in North.  Armor drops are even more common in West Wing from recent experiences.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You say that the Warrior drops can be farmed easier? I agree. However, once the Warrior/Paladin/Shadow Knights are outfitted in quested, what else in the way of upgrades for those slots drop in NToV?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Don't expect any sympathy from me.  Have you ever looked at the monk Velious armor, the Kunark armor (crescent armor I think), the Fear armor?  Most of those armors are inferior in every way, not just ac, but also on resists.<br>
<br>
It's like whining that the hard mobs in North don't drop anything for you, when you already got decent armor that can be done with a random pick up raid.  It takes quite a bit longer to be able to get into North as a guild (primal is almost a requirement, which requires quite a few ST keys).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Which means that Monks (also Rangers and Rogues, but thats a different issue) are being outfitted in armor that is equal to Warlords. Doesn't that strike you as messed up?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, the armor is messed up (even casters can wear).  Is that a reason to nerf monks?  No, they're just trying to get something more than the pathetic 6 ac on their Skyshrine quested legs.<br>
<br>
We didn't ask to get armor with similair ac as a warrior; but if its handed to you, wouldn't you wear it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In Kunark what was the highest tunic a Monk could get? 15 AC? And a cobalt BP was 45 AC wasn't it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Fungi tunic is 21 ac, and it's not even monk only.  It's defaulted to monks often though, not just because of the regen, but also because it is the highest AC tunic Kunark had to offer for monks.<br>
The class specific armor monks get in Kunark is mid-level at best, and pales in every way in comparison with Cobalt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My how the world has changed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yes, I think you could safely say monks have gotten the shaft in Kunark, and we were definitely due an upgrade.  We did get some nice stuff in Velious, and for those few monks able to go to North ToV, it was even ridiculously nice, perhaps too much so, for most though, even Velious was hardly monk paradise.. compare that to the upgrades the other melees got. <p><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~hjohn/swilvsign.jpg" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utheunmistakablevoiceofreason.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Unmistakable Voice of Reason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/14/02 7:34:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monk Changes</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
You are being drawn into his trap.<br>
<br>
In North ToV, every single slot offers FAR superior items for either all plate classes or warriors than the all/all stuff unless you add in the Vulak Aerr pieces.  Halfing the AC on all Vulak loots would, in effect, fix the entire problem.<br>
<br>
But a warrior suited in North ToV drops has a greatly superior AC than any monk suited in North ToV drops.  A comparison of 1400 for the monk and 1800 for the warrior.  Many warriors haven't tried to accumulate this AC as it doesn't work correctly in game.  Once more, however, this points to the need to fix the game mechanic and not touch monks.<br>
<br>
Glatius set up a straw man argument.  He is using a series of lies to make his point.  It is important not to be drawn into that and to question each mistake he makes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=202.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=202.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.emailToFriend?topicID=202.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.threadControl?topicID=202.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=202.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=202.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17>Monk Change</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
