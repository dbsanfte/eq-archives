<br>
They do so much with faction why not add Religious Factions  (i don't think they have this now)  that would add to the points system.  That way lessuberSK_01, if he killed enough of the opposing god's minions, would equal enough points as say uberSK_01 who only killed one named mob.<br>
<br>
Naturally these would be geared to individuals and not raiding parties as that would complicate things greatly.  Imagine all the Cazic-Thule worshipers in your guild turning down a raid in the new CT temple because they take a religous faction hit.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have decreased your standing with the &quot;Army of Cazic-Thule&quot; ... You have been demoted to Corporal.<br>
<br>
Either way...<br>
I still want to be a GOD!<br>

Then we will be right back where we are today, and we can all agree that it really isn't a good thing. the uber guilds are getting stagnant. I mean how many of them can actually say that they are &quot;Challenged&quot;?? with the game the way it is now Armor / Weapons / Mobs cant get much harder with out completely changing the coding / engine / what not. 60's can only have so much of a range of ability. They can't fight level 80 mobs...resists are too high, and they would hit too hard. then the reward for killing said mob would have to be insane, yet it would be too much for the way they do eq armor to handle...<br>
<br>
     If you really think, what would be the difference? Sub 55 - 60 players would have to play through the rest of EQ anyway if EQ: 2 was just another expansion... Why not give the ubers something i think that they have wanted for a long time. SOMETHING BRAND NEW. I mean the ubers entering an entirely new world where they are the only ones, they get to walk in and say this is all for me. Not hunt around the new expansion and try to find the uber zones. I think they miss the feeling of immersion. Believe it or not, i think some of them want to feel like newbies agian...I know i do. i would love to walk into a whole new world. where Mob's like Vulak / AoW / 4th Warder were gonna be the eaisest &quot;Boss Mob's&quot; that i could find. <br>
<br>
      If the all the time it takes for level 1 - 60 is only one year then, whats the harm in that. With my idea for eq 2 the ubers will only need one year if that to be on the next level ( i.e around level 70 ) for the new wave to come in. Plus so what if it takes one year. Wouldn't you want to get raiding and grouping and fighting done in NToV, and get a little experiance under your belt?? Or are you just talking about the LoIo, OT, DL, KC n00bs?? Yeah that takes a year, but are those players half way decent and skilled??? ( i know a few are but the majority, i think speaks for itself ) They will also want to be the best equiped that they can to enter EQ 2....<br>
<br>
       Basically all i want is a nice flow...I am just tired of people trying to become better, but can't since so many are holding them back. You can only raid VS / Chardok / etc soo many times. Many guilds i belive are ready to learn how to do NToV, but can't because of the people already there...In my idea the people that are there ( in NToV etc ) will be gone in a little while. That gives room for others to stay there and become &quot;uber&quot; for around 1 year or so, that way they can get done and move on.... Again just ideas, i just elaborated to give more points than previous post <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufuzzyfoot07.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fuzzyfoot07</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/02 8:56:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23059.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.katanya.net/EQ/Stabn.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re...</span><hr size=1> I know many people will disagree with me but I personally think a new 55+ expansion would be awesome only if they changed the rules a little... I mean make it so that somehow a portal has been opened to a very powerful world... The rules we know change, Levels can be increased to 75... Skill Caps would be raised... Stats could reach 500 instead of 255, etc... The catch would be you couldn’t zone with equipment... Your stuff is stored in a Special bank on the Norrath side of the game.... You zone over and there is a special bank on the new world also (which would have some basic gear to get you started maybe PoG equal). Anyway your gear would stay there if you decided to zone back to Norrath... If you did zone back to Norrath and were lets say level 65 you would revert back to 60 for your time on Norrath, then back to 65 when you go back to the new world... <br>
This would cause everyone that zoned over to the new expansion to spend many hours restocking gear and exploring... I don’t think it would be a wise idea to come out with an expansion that only one guild on every server could handle... It wouldn't be worth it money-wise... but by leveling the field in the beginning of it, all 55+ could have a good/bad experience there... The Uber guilds couldn’t complain that it was too easy, because they are in full NtoV gear and the lesser guilds couldn’t complain it was too hard because they can’t get any gear because it is always farmed… <br>

In some ways, better than totally reengineering EQ.  Obviously EQ1 is very popular still there's tons of content here to get a player to level 60.  But it is definitely overcrowded at the high end.  The same guilds are farming the same stuff over and over squeezing out the up-coming guilds.<br>
<br>
Not only does it provide a sort of incentive to stick with EQ to the very high levels, but it would solve the lower content going so obsolete with higher level people.  <br>

<br>
I think that more than one guild per server could handle eq 2. I am sure that on any given server there are at least 3 guilds competeing for spawns, most deffinately 2. I am most sure that at least two guilds from each server would move. Now you may not think that it is that much, but in reality it is. Those ~150 people free up nearly 100% of the highlevel content. <br>
<br>
I realize that eq has 2 year subscription plans, and i am sure verant would let them carry over, because in essence EQ 2 would be an expansion - not an entirely new game. Your account would carry over into eq 2 - or an expansion.<br>
<br>
I do think that the next expansion needs to cater to only the higer-level players. For they are at the end, and quite frankly the only way i see to keep them happy is to give them nearly 50 or so zones and raise the level bar. In tandem with raising the level bar the difficulty / rate of exp gain needs to be a huge amount to gain levels. With raising levels that means raising mob levels so then verant would have to re-do the armor and weapons and spells of all the classes. They will need to have AC on items goin into the 100's at least. the expansion needs to be very hard. I know the higher levels want all this content and all these items, but they don't wanna work for it. We can't make level 60 - 75 or 60 - 100 a cake walk. This needs to be something that the higher levels need to work at for a long time. I am thinking at least one year to reach the new level max... This should keep the higher levels busy, with out frusterating them too much.<br>
<br>
To all the lower level players...Some may be thinking that the higher levels always want to exclude you..We don't, not in the least bit. However many lowerlevels can't even tell you where the entrance to befallen is located. They couldn't tell you what an SSoY is. Lower levels whine that they don't have the content that the upper levels do. You do, infact you have much more than the higher levels. I think that some where it says that 75% of eq's zones have mobs ranging from 1 - 45. thats an awful lot of content. You are right none of these zones drop the essentails for every newbie ( i.e Iksar Bp, Lammys, etc... ). ATTENTION:: YOU DON&quot;T NEED ITEMS THAT MOST LEVEL 50 - 60 PLAYERS HAVE TO GET THROUGH LEVELS 1 - 50. Believe it or not it can be done by killing and looting mobs that are blue and maybe even to you, at any given level. <br>
<br>
I just think that the higer levels deserve more. They have put thier time in. We have went through the hardships and beginings of the game. I remember when you were uber when you were a 40 sk and you had bronze armor and a BBC. I also rembmer when sks had no life tap... its just sad to see a majority of the level 15 - 45 people stay in just 4 - 6 zones in the game. EQ has so much more to offer... I appologize that my post has been turned into a nostalgia rant. In conclusion I just think that the higher levels need  a full expansion dedicated to them, that way we can free up the end game for others....<br>

Lower guilds could either work in the new expansion areas building up or in ToV/Sleepers/Ssra etc... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=23059.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=23059.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23059.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=23059.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=23059.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23059.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23059.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
