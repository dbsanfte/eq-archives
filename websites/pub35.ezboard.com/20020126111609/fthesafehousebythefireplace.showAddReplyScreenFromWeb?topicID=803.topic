<br>
Here is something that happened to me yesterday.  I must say it was one of the more intense experiences in the game yet.<br>
<br>
As every rogue knows, there is an item getting which is considered to be rogue's right of passage.  This item is the coveted Mask of Deception, which allows its wearer to turn into a Dark Elf effectively allowing you to travel the evil cities.  This marvel of roguish equipment is located deep within Undead Side of Lower Guk.  The MOB that drops it is called Ghoul Assassin and is one of the more notorious monsters in the game.  Since I have reached a mid-point of my life at lvl 31, I have decided that it is time for me to get this. <br>
<br>
My travel from Freeport was uneventful.  I ran from EC to N Ro, then on to Oasis, crossed the S Ro, and finally entered Innothule Swamp.  I have never been that deep south.  After many mistakes and wrong headings I at last stood at the entrance to Guk.  The entrance was guarded by couple of Froglocks.  To my surprise they conned dubious to me, which meant that I can travel safely through live side.  This is what I did.  It took a very long time to get to the entrance to Lower Guk, but finally I swam in underground river and emerged in L Guk on top of the waterfalls.  Shrill cries and slimy walls have surrounded me.  I quickly put on my hide and sneak and got ready for my adventure.  I then shouted if anyone would like to help me kill the Assassin.  Before long I was answered by fellow adventurers who were also camping this item.  I was to join their group and we would fight our way to Assassin.  After sneaking to them, we have joined and began our fight.  I won't describe hordes of undead frogloks which we hunted down, and there were many.  Finally we have stood at the ladder leading to the assassin room.  We all climbed and were immediately attacked by the assassin.  He was destroyed very fast.  Lo and behold he had the mask, however, there was a bard before me and he was to have a first pick.  We settled to wait for another one.  Everything was going well, we were quickly dispatching all the pops when something terrible has happened.  Our 38 Monk has fallen down the ladder, and inadventuredly cause a huge train.  All of the sudden we were beset on all sides with 7 undead frogloks 2 of which were wizards.  The fight was on, we killed 2 of them but we were getting swarmed.  Our wizard has began to cast the evac spell.  Me and a monk were holding the frogs off, I was backstabbing for 150 points and doing terrible damage.  With a backstab I downed a wizard, while our two clerics were healing us.  The battle turned as there were now only 2 attackers, since the other 2 frogs were killed outright.  Our wizard abandoned the spell.  We thought we had triumphed.  And then another disaster struck.  The assassin spawned and announced his appearance by backstabbing our cleric for 160 points, while more reinforcements have arrived in the face of 2 more wizards.  Our cleric, Lendara, went down.  The wizard has began casting the spell of evac, while I and our Monk, were again buying time with our lives.  As assassin fell, the spell went off.  I found myself in North Karana along with most of my companions.  Unfortunately we have not evaced another one of our companions who was a bard that received a mask.  He soon announced his death.  With tears in our eyes and thoughts of revenge we grimly healed and prepared to storm back and claim the bodies of our fallen comrades.  We TPed to Cazic-Thule and immediately were engaged in a battle with a clay golem.  Upon his defeat, a piece of Ravenscale armor was dropped.  Not believing my luck, I was told to loot it.  Woot, I got the first piece of rogue's armor by myself.  We ran through the swamp and traveled through Guk, and once again I found myself on the top of the waterfall.  We have fought through only to be thwarted time and time again.  With one final push, we broke through and were able to drag the corpses of our fallen comrades to the zone.  While our cleric and wizard dragged the bodies, me and a monk again provided the rear guard against the tough undead.  We zoned and came back a bit later.  Our friends were rezzed and we were all together again.  However it was now very late at night and most of the group had to log.  Thus I did not gain my Mask that day, but I know I will.  Instead I got a piece of Ravenscale and won the friendship of many friends.  I will now never forget the horrible cries and faces of the undead and the shouts of my friends in battle.  <br>
I hope you all enjoyed this piece as much as I did living it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umkondr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mkondr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/01 2:06:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=803.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Error</span><hr size=1> Sorry the golem killed was stone, not clay and I got a helm off him.

With the combined forces of everyone in zone, lol, i had finally got the mask.  While 56 necro pulled the whole zone, the rest of the people (around 20 or so) beat the assassin senseless.  Then I was allowed to loot, invis vs. undead and lead to the exit.  It was great, for 5 hours I was just sitting in BR room chatting with everyone in zone, and eventually everyone helped.  I mean every single person in the zone actually came to kill the assassin.  Man it was fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
