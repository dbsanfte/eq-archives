But this fight, i knew i was in trouble, they were already in over their heads. But im fighting nonstop, refusing to give into death, although i feel it encroaching at a rather unpleasant pace. I drop, but only for a moment, an dim back up, swinging again. It connects and i fall, watching my life fade before my eyes, The necro behind me imbues his life to me, i swing, the other caster hits it, the crawler hits me and im down again, up again. down again. This went on for at least a whole moment, knowing my life could go quite easilry even from one strong hit. And finally the thing falls.

No such luck D'vinn spouts something about killing all woodelves and backstabs me for 47 and stabs me twice.

I love to group with rogues though. On Quellious there is a rogue called Winestab (!!!)...He is now lvl 23 I think. At llvl 14, we used to group a lot for the dervs in WCommons. By god, the little guy will be prancing around the dervs and backstabbing them all the time..!!! <BR>  <BR> Anyway, my closest exp with the death thing was at lvl 17 in a full group in Befallen. We had 2 paladins, me a monk, and 3 casters. Hmm..I am tanking this evil thing which was basically wiping the floor with me when we hav two more of its pals join in. The casters blast the new monsters, while I was holding our first guuest. I Mend, fight on..The monster gets a dual weild/double attack in (Sigh..4 hits of 25 each or so!). I am unconscious and bleeding to death, Tada, I feel a &quot;healing &quot; touch. WOW. I am up and hitting it again..The casters are OOM. The monster ignores the paladins and comes for me! Very soon, I am unconscious again!$#$#$#e. Again, the second paladin uses lay hands on me! We finally killed the baddy. <BR>  <BR> And, this is the great part..That was the first time I had grouped with those paladins..!! Very dew paladins I know of use layhands on others, especially in the heat of battle! <BR> Compare this to some clerics I know who spend all mana nuking the MOB:( <BR>  <BR> Ronninn NynjaKami <BR> 20 Monk on Quellious <BR> Admirer and Friend of Rogues <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/ukezzek.showPublicProfile>Kezzek</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/smallPadlock.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/15/99 4:53:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cheating death</span><hr size=1> Wow, this just might be the oldest thread in the Safehouse! <BR>  <BR> 6/20/99?!?! <BR>  <BR> Impressive! <p>Kezzek Bladefiend<br>
