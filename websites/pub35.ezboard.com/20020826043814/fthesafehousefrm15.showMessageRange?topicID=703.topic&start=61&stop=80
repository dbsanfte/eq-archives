That's the truth right there.  All y'all &quot;Pvp sounds like fun but I don't wanna leave all my gear and my stuff!!&quot; people should read that again.  Yeah eq pvp isn't perfect.  No pvp is perfect.<br>
<br>
Our population is somewhere around 300-800 off/prime.  SZ's population changes everyday as new people join and old people leave.  I think one of the best parts is making a name for yourself.  The community is so small that everyone knows everyone else.  A newt rogue isn't just some faceless guy from another guild, he's the guy that backstabbed me for double 300's in a kith forest epic fight.  <br>
<br>
our message board is pretty crappy, populated by people that no longer play sz, and make the same type of remarks I've seen in this thread, every day.  enh~<br>

It was such a change of pace...the issues I do see though are the same issues in regular EQ--it's not the getting ganked part, it's having the TIME to play enough. Instead of needing 10 hours on Saturday for ToV, etc, you'll need it for pk-ing, for levelling so that you can continue to pk...<br>
<br>
Logging in Wythe again last night and getting her to 23 (wow I do like the experience bonus :P) was a blast...but also a shock. When I stopped playing Wythe I made 7 bluebie twinks. Playing an untwinked bard again took some adjustments. It's funny how you forget the times a pgt was a good weapon so quickly...<br>
<br>
But there is something oddly addictive about Sullon. I don't think its the people exactly, sure they are all nice enough in their own ways, but no one is There to be nice. What I find most interesting is the way Norrath itself is a brave new world. Porting into GFay becomes scary, DL more so. It's like the world has shadows and monsters lurking in them that aren't on the spawn table, strange things that you've never seen before. Real threats and real dangers.<br>
<br>
The high end game is fun enough. I can't see it being more so on a red server. Since so much of it involves time, adding to that time just seems like adding to the annoyancesf. Erasing the need for it though, which I think SZ does by offering a counter to lfg in seb chardok and velks, another way to pass the time, is Very interesting. I don't think I have time to play really, and I am quite fond of my life on Saryrn, but still, I am sort of glad I made Wythe way back when, and every once in a while I can dust her off and go exploring.<br>
<br>
As somone (I forget and never knew who) used to say, &quot;there is no love on Sullon Zek&quot;. However sometimes that can be totally entertaining. <p><a href="www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=87982">Vainne</a> K'harmicdeva

I've met them, they've helped me, but they don't seem to be organized in any way. (Here I'm referring to guilds. Even though that's nowhere near an option at level 5, I don't want to get to level 30 or so to find out that there may be none.)<br>

<br>
Evil team controls pretty much any zone they want when they want.<br>
<br>
Evil has more players than any other team so it is more likely to find a group.<br>
<br>
Organization does not occur in the lower levels on Sullon Zek very often, the most organized guilds (55+) are: Hate, Ruin, and Defilers.  Da Bashin Iggles are an organized guild who mostly pvp and aren't really into high end content, but they do plane raids and such.<br>
<br>
I played on TZ since a few months after release, as soon as Sullon came out I played full time and haven't looked back.<br>
<br>
The whining and crying that occurs on most blue/pink servers only gets you killed on Sullon.<br>
<br>
Sure it has it's share of idiots, but what server doesn't really?<br>
<br>
The good and neutral team need the most help, if you want to make a difference on the server, play on one of those two teams.  I always enjoy more elf stew *grins*.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions or anything, feel free to send me a tell and I can probably go into more details.<br>

I like playing the blue PvE game, with the added rush from the PvP. The other day, we had a failed raid in seb for undead bard but my heart was pumping the whole time because we didn't know how it would turn out. Sebelis is an evil controlled dungeon, probably the most heaviest one making it extremely hard for another team to get in and kill something like Trak and make it out. We came with 21 people and cleared out about 20 inside. We made it down to the undead bard and proceeded to engage as 40 evils were clearing their way through the shrooms. Unfortunately, we rushed and wiped out but it was intense because noone had any idea who would win. This is the kind of stuff I came to SZ for. On any other server, there's no thrill of zoning into sebelis, clearing through the mobs, and killing a pushover like trak. <p>Vidmaster Melerak<BR>

<br>
The no rules, no level limit environment eventually becomes second nature to you, and playing on the old Zeks gets very frustrating - certain types of griefing behavior quite _depend_ on the other server's level limit, namely super-twinked lowbie ganking on RZ to steal more twink gear, or just deleveled newbie harrassment on the other Zeks.  On SZ you can only grief newbies but any red that happens to pass through can attack you.  Granted, people still sometimes go into greenie zones and make like lawnmowers, but that's life.<br>

PVP an afterthought, btw Vermillion?  PVP is the only thing that makes EQ more than (sorry) a chat-room with a shot-up RPG with poorly written content tacked on.  On a blue server you level and get gear so that you can level more and get more gear, so you can get to raids, where you can get more gear, that will let you level to let you raid to get more gear.<br>
<br>
On SZ you do that so you can kill and not be killed with better gear and more levels.  EQ's a bit more interesting with random, zoning, superintelligent levl 60 opponents, wouldn't you say?  Continue to play against map-designers and genius mob AI if you find that challenging, however.  Noone will stop you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you are a group dependant class you will be hard pressed to find a group to level with, and it is even harder to find a good group.  So the solution to this is to play a easily soloed class which, if and when you ever get to the high level game, are not particularily useful on raids generally.  Druids have been called the clerics of the neutral team on sullon zek, why?  Because druids are very good at mid level pvp and are easy to solo level.  Also the pvp bugs can be frustrating at times.  Although collecting a insignia from someone is not the only way to declare victory in a pvp battle, if you cause someone to gate/ring pull/zone plug then you have defeated them in a sense.  If you ever get to the high end game as a non evil, the numbers against you will be daunting and uber raids will not be done by a single guild but most likely the team.  You will also have to deal with manaburn, lifeburn, ranger burn, charm burn and the like as a high end player.  Just making it past level 20 or 30 is an ordeal now, it wasnt so bad when the server started up and you rarely saw reds out there but now that will be the greater part of what you see against you.<br>
<br>
And even with all these flaws and frustrations to deal with I bet that 99% of the SZ population would quit before they went back to bloobiness.<br>

What do you do about equipment on SZ?  I remember 2.5 years ago when I first started playing EQ, I was tickled to death to get a BCP for my druid.<br>
<br>
I read a few posts that suggest the economy is a little different, but to what end? <br>
<br>
I would expect there to be little twinking involved and a support-base within guilds that issue pass-down equipment, etc in order to strengthen the team/guild.  Is this true?<br>

Some of the best twinks on any server can be found on Sullon (thanks legends transfers /rude verant).  However there are plenty of people who have never played on any other server.  <br>
<br>
Yeah, we want more people, but we don't want any of the people that are like &quot;well, I like killing computer AI, but it kinda sucks that someone might kill me and make it take longer for me to kill computer AI&quot;.  Please don't sign up.<br>
<br>
Yup, there are some people on Evil and Newt team  who do play purely because the uber mobs are less contested for than on their old servers.  Most of the people are here because they *want* to fight other people, its fun to get in a battle over a zone or to recover a corpse or just because you happened to be passing through a zone.  Most of us get gear because being rooted sucks, and more hp means you'll have a better chance.  Loot is NOT an end-all.  Yeah, I wanna look secksay and have nice big green numbers on my stat list, but thats just so I can kick your butt better (or die less often)<br>
<br>
I think the original post was for all those people that started SZ the first couple of weeks, and then left because there were just so many of us.  If you love to play a &quot;co-operative game&quot; thats great, enjoy your blue server.  However, if you wanna get the chance to kick some butt, and pvp with the best pvpers around, Sullon Zek just might be for you.<br>
<br>
Evil and Newt teams are very viable. They are closer than ever in power now thanks to most of &lt;ruin&gt; leaving for dungeon seige and a lot of newts returning twinked from legends.  Good team still has it hard, but an old evil guild just rerolled good, and goods are gaining pve experience every day.  Sullon Zek isn't for everyone, and thats ok, but if you are interest come on over =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uquindinarolorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quindinar Olorion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/02 1:49:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Damn, I'm sold.

I don't think I have time to play really, and I am quite fond of my life on Saryrn, but still, I am sort of glad I made Wythe way back when, and every once in a while I can dust her off and go exploring. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well about the high end game and &quot;time&quot;.<br>
Alot of epic battles (50+ people) and smaller skirmishes have <br>
occured mostly in and around :<br>
Kael, WL, Skyshrine, CS/SG, Western Wastes, ToV/DN.<br>
Usually over key dragons and other things.<br>
<br>
<br>
So when you said it takes so much &quot;time&quot; to do high end<br>
stuff.<br>
<br>
Well on SZ, as soon as you gather more than about<br>
12 people, the timer is ticking until the enemy hears<br>
about it and decides to attack with PvP or a train or<br>
whatever to disrupt your team. So you have to move<br>
relatively quickly and be mobile and flexible or you<br>
can get crushed. In some ways that makes things go<br>
faster and people work better under some pressure.<br>
It changes group strategy too, like putting an evac in<br>
every group in case of a train from the enemy.<br>
<br>
And there are also fights over the few good places to<br>
level up at lvl 55-60.  Places like Velketors especially.<br>
Sebilis being so remote has remained Evil controlled<br>
generally.  Goods control The Hole, while Neutrals control<br>
Velketors generally.  Other dungeons are up for grabs.<br>
Sometimes you have to fight/defend or clear out a dungeon<br>
to have a chance at xp/loot from there. It can add an<br>
interesting dynamic and can be frustrating too so a <br>
certain attitude about these things is required. <br>
<br>
<br>
Try it out, you'll like the added dimensions to the gameplay,<br>
especially if you are burnt out on normal EQ.<br>

I currently play a neutral bard, and I love every minute of it.  Heck, due to my experience of SZ, every alt I make now, is on a PvP server.  In my opinion (as of now), making an alt on a blue server will just result in the same mind numbing mob-whacking that I currently do with my rogue.<br>
<br>
PvP servers offer so much more to do compared to blue servers.  Logging on my Rogue lately is becoming painful, unless the &quot;core&quot; of my guild is on, in which case I go to the Hole or something with them, which is making me edge over to SZ permanently.  <br>
<br>
On SZ, there is actual risk wherever you are, you have to constantly /who, always look around.  Also, the small amount of people results in the fact that everyone is known, which is pretty cool.<br>
<br>
Again, in my opinion, it is all that great, and even more.  It's some of the most fun I've had in EQ ever, and to anyone considering it, do give it a whirl, it is way worth it.<br>
