It's not like we're asking to be rulers of the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
The bulk of the problem for SB's is this.....<br>
Without doublefrost, LEFTAXE is not as good as CD/DW.  It needs to be at or better then CS/DW damage, as it is MUCH more dependent on high spec. (LEFTAXE UPGRADE)<br>
<br>
The 5% increase in hitpoints is not as effective as the .3 more spec points per level, something unique needs to bring this back to par.  (10% INCREASE IN &quot;something&quot;)  *** feel free to help me out on what that &quot;something&quot; should be.<br>
<br>
Having only access to slash makes SB's far less versatile then the other 2 assassins. (HAMMER SPEC)<br>
<br>
Shadowrun is the most pathetic unique realm skill in the game.  (FIX SOMEHOW)<br>
<br>
<br>
INFILTRATORS EVERYWHERE, LOOK AT THIS!<br>
<br>
Would this be such a bad thing?  Would it not bring about a nice balance between the sb and inf?  (I also listed my fixes for ns's that I think would make NS = INF = SB)<br>
<br>
Jump on THIS bandwagon!  Don't buy into the SB's are SOOO overpowered BS.  It's just that... BS.<br>

This would open up other options to them all around.  This change would probably make for a lot of very unhappy paladins though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lakeb>Lakeb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/2/02 2:28:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3410.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> caution</span><hr size=1> I don't really see this balance problem as being as bad as some are suggesting and I am a NS so I have room to talk.  I would love to have a decent spell line mainly because I want to ding people from the top of the keep, it has nothing to do with other rogues.  <br>
<br>
My main concern is that so many posts on this topic and similar ones revolve around duplicating something good that another rogue class already has.  I am very much against cookie cutter classes.  Making us all exactly the same would indeed make us balanced... but it would be boring to play.<br>
<br>
Regarding Celtic Dual, it isn't that great for us but it is decent, as pointed out above.  When it comes to helping Blade Masters, I feel it would be better to give them double parry for dual wielding since most of them that I know pull agro easily (filborg dual wield) and almost all CD styles cause a penalty to defense.  If they could parry with both blades (at least mathematically) it would make them a very good class to play in the way a NS with high evade/dodge makes a pretty good tank.<br>
<br>
It seems that there are several SBs that are going for the jugular on the Infiltrators and it is just wrong.  Since they never did this before the LA nerf, I am guessing they are using Infs as whipping boys because they are mad about LA.  That is not cool.  I have never played an infiltrator but I know I kill them as often as they kill me so they aren't uber.  I certainly never feared them the way I used to fear SBs.  <br>
<br>
IMO, the main love that needs to be extended to SBs is the opportunity to respec.  However, I think that most of them would not change their LA spec because in spite of the DF nerf, LA is still a great line.  I respect the fact that the SBs are pissed and I think they have a right to be pissed, but there is no need to start marching for cookie cutter classes and please don't start preying on Infs because it is just not true.  No offense to Infs, but no one says, &quot;Oh God, please don't let an Inf find me out here alone.&quot;  Infs aren't scaring &quot;uber.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/2/02 2:44:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3410.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: caution</span><hr size=1> Double parry for duel wielders would go far to balance the classes--it wouldn't affect the assasins, and it would help the classes that needed it most.

That's a bit big for a rogue class.<br>
<br>
<br>
People are already pissed as is about us, if one assassin can spec hammer, not only will they be able to kill *any* class without penalties,  SB haters would have a reason to ask for nerfs even more and actually have good arguments for it.<br>
<br>
Ask for thrust, not crush, that's not serious.<br>
It's gonna hinder more than help Sbs in the long nerf/fix run. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ullava.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llava</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/2/02 11:56:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3410.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Rebalance</span><hr size=1> I gotta say, I play a Nightshade, and I'd really love the chance to spend those extra .3 spec points.... but to the point where I care about the integrity of this game I have to say I can't agree with the idea.<br>
<br>
As the magic users assassins we should have the best ranged ability of all of them.  We don't.  Hell, I get hit with an Infiltrator's crossbow for more than my spell hits him.  Make it a viable DD spell, not quite as strong as a caster's but pretty damn strong.  Enough to make them fear.<br>
<br>
Increase the shout damage a bit, fix the variance.  I'd say to lower the timer too, but it depends on how the damage does.<br>
<br>
Give Shadowblades more hitpoints.  A lot more.  Not 50.  More. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulilamien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilamien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/3/02 12:13:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3410.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Rebalance</span><hr size=1> Bile,<br>
 <br>
   In your list of suggestions you're overlooking a few things, besides my sarcasm.<br>
<br>
   You said that you should get a 15% HP increase to match the potential 15% damage bonus Infs get from 2.5 spec points.  Well, don't forget Shadowblades can use specable 2 handed weapons without spending any spec points in another line. (Meaning a 2 handed weapon spec skill).  Nobody in Albion or Hibernia can do that.  They all must spec specifically for 1 hand or 2 hand.  Alb/Hib rogues can't weild 2 handers at all (except unspecced staves).  That is a very notable ability you have, and it is worth something in considering balance.  The shadowblade community has this habit of turning a blind eye to that fact, but it is a special ability that you have and is unique amoung the 3 classes.  Much as is my +.3 spec points, and the NSs shout spell.<br>
<br>
   Nightshades definately should have decent damage capability with their spells, but I can see where it gets tricky.  How could Mythic justify giving a spell that requires no spec points a well specc'd variance?  Maybe it could be linked to or made part of the Envenom skill for shades.  That might be one solution (except to shades who don't spec evenom).<br>

<br>
it turned into a powerful tool,for sb's to use against casters,and other low hp targets,as we could get off large perfs.<br>
<br>
with the introduction of epic armor,realm abilities,and last but not least the 1 shot stleath removal,2h is alot less powerful.<br>
<br>
also,as a final balancing issue&lt;supposdly&gt; the things you state were given to the 3 realms classes. the hp increase we got was 50 points,vs .3 spec for infils,vs what for shades? i forget,they are the red headed step children of rogues unfortuntely.<br>
<br>
i used a 2h weapon for 43 levels,it wasnt that great,and was really pointless after the 1 shot stealth nerf,prior to that it was very nice to attack casters ,as you could survive around the edges of combat easier.<br>

This is not what most Assassins want, since most believe that this was too powerful.  They are also yelling that they cannot kill anything at all.  This is putting peoples backs up since most, myself included do not think this is true.<br>
<br>
BUT this is detracting from the view that maybe SB’s have been nerfed too hard.  I disagree wholeheartedly that they should be brought back to their former glory but maybe they need some love too.<br>
<br>
I still do not believe that a slash infil is better than an SB.  So far all we have seen is one persons logs against one single Infil who is apparently the best buffed, best equipped Inf on the server.  The first log shows them about equal and the second shows totally different results.  This is not proof of anything and how can it be when we have two totally different results?  This alone shows the data to be non representative.  <br>
<br>
In the same thread Mill says that SB’s now fight doing 50% less damage than they used to.  Yet still he claims they were never overpowered.  No offense to Mill here since at least he is trying to provide us with logs and suchlike, I just think the data is getting taken out of context.  How can they have been anywhere near equal before if the SB used to do 50% more damage than now?<br>
<br>
I think the fact is that IMHO SB’s used to be overpowered.  Now Infils and SB’s are equal in melee. However, I do agree that they should not be equal since an infil gets more options.  Let’s try and even this out. <br>
<br>
SB’s Have 2-H weapon which is undoubtedly a bonus, they also get extra hits.  Inf’s get more spec points’ which is a bonus and get to choose thrust or slash.  NS’s get the shout spell which is a bonus (or would be if it ‘worked).<br>
<br>
These things should be worked on to increase the effectiveness of the classes.  We should not go down the road of the cookie cutters.  I would say increase the damage for SB’s (not as high as it used to be though) and/or give them the different weapon spec option, NS’s are easy to fix.  Up that shout damage.  I think that this last option will be done.  It’s just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
If we can all agree and not ask for unreasonable things then let’s all work together and try and get Mythic to listen.  Of course they won’t listen right now because whatever you say, someone else will disagree with.  Why should they listen?<br>
<br>
NS’s do not have this problem and I believe that this is THE reason they will get the damage upped on their shout spell.  Why should they not do it, it won’t piss anyone off and will make some people happy?  If they make the same amount of people happy that they piss off they gain nothing.  The only way to get Mythics attention is to present a united front.  The only way to present a untied front is to be honest with each other and ourselves.  If you want to look for balance then be honest with your limitations and your abilities.  Don’t cry wolf or exaggerate because it will only destroy the case you are trying to make.<br>
<br>
Baiul.<br>

<br>
SB need 2 more Hit point pre level . who cares if this gets them close to thanes and Skail or how ever you spell it . Those classes get great spells and ability that SBs don't . <br>
Up SB damage with all weapons 5% to 25-30 % at 50 th level to get him back their combat edge over Infil . <br>
<br>
NS need their shouts to be treated as 2/3 spec and the damaged up about 30% to 40 % . Give them a hunter/ranger type run spell and mage like AF shield buff . I would even go a lot with a single BT spell . this would make them a good defense assassin . <br>
<br>
this would make SB the strongest combat ,infil the best skilled assassin  and NS the best defense assassin .  <p>Moonglum DAoC
