You can call whoever you want thick headed and call them a poopoo head or whatever else you do... I fail to see examples of this other than software that people use to intentionally violate the Rules of Conduct (such as #11 and #12) or the portion of the EULA that prohibits modifying EQ to make yourself run at 20 times the speed of 60 sow or making warriors have mend.<br>
<br>
Also, I have not received any written statement from SOE or Verant saying I could use DirectX (or any other written statement for that matter).  I'm not sure where you got yours.  Written statements are generally... sit down now, this might be a big surprise... in writing.  They may be typed, but in this case they still have a written (yes, or even stamped) signature at the bottom which brands a name to it backing up the statement.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has been wrongly banned for using third-party software that does not fall within the restrictions of the EULA (such as EQAnnounce or EQWatcher) can apparently contact the Department of Consumer Affairs: &quot;The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've not received express written permission to use virus scanners, and they access EverQuest.  This is third party software and if you were the authority on it, I would apparently not be allowed to use one.  Or let me see... I have Internet Explorer running.  That's third party too, what if I leave it on?  Or hey, WinAMP is third party, I'm not allowed to run that in the background?  What if I have a virus scanner that is constantly scanning in the background, and it accesses my log files?  How about this one.. &quot;System Idle Process&quot;, it uses up to 99% of my system resources, running in the background and its third-party to SOE.  The point is they cannot say &quot;you can't have any other programs running on your computer&quot; -- and they haven't.<br>

<br>
i think talnari made a good point that IF there was ANY possibility...  that a person 'could' be banned.. whether it is likely, reasonable, or praticle or not..  the illiterater user should be made aware.  just like the buyer beware slogan.  but of course nothing is sold.  but not telling an illiterate user this possibility is not cool at all.  that's like a doctor saying take these 2 pills in the morning and you'll feel better but dont worry.. it is for your own good (not to know that you could be banned, although 98% not likely).  that is hiding the possibility of the (benefit of) doupt.<br>
<br>
i understand where EQWatcher is going.  it IS pretty safe to use either of the 2 programs in question since it is not 'actively' modifying the EQ game software in with any seriousness compared to ShowEQ.  unfortunately Grimwin cant use his own program now that he is been specifically told not to.  So for those that have the software already.. feel free.  BUT you may want to keep it 'on the down low'.<br>
<br>
lastly about Section 9..   the key word is &quot;to change Game play&quot;..  not just the EQ software itself.  as Garnola put it, pretty much a simple OS change like direct x 8.1 can violate the EULA. but will Sony ever do anything about that? No, because it doesnt infringe on their investment.<br>
<br>
But do know that using a parser log CAN affect game play if an 'illiterate' player just now realized that a jade mace is better than a rusty mace.  Game play has been affect, by an example, spreading the word to a guild, then a quest or uber mob is severly campped, or a PC market change in economy, and so on and so on.  if one day it makes enuf noise.. and VI gets concerned, only then, within a 'flick of interest' can someone be banned. but for right now.. its not a threat.<br>
<br>
so basically, like someone put it earlier, you're screwed the moment you clicked &quot;I Agree&quot;.  so ANYTHING you do while playing EQ can be a violation if VI see fit to say so (according to their vision). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueqwatcher2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQWatcher2001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/24/02 10:09:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: by the way</span><hr size=1> Actually you're wrong.  The keyword is &quot;to modify the software&quot;, and then &quot;to change game play&quot; is acting on that phrase.  The biggest group of people who think everything violates the EULA is the group that assumes otherwise.<br>
<br>
This is a 3 part if.  The logic goes like this:<br>
<br>
IF AND ONLY IF the program is third party,<br>
AND<br>
IF AND ONLY IF the program modifies the software<br>
AND<br>
IF AND ONLY IF the program changes game play<br>
THEN AND ONLY THEN it is a violation.<br>
<br>
Sure log parsers can &quot;affect game play&quot; in some ways.  They do not modify the software.  Just because someone &quot;feels all utilities affect game play&quot; does not make all utilities a violation of the agreement.  I feel your mom is violating my rights because she's affecting game play.  Well, obviously that argument holds no water, unless you don't understand my rights.<br>
<br>
Like I mentioned above, if someone is wrongly banned and does not receive compensation, they can contact the Dept of Consumer Affairs.  SOE/VI can't ban you for anything they please, it would be horrible for business.  Ever see Seinfeld with the Soup Nazi?  VI has good soup, but if they tell you no soup for you just because you wanted crackers, they won't be getting far.<br>

False.

You have to specifically write something the hard way to either: not be in the table intially, or to remove the entry as it pops up. Any program can check the running object table (which is why Window$ NT will never pass a real C2 compliance check - too many covert channels in the operating system, and the &quot;well it is built on an already compliant core&quot; is the loop hole they use to get around it and maintain existing compliance). With WinNT/2k/XP you can mess with the running object table to hack into and run code you are not allowed to run (with permissions and security and stuff). Any competent systems programmer could tell you all about this. <br>

<br>
as for the example, i was trying to hypothetically view it from SOE/VI standpoint (although not likely to happen). either way, since using a utility that revealed to me a more powerful weapon wasnt caused by an act of modifying the Software.. i guess i didnt hold water there hehe.  and even if it changed the game play, i guess SOE would then try to call it an exploit or &quot;not used as intended&quot; feature or something for them bring the server down for another 3 hours (just trying to be funny here).<br>
<br>
but your example wouldnt be in context here because an act of a third person (my mom or who ever, hehe) or nature even.. would be beyond 'my' control of playing the game and not something that 'i' actively changed in my game play.<br>
<br>
i'll be more straight forward. i personally see nothing wrong with using parsers and i do use them from time to time. it basically extract information from log file (as allowed by SOE/VI) and modify (resorts the data) to be viewed better than what a notepad would do.  this data is not going back into the Software or utilized any further by the Software. to me, it is obvious to me that there is nothing wrong with this.<br>
<br>
i do have a question and i am honestly unsure of... how is EQWatcher or EQAnnounce any different from a log parser? does it modify anything that actually goes back into the Software that effects game play?  if so, should i be warned that this may 'affect' section 9 (even if it is for the good or better).  i realize that this is something that anyone can get by for now using the program.  so lets forget about 'detection' for a sec.. supposed SOE/VI was looking over my shoulder in person hehe.  if someone at SOE/VI went on a power trip... could a user be subjected to being banned? possibly? 0.9%? <br>
<br>
dont get me wrong. from the sound of it, these program seems to function as a great accessiblity option for EQ and i like the idea of it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   so i am going to sit in the 'illiterate' user seat and re-read up more about the program. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uglimwinnettlefoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glimwin Nettlefoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/25/02 12:19:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: by the way</span><hr size=1> Nilikbik,<br>
<br>
  Basically we are ran and sit in the background.  Then EQ is ran.  In game we use various /note commands which make entries in the NOTES.TXT file, or /log on (turn the log command on).  Our programs are watching changes on these files and react accordingly to text that they see in these files.<br>
<br>
  Usually there is some form of sound feedback if not speech that occurs when a condition is met.<br>
<br>
  Say, your invisibility is starting to fade (EQWatcher does this) -- an audible cue happens or it speaks to you notifying you.<br>
<br>
  Lets say you are fighting a mob and want to know some statistics on your damage of the fight.  EQWatcher and EQAnnounce both parse the logs and total it all up.  They would speak the amount of damage you did and possibly a Damage Per Second ratio.<br>
<br>
  EQAnnounce would then dump these stats into a grid which you could copy to say, excel.  I think EQWatcher provides a mechanism to dump the stats to a file, but am not sure.<br>
<br>
  There are some more things they do like allow you to set a timer to go off in X minutes and when it goes off to &quot;speak&quot; something to you which is usually a user-defined message.<br>
<br>
  With EQWatcher's scripting abilities it has a lot more flexibility and recently has come 'canned' with a bunch of turn-key features.  It also allows you to create new scripts should you choose.  EQAnnounce tried to keep all of the scripting stuff from the user and do it all inside the program.<br>
<br>
  There is your *brief* rundown of them.  I am sure I don't do EQWatcher justice, but for more info you should probably check his site. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaidden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Webmaster</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/27/02 12:02:33 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: by the way</span><hr size=1> Just in case you people have forgotten, this is the Safehouse.<br>
