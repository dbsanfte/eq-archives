RZ FOREVER! At low levels it's an all out pk fest where you would have to seclude yourself in a retired exp spot where no one is if you want to wear your full uber gear which you twink yourself without the chance of losing it, unlike SZ where you can get only pp, RZ you can get ITEMS. It advocates PKing more, but if you join the server you will notice that PKs band together. Anti-pks and PVP guilds dominate the server and keep the PKs in check. PKs are considered traveling bandits. PKs do get a GREAT profit out of pking but they lose reputation which in the end can be devastatingly way more costly. most people on our server have PK alts, really depends. At higher levels there are no RACE wars or DIETY wars but GUILD wars and MULTI-GUILD wars, JUST like WORLD WAR 2, there are different alliances of guilds vying for power, political strength, strength over others, control over zones both exp and phat lewt, etc. you want war with a PURPOSE? join Rallos Zek, I've played since beta and after 10 minutes on a CRAPPY CAREBEAR server (blue) I've decided to stay pvp till I die. RZ FOREVAAAAA!<br>
(p.s. if anyone gives you grief on RZ server most people take it as the right to pound your ass to the ground, grouped or not!) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvelaelsoulrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/26/02 12:35:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mmogamers.com/hate/ikonboard/avatars/joe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calling HardCore EQ players, create your own Legends...</span><hr size=1> Sullon was made for the people on the teams servers and Rallos who wanted PvP with no GM interference. Believe it or not, we like killing people, and being killed. This is not a server for everyone, and don't get some gooie eyed picture of how ideal it is. It's a very, very harsh server ... the way we like it. People aren't &quot;griefers&quot; per se, because the goal isn't to cause RL grief, it's to win. If you view losing as grief, then move to another server. If you see it as we see it, simply losing in a video game, then Sullon is for you. You simply cannot take EQ to seriously if you play here.<br>
<br>
EQ is an easy game, anyone who says otherwise really doesn't play much. I leveled to 60 from naked server up with crap gear and losing full xp from all PK deaths with less than 44 days /played. I had my epic 4 months after the server started, I mean come on ... this @#%$ simply isn't difficult. We are here because we wanted the additional challenge that player fighting/interfenence causes. <br>
<br>
Sullon is a fantastic server, with a great, tightly knit community ... if you cannot say that you understand the consequences to coming, don't come over ... we don't need more people upset about how we choose to play. You have tons of other servers for that, leave us in peace in the one we have. If, however, it sounds like a place for you ... by all means join us ... we will bind camp you in celebration <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Sorceror of <a href=http://www.mmogamers.com/hate>Hate</a>

<br>
Well, I read this post during my random trolling of every message board alive, and actually got somewhat inspired. So, I dragged two friends with me.<br>
<br>
We've been evil most of our lives, and in a place (pvp) where you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> need</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to know every corner of your home base, we figured it was the best option.<br>
<br>
It was interesting to &quot;start fresh&quot;. Fishing for spell money. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *grins*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> It still works, believe it or not. I now have a level 5 cleric. My husband has a level 3 rogue. Our other friend has a level 3ish shadowknight. <br>
<br>
I actually got to make patchwork armor for the three of us, and it was a blast. Useful! <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *gasp*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I've always loved tradeskills, and my main does quite a few of them. But on a server like this, where you can't exactly grab an entire guild of level 60's and raid the crap out of everything, people still wear bronze, and are proud of it. People actually hunt in Sol A, Sol B, Najena... I'm not there yet, but I've heard OF it.<br>
<br>
I'd like a bit more information before devoting a lot of time to this though. The &quot;official rules&quot; listing on the EQ site (the sony one, you know what I mean), is a broken link... could anyone help with that?<br>
<br>
Also, from everything I read on the &quot;Sullon Zek at War&quot; boards, it sadly did seem like an 11-year old playground. (No offense to the mature but younger players of EQ of course, god knows I don't want my post about information to turn into a flame!) &quot;Good&quot; seemed to be the most mature team, but you can only have one character on SZ (therefore little twinking), and I like the tailoring and such that I've done already. Admittedly level 5 isn't too late to restart, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *grins*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, but I like that evil controls places like CAZIC THULE! (My all-time favorite hunting spot, taking over all of TR... and I came after Kunark! <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *gasp*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)<br>
<br>
Anyway, to make a long story short:<br>
<br>
Show me some of the plusses to being evil on SZ. <br>
Let me know I haven't wasted a few days here.<br>
There has to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> some</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mature people. <br>
I've met them, they've helped me, but they don't seem to be organized in any way. (Here I'm referring to guilds. Even though that's nowhere near an option at level 5, I don't want to get to level 30 or so to find out that there may be none.)<br>
<br>
Hrm, hope I haven't just completely confused everyone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I suspect rogues are actually more common (percentage wise) on the neutral team than the evil team.  I'm in the most powerful neutral guild, and rogue seems to be pretty close to our most common class.  So in answer to your question I'd say that a non-evil rogue has a very good chance of &quot;making it&quot; on the server on a team other than evil...if that team is neutral at least.  I don't know much about playing good though.  <br>
<br>
In general one thing that is cool about Sullon Zek is that most players here had the high-level game in mind from the beginning, so class balence is really good as compared to other PvP servers where everyone is playing necros and druids.  Also most people here (at least on the neutral team) seem to be much more experienced in the high level game then they were on TZ which is the only other server I've played on.<br>

that don't correspond much to the in-game action.  Just like most<br>
of the web, there is 5% or so of useful information.<br>
<br>
The best part of that board is the Trade board, its the<br>
place to spend time on.<br>
<br>
When in game, PvP is usually silent, fast, deadly.<br>
There is only talk once the encounter is over. Often<br>
congratulatory, sometimes not, but whatever is said<br>
reflects on the person saying it.  Take the posturing<br>
as part of the game. (Just like many sports) And it's mostly<br>
hot air.<br>
<br>
The thing to do is get into a guild quickly. Get lots of<br>
information on the lay of the land. Alot can be learned from<br>
/guildsay.  You need to pool resources in a guild setup.<br>
Find a mid-level guild that is mature, likes to PvP, or<br>
PvE, whatever you like to do most. <br>
<br>
Because of the 1 char/account alot of SZ is lvl 30-60,<br>
so it is alot easier to be lower level now than it was<br>
at the beginning of SZ. <br>
<br>
Level up, once at a higher level, perhaps you might be able<br>
to get into the lvl 50+ guilds.  <br>
But I would caution to enjoy the lower levels though.<br>
Some people level to 35-40 then stop and just PvP,<br>
those are the ideal levels imho.<br>
<br>
Once lvl 50+, player capabilities are so high that PvP<br>
is more group oriented and the solo PvP is tougher because<br>
of resists and other factors.<br>
<br>
(Unless you are a manaburning/lifeburning wizard/necro. =)<br>
BTW, I would suggest that both those skills need longer cast times<br>
and Line of Sight restrictions.  Perhaps even restricted to<br>
NPCs only. )<br>

<br>
I agree with SKeker, ya gotta stop to smell the PvP roses along the way, don't hurry<br>
into the super higher levels.  High end is still mostly about PvE.  Funny enough I am<br>
seeing alot of people rerolling as Wizards,rogues,monks because of their power at pvp/pve.<br>
I wouldn't say that PvP is perfectly balanced, and sometimes ya gotta suck it up when<br>
a wizard manaburns you in one click,  but that can be avoided by knowing who the enemy is<br>
(Kirban/Cappadonna) and thus avoid being ambushed.  The PvP adds an element to the entire<br>
game which normal servers just don't have.<br>
<br>
(Yes on this server people will DELETE a lvl 50+ char and restart at lvl 1 because<br>
of the 1char/account, that's called rerolling.)<br>
<br>
It is fun, a different kind of EQ, give it a try.<br>

All I can say is that we are looking at PvP at this time, no promises on changes or a<br>
                                      time frame for changes.<br>
                                      We are well aware of the situation on Sullon Zek (as well as all of the Zek servers). I<br>
                                      know how hard it is for the goods-newts on Sullon, all I can say is to keep the faith<br>
                                      and hold on, heroes will come to your side. <br>
<br>
                                      If that hero is bred from the player base, or comes in the form of development<br>
                                      assistance, we will find out in the near future.<br>

<br>
&quot;<br>
We have increased the number of character that can be created on an<br>
                             account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team <br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
so I must admit some twinking will happen now,<br>
but it will be less as only 2 other characters are possible<br>
and you can't crossteam on the same account so it<br>
is much better than other PvP servers.<br>
<br>
At least on Sullon Zek you have to pay for the &quot;privilege&quot; to cross team.<br>
<br>
Come and try it out, now you aren't locked into the<br>
same char forever, you can mix it up. We'll hope that it<br>
helps the gameplay on SZ. The economy will certainly<br>
change.<br>

<br>
I play almost excluslively on Firiona Vie, and I love the RP aspect of it (though one might argue that with each day and each patch, it becomes less a roleplay server and more like a &quot;blue&quot;, but I digress...)<br>
<br>
I read the original post and I was inspired to start a character on SZ (the WORST possible day to start your first SZ character, since they just made it so you could have three) since a few friends of mine and I decided to reroll our mains on FV and I'd gotten ahead of them level wise. So I needed something to occupy my time as to let them catch up.  Since I've had bad experiences with &quot;blue&quot; servers, I thought I'd give PvP a try.<br>
<br>
*sidenote*   I'd love to play on a server that crossed the RP aspect of Firiona Vie, with a PvP style server.  Granted, since SZ and FV are the two lowest populated servers, so you'd get even LESS of an audience for a hybrid of the two, more than likely.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;good&quot; rogues go, I didn't see many though I haven't made my way far from GFay yet.  I was definately tempted to start another rogue, but I started thinking about how much time I've already invested into my rogue at the low lvl of 23 in order to keep my skills sharp, and I decided I'd rather die than do that all over again so soon.  Anyhow, I now have a lvl 9 bard on SZ and I've found it like I'd imagine every server is.  You take the good with the bad.  There was ALOT of whining, flaming, etc. which I suppose is inevitable when you have a lot of bored people and give them a /shout channel to play with, but in the short amount of time I've spent there thusfar, I've encountered a few genuinely nice, helpful people.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping that once I'm able to gain some more lvls and start journeying away from GFay area, that the maturity of the players will improve, as that's usually the way it seems on every server I've ever played on.  Regardless, I'm just looking forward to creating huge spec trains and such, and causing havok amongst the &quot;evils&quot;.<br>
<br>
I haven't slept in awhile, so please forgive my ranting.  Goodnight.<br>

He never swung once, He only tried to get away. I was OOM and he had a sliver of health, and I was down to melee (feeble at best). He could have killed me in only a few swings, but he ran and zoned, I followed. He got within range of the freeport guards, VERY small sliver of health, and he shot a guard with an arrow, letting the guard kill him rather than letting me kill him. <br>
<br>
The bastard must of had mucho cash on him, and the little wussy was too scared to lose it. After all, thats what PvP is about. <br>
<br>
So lame jackasses like this ruined it for me. Its like cheating in Counter-Strike basically. <br>
<br>
If it was true PvP, and that guard killing him would not have mattered because he only had like 1HP left, and I got to loot him, then I would say PvP was worth it. Otherwise, Blue is the way to go to avoid the aggrivation of dealing with spoiled little twink brats like this. <br>
