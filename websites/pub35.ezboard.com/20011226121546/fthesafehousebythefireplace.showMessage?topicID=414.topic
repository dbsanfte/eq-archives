<br>
                  Eyeing her cautiously, I nodded. A hood covered her face, revealing only a chin and mouth<br>
                  of obvious middle age. <br>
<br>
                  &quot;I have a task for you, if you are up to it. I can pay you well,&quot; and she plopped a heavy<br>
                  purse on the bar. Eyes turned. Sizing up the situation, and returned to their drinks.<br>
<br>
                  &quot;Tell me of your task,&quot; I said<br>
<br>
                  &quot;Bring me the ivory chest of Sir Azzwyp &amp; I shall reward thee well,&quot; she said. She slid the<br>
                  purse to me and said, &quot;Ten-fold shall be your reward when you put the chest in my hands.&quot;<br>
                  Nothing more.<br>
<br>
                  I found out she had sought the thief Dloc, but reconsidered it. Dloc's name being a bit too<br>
                  well known after his recent raid on a notable Paladin of Freeport.<br>
<br>
                  =====================================================================<br>
<br>
                  The cottage, and more importantly the cottage defenses, were deceiving. The grounds were<br>
                  surrounded by a low wall of limestone. One could literally step over it. But in doing so, an<br>
                  alarm of some sort sounded. Bringing 9 paladins in full armor running. <br>
<br>
                  &quot;Words of warning, or some other spell. Great!&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Worse yet, the pallies weren't giving chase. The held their ground, making sure to not be<br>
                  drawn away from their posts. I hid from them easily, marking their spots and routs.<br>
<br>
                  &quot;Well, there goes plans A and B. No direct approach and no luring the guards away.&quot; I said<br>
                  sourly.<br>
<br>
<br>
                  I attempted to gain access by bringing supplies to sell. And yet I was brusquely turned<br>
                  away.<br>
<br>
                  That left the cliff. The cottage faced the sea on one side. Yet this was no trip to the beach.<br>
                  Nay it sat on a cliff of at least 75 feet, if not more. The sheer face of the wall was<br>
                  deceiving. Though a daunting task, the climb was possible. Not an easy task though. <br>
<br>
                  The house itself was nothing extravagant. <br>
<br>
                  &quot;I've stolen from grander places than this,&quot; I thought to my self. It was a low two-story<br>
                  cottage of earthen walls with oak trim. It was surrounded by flowers and odd statuettes<br>
<br>
                  Inside the house was opulent. Almost decadent. Inlaid wood tables. Finely oppolstered<br>
                  chairs. Pillows and cushions of colors I'd never seen. &quot;Must be a parlor of some sort,&quot; I<br>
                  whispered to myself.<br>
<br>
                  Even at this hour of dark of night, the house was well lit. Crystal sconces holding fine white<br>
                  candles hung on the wall at 5-foot intervals. The room seemed to shimmer in their soft light.<br>
                  Tempting as it was, my &quot;patron&quot; gave specific instructions - take nothing but the box.<br>
<br>
                  'Enough gaping,' I though to myself. 'Those guards are still about.'<br>
<br>
                  I set about my search. The cottage was small enough, nine rooms and an attic, five on the<br>
                  first floor and 3 on a second floor. It should not take too long. Plenty of time before the<br>
                  pallies sweep through the house.<br>
<br>
                  The parlor was clear. Through the arched doorway lay a fine dinning room. Within it lay a<br>
                  massive oak table, with ornately turned legs. Upon the table were 8 settings of shimmering<br>
                  silver. Knives, forks and an assortment of other odd looking utensils. Against the South wall<br>
                  was a large cabinet, carved in a manner to match the table. Quietly, I opened the<br>
                  chambers; yet again I was disappointed to find not what I was looking for. <br>
<br>
                  The kitchen and larder yielded nothing as well. Entering what had to be the den, my hopes<br>
                  rose. <br>
                  'Aye, this is the place,' I silently though. Shelves running from floor to ceiling covered three<br>
                  of the four walls in the small room. Books and books sat on each shelf, leaving not a mote of<br>
                  empty space. A small writing table sat in one corner and a soft, well-used leather chair<br>
                  adorned the other. Next to the chair sat a small shelf with what was undoubtedly a humidor<br>
                  full of fine pipe tobacco. &quot;This I cannot resist! Surely my patron will forgive this small thing.&quot; <br>
<br>
                  I opened the wooden canister. The aroma was euphoric! Lush with latikia and xanthith, it<br>
                  was both flowery and spicy. In my pack it went.<br>
<br>
                  Despite this find, the ivory chest was not to be seen.<br>
<br>
                  Adjacent was a large open room strewn with childrens' playthings. A smile flitted across my<br>
                  face, and I set out for the stairs. Silently I stalked up the stairs. They were wide enough for<br>
                  two to walk abreast, yet I clung to the wall. Reaching their precipice, I paused. The hushed<br>
                  breath of sleep could be heard from three of the four rooms. <br>
<br>
                  I chose the empty room first, knowing that it was the nannies quarters, and she was on the<br>
                  town tonight. An odd place to keep a treasure, yet this mark had proved to be a wily sort. I<br>
                  took nothing for granted. The furniture was plain and sturdy. Yet the craftsmanship of it was<br>
                  unmistakable. The drawers slid silently open to reveal . . . stockings. *sigh* On to the next.<br>
<br>
                  Within the first childrens' room, two boys lay sleeping. The oldest was no more than 10.<br>
                  Their chest rising and falling in time. Their beds were of an odd sort, with one atop another.<br>
                  The legs of the upper bed, that should have rested on the ground rested on the lower bed<br>
                  instead! 'Ingenious', I thought. A thorough search revealed nothing.<br>
                  Finally, to the masters chambers. The large room was encumbered by a sturdy oak framed<br>
                  bed, two chests and a chiffero. Within the bed, the master lay. Next to him a small waif of a<br>
                  lady drowsed. Half his age if that. Her soft smooth features were in stark contrast to his<br>
                  aged and scared body. Moonlight bathed her face, the soft fullness of her breasts, her bare<br>
                  leg that hung over the bed's edge.<br>
<br>
                  Noting the short sword near the master's bedside, I promptly resumed my business. The first<br>
                  chest lay at the far end of the room. It opened easily and quietly, revealing the lady's finery.<br>
                  The second chest and the chiffero held the same. A small closet held the masters clothes as<br>
                  well as more of the lady's. 'Where can this prize be??' <br>
<br>
                  Staring at the draped leg of the lady I caught sight of a mottled white corner. 'Under the<br>
                  bed? Who keeps valuable under their bed?' The sheer contrast of the pallies, traps and spells<br>
                  guarding the house and the hiding of a prize under the bed made me chuckle inwardly.<br>
                  Slowly, I edged toward the case. After checking for traps or other trigger, I began to slide<br>
                  the case out of its &quot;hiding place.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  A slight sniff emitted from the lady. &quot;Mmmf . . . take you . . . yucky . . . pipe elsewhere<br>
                  dear.&quot; She began to rouse! Her eyes snapped open. Dark brown orbs tinted with fear. <br>
<br>
                  Beautiful to behold.<br>
<br>
                  A quick hand to her mouth silenced her gasp. And a blade to her throat told held all motion in<br>
                  check.<br>
<br>
                  Her cheeks became flushed. As red as roses in bloom.<br>
<br>
                  Freight filled her eyes.<br>
<br>
                  I could feel her full lips quiver under my hand.<br>
<br>
                  A quick flick of the wrist and it was done. <br>
<br>
                  No gasp escaped. I held her mouth tight as the lifeblood flowed from her open throat. Fear<br>
                  rose and ebbed within her palpable. Pleading 'no no no make it not so '<br>
<br>
                  The life faded away into nothingness. She lay still.<br>
<br>
                  'No time to loose. Her body will cool and awake her lover.' I slid the long ivory box from under<br>
                  the bed and slinked out. Through the back. down the path. Making sure to keep an eye out<br>
                  for the pallies. &quot;Bastards never slept!&quot; I cursed under my breath.<br>
<br>
                  Over the cliff's edge, and into town.<br>
<br>
<br>
                  My &quot;patron&quot; was joyous at the sight of the chest. She laid out the platinum mirthfully. And<br>
                  her joy rose even high as I told her of what had become of the lady. <br>
<br>
                  &quot;I could not have asked for more!!!&quot; She bellowed laughter as she double the sum she had<br>
                  given me. &quot;Sir Azzwyp lives though.&quot; I nodded &quot;You have done more for my revenge that I<br>
                  had though possible!&quot; My stomach tuned as I recalled the life fading from the frail eyes.<br>
                  &quot;OOOH, what a marvelous thief you are!&quot; Her voice dripped with venom. &quot;His children, do<br>
                  they still live??&quot; She asked eagerly.<br>
<br>
                  &quot;Yes, they live,&quot; I spat, and pored his blood money back on the table. <br>
<br>
                  &quot;What?&quot; She asked. Clearly confused. Yet I replied nothing and simply left him at the table,<br>
                  not looking back.<br>
<br>
                  Outside, I could feel the bile rising in my throat. Blackness filled my eyes as I wretched.<br>
                  &quot;What vileness is this Minz?&quot; I asked myself &quot;What shall you do to undo this black deed.&quot; <p>Minz Elandril<BR>
