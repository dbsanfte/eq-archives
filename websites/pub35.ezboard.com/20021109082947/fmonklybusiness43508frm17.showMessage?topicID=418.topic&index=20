-----<br>
The further fact that Monks got a vague statement of intent (as compared to Mages and Wizards, who were BOTH told EXACTLY how Mid Rods and Mannaburn would be modified), truely demonstayes to me that VI doesn't understand their own game, and that the Dev Team is more interested in making the Game look prettier (Graphics Wise) then they are in fixing the GLARING gameplay and bugh issues that still currently exist to this day for ALL classes.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
I never understood VI's attitude about this either.  It seems like every change they make to the spell system they lay out in excrutiating detail for all to see but whenever they do something to melee we get some vague statement about balance and then have to figure it out for ourselves through extensive log parsing and curve fitting.  I totally agree about the fact that they should have posted what exactly the nerf entailed.<br>
<br>
I won't deny that I did think monk defense was too high relative to warriors, but I also don't want to see it nerfed so bad that you guys can't pull effectively or handle short bursts of aggro if you happen to draw aggro once in awhile.  I don't even have a problem with monks tanking in xp groups but in my opinion a warrior should be noticeably more efficient at it because of our lower DPS.  <br>
<br>
I honestly don't care about the soloing situation.  I can't do it effectively and don't really care if anyone else can.  I do care about group and raid dynamics.  I have seen raids where a monk kept getting aggro and gave up trying to manage aggro and instead just assumed the MT role.  In my opinion this should not be an option for monks.  Warriors don't have the option of assuming a primary damage dealer role, and by the same token the classes in the traditional damage dealing roles should not be able to assume a tanking role without severely affecting mana useage.<br>
<br>
I am not disputing your claim of 30-40% more damage taken but I have seen conflicting reports so I don't think we've really seen enough data yet to tell what they did.  I also wonder if you took the fix of the double logging of misses into account when you got that number.  It wasn't mentioned in the patch so I think most people are not taking it into account.<br>

I disagree.  In order to make is so that a monk tanking would severely affect mana usage you would have to make it so that we took about 30% more damage per second than a warrior.  That is certainly not acceptable under any circumstance.  However, I would like to see warriors take as much DPS as monks do.  This seems to be the case now.  I also think it would be very cool if they made it VERY difficult for a monk to get agro.  Liek someone said, make it so that a block reduces a monk's agro.  A large part of tanking is getting agro.  Reduce a monks ability to get agro and you reduce their ability to tank without severely crippling solo abilities.  And if you ahve a high DPS caster class you will just have to get a plate class to tank for you.<br>
<br>
This would still leave all the things that most monks value (pulling, soloing) viable and make the 'tank' classes needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unkraptor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NKRaptor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 3:18:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not so bad..</span><hr size=1> at least this way, monks even with 1100 ac can aspire to 1400+ ac to actualy make a difference.<br>
and not the case of warriors where htey slam into 1300 preaty easly, and go, oh hey let ditch some of this ac for some hp.<br>
this problem coudl have easly been changed in making ac more effect for higher amounts(from what ive seen, dont flame me if youve seen diff :P).  its just been my personal expereince that warriors can reach higher ac easier(but for time being, choose to lose ac for hp).<br>
varent doesnt want their super bosses to become walks in the park, so they make it that no matter how thick somebodies armor is, a boss will still do on the upper edge of its max damage.<br>
well, taking this view, if you REQUIRE bosses to always do max damage, youve basicaly thrown ac out the window.<br>
letting tanks make sure of their 300 more ac or however much a normal one has over other classes would have increased their tanking.(from what ive seen, monk basicaly has high ac items in every slot to get up into the 1400 area, while warriors have some high ac, and some just for hp).<br>
<br>
if the same situation is in place that a warrior cant take advantage of higher ac, most likely with PoP that even those monks not in the super uber guilds will have ac that gets up there.<br>
<br>
but all that above probably is just crap that isnt super important.  my BIG problem is, now monks REQUIRE ac items.<br>
if epics2.0 are indeed armor epics, then if monk armor ISNT high ac, then its sub par and unusable.<br>
no longer can sacrifice lots of ac slots for hp.<br>
if armor epics are low ac, monks will say they suck and not use them.  if monk armor epics are made with higher usuable ac, i wouldnt be suprised if comments come out of, &quot;why the hell is the 'leather' dodging class so beefed on ac?&quot;<br>
<br>
theyve dug a hole almost, way i see it monks need just as big ac items as other classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucarnagh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnagh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 652<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 4:51:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not so bad..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Sol B - LDCS, light blues vary immensely, one had me using mend another left me at 85%. These used to all go down leaving me between 80-95% life. Dark blues seemed the same as ever, only noticable change was that period before they run where they now smack for alot more in their small old world mob way. Imps - wierd, killed one with 91% life left and another 89%. On the whole over three hours I noticed no change here unless it actually seemed easier. <br>
<br>
KC - Decayed soldiers, no chance anymore. Prisoners still possible but I had to FD and bind a few times. Other light blue mobs hit harder but doable if you want crappy exp.<br>

My AC - 1100 max level 60 so not good. Seems like my EQ days are nearing an end as on GMT soloing keeps me up with my American guild buddies.<br>

<br>
Usually things were more predictable, but now, the monk actually had to use mend a couple times even against a slowed mob with primal essence, focus, and riotous health HP buffs(he's 60, so is shaman), as well as celerity(50% haste spell) and with shiverback sash(31%), while wearing fungi.  Weapon was either my tae ew war maul 2hb or my BORS/adam club combo, same as I always use on those mobs there.  Didn't want to take the chance on shaman heals not landing, so I used mend while shaman was casting heals, or before he got the chance.<br>
<br>
Lord knows what's it's going to be like if I level my guys up and have to fight even tougher mobs.  Monk used to be the perfect duo for shaman, but he just lost quite a bit.  I'm using Kraggs mending on him a lot more now, since otherwise I'll have to keep him torpored much too much, which will slow down the fight more than it should be.  One or two torpor casts didn't hurt my fights much before, but I don't want to wind up using three or more, or I'll have to reapply slow, etc.<br>
<br>
So, the monk is costing me more mana now and is subject to highly unpredictable swings in his health.  I have to be on my toes a lot more than I used to, and hope more than usual that I stay well clear of any bad runs on the random number generator.<br>
