I’m going to try and put things in perspective, even if I get called biased again, for the good of the Assassin community. I won’t even wear my flame retardant suit.<br><br><br>* Unique ability granted: *<br><br>Infiltrators with +453 points can specialize to obtain a 10% to 16.5% boost in general melee damage (but not overall damage) or a rate of +7 damage per second. Access to better styles also adds utility.<br><br>Shadowblades receive +50hp by level 50, resulting in 5% longevity, but it applies to both melee and magic.<br><br>Nightshades have a shout that adds +3 damage per second, with an endurance cost, but has a small utility.<br><br><br>* Stat Damage Effects *<br><br>Infiltrator can start with a 60 stat bonus with a slashing briton, or 65 with thrusting saracen. (+ 5)<br><br>Shadowblades can start with 70 stat bonus with a slashing Norse, or 50 with a kobold. (+/- 0)<br><br>Nightshades can start with a 40 stat bonus with a slashing of any race, or 60 with a thrusting weapon. (- 10)<br><br><br>* Stat CON Effects *<br><br>Infiltrators will have 55 average CON, or –18hp from a base of 60 at level 50<br>(-18hp)<br><br>Shadowblades will have 60 average CON, which is 0 base adjustment<br>(0hp)<br><br>Nightshades will have 40 average CON, which is –74hp from a base of 60. <br>(-74hp)<br><br>In addition to maximum hit points, higher CON also plays a role in reducing damage received in combat.<br><br><br>* Stat QUI Effects *<br><br>Infiltrators will have 60 average QUI, neither decreasing style damage nor increasing rate of attacks.<br><br>Shadowblades will have 60 average QUI, neither decreasing style damage nor increasing rate of attacks.<br><br>Nightsades will have 77.5 average QUI, decreasing style damage, but slightly increasing rate of attacks. (Benefit is that unstyled, Nightshades will attack slightly faster, but styled damage suffers). The additional quickness adds approximately 0.7% chance of evasion at level 50, for a base of 35.7% evade chance.<br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Interruption Analysis Summary &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Unique ability alone, Infiltrators come out on top. Shadowblades bonus hit points almost equals the damage rate of the Nightshade.<br><br>Statwise, Infiltrator stats on average can supply better base bonus to damage, but slight loss in hit points compared to the Shadowblade, almost a fair comparison in stats alone. Nightshades are negatively affected in 2 of 3 areas, having –17.5 STR/CON on average, and it is debateable how beneficial +QUI really is (please don’t use this to ask for a self-buff, ick!)<br><br><br>* Damage Types: *<br><br>Infiltrators can specialize in Thrust or Slash almost equally well (more leaning towards Thrust), through race selection. Thrust for Infiltrators has 5 targets to choose from that have a +15% penalty, and Slash has 2 targets to choose from that have a +15% penalty.<br><br>Shadowblades can specialize in only Slash weapons, but have 2 banks of styles from which to choose from and also adds to 2-handed damage should they opt to use it, with Norse best supporting the bonus damage. Slash for Shadowblades has 3 targets to choose from that have a +15% penalty. IF Shadowblades had Crush, they would have 10 targets to choose form that have a +10% penalty to Crush, and no armor type has bonuses against crush whatsoever. IF Shadowblades had Pierce, they would have 3 targets to choose from that have a +15% penalty (Mercs, Clerics, Minstrels).<br><br>Nightshades can specialize in Thrust or Slash, but will always be at a –20/30 STR disadvantage when choosing Slash, which almost forces all Nightshades to only pick Thrust. Thrust for Nightshades has 8 targets to choose from that have a +15% penalty, and Slash has 3 targets to choose from that have a +15% penalty.<br><br>Damage Type / Style Bank / Non-Style Perks<br>Infiltrator:<br>Slash / Slash / 3 targets<br>Thrust / Thrust / 5 targets<br>Nightshade:<br>Blades / Slash / 3 targets<br>Pierce / Thrust / 8 targets<br>Shadowblade:<br>Sword / Slash / 3 targets / 2-h option<br>Axes / Slash / 3 targets / 2-h option<br>Iff:<br>Hammer/ Crush / 10 targets / 2-h option<br><br>With adding the Shadowblade Iff, just glance at the raw visual quantity of options that gives Shadowblades. 2 damage types with 3 style banks each that have 2-h options, while other realms have 2 damage types and 2 style banks.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Interruption Analysis Summary &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Infiltrators have 2 damage types which each lead to a bank of styles designated for it.<br><br>Nightshades also have 2 damage types which each lead to a bank of styles designated for it, but almost all Nightshades are pierce because 33.3% of blade styles are based off shields and the stat penalty. Nightshades do get the most targets to choose from weak to thrust by +3 targets, but inherent Nightshade weakness versus the class types that wear Chain area reason Nightshades don’t always go after them.<br><br>Shadowblades have 1 damage type, but 2 banks of styles to choose from for it. Each have the additional perk of increasing 2-h damage. (Key note: it is not a liability, for you are not forced to use it and you can still use it when it is beneficial. It is like saying the Nightshade shout is a liability because the damage is poor and it burns endurance, but you are not forced to use it and can use it when it is beneficial)<br><br>This is why I mentioned in another post that it is a bad idea to give Shadowblades Crush. I know what a 2-h Staff can do unspecialized. It only takes a small amount of specialization in hammer points for a 1-h hammer to beat 2-h Staff damage. I still use a Staff to open up against Plate/Archers in combat just for the damage bonus. It would be even scarier the range of targets Shadowblades would get a bonus against. Slash and pierce has +15% and –15% targets, both having more armors that have bouses against both types more than penalties. However when it comes to crush, there are 10 targets which it has a 10% bonus, and all other armor wearers have NO bonuses against crush weapons whatsoever. Upon respec, every Shadowblade would go Crush.<br><br>Possible Flame Bait: I know I can be called a Shadowblade hater in one post, and biased for Shadowblades in another, and what I present here is likely to get me called a SB hater again by all SBs, but trust me that Crush would overpower SBs. A 10% bonus to 10 targets combined with no penalties whatsoever would increase your average damage by +7.5% in relation to Infs/NS that generally have a –2.5-5% when it comes to armor penalties across the board. Thrust does not add anymore targets for Shadowblades as well.<br><br>I’m being objective here and looking out for your future, you will cause a nerf riot when you are perfing all Plate/Scale Wearers (Armsman, Paladin, Hero, Champion, Warden, Druid) at +10% damage, along with 10% bonus damage to Blademasters, Rangers, Bards, and Scouts, and no penalties. Besides, you still do have 2 banks of styles to choose from (styles aren’t the best, so you can petition to fix those), only 3 classes you face are particulary strong against slash, and 2-h options.<br><br>Instead, I ask Shadowblades focus on ways to improve your primary weapon styles and possibly another minor area, then they should focus on Assassin wide issues. Increased bonus points or adding Hammers is overkill. I’ll go over minor areas that can be addressed later on.<br><br><br><br><br>* Styles *<br><br>Infiltrators will generally have more access to styles with bonus points. Dragonfang is the best evade based style in the game. There are no useful DW styles.<br><br>Shadowblade Left Axe uniquely scales 20% better than DW/CD styles (might get fixed in 1.52, as those styles have been proven to be less than 50% as effective as equivalent weapon styles). They are also the best at applying 2 poisons in combat through how Left Axe functions. Doublefrost, albiet nerfed, still brings on the pain when used, just not having the former glory it once had. Shadowblades to have to spend more points into their offhand for this ability, which does sacrifice from some other area. They can also gain a evade-stun 2 chain, but is more difficult to pull off.<br><br>Nightshades will obtain their evade style Diamondback earlier, but is a short duration stun enough to get a free hit in. There are no useful CD styles, let alone the points to spend for them.<br><br><br>Note: If there is any enhancement in a high end Assassin specialization, you cannot say that fix is always biased towards Infiltrators. Part of the envy generated is the feeling that the Infiltrator can have access to a level 50 Dragonfang in Thrust, or easily obtian 50 Envenom, or benefit from all the level 50 styles. Any choice they make will mean sacrificing possible points into one area for another, so their overall benefit is still in that 15% range that I mentioned earlier. For a similar comparison, it is like saying Humans are overpowered in 3rd Edition D&amp;D rules because they get extra skill points and a bonus feat that increases what they have access to, and that any feat added to the game would overpower humans, but the tradeoff is that they do not have any inherent racial bonuses like all the other races do.<br><br><br>* Dual Wield vs Left Axe base scaling *<br><br>I’ve done TONS of testing on this as you probably know, but a patch was released that scaled Left-Axe damage as you increased in level. To what degree, I think MJ is playing hush hush specifically because how much we pick it apart. Knowing Mythic, the acorn doesn’t fall far from the tree, such that it either improves it .25% per level after 20, such that the total bonus goes from 120% to 132.5%, which still has to be determined, which falls short of the 137.5% benefit from Dual Wield.<br><br>I’m not going into the math behind it, but I think 145% is THE fix for the Shadowblades. Instead of just increasing only the left axe component, it increases both by .25% per level. That takes some of the burden away by allowing both primary and offhand weapon to increase damage without having to spend the points into them, for having less points than Infiltrators. That way, Shadowblades don’t need to ask for more points.<br><br><br>* Summary of Fixes *<br><br>Infiltrators are just fine as they are. If there is anything they should be asking for, it might be an analysis of their weapon styles (mostly slash) and dual wield styles. Every other concern is generally an Assassin wide issue.<br><br>Shadowblades, a 12.5% boost to melee damage in the primary I proposed (145% total) along with analysis of your weapon and left axe styles is all that is really needed. That along with the 5% bonus hit points would make you on par with Infiltrators for the benefit they gain with those lost points. Adding more points or adding hammers as a specialization would overpower your class and have tanks and healers screaming bloody nerf. After receiving the melee damage boost, Shadowblades’ primary concerns should be Assassin wise issues.<br><br>Nightshades are proven weaker in melee, hit points, damage taken, style damage/access, or amazing styles to choose from, but do have the most amount of targets that have a thrust penalty. CD styles are terrible of course, but 33.3% of slash is based off Shield, and Pierce has useless long chains that draw out the damage over a longer period of time. Being weaker in Melee damage can be supplement if the Shout base damage was increased to 140, being weaker in defense can be made up for a 175 base nuke, and at most, a new spell. I ask that Nightshades not opt for a self buff to make them artifically fight like Infiltrators and Shadowblades do in melee. It is okay to be weaker toe to toe (some Nightshades out there hate me for saying this), we shouldn’t be clones, as long as there are benefits in different areas for Nightshades to be good at.<br><br><br>Generally my posts analyze a situation and propose fixes. I’m really repeating stuff here that I have always been saying, but I’m trying now to put things in perspective that not all is bad, there’s envy, you can’t have it all, and things aren’t far off from being balanced, and some proposed “fixes” out there are too much. I’m trying to reword things to put it into perspective not to overpower Assassin balance. It is a very delicate thing you have to break down one step at a time and look at how it affects the whole way the class operates. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 6/30/02 2:19:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uubergnome563.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ubergnome563</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/30/02 2:15:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Yeah that looks pretty good.

The benifit of this QuickBlade is that their 2H is potentially useful against a tank too (their tank target pretty much has to use big, slow 2H too).  I've only kinda heard about it, it is certainly NOT mainstream (i.e., you need to hyper-invest in Realm Abilities to even make it work at all.  If they stick with the 2H then they are a 4-spec which means that they can have the points like an Inf does to raise their skills pretty high but greatly sacrifice Enven (i.e., CS 50, Sword 50, Stealth 34, Enven 14).  Most would agree that such a specialized template would be too limiting for normal RvR and therefore don't do it.  There could be one or two out there that are quite successful in VERY limited circumstances (watching 20 targets pass by to pick the 1 perfect one), but perhaps the more classic template of: CS 50, Sword 44, Stealth 36, Env 25 is slightly more versitile as with DF jewel and epic equip you can bring the Enven up to an almost useful level.<br><br>Most people who first play an SB or rival assassin class think the 2H'r is so cool (and they are correct right up until about level 35), but most higher level people agree that the long wep-delay is just not worth it if you are fighting anything other than other 2H'rs (i.e., a polearms man.... personally I'd never fight a polearmsman unless he con'd green/blue to me cause if I don't evade then I'm just gonna get smacked).<br><br>I think most SBs out there just hold the 2H weapon with snare poison on it for running when the fight goes bad (and the long delay is a real nail-biter when you need to run &lt;grin&gt;).<br><br>The other thing the SBs hold the 2H'r for is ganking low con targets, cause the 2H PA move just looks so cool (and the sound effect is pimp too &lt;mwahahaha&gt;).<br><br>Gonna have to try this 2H staff trick for PA on plate wearers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br> <p>Cheers,<BR><BR>Steppin Razor, BORS/Mid [Lvl 40 CritBlade (One-hit-wonder but made of paper in melee)]<BR>Steppin Razor, MLF/Mid [Lvl 24 ShadowZerker (Death-dealing bladed hurricane )]<BR>http://www.geocities.com/nage42/Steppin_Razor.html</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vestige>Vestige</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/30/02 10:17:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ashame this makes perfect sense...</span><hr size=1> hmmm.. still waiting for a response from the SB community...<br><br>which would you rather have..

(since there are many other more desireable options for a class bonus)<br><br>The only issue I see while you factor in numbers and percentages, is the fact that the infiltrator with their spec points can flesh out their character more fully  Have higher specializations accross the board, which of course, equals higher damage.  Curious how you see that extra damage factored in that is unreachable by the other two assasins. For example, the ability they have to bump up their poisons, critical strikes, main weapon, and offhand,  to a much higher degree than both the other assasin classes.  Yes, they have to sacrifice some areas to do so, but on a much less percentage base to max it out.  As an obvious example, for a Shadowblade or Nightshade to max out their envenom it costs them much more,  in other spec lines, in comparison.<br><br>Hence, extra spec points are needed (if we are balancing the assasins against each other, or some need to be taken away)  I dont think NS and SB's should get 2.5, probably more like 2.3.

The Infiltrator's bonus points can be spent to raise Dual Wield to 33%, which adds 6.2% to the overall melee damage. It isn't that high, because the Infiltrator spent it in a specialization with diminished returns. It can range anywhere from a 6% to 28% melee damage bonus for the Infiltrator, so that is why I use 15% as a good figure from which to work with (or +7dps) to get Shadowblades and Nightshades to measure to catch up.<br><br>Even with the above mentioned template, and multiplying the result by x1.05 to account for Shadowblade hit points, Infiltrators still come slightly on top (that is why it could possibly need a 15% boost to both weapons by level 50, but I would wait and see with the effects of 12.5% first). One of the argument to give Shadowblades more points is the utility that Infiltrator can get through added points. Instead, I suggest analyzing the styles you can obtain with your points (34-44 range) and looking to make those worthwhile to add more utility. (For example, longer stun on Frosty Gaze or better damage, or removing the 25 detaunt and returning it to the base of the chain for Atrophy and reserving 25 for another style, or looking at Swords and Axe styles that are redundant). That way, you get the added damage + hit points + utility without having needed any more specialization poitns.<br><br>...and it's okay if LA is slightly less damaging in base damage in DW...<br><br>I never ended up posting the results of the style damage in all my NS vs SB tests because it takes so long to crunch, only to get flamed or misread by board trolls, but this simplifies some of the data collected:<br><br>For the Shadowblade:<br>Garrote adds 75% damage to the primary at 34 + 2 (36) CS, and 34 + 2 (36) Sword<br>Doublefrost adds 175% damage to the primary at 34 + 2 (36) LA<br><br>For the Nightshade:<br>Garrote adds 68% damage to the primary at 50 + 5 (55) CS, and 34 + 3 (37) Pierce<br><br>And my formulas almost proved the way base damage is calculated. Styled damage is still a relative unknown that I'm learning more about, and I've been working with it more lately and testing CS damage caps and such.<br><br>The Nightshade result (yeah, that's me!) had me scratchig my head! How could my Garrote do less damage for having +19 CS ?? (and that was after normalizing damage from resistances) I'm attributing it to Nightshade Quickness effects on damage, since I have a base of +40 QUI than the Shadowblade has, but that's a seperate issue altogether for Nightshades to wrestle with when it comes to their style damage. (My testing basically proved Nightshade base damage to be fairly decent, while something was left to be desired in SB base damage. That was why I proposed base fixes for the damage back then. It was style damage that shocked me because I originally thought my garrotes were returning more damage, but after normalizing for resistances and taking into consideration my +19 CS bonus, it caught me off guard that I did less garrote damage).<br><br>The point of the comparison is that the best use anytime tool available to the Infiltrator is Garrote for 75% added damage. The best tool available for Shadowblades still adds 175% added damage (and this was before the left axe level based scaling boost).<br><br>but Infiltrators get Dragonfang... which is the best evade counter style in the game...<br>but Shadowblades get Doubleforst... which is the most damage use anytime style in the game...<br>but Nightshades get a poor man's Dragonfang (Diamondback), and a 4 chain use anytime combo /snicker<br><br>You can see where I am going with on tradeoffs here when it comes to style. Dragonfang looks awesome, and those extra points make it just as easy to obtain as it does for a Shadowblade to spend 34 points to obtain Left Axe and dish out +175% additional damage, and Infiltrators have nothing like it. It burns endurance, but it does layeth the smack down in 1v1 when it is needed, and is still widely used.<br><br><b>To summarize it all up, my point is:</b><br><br>With the base damage proposal of 12.5% to the primary by level 50, and appx +50hp by level 50, your damage output will be more than fine and in the ballpark of being made up for having less points. If you are looking for added utility that the Infiltrator obtains with those points (ie Dragonfang), no amount of specialization points will ever grant Shadowblades that ability, it simply doesn't exist in Midgard. Instead, focus on the styles you can obtain with your points and look to make them more worthwhile to you. It is very unlikely Mythic will add anymore specialization points for Shadowblades, or any class for that matter. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 7/1/02 3:23:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 7:48:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theblackwatch.biz/Balor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ashame this makes perfect sense...</span><hr size=1> Unfortuantely Elaa, you'll never be listened to.  }:)<br><br>You make to much sense. <p><p><p style="text-align: left; font-size: 80%; font-family: Verdana">Balor Gafdan Nightshade of Guinivere<br><i>What life brings, is it ours to take?.<br>Your pain feeds my soul, feeds my hunger<br>Shadows dance about my tortured being.

In addition to not being able to spec a weapon based on our primary stat, the one we can spec is Slash based, limiting our target selection severely.  At least if we had hte option of a Thrust spec, we can choose who we limit our targets to.  As it stands now, if an SB goes up against a chain wearer, he's suffering multiple negatives, some of which are forced on us.  You have the negative of slashing vs. chain, acceptable, since you chose the target, but we also have the negative of not speccing a weapon based off of a primary stat. (negative compared to the classes that can spec a Primary stat weapon)  We're forced by Mythic to use a weapon based off Strength, that's funny for a Kobold.  Even with Str buffs, I've never gotten my Strength up as high as my Dex, and I wear a lot of +str gear.  We need the option of a Thrust weapon to balance us out with the other Assassin classes.  <br><br>Jus tmy 2 coppers this Monday morning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Gliling Ghostwalker<br>4x Shadowblade<br>Guinevere <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=biabia>Bia Bia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 10:07:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> i agree, that the str/dex thing needs to be looked at. my main is a kobold sb.  thinking back, there is no question that all sb's should be norse, due to higher str.  for an assasin you'd think dex would play the major role, but alas...<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uubergnome563.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ubergnome563</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 12:49:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> There's more to being a high dex / quick class than you may think.<br><br>Usually go around with a sarcean inf (im a brition), I have dodger 5 and he has dodger 4, yet he evades much, much, much more often than me in rvr cause of the quick / dex thing.

What bugs me, is we're the only Assassin class that can't choose a weapon based on our Primary stat.  Hell, the only class in Midgard that gets a Thrust option at all is Hunters.  I'm not a Hundred percent sure, but I believe there are both Slash and Thrust Spears available to them.  This to me says that once again, Midgard is the red-headed step-child of Mythic.  All I'm asking for, is a Thrust based Sword.  Give me a Rapier, Hell, I'll even keep the crappy slash-only Left Axe that I have to spec to get the damage output up to par with an Inf or NS who doesn't spec at all in CD/DW.

It also allows access to more styles,whether or not these styles are effective or not is completely moot. The fact is, the means by which to obtain these styles is provided, as well as the option.<br><br>As we all know, DAoC is a dynamic game. Keeping this in mind, what happens 1,3,6 months from now if/when Mythic decides to overhaul a line we spec in. Upping my base damage isn't going to do me any good IF they revamp the CS line (or any other line for that matter) and one day the 44th and 50th CS styles become more attractive. What then?<br><br>As a SB, even if respec was avaliable, I could not reach either style with a 5 spec template because of LA. At the moment, as things stand, I am a true jack-of-all-trades. I excel at nothing, but am quite decent at everything.<br><br>The other huge problem I'm having, is seeing both NS and Infs posting about &quot;Please don't allow SB's to spec thrust/crush etc.&quot; WHY THE HELL NOT?? Both NS and Infs get to CHOOSE what weapon they want to use. How is it not fair for SB's to want to be able to do the same thing? Especially kobold SB's who are forced into using a 100% STR based weapon.
