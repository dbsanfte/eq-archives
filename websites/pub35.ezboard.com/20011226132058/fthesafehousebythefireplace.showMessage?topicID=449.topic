We the gnomes have regarded you as a traitor and an accomplice to your brother. You shall be put to death once we find you! You cannot hide from us; there is no place in all of Norrath in which you can conceal your petty halfling arse. Are you just going to leave while your brother is executed right in front of hundreds of gnomes tomorrow? I think not. I suggest not interfering in your brother’s process of extermination, for you shall not be treated as well as he was!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tibith chuckled as he watched the stupid gnome yell out into the horizon. Sure his brother Les was to be put to death tomorrow for a crime he didn’t commit, but the young halfling still found it funny that the forces of Ak’Anon had yet to catch him. He had recently escaped  from a horrible jail cell in the depths of Ak’Anon after he and his brother had been charged with murder. They were accused of  assassinating the high wizard Korick Hofoldorf. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His brother was not so lucky when he tried to break from the city. The guards were on their tail and they couldn’t seem to outrun them. Les had tried to duck behind a boulder as the guards ran by but one certain warrior saw him. The gnomes jumped on Les and beat him down with clubs until he was rendered unconscience. Tibith had managed to escape while the guards beat down his brother.  Tibith’s purpose was to now save his brother from the clutches of gnomes who knew not what the truth was.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tibith and Les were traveling on a quest from Rivervale with an intent to see all the cities of Norrath. They had decided that they wanted to visit the great continent of Faydwer first and then make their way back. After they had visited Kaladim, Kelethin, and Felwithe, they set their sites on Ak’Anon. They had heard many rumors of the grand city of clockworks and knew that they would not have many chances to see such a site. While on their way to the city they were passing by the large windmills in the hills of Steamfont. They decided they would go inside one and ask one of the residents about the history of the grand structures. They walked quietly inside and tapped on the door to let their presence known.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hello???&quot; Tibith called, &quot;Anyone home??&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No Answer. Once again they called out. This time, however, there was a different result.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ahhhggggg!!&quot; they heard a gurgling scream come from above. The two halflings scampered upstairs to see what the commotion was. The site they saw was a gruesome one. A horrible looking inkie stood over the bloody body a gnome cloaked in a beautiful looking blue robe. The halflings were stunned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dark elf looked up and growled. He quickly darted across to Les and Tibith,  smearing their hands and clothes with blood. The brothers watched as the evil being jumped out a window and into the hills. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Wha…what just happened?? &quot; Tibith whispered.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;HALT! What is going on here??&quot; a gnome guard shouted. &quot;High wizard Korick dead??? You two drop your weapons and back away. I charge you in the name of Ak’Anon. You shall pay for this!!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The brothers were bound and hauled away without even being given a chance to explain themselves. There was a trial in which the halflings were declared traitors to the gnome race. Since they were both rogues in nature they were easily not liked by the citizens of Ak’Anon.  They were sentenced to death within an hour. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After Tibith has escaped he took refuge in Steamfont. The city guards had searched for days for the elusive young rogue but had yet to find him. Many times they had come close to getting him but each time he got away. Now Tibith was planning on rescuing his brother tomorrow at the execution. He knew not how the gnomes planned on taking Les’ life, but it would not be pretty. Tibith went forth to check out the situation.<br>

There sat Les, his hairy hands and hairy feet tied to a pole. Three warrior gnomes stood a good 15 yards off holding their bows; waiting for the signal to fire. A large crowd stood back behind the warriors, anxiously waiting for justice to be served. The King of Ak’Anon and his servants were sitting too Les’ far right, each watching with patience. <br>
A drumrole began. Tibith reacted quickly; snatching a few throwing daggers out of his satchel he began to run towards the gaurds. A shout from the crowd made just about every gnome head turn in Tibith’s direction, even Les looked. Tibith froze, he knew he was done for. Suddenly the blood in his veins began moving and he started to get his senses back. He ran a few more paces and let fly his first dagger. It struck the first gnome warrior right in the eye; the warrior fell back with a sickening thud. Another dagger flew and another warrior fell. Gnomes everywhere were screaming with panic. The King began to issue out orders to his troops.<br>
&quot;Get him! It’s only one puny halfling! He cannot take out the great might of Ak’Anon!!&quot;<br>
Tibith heard the screams of the king. His mind went blank. He looked over at Les, his face was a look of horror. The final warrior stood in the path of Tibith. Tibith readied his final throwing dagger, he let it soar at the warrior. The gnome was quick though; he dodged nimbly to the side and let the dagger fly past; right into Les’ neck. Les died with a gurgling scream. The commotion stopped.. Tibith didn’t know what to do. He had slain his brother, his brother was dead. He immediately fled from the site and made his way back to his home of Rivervale. The gnomes decided not to give chase, as they had got what they wanted. The king did vow, however, that is that halfling ever returned he would slain on the spot.<br>

What was he going to do? His brother was dead and HE had killed him. How would explain to his parents what had happened? He stopped next to a grand oak tree, panting and crying. He looked at his surroundings. Everywhere he looked there were trees, trees and more trees. Greater Faydark was such a beautiful place. He decided that he would stop at Kelethin , city in the trees, and then make his way back to his homeland. He knew he must tell his parents all that has happened since they left almost three months ago.<br>
 He pulled off his satchel and dug through the contents. He quickly found what he was looking for, food. He hadn’t eaten all day and he was starving. He sat eating and thinking about his brother. He choked back tears while he choked down his food. He took a swig of water to wash and down and then he put all of his things back into the satchel. He threw it on his back and set off for Kelethin.<br>
<br>
<br>
It didn’t take long for Tibith to reach the city of Kelethin, home of the wood elves and a few half-elves. Tibith loved the city among the trees. The lift ride was always fun and most of the residents were fairly kind. He always had to be on the lookout for Orcs though, as they could pop up just about anywhere. He walked around a bit and then stopped in a shop to load up on supplies. He hadn’t planned on staying long in the city so he hurried over to the lift and took it down. He was about to rush off when he heard someone call out to him.<br>
&quot;Hey mate, where ya heading in such a hurry? Off to help slay some of those disgusting greenies eh?&quot;<br>
Tibith looked around for the caller of the voice. He saw a wood elf sitting near one of the lifts. The wood elf was glorious looking. He was dressed in a magnificent blue armor and carried a perilous looking sword accompanied by a dagger. Tibith replied a little nervously.<br>
&quot;Uhh…I was just returning to my homeland Rivervale, sir.&quot; <br>
&quot;Rivervale eh? Well I was thinking of heading to Qeynos. You look kind of lonely, mind if I join ya for the trip?&quot; the wood elf stood up and shouldered his backpack.<br>
Tibith replied with excitement, &quot;I’d mighty obliged if you did sir! I sure do hate to travel alone. My name is Tibith.&quot;<br>
&quot;Frishock Julesetter here, but ya can call me Frish&quot; he replied.<br>
&quot;Please to meet ya Frish, shall we make out departure?&quot; Tibith readied himself.<br>
&quot;One sec little sir,&quot; Frish pulled out a very nice looking mandoline and began to play. He started to chant some curious sounding words that Tibith couldn’t understand. Soon a blue light began to encircle the two. Tibith felt his legs tighten a bit. They soon loosened out and felt so much lighter.<br>
&quot;What did you do to me???&quot; Tibith questioned.<br>
&quot;Hehe, it’ll just loosen your legs a little, boy. Lets get moving. Oh by the way, if you don’t like to travel alone, why are you out here all by yourself?&quot; Frish questioned.<br>
Tibith related his tale to Frish as the two set out into the depths of Faydark. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/udrakc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drakc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/11/00 11:01:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> Not a bad story, do keep writing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=398.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=44.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=449.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=449.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=449.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=449.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
