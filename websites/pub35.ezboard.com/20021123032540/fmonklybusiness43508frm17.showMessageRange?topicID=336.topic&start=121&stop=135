Since I haven't even made any claims myself regarding warrior damage it just shows that you are a pair of ill mannered trolls.<br>
<br>
Then again, being able to look up the name of a disc on castersrealm sure does make you the monk experts eh?<br>
<br>
<br>
Regarding people claiming warriors and monks do the same damage with the same gear, that is ludicrous. However the claim I have been reading here is that good warrior gear is quite simply cheaper and more available than good monk gear. <br>
<br>
Since I havent had to equip a warrior I dont know if this is true or not, I do know that if I sold or transferred my droppable stuff I could probably equip a warrior that could solo pretty well.<br>

Wychway is indeed correct.  Our DPS is much greater than that of anyone other than Rogues and HIGH AAs Rangers with a good bow.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some numbers taken from Dagarn the Destroyer fight....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Defendant (using Khasek's Katar and FoL + shovel of harvest at end of fight) - Monk<br>
DPS - 49.95<br>
<br>
Ssoulz (using simple Tstaff 29/30)  - Monk<br>
DPS - 48.23<br>
<br>
Limbua (using simple Tstaff) - Monk<br>
DPS - 47.96<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Katsuo - Rogue<br>
DPS - 56.07<br>
<br>
Them - Rogue<br>
DPS - 59.58<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Calas (using twisted bastard sword - 52/46 or something close)  - Warrior  <br>
DPS - 35.54  (was in Def disc for last 1/4 of fight)<br>
<br>
Getten (using epics) - Warrior<br>
DPS - 24.53  (was in Def disc for 1/4 of the fight)<br>
<br>
Rokosj (using 10/18 or better weapons) - Warrior<br>
DPS - 27.04 (was not in Def disc)<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
Now normally, Calas gets fairly close to a nonuber weapon monk's DPS when he is not in defensive but the difference is all in the weapon.  Even with 52/46 2hs he uses vs. 29/30 tstaff I was using, I would still just barely outdamage him when even when not in defensive.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Damage<br>
Rogue &gt;&gt; monk &gt;&gt;&gt; warrior<br>
<br>
Tanking<br>
Warrior &gt; monk &gt;&gt;&gt; rogue<br>
<br>
That is about a correct comparison.<br>
<br>
<br>

I'm not sure if it's a complete inversion of /disc defensive, but the priniciple is the same. Increase dmg output for 3 minutes while also increasing damage you take.  Also, /disc precision increases the chance to hit for 3 minutes with the same penalty as /aggressive.<br>
<br>
The problem is that it seems every warrior is always dreaming non stop of the next chance to hit /defensive. It's a huge crutch and since it's overpowered, many warriors are reluctant to blow their disc on anything else. I've seen warriors who will most likely not take damage the entire night except for riposte/enrage never use any of their offensive disciplines. <br>
<br>
Now if you're a warrior that is going to be the MA in a particular encounter, then you'd be a fool not to save your disc for /defensive. Unfortunately, many of the warriors out there *could* increase their dps significantly for 30 percent of the time by using another discipline. It's like the monks who aren't pulling on a raid saving their /disc for stonestance or voidance when there's no way in hell they're going to be pulling or rampage tanks. Now, our offensive discs aren't nearly as good as a warriors, so I guess it's not really a big deal if a monk goes a whole night without using /disc once, but the principle is still the same. <br>
<br>
Along the same line of reasoning, I continue to be amazed by the number of tanks who don't make an effort to move behind the mob. Again, I think it comes from that ingrained &quot;center of attention&quot; thing that defensive only emphasized, that makes plate melee feel like they need to be right in the face of the mob. /shrug<br>
<br>
I'm certainly not an expert on warrior disciplines and I'm not going to make any claims that warriors do the same dmg as monks. I do feel confident though that *many* warriors really gimp themselves in both their choices of /disc and gear when it comes to raiding and soloing. If you are not one of the top few warriors in your guild, you don't need to be so hung up on aggro all the time. Get a damaging weapon and use it when you're standing behind the mob like all the rest of us. I see warriors all the time who are so hung up on finding an aggro/hate proccing weapon that they give up a great deal in dps because they refuse to use weapons with no proc or low aggro damage procs.  When you aren't going to be using defensive, try using an offensive discipline.  When you want to solo, get a freaking fungi like every other high level melee that wants to solo and use your invigorate bp for downtime, or better yet try to use some  bandages.<br>
<br>
You see, for a long time, monks have been gearing themselves for both roles and we could alternate between them. When I'm pulling, my dps is the furthest thing from my mind. I'm using a shield. I'm loaded up on ac/hp gear and I'm getting all the ac/hp/regen buffs I can get. When I'm just one of the pack on the ass of the mob, I switch out some gear and beg for atk buffs and attempt to max out my damage.  That being said, no monk in our guild ever tanks, period, unless people are dead.  If more warriors would try to be more adaptable and not have tunnel vision when it comes to defensive, defensive, defensive, I think they could do a much better job at making themselves happy.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pokiri>Pokiri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 9:12:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monk role?

Yes monks, warriors have some of the worst DPS in the game, why, because a tank knows hes not there to do damage, he equips himself to hold aggro any way he can, this means aggro procs (Slows, stuns, dots, debuffs, Enraging blow), usually at the cost of DPS, <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
... and conversely, if a warrior equips themselves for damage, they get very close to monk DPS, especially pre-ST/NToV. I've got parses that show it with different weapons, if I can get my spouse to go that last level to 60 I'll show you how close a 60 warrior gets to a 61 monk with the same weapon (like oh, tae ew war maul, amy staff, or shovel) and haste item.<br>
<br>
As for offensive discs, warriors have much better discs than monks do. We have innerflame (4x bonus 12s/26 min), hundredfists (~30% haste 15s/27min) and the pathetic discs of thunderkick (single kick/3.5 min), silentfist (single strike/6 min) and ashenhand (single strike/71 min).<br>
<br>
Warriors have charge (no miss 14 sec/23 min), mighty strike (crits 10s/54 min), precision (3 min/27 min), fell strike (4x bonus 12s/28 min), and aggressive (3 min/27min). Notice, all discs last LONGER. Like enough to actually affect DPS. Both aggressive and precision are good discs, and would be used a heck of a lot if monks had them. If you hadn't noticed, we already tank like rangers at the 60 and &lt;20aa point, so we'd certainly use them.<br>
<br>
There's no denying that monks do great damage at the highest levels (post-primal especially), but to overlook that monks need help at the middle levels just isn't fair. We're not hybrids of rogues and warriors, for god's sake, we should have a clear role - either pulling, or damage, and we should be GOOD at them. The mitigation nerf has severely impacted the pulling role, and the pre-primal damage is way too close to warriors for anyone to call it balanced. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wychway>Wychway</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 9:25:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=125>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Castersrealm</span><hr size=1> Has nothing to do with this.

In the intrests of putting this thread back on its rails, I would like to offer what I see. I see monks still pulling effectively when FD is needed to split. I still see monks dealing great damage in a fight. I've even seen monks tanking rampage post-nerf. Soloing is not your, or anyone's role really. It's just what to do if you can't find a group. And I still see a large number of monks running around the same exp areas, soloing.<br>

Having said that, some warrior is probably going to come here &amp; say how they use aggressive on every fight.  Well, good for you.  No good warriors I know do.<br>
<br>
I use one maybe two discs ever.  Normally I save my disc for defensive becuause I am generally the MA or SA.  If I think it is going to be a fast Trak style fight I'll use fellstrike, or if the mob is 1 or 2 pct health &amp; the MA is doing fine.  The one time I tried using aggressive I got my ass handed to me because I generated too much agro.<br>
<br>
As for weapons, I use my wavecrasher/frostbringer in 99% of all fights.  Even when I am not MA I have to stay high on the agro list in order to quickly take over should the MA die (I don't yet have AE taunt).  Also, for rampaging mobs, I like to stay high on the hate list so I eat the rampages instead of the clerics.<br>
<br>
Positioning:  We wall just about everything.  In order to keep the MA from having to continually flip the mob, we position a fair number of plate class melees in front of the mob.  That means eating a few ripostes.  If a warrior is aggressive &amp; eats what would normally be a 900 dmg riposte its going to be more like 1300.  That means not only are you a mana sponge, you will die if you are already low on health.<br>
<br>
A warrior's role is almost never DPS, so making arguments about them passing monks as melee DPS is foolish. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6347">Baron Draxus Diablus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Now think how hard it would be to keep aggro off of a warrior doing a monks DPS. Well no aggro lowering skills for the warrior to use. Only things they can do is turn attack off for long periods of time and grab some chanter spell, and then they will still get hit as well. <br>
<br>
So why should a warrior worry about getting hit? Aren't they suppose to want aggro anyway? Lets take a mob you are fighting and let it hit for and additional 40% , not just max hit 40% more often, but every hit doing 40% more damage than normal. How fast you would die under that condition when you cannot FD, evade or jolt, and you are unable use a /disc for another 25 minutes?<br>
<br>

<br>
Draxus, as I said, any warrior who is likely to tank would be foolish to blow a disc on anything but defensive. You still didn't explain what the other 8 warriors on your raid are thinking though. I think though that what you imply is just what I referred to as the self imposed albatross around your collective necks.  It seems *all* warriors, not just the MA or SA, seem to think that the spotlight is suddenly going to swing around to them as the 9th tank and they're going to need defensive. <br>
<br>
I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that warrior taunt is lacking a bit of oomph, but do you really think it's necessary to keep a bunch of tanks in front of the mob? If the true goal is to avoid the mob turning back and forth, I would think the monks doing insane dps would be placed shoulder to shoulder with the MA since they're so much more likely to draw aggro and flip the mob.  <br>
<br>
If warriors and knights really do have such crappy dps (melee or otherwise), wouldn't it be largely irrelevant where they stood since they can't draw aggro off a monk anyway without using taunt?  Ahh. But perhaps, just perhaps, it's the warriors who refuse to put away their aggro generating weapons in a situation where they *don't* want aggro that are making the mob flip. So, tell the rest of your tank squad to put away the wavecrasher and the frosty in that situation and whip out some superior primary hand damage weapons like Ornate Sword of the General, CBoL or Seb Croaking Dirk.  All of which are comparably priced or cheaper or easily done by a reasonable near 60's guild Hell, that 44/44 Savage Axe of Dismay seems pretty nice or the Rubicite Staff.  Both fairly cheap and not likely to flip the mob.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I'd like to understand why everyone should worry about aggro except the non-MT plate classes? Sounds to me like they're just lazy. Too lazy to switch to a more damaging combo. Too lazy to switch to non aggro weapons. Too lazy to move behind the mob. Too lazy to use any discipline other than defensive.   Clearly, this wouldn't apply to you since you are your guild's MA, but what about the rest of them?<br>

I'd really like to know so that I don't sit there watching tanks  hammer away at the front of the mob and scratching my head wondering why they aren't playing smart and moving with the rest of us as the MA positions.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pokiri>Pokiri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 11:43:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=129>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monk role?

Quite correct... but neither is pulling without tanking. When you pull, you are in a lot of cases solo tanking it for 10-30 seconds. Okay, so monks can't solo, but the mitigation change definitely impacted pulling.<br>
<br>

<br>
No offense, but right now there is no riskier role than the monk pulling. Just imagine a druid with FD pulling, and you'll get what I mean. I'm not sure how long my pulling will last, I'll probably switch to my SK for that - which I don't want to do because my monk's my baby, the character I've played for 3+ years. Also, you really don't need FD pulling in a lot of situations that people do it in, you just need knowledge of pathing/aggro and a few tricks - which is another reason why SKs are going to dominate pulling. When one stun/failed FD means death, it's just not viable.<br>

<br>
That's what the monk world looks like at the moment. See what the problem is? Unless you have 4000+ unbuffed HPs, not the 2700-ish most 60 monks have, you can't take a hit for 900-ish - because you die by ripostes/low health aggro before you can FD. Monks with that kind of gear are basically permanently aggressive warriors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wychway>Wychway</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/25/02 12:10:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *snicker*</span><hr size=1> I have to wonder that too. Get behind the damned thing you momos! Not only do we do more damage there, we take a little less premature damage too. Clerics hate nothing more than when a tank's turn comes and he's already down 40% from taking riposte. They generally end up a splat fast.<br>
<br>
For the record, I spend enough time behind a mob to feel like a rogue if I'm not tanking or taking rampage and I have a nice DPS 2hander. Fungal + regrowth take care of the occasional 'oops' in aggro (which I often survive) and most AE damage. ... I should probably post this on our own board. ;)<br>
<br>
The reasoning behind not using an offensive discipline is the 'rule' that you will need to use a defensive disc about half way or so through the recycle time and end up becomming a splat because it was not available. I swear, VI has this hard-coded in there somewhere. :D<br>

Monk and Warrior weapon skill caps are identical until Level 43.<br>

<br>
&quot;Compare monk weapons commonly available pre-50 to warriors commonly available pre-50. Monks are comprable or slightly better.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not on my server. On my server, Monk weapon prices are jacked ridiculously high, while a Warrior can get a weapon for 500pp that will get you to Level 60.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Pre-50s, the higher atk rating and the higher weapon skills put monk damage above warrior.&quot;<br>
<br>
Warriors start with higher Offense skill caps (though Monks eventually do catch up, and surpass Warriors at Level 40). Furthermore, almost all Warrior races start with higher STR. Consequently, Warriors have higher ATK ratings until the mid 40s. They also have Critical Hits.<br>
<br>
Monks on the other hand have better special attacks at Level 5+, and higher caps on Dual Wield at all levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the final analysis, Warriors and Monks have comparable damage output until the mid 40s. After that, Monks finally begin to outdamage Warriors.<br>

so you mostly are all sure about warriors doing monk damage at any level, parse it and prove it.

I just sat here and read 80 minutes of mostly bullshit...!<br>
<br>
It all comes down to this... Varent is inept and choose the least likly scenario of nerfing a Monk instead of just adding weight to items.<br>
<br>
My lvl 55 Monk fighting Light Blue (lvl 3<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Lava Beetles use to get hit in the 30's, 40's and occasinal 50's.  And win out with 90% life remaining.<br>
<br>
Today I got hit for 80's, 90's and 101 &amp; 102 dmg.  I was left with exactly 50% life......!<br>
<br>
I have lost approx 40% of my melee ability in small group situations...  and i have a Quest cloak with AC+15 <br>
NOT THE UBER AC+60 legs that Verant thinks EVERy monk is wearing.<br>
<br>
The made a nerf cause they didnt like what 10% of the Monks were doing and hurt ALL of them but the top 5%...<br>

Warriors aren't out damaging monks (there are a few exceptional..erm.. exceptions - about as many as monks out tanking warriors pre-nerf ironically enough. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
BUT, with the mitigation nerf they are closer to monks in damage than they should be (relative to monk current LACK of defence), or perhaps monks are further away from rogues in damage than they should be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Simple solutions would be, increase monk avoidance and leave damage alone, or increase monk damage a bit, or undo mitigation nref and give warriors a mitigation bonus.<br>
