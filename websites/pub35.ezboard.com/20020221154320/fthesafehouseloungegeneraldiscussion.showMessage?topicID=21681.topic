However, we'll gladly have anyone, of any class or race (yes, even those pointy elves) who wish to join in on our discussions.  Be wary though, as we've got a habit of converting new comers to the dark side. *grin*<br><br>Its important to remember while visiting our humble establishment that while discussion is most certainly not limited to rogues and rogue matters that the Safehouse is a rogue meeting place.<br><br>So the views expressed will primarily those of rogues.  This is meant not to scare away potential posters, but to clear up a misconception that we're a general board.  Make no mistake though, we value the input and opinions of <i>all</i> our posters.  Anyone is welcome here.<br><br>As a result of this, we have quite a bit of diversity, and many different ways of looking at things.  This makes it important that everyone be on an even playing field.<br><br>At the Safehouse we do our best to make sure everyone can be heard, and to see to it that everyone gets their fair shot.  We know that with a community of this size, that it can be intimidating for new, and even old members to join in at times.<br><br>Its important to us that you do feel welcome while visiting and that you don't hesitate to contribute to our community.<br>After all, you guys are what make us what we are.<br><br>Its also important to know that we do not give preferential treatment to anyone.  You can be the leader of one of the most powerful guilds, or you could have just fallen to the wrath of a bixie, it doesn't matter.<br><br>We don't see you in game, and the majority of us never will.  We judge you instead on the role you take in the community, no matter what level you are or what guild you're affiliated with.<br><br>A great step towards becoming an esteemed poster is following our forum rules.  They're pretty reasonable, really and are there for your benefit.<br><br><p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><b>General rules:</b></font></p><br>      <ul><br>        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">First and foremost, the Safehouse is frequented by people of all ages.  Please keep this in mind when posting links as we don't allow links to pornographic material and the like.</font></li><br><br>        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">We ask that you show your fellow posters the same respect which you would have them show you.  We do not allow personal attacks on our forums (this includes personal attacks against guilds).  Debate ideas, not the people behind them.</font></li><br><br>        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">Please post new topics in the correct forum.  You can find descriptions under each forum on the main page.  Nobody is perfect though and we realize mistakes will be made.  in such cases we will move posts to the correct forum and forget it ever happened, just don't make a habit of it.</font></li><br><br>        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">As stated earlier, this is a family board, so we have a language filter turned on to filter out profanity.

They are as follows:<br><br> -   Signatures and personal pictures may be no larger than 15kb combined.  Many users do not have the benefit of a cable or DSL connection.<br><br> -   Please only post your signature one time per thread.  This isn't to reduce load times as the image is already in your cache, but to keep the clutter down and the threads looking neat.<br><br> -   Simply uncheck the "Include custom signature" box when posting more than once in a thread. <br><br> -   Please keep your sig dimensions at or below standard banner size.  We don't have an exact size set for this, just use your best<br>  judgment.<br><br> -   Please do not use Java signatures<br><br> -   Don't post "test sigs", use the "Preview" checkbox to see how it looks.</ul><br><br> </font></li><br> </ul><br><br><br><br>As in any large group of people, there will always be a few who break the rules.  It isn't one of our favorite things to do, but we (The Safehouse staff) are often forced to discipline<br>individuals.  <br><br>Our disciplinary "table" so to speak, is as follows:<br><br><ul><li>First offense - Minor Infraction:<br>Reminder to follow rules, nothing big.  For matters such as this more often than not it was just a mistake and never happens again.</li><br><br><li>First offense - Major Infraction / Repeated offense of minor infraction:<br>Official warning.  This means you have your one and only warning for a period of time and that there has been a post about you in the administration forum advising the rest of the staff of the incident.</li><br><br><li>Second offense - Major Infraction / Continued offense of minor infraction:<br>One week ban.  Your posting privileges are revoked for one week, during which time your behavior will be reviewed.</li><br><br><li>Third offense - Major Infraction / Continued offense of minor infraction: Permanent<br>  ban.  Posting privileges permanently removed.  This doesn't happen often and they are rarely lifted.  This isn't something we take lightly</li><br><br><br>For the most part things run pretty smoothly.  We do have to intervene occasionally<br>  though.  When such happenings occur the problem will be taken care of by a member of our Safehouse staff.<br><br>There are two levels of staff members.  Moderators, and Administrators.  Their individual<br>  powers are as follows:<br><br><ul>(Please note the following are the technical powers each has.  All Safehouse staff members have the ability to issue warnings and call for or make bans.)<br><br>Moderators:<br>Have the ability to move, lock, edit, stick and delete topics.<br><br>Administrators:<br>All of the moderator abilities + can ban users and make layout/technical changes to board.</ul><br><br>With that said, here is a list of our staff and E-mail addresses we can be reached at if you have any further questions, or concerns.<br><br><ul><br><b>Administrators:</b><br> <p><br>Glip - <a href="mailto:Glip@thesafehouse.org">Glip@thesafehouse.org</a><br>Vaslin - <a href="mailto:Vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin@thesafehouse.org</a><br>Fiae - <a href="mailto:Fiae@thesafehouse.org">Fiae@thesafehouse.org</a><br>Aidden - <a href="mailto:Aidden@thesafehouse.org">Aidden@thesafehouse.org</a> </p><br><p><br><br><b>Moderators:</b><br> </p><br><p><br>Shadowcross - <a href="mailto:Shadowcross@thesafehouse.org">Shadowcross@thesafehouse.org</a><br>Fricka - <a href="mailto:Fricka@thesafehouse.org">Fricka@thesafehouse.org</a><br>Tibis - <a href="mailto:Tibis@thesafehouse.org">Tibis@thesafehouse.org</a><br>Gyorg - <a href="mailto:Gyorg@thesafehouse.org">Gyorg@thesafehouse.org</a></p><br><p> </p><br></ul><br><br><br><br>  <p><br>Thanks for your time, </p><br>  <p><br>The Safehouse Staff</p><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uglipthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glip the Gnome</A> at: 2/14/02 5:23:17 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=21681.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=21681.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=21681.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=21681.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21681.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21681.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
