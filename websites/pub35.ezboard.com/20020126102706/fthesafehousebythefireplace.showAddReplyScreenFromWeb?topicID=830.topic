Kodami crept into the bedroll and looked over at  Vaghris, pondering whether or not she should offer the bedroll to him.  She was about to ask when he said, “No, you get it, I can bare going without.  I’m warm enough in these wools.”  Which was a total lie as he felt a chill run through him, from his feet all the way to the nape of his neck.  She sat there and watched him finally go to sleep after shifting into various positions.  She felt sorry for him, for what she did to his back and that he had to sleep against a cold rock.  After awhile of looking at him, his bluish skin seemed to blend in with the rocks around him.  The only way she could see where his face was was to look for the white of his long hair.  When the fire went out, he seemed to curl up into a ball, trying to warm himself.  Kodami got up, forcibly uncurled Vaghris, laid the bedroll next to him and rolled him into it after taking off his chain mail tunic.  She took off his woolen shirt too, thinking on how much it must hurt the wounds on his back to have it scratched constantly.  She buttoned up the bedroll and slide in with him, facing away from him, and put his arm around her waist so she could be close to him.<br>
<br>
    Vaghris awoke to the feel of silk touching his chest.  It was so soft and warm, it felt strange.  He thought he was dreaming, for he also thought he could see himself next to the wall where he had fallen asleep.  He had remembered that he had fallen asleep on that wall and that he had put Kodami in the bedroll.  He stretched for a moment and rubbed the sleep from his eyes.  He found that he wasn’t asleep when he pricked his finger on his bared sword.  He sucked on his finger for a moment and stretched some more.  He also found that his bedroll had gotten considerably smaller since the last time he had slept in it.  He didn’t care at the moment and was moving his arm up from his leg inside his bedroll when his fingers brushed bare flesh.<br>
    <br>
     Kodami awoke in an instant, and thinking he had woken her by accident, he moved his hand behind his leg.  She reached behind him and gently grabbed his hand and moved it back to where it had brushed up against.  In the dim light of the rising sun, Vaghris saw Kodami bite her lower lip.  Vaghris moved his hand up her body, under the silken shirt, to her stomach where he held it.  He could feel the heat rising off of her; soaking into his chest as she pressed her back into it; his hand absorbing some from her tight abdomen.  But she grabbed his hand once more and moved it down.  Past her midriff, past her hips.<br>
<br>
  When at last she let loose a gasping scream of pleasure, she turned about and kissed him openly and fully.  Only the sound of oncoming footsteps stopped them as she showered him with kisses.  A man of medium size was walking toward the cave, occasionally glancing at the ground, and soon they could hear him whistling a fine tune of, “Legions of Teir’Dal.” <br>
“Well well well, what would YOU two be doing this early in the morning ehhh?”  a sly voice came forth.<br>
Vaghris turned his head to look at the stranger was.  Coming at the absolute worst time possible, Adden came walking over the rocky terrain toward them both.  <br>
“Good to see you made it out of the Commons alive, Adden,” Vaghris said back, putting his head next to Kodami’s to look her in the eyes for a moment.  After that, the tracker stayed silent, looking off into the lands every so often.  <br>
“Who are you looking for?” Vaghris asked.<br>
“Another one of your friends, he he,” Adden smirked.<br>
As if his words were a signal, a voice full of contempt anger came bubbling up the mountain side.<br>
“ADDEN!! ADDEN!!! Damn it, where are you?!  Come here, I need you to lift me over this particularly large rock so I can ROAST YOU!!” a small angry voice said from a short distance off.<br>
Vaghris looked at Adden with a worried look and mouthed, “NO…” to him.  Adden just sat there and nodded his head and his smirked widened. Centin….<br>
Vaghris immediately whispered into Kodami’s ear to get up and get dressed before the other got in the cave, no telling when he would hear the end of this if Centin saw them like this.  Just as Kodami got out of the bag and Vaghris put his tattered night robe on, Centin came leaping over the small outcropping of rocks surrounding the cave entrance.<br>
“HAR!!! Who is this fine young lady?  A poor woman you held up for money and stole more than that by the looks of it,” the small gnome gave an evil smile at Vaghris.  Vaghris gave a flat, cold stare toward Adden, who just shrugged his shoulders and smiled back.  <br>
“Hrm… quite a set o’ legs this one has… mmm… well if nothing else Vag, you’ve got good taste in women…. HAR!!” the old gnome hoped down from the rocks and entered the cave, his black robe trailing somewhat behind him.  <br>
The only retort Vaghris could think of was, “Go back to your Ogre spear wife,” but it had been a while since he had last seen his old friend, Centin.  Instead he moved to grab his cloak and then put it around Kodami, who was trying her best not to blush at the peevish gnome.  <br>
“Oh it’s been too long Vaghris, how old are you now? 270? 280? Its so hard to remember anymore…” Centin said with feigned sarcasm.<br>
“ Oh you don’t remember ehhh?  Well I just had my 321st name day thank you…” Vaghris said with equal sarcasm.  <br>
“Ok, now I get it, she is part of the entertainment/name day present ehhh? Ooh ooh, when do I get  a turn?!” Adden said suddenly. <br>
Kodami sauntered over to Adden, acting as seductive as possible.  Adden had the look of victory on his face.  All until she reached him.  She brushed the side of his face with her fingertips and stared him in the eyes.  Adden could hardly contain himself.  He reached in close for a kiss and she kneed him in the groin so hard he collapsed on the ground, rolling around in excruciating pain.  Both Vaghris and Centin looked at each other for a moment and then burst out in a howling laughter.  Kodami just stood next to Vaghris and started to snicker softly to herself.<br>
<br>
   After helping Adden back onto his feet, Vaghris had time to talk to his old friends while Kodami dressed behind some rocks.<br>
“So how did you get away?  I thought that they would be on top of us in minutes…”Vaghris said to the pair.<br>
“Easy,” Adden said, “we lead them into Kithicor Woods, where I met Centin, who was blasting the snot out o’ some orcs there.”<br>
“Yes, quite easy when they sit there all day, staring at each other.  I swear that they’d never miss any of the orcs I slew, they be so dumb…” Centin trailed off.<br>
“Well, I AM surprised that Centin was able to kill of a whole host of Dervish, him being one man.. well half of one anyways….”Vaghris jested.<br>
“Yeah well, I thought the Dervs had us until General V’Ghara lead several sorties against the horde o’ Dervs.  Totally sent them into disarray.  Last I saw, the Dervish folk where still runnin’ through the hills.” said Adden.<br>
  General V’Ghara had been one of the best Generals in the Neriak military.  He had disappeared suddenly to become a mercenary, for hire to the highest bidder.<br>
<br>
  Kodami came around the corner, clad in her armor, yet still wearing Vaghris’ silken tunic under her plate.  Vaghris, thinking he should do the same, went back into the cave and grabbed all his pieces and started putting them on in a somewhat orderly fashion.  He swallowed a scream as his chain mail tunic scraped and scratched his wounds on his back furiously.  He packed up his woolen night cloths and the bedroll and shifted everything outside.  Putting his hair back into a ponytail, he walked back outside where he saw that Centin had Kodami in his sights and was diving in for the kill.<br>
“..nah, you don’t want a child like Vaghris.  You need a real man…like for instants me…” Centin pondered what to say next.<br>
“No, I am fairly content with Vaghris.  And if your height has anything to say about the rest of you, he’s more of a man than you’ll ever be.” Kodami said, holding back a smile.<br>
Centin’s hopes of getting in good with Kodami suddenly got drop kicked into oblivion.<br>
“Besides, I love him.  He treats me fair and sweetly.  He is helping me at the cost of his life.  I can’t deny him that.” Kodami said sadly, staring at the ground.  It was at this point where Vaghris stumbled on some rocks as he heard this, crashing into Adden, nearly knocking him over.  Kodami saw this, and started to blush a deep red.<br>
“He he,  ummm… well… who’s up for a walk in the wilderness?” Vaghris said, suddenly embarrassed.<br>
Vaghris talked with Adden a bit more, explaining why he was needed and what they were hoping to find.  Adden replied, “If it’s some all powerful necromancer, his power can be traced.  But not by me.  I track animals and people.  These things leave marks in the wilderness, marks that can be traced along a path.  If magics are involved, talk to a magician or wizard, I cannot help.”  So then Vaghris talked to Centin.<br>
<br>
“Listen, we have been friends a long while, but this I simply cannot do.  Not only am I but a learner in the ways of the magi but I also like the possibility of living for another 400 years or so.  You always seem to turn up trouble wherever you seem to flip over a stone.  I’m sorry for the girl, but I’m not the one you seek.” Centin said as he looked over at Kodami for reference. Suddenly, Centin looked out into a rocky outcropping.  He sat there for a moment, just staring.<br>
“What is it? Something there that really isn’t?” Vaghris said to the gnome.<br>
“Something is coming, and whatever it is, it is expending massive amounts of manalergical energy to get here.” Centin said without breaking the stare.  A blue aura seemed to congeal in that area and the party hid behind some rocks, not knowing what would happen next.  The blue aura shifted and turned into a tangible thing of reality, creating a rift of energy.  A small man in a blue robe could be seen in the distance of the portal.  Kodami crept out, hiding behind the portal, waiting for the being to show itself.<br>
<br>
  After a moment, the rift closed and a Dark Elf stood there.  Kodami rushed the wizard, expecting to slam into him and put a dagger to his throat.  The wizard was powerful indeed.  He had erected a barrier of energy around himself that shielded him from the attacks of the physical world.  Kodami simply bounced off the magical wall of force and landed in Vaghris arms who moved to catch her when he saw she was falling.  <br>
“Nice to see you too, Vaghris.” Zackrin said as he dusted some dirt off his robes.<br>
“Zackrin?  Well that’s something new… I thought you could only teleport to where the ancient wizard spires lay?” Vaghris said as he helped Kodami back to her feet.<br>
“I’ve been doing some research in my off time in Rathe Mountains.”  the wizard said back.<br>
<br>
   Kodami suddenly fell to her knees, clutching her temples.<br>
“No…NO!! I DON’T SERVE YOU ANYMORE!! LEAVE ME BE!!!” she screamed.<br>
Zackrin was holding the side of a rock for support, looking as if he were about to topple over the side of the mountain.  He was grabbing his temples as well, trying to get whatever was plaguing him out of his head.<br>
An image appeared betwixt the group.  A large figure, a lizard man by the looks of it.  The figure stood there, shrouded in black, seeming to be real, but translucent all at the same time.  <br>
“You ssshall never be rid of me, woman.  I am your true massster, this male ssshall not control what isss mine.” the figure said.<br>
“What in the name of the seven hells are you?” Centin said through all the confusion.<br>
“You don’t know of me?  That figuresss, sssuch a weak little raccce would hardy know true power if it bit them.  I am Ssshu’It’Rben, an Iksssar, a necromancccer ,a sssuperior  race to that of yoursss,” the lizard hissed. <br>
“Go bugger yourself,” Adden said.<br>
 All the while, Kodami was still writhing on the ground, Adden and Vaghris both at her sides.  Adden brought out his strangely shaped long axe called Wurmslayer while Vaghris unsheathed Ragebringer.  They both stood in a defensive stance around Kodami, moving to protect her.  The Iksar walked toward them, and with a flick of his hand, a force sent Adden flying into a cliff side a few meters away.  Vaghris stood alone, trying to get up the courage to rush the being, yet failing to do so seeing the power of the beast.  Shu’It’Rben moved to grab Kodami, but Vaghris slashed at his wrist with a crisp strike.  Shu’It’Rben seemed to be incorporeal, the image where his wrist was fading slightly and appearing again with no apparent damage done.<br>
<br>
  Shu’It’Rben looked up at Vaghris and smiled a scaly grin.  He brought his hand up from his side and made a fist.  Suddenly, Vaghris felt as if he was being crushed from all sides at once.  The Iksar lift his clenched fist into the air and Vaghris floated upward several inches.  He turned his other hand flat and pushed and Vaghris flew back into a wall, breaking his shoulder against the hard stone.  Vaghris screamed in pain as he felt his ribs starting to give way to the pressure being exerted on them.  Shu’It’Rben grabbed Kodami by the wrist, by which point she had been totally lost in fear for Vaghris and Adden. <br>
“You will be coming with me, Kodami,” the Iksar said to her, “and asss for you, Vaghrisss, thiss isss for attempting to corrupt what isss rightfully mine.”  The Iksar balled his hands into fists and raised them into the air.  Vaghris turned horizontally and was slammed into the ground and held there by the same force that was crushing him against the wall.<br>
<br>
  The beast was about to step back into the ethereal planes with Kodami when Zackrin completed a chant he began when the being stepped into this plane of existence.  “By the power of the Sixteen Gods of Norrath and the energy they have granted me, I banish you back to the place of your dwelling!!” Zackrin finished the last verse of the spell.  Light streamed from his hands into the image of the Iksar.  Shu’It’Rben hissed loudly and turned away from the party, the image fading as he returned to where he cast the spell.   Zackrin leaned back up against the rock he had been near before, his mental energies expended.  Adden got to his feet, complaining of a ringing in his head.  Centin was gone, run down the mountain side after being told off by the Iksar.  Kodami sat there in complete silence from what had just taken place.  Vaghris was far worse off then them all.  His shoulder was shattered, four of his ribs had snapped like twigs in a maelstrom and his body was shivering from the shock from the power sent through his frame.  He tried to move, but the pain was too great.  He sat there, wanting to die from the amount of pain he was feeling.  Tears started to form beneath his half closed eyes.  It hurt too much to breathe.  The group noticed that Vaghris had not gotten up.  Adden reached Vaghris first and tried to help him up by grabbing the arm of his shattered shoulder and lifting upward.  Vaghris screamed in tormented anger and kicked at his friend.  Kodami rushed over to Vaghris’ side after a moment of clearing her head of what happened.  She helped Adden lift Vaghris up by the waist and carry him down the cliff side at where Adden had tied the horses he had brought with himself.  Each step and each shift in his weight sent daggers of pain and torment through Vaghris.  Kodami kissed him on the cheek, promising the pain will be gone soon enough.  Though to Vaghris, it seemed like an eternity before they reached the horses.  <br>
<br>
   Before mounting, Vaghris had his shoulder and arm splinted and his ribs supported by his cloak wrapped about his abdomen.  After that he mount with as much pain as he expected and took a long swallow from a wine skin that was at his side.  The alcohol slowly released into his blood and his pain started to subside.  <br>
<br>
  They rode at a medium pace toward Neriak, toward the nearest healer.  At the entrance to Nektulos forest, another gnome sat there repacking bandages and separating reagents for various spells.  Zackrin noticed at once the chain about his neck, signifying that he was a cleric, a healer.  The black link that hung nearest his heart was a sign that he worshipped Bertoxxulous, the @#%$ of Plague and Corruption.  Adden rushed up to him on his horse and pleaded for assistance with his friend who was in dire need of the healing abilities he could offer.  The little gnome seemed offended at first, but after talking and haggling for a moment, the gnome walked over to Vaghris with his pack full of medical appropriations.  Adden told the group that his name was Samsys, a Cleric from Ak’Anon, that he was shunned by his own people so he came here to practice his magics and skills.  Vaghris slide of the horse and walked over toward a spot the little gnome had placed a laid a small blanket. <br>
“Lay here and don’t speak,” Samsys said to him as he gathered various things he needed.  Vaghris did as he was commanded, his body shrieking in protest from the pain that shot through it.  He grimaced a bit and Kodami was at his side again, holding his hand against her cheek to let him know she was still there for him.  Vaghris closed his eyes.  Samsys waddled back over and placed his hands over Vaghris shoulder and ribcage.  “Brinn’iy cigradcro imbolinua…” he chanted.  Vaghris felt nothing, better nor worse.  But after a moment the chanting grew faster and louder.  Vaghris’ bones began to shift and mend themselves, and with this his bones began to pop and crack as they did shift back into alignment.  Each pop and crack was more painful than the last, soon, tears began to form around the rims of Vaghris’ eyes.  Samsys ended his chants, and told Vaghris to stand and move about some.  Doubtful, Vaghris slowly rose, his sides and shoulder sore but not anywhere near the amount of pain was ripping through him.  He moved to his feet and twisted his back some, feeling the soreness of a good days workout in his back and sides.  He threw a quick jab in the air with his previously injured arm, and a fiery lance of pain shot through him like a sword through butter.  He gasped and held his arm for a few moments.<br>
“The ribs were easy to fix, just minor cracking and a few fractures.  The shoulder was something else entirely.  You’ll have to rest for sometime before it will be back to it’s old self again.” Samsys said packing up items again.  Kodami slid her arm around Vaghris and pulled him into a hug.  She kissed him, very pleased that he was ok.  “I love you, Vaghris,” she said after a moment of embracing.<br>
“I know,” Vaghris said into her ear.<br>
She looked at him as if he had hurt her somehow.  <br>
“I love you too,” he said after looking at her with the utmost loving expression he could muster in his current state.  They kissed again and realized how late it was in the day.<br>
“How long was I out for?” Vaghris said to Samsys.<br>
“Several hours, M’Lord.  The process took a great deal of time to complete.  I don’t know what you tangled with to get so grievously injured but it really messed you up bad.  Try not to piss anything bigger than you off next time.” The gnome started to waddle away from them as he said this.  For some strange reason, the party felt that their paths would cross that gnome again.  <br>
<br>
  Adden helped unpack everything that the group would need for the night: bedrolls, food, clothing, etc.  Zackrin sat down for awhile in deep meditation, trying to trace where such enormous power could be emanating from.  Kodami sat near a moss covered tree and munched on some of the rabbit that Adden had brought with him.  Vaghris rested near a spot that he used to play around when he was a child.  Everything was set for the nights stay in Nektulos forest.<br>
<br>
  After some time, Zackrin came out of his thoughts and started to practice some rudimentary spells on some of the local wildlife and himself.  Some things he cast on, such as the enchanted corpses of Skeletons, simply disintegrated.  Others, well, best not describe what happened to the Kodiak that wandered by.  After some practice, Zackrin set forth to cast a warding spell that would protect the grounds that the party slept on for the night.  Many perilous things wandered throughout the forest and to be caught unawares would mean death out here.  Adden took a small hike to a trader’s post where he bought some more provisions and haggled with the merchant on the recent news of the area.  Nothing new really, a few of the Halflings had been sighted looting people left and right.  Soon, Vaghris got up and started up a kinesthetic routine that took him through various evading moves and striking positions.  He still had the splint on his shoulder, but it had loosened much since he had started.  He bounded off of trees into the air, doing a few flips, and landed on one foot like he weighed nothing at all.  He then started to practice unarmed combat techniques.  Striking at the air as if was a threat to him, he moved with grace and fluidity.  He had removed his tunic to allow him more mobility in his exercises; a fine sheen of sweat glistened from his chest and brow as he suddenly dematerialized.  He reappeared and disappeared several times in rapid succession, each time he showed up he was in a new striking position.  He attempted a back handspring, pushing off with his bad arm to try and train it to work with the rest of his body.  A faint grimace of pain shot through his face, but that only made him train faster and harder.  He de- and rematerialized with greater speed than Kodami could ever handle.  He seemed to float in the air at some points in his leaps.  Be bounced from tree to tree as if gravity had no effect on him.   Each move seemed to flow perfectly into the next flurry of moves and positions.  Sometimes he would stand as still as a statue for minutes on end, waiting for something.  Then, in a flash, he would disappear again, to continue training his body into perfection.  Kodami was watching with great interest and soon Adden and even Zackrin came to watch what was going on with Vaghris.<br>
<br>
   Vaghris slip off of one of the tree branches and fell a great distance to the ground.  Kodami cried out as he hit the ground and Adden started to move toward the cloud of dust where he had landed.  When the dust had cleared, Vaghris stood there, with his back toward them, bleeding from various cuts and scrapes he had across his body.  He walked over to his belt and picked up his sword.  Vaghris walked back to the tree he had fallen off of and stood there for a long while staring at its trunk.  Kodami wondered what he was doing when all of the sudden, he made a lightning quick stroke that brought the blade across the truck of the tree but didn’t really seem to touch it at all.  Vaghris spun around to face his audience and then kicked backwards into the tree trunk.  The tree then proceeded to topple over, barely missing Vaghris bad shoulder or hitting it, the group couldn’t tell.  Vaghris started walking toward the group and continued walking past them toward another tree.  He broke into a run and offset himself from the base of the tree.  He rammed the tree with his bad shoulder, and upon impact, Kodami heard a loud pop come from his shoulder.  Vaghris stood there and rotated his bad arm in several different directions.  Kodami ran to him.<br>
“What did you do that for?! That cleric said to be easy on yourself…” she said in a worried tone.<br>
“I had to pop it back into place or it would hurt a great deal more if I went to bed with a dislocated shoulder,” he said lovingly back to her.  <br>
“Those were some pretty slick moves their Vag.  Why couldn’t you use those on that necromancer?” Adden suggested.<br>
“Very simple.  I can use the moves but unless he responds to what I do, I am just setting myself up for something.  He had to make the first move.  I couldn’t react until he did.  Then he shattered my shoulder and crack my ribs so I figured, hey, I’ll just lay down for a bit.” Vaghris said with a wry look on his face.<br>
Zackrin came up from behind him, “Good work. I’m surprised to see you so active after such and undertaking of punishment,” he said before slapping Vaghris on his back.  Vaghris stiffened from the blow, then leaned up against a tree, a tear streaking down his face. <br>
“Training doesn’t come without costs.” He said as he wiped the tear from his face with his fore arm.  By that time it was late and the campfire was well blazing.  Adden came by Vaghris’ bedroll and handed him a small package.  Vaghris looked at Adden with some anxiety but he opened it.  Be pulled out a black silken evening tunic, matching the one Kodami was still wearing.  He thanked his friend kindly and stood to put in on.  The feeling to have the silk touch his battered and beaten body was so great he nearly started to cry.  He was about to lay down in his bedroll when he opened the top of it and saw a pair of gleaming eyes looking back at him.  Totally surprised, Vaghris attempted to stand, but a hand came whipping out of the bag, snatching him by the ankle.  With a small yelp Vaghris fell back onto the ground.  Another hand came out and started to pull him under.  Vaghris was starting to think a bit more, “Ummm…should I be worried at all?”  The hands moved up his legs as they dragged him slowly into his bag, with him kicking every so often to try to free himself, but that proved useless as the hands had an iron grip on him.  They grabbed his waist, pulling still down.  Vaghris was starting to worry a bit more thinking it could be a trick of that necromancer’s and he was playing right into it.  He took a breath to raise a shout to his friends but he was dragged down faster and a hand released his waist but instead clamped down on his mouth.  He attempted a scream to his friends but a voice crept into his ear, “Shhhhh….don’t speak.  Just lay here with me.”   Suddenly, Kodami was staring him right in the face.<br>
“Bloody…seven hells woman! You had me thinking I was being dragged into hell or something of the sort…” Vaghris trailed off.  She kissed his temple and placed her hand on his bad shoulder soothingly.<br>
“I just don’t like being spied on by your friends when I get in this thing that’s all and I figured I could play a little prank while I’m at it. Tee he he.”  Kodami said with a smile.  She laid her head back down and they fell asleep like that, in each others arms.<br>
<br>
  The next morning, Vaghris awoke to a small wolf sniffing his face.  He looked up at the strange feeling, and, seeing the wolf, was somewhat startled.  He smiled at the wolf who was panting right back at him.  He reached a hand out and scratched the wolf behind his ears and he trotted off, content in his petting.  Vaghris laid his head back down and kissed Kodami’s shoulder and nearly instantaneously fell back asleep.  <br>
<br>
   He awoke again at the shaking of his bag.  Kodami was nearly dressed and the others were almost packed.  He sat up and immediately felt the pain in his limbs from his workout the previous day.  Despite the pain, he got out of bed.  After getting dressed, washing out his mouth with some of his special cleaning solution and eating a hearty breakfast, they set out on horses, following Zackrin, who hadn’t said a word all morning.  They crossed the open fields of the Common Lands and saw the fallen folk from the Dervish host that had ravaged the country side nights before.  They went through a cave lined with torches that guided them to the Northern Desert of Ro.  Before entering the desert, Zackrin paid homage to his patron @#%$, Solusek Ro.  He burned the corpse of a rattlesnake, which thrived throughout the desert.  Upon asking why he had done that, he answered, “If we respect the beings that live here and the snake sacrifices itself for us, then we shall be granted safe passage, without excessive heat or burns.”  True enough, the wizard led the group through the desert with no trouble.  They met a small gnome standing before a hole riddled dock making silly pirate noises with his comrades, Vaghris was debating whether a conversation would be amusing or just another headache.  He thought the later and the group pressed on through the Oasis of Marr.  <br>
<br>
“Here we must watch for the spectres from the ancient elven city that once dwelt here.” Zackrin said to the group. Vaghris nodded in agreement.  He had had his fill of the spirit world for a bit.  Many different things could be seen in the oasis.  Crocodiles and caimans were the dominating species of the area.  A few orc settlements had been based around the edges of the oasis.  Soon the group encountered yet another one of the inhabitants of the oasis.<br>
<br>
   A sand giant walked toward them with a hungry look on his face.  Adden drew sword and spear, Vaghris pulled in front of Kodami with his horse and drew Ragebringer and his war sword.  Zackrin simply raised his hand, telling the group not to worry.<br>
   <br>
    With his hands, Zackrin gestured in several different ways.  He started to chant something that was only a whisper.  The clouds of the area darkened and energy gathered around Zackrin’s hands.  The giant stopped, totally amazed by this feat of magic.  Zackrin raised his hands and flung his wrists out and a blazing ball of energy shot out from his hands, striking the giant in the chest.  The giant fell, a smoking crater where his chest had been.  A loud rumble could be heard for miles as his body landed in the sand.  Zackrin smiled slightly and turned his horse about.  From that point on, nothing bothered us in the sands.<br>
<br>
  Still, the group followed Zackrin, following his mind to the place where he had traced the dark magi as generated.  They passed through the Southern Desert of Ro before stopping for the night.  The sun had already set and the heat of the desert was fading.  The wind had started to pick up a bit and it was starting to get chilly outside.  Zackrin went off again to meditate on where this power was and Adden built a fire.  Vaghris and Kodami laid in the sand, under the enormous moon.  He laid out his cloak and they both laid there and told each other secrets of their lives.  Kodami rolled over Vaghris to straddle him and laid her head on his chest.  Vaghris had a burning question he had to ask but couldn’t find the courage to do it.  She looked him right in the eye and he started to ask it…<br>
   “Kodami…ummm…will you…I mean after this is all over…uhhh… will you…” Vaghris started to stutter a bit, but he finally got it out, “will you marry me?”<br>
Kodami raised her head and looked at him in total shock.  She started to cry a bit and Vaghris raised a hand to wipe the tears away.  “It’s ok, I’ll understand if you say no…” he started to say, but she stopped him in mid sentence. <br>
“Vaghris,” she kissed him lightly, “of course I will.”  Vaghris hugged her tightly and she responded with another kiss.  He produced a platinum ring which he had gotten off of the giant Zackrin blew apart.  The thing had practically landed in his lap.  He slipped it on her finger and she gasped, looking at the ring with some amazement.  “Why did you do it Vag?  Why?” she finally asked.<br>
“Do what?” he replied.<br>
“Love me and then go and do this,” she whispered back.<br>
“You are the first person to totally stop me in my tracks and make me think about what I am doing and who I am doing it to.” Vaghris said back.  “What about you?”<br>
“Me? Well it was my first time looking upon another males face besides that of my family.  And I have to say that your quite easy to look at,” she let a wry smile cross her face as she tossed her head to the other side, “if you really want to know, it’s those red eyes, there is something about them that just melts me whenever I catch you looking at me.  And there was something that came from you in your room that night that felt like piety and sympathy that I have never felt from anyone before.”<br>
<br>
  They fell asleep that night with the cloak wrapped about them under the moon lit night.  The next morning, they both awoke to Adden kicking Vaghris’ feet telling him to hurry whatever he was doing under there up or he would have to toss a bucket of water on them.  Embarrassed, they both got up and packed up their belongings and set out for the last stretch in the trek, or so Zackrin confessed.  Mounting their horses, they marched through the rest of the desert and came into a small wooded area where a small path lead them through a swamp into a small cave called Guk by the locals.  Vaghris had had several visions of Shu’It’Rben over the last few nights and had some choice words to say when he met him again.  The frogloks at the entrance didn’t seem to care about they entering the cave.  <br>
<br>
   Soon, the place started to get darker and the creatures that dwelt there started to get bigger and harder to avoid.  Zackrin closed his eyes and told them to follow him no matter what they saw or heard, that he would show them the correct way.  They did as he bid and they found a tower that literally crawled with the dead.  The walls itself seemed to be made out of skin and the bricks below it were made from the bodies of the slain people that once lived in this ancient city.  <br>
“Vaghris, this is gettin’ pretty creepy man.  Lets hurry this up some so I can get out of here,” Adden said with apparent anxiety. <br>
A small tangle with the guards ensued their arrival to the tower, but Vaghris and Kodami simply killed them in a single blow each.  They entered the tower with little trouble after that.  They followed Zackrin throughout what seemed to be the whole tower before coming to a great door.  Not guarded, not protected by traps, nothing of the sort out of the ordinary other than it was a creepy looking door.  The small sound of an organ could be heard through the door.  Adden went up to the door and it creaked open before he got his hand out to push it open.  They walked for a bit, following the stained and faded red carpet that lined the hall.  Each step they took, the organ grew louder and boomed in the surrounding passages.  Kodami had her spear at the ready, Adden had Wurmslayer out, and Zackrin began to concentrate on his next spell.  Vaghris pulled Ragebringer and his war sword out from his belt.  They came about a corner and what they all saw amazed them.<br>
<br>
   The organ was monstrous in size.  It took up the whole wall, which was a good seventy meters tall.  Each of the organ pipes were ornately decorated with pictures of death and the various victims of Shu’It’Rben.  To the left of the organ, a hallway with a whole line of cells could be seen.  People were packed into these cells and simply stood there, awaiting the call of their master.<br>
<br>
   Shu’It’Rben himself, sat on a small bench close to the organ keys.  His head bobbed and his hands moved across the keys with extreme precision.  After hitting a note that lasted a few seconds, he stood and whirled around.<br>
Power and evil filled his eyes as he floated into the air and walked toward the group.  Everyone got into various fighting stances, knowing this was the last stand.  All except for Zackrin, who stood staring at the Iksar.  “It’s not him,” he said finally.<br>
With that, Adden flew from his stance into a bronze statue.  The image before us faded and Shu’It’Rben was standing right behind us.  With a hiss he let loose a bolt of energy that Zackrin dispelled immediately.  Vaghris hissed back and lunged for him.  His blades almost touched the necromancer before sliding off in a different directions as a barrier of force protected him from harm.  Vaghris and Kodami continued to hack at the necromancer in vain, though he seemed only content with Zackrin at the moment.  Spells flashed back and forth, both having to dispel the energy and prep for another one.  It was a total battle of the minds.  Adden got back up and ran over to the cells where the prisoners were being held.  If they died, they would die setting these people free.  He released a lock and the cells opened.  The people looked like they got jolted by something and started looking about in confusion.  Adden took the nearest prisoner and started to guide the small group of people out of the tower, into the swamp.  Adden took off at full speed with the group of people, all wanting to leave as quickly as possible before their master saw them.  Adden waved at Vaghris and took off down the hallway, never to enter that hall again.  He safely led the people and their children outside, avoiding the guards and the frogloks of the area. He led them as far as Oasis before stopping.<br>
<br>
   The others were in trouble.  Zackrin was mentally being broken down spell by spell and the necromancer showed no sign of fatigue.  Finally, Zackrin said, “I’m sorry Vaghris, I failed you.” He threw his fist forward and the air erupted in the blue light of a portal.  He leapt through it and closed it behind him before the next spell could reach him.  The Iksar turned to Kodami and clenched his fist.  She screamed and was pinned against the wall by the force that nearly crushed Vaghris.  Vaghris lunged again for Shu’It’Rben but the Iksar caught him in mid air.  Vaghris kicked at him, discovering that the barrier of force was gone.  Vaghris tried to slash at him but he was being held too far away by the necromancer.  He tried to break free of the grip the Iksar had on him but the lizard man was far stronger than he looked.  Shu’It’Rben pulled a wicked looking dagger from his robes and held it right over Vaghris’ heart. Just a little closer….<br>
Mere inches away from slashing at the beast and ending it all.  The Iksar set him on the ground but still held him steady where he was; Vaghris still couldn’t get closer and that dagger was still held to his heart.<br>
“You are a fool to think you can beat me, Dark Elf.  I alwaysss knew you were a weaker raccce.” He spat at the rogue. <br>
<br>
  Kodami was still struggling against the bonds of force that held her to the wall, she could see her old master holding Vaghris back and he couldn’t strike at him from that distance. Just a little bit closer…<br>
Vaghris looked over at Kodami; pain and fear filled his eyes.  He lowered his head as if defeated.<br>
“No…no Vaghris don’t do it, please…” Kodami started to whisper, tears filling her eyes.<br>
<br>
“You think I can’t beat you ehhh?” Vaghris said suddenly.<br>
“You haven’t got a chanccce.” Snarled the Iksar<br>
“…..for Kodami…”  Vaghris replied.<br>
   At that moment, the Iksar brought his head back in amazement.  Vaghris pushed off one final time and struck Shu’It’Rben straight through the middle of his forehead.  The dagger Shu’It’Rben was holding impaled Vaghris through the heart, tearing easily through the chain mail with all the power of the beast behind the blow.  The Iksar lurched back, for a moment, looked at Vaghris and collapsed to the ground in a heap.  Vaghris stood there for a second with the dagger protruding from his chest, wavering each time his heart beat.  He too, slumped to his knees.  Kodami was free of the force that held her back, and she rushed over to where Vaghris had collapsed.<br>
“Funny… my shoulder hurts worse than this does,” he said as he pointed at the dagger.<br>
“Sweet fool…” Kodami said as she held him there in the necromancer’s chambers.<br>
A portal opened in front of them and Centin, the dirty old gnome, stepped out from the blue rift and screamed, “Come on! Get him up!  Come through the portal!!”  She did just that.  She threw one of Vaghris’ arms around her neck and help him threw the portal.<br>
<br>
  On the other side, they met up with Zackrin, Adden, Kodami’s family, and Centin.  Vaghris, unable to support his own weight, fell to the ground with a slight thud.  As he laid there on his back, preparing for death, Kodami held his hand, tears streaming from her eyes.<br>
“No….you can’t leave me…you promised you wouldn’t hurt me….you were to marry me…” She cried into his chest.  He reached up and pulled the dagger from his heart, and, with a yell of anger, flung it into the waters of the oasis.  He coughed and blood was in his mouth.<br>
“Be…b.be with your family, Kodami,” he said between coughs, “just promise me that you’ll n…ne…never forget me and that I…I..I did this for you…..” as he said this, his fingers slipped through hers and he let his last breath of life escape him.  His head rolled to the side, his eyes closed.  Blood still ran from the wound in his chest, but his heart no longer beat in time with hers.<br>
“No, Vaghris wake up, please wake up.  I don’t want to lose you…” she said grabbing his hand again.  <br>
<br>
   Adden and Zackrin helped her up from his body and each gave her a long embrace telling her that he was gone.  Her family came forward in all the commotion and was waiting for Kodami.  She told them that she was going with Vaghris’ friends to see him properly buried and to fulfill a promise.  They accepted this after long embraces themselves, and headed back to the desert where their village lay.<br>
<br>
   Adden and Zackrin made a stretcher out of a blanket and some branches of the local trees and hung it between the horses.  They wrapped the body of Lord Vaghris Bloodreaver, The Lightning Count, and the Lord of Hell, in his own heavy cloak and placed him in the stretcher for the trek home.  They made a flag of mourning which hung from the side of the stretcher; black against white with a red slash in between.  Many travels saw the flag, some bowed their heads, others knelt in prayer.  <br>
<br>
  The ride to Neriak was  a quiet one.  No one seemed to speak at all and at night Kodami’s bed felt empty and cold.  When they reached Nektulos forest, Kodami said that there was a place that Vaghris used to play as a child and thought that would be appropriate.  They all agreed and started digging.  <br>
<br>
    Samsys, who had just returned to the forest to search for some herbs, saw the party at work.  He rushed over, but Kodami and Adden took him aside and told him of what had become of Vaghris.  He lowered and shook his head, “Poor fool,” he said, “I told him not to piss something off bigger than him.”  After that, Samsys asked if he could prepare the body for burial so that the wildlife wouldn’t disturb his body.  Again the group agreed.  They set about doing other things, Adden returning to the trading post, Kodami leaving the forest for a short time, and Zackrin sat in deep thought, but his thought were perturbed by the memories of him and Vaghris.<br>
<br>
  After several hours, the gnome came to Zackrin, “I did what I could,” he said, “but it’s up to the Gods now to protect him…” he waddled behind a tree for a moment and came back leading a figure balanced on one crutch.  That face…. Zackrin’s thoughts betrayed him for a moment and he swore he saw Vaghris standing before him.<br>
<br>
  “Hello friend.  Fancy seeing you here.” Vaghris spoke to Zackrin.<br>
“This…this can’t be…your dead…that dagger…your heart…” Zackrin stuttered out.<br>
“Well, the hole in my chain mail will have me economically set back for a bit but…” Vaghris smiled as he poked a finger through the hole in his mail.  Vaghris turned to Samsys, and thanked him once again for bringing him back, despite the great cost.  He looked weak and that he needed food.  Adden came back and saw Zackrin conversing with Vaghris and nearly shat himself.  He tottered over to Vaghris, looked at where his wound had been and then looked at his face.  “Your back!” he said with a wry smile.  Vaghris simply nodded his head.  Soon after, he asked where Kodami had gotten off to.  Adden and Zackrin just looked at each other. “What?” Vaghris said, looking confused. <br>
“She took it pretty hard.  You should really try not to scare her, you might shock her so bad it could kill her.” Zackrin said to Vaghris.  Vaghris understood perfectly.  Kodami came riding back and asked to see the body so she could give him something before he….went away.  Vaghris laid back in his stretcher, perfectly still like he had done in his exercises.  She walked up to the cot where the body of Vaghris lay.  She laid his ring back on his chest and said, “I love you Vaghris, not matter how much the rogue you were,” and kissed him lightly.  He moved a hand slowly up her arm, behind her neck and returned the kiss.  Kodami leapt back from the stretcher and in the background, Adden and Zackrin both watched contently.  <br>
“What kind of cruel jest is this?” she spat out.<br>
“I came back for you, well not for you, but because of you.” Vaghris said as he sat back up.<br>
Kodami looked at Vaghris and ran over to Zackrin, “Tell me that’s really him?  Please tell me that’s him,” she pleaded.  Zackrin only nodded and pointed back at Vaghris who had risen from the stretcher.  He walked over to the group and leaned on his crutch some.  He held out his hand to Kodami and she put her hand out.  He dropped the ring back into her hand, “You might want that back, you know,” he said with a smile.  Kodami put the ring back on her finger eagerly and hugged Vaghris so tightly that he thought his ribs would crack again.  She kissed him for a long time as if to say, “Welcome back,” but that was already implied.<br>
<br>
-Epilogue-<br>
   It was many years before they met again.  In fact, it was at Vaghris’ and Kodami’s own wedding.  Many of the friends that they both met over the years had attended.  Vaghris had met a new wizard friend over his explorations, a High Elf named Fendien.  Fendien and Zackrin flanked the alter at which Vaghris and Kodami stood.  Samsys was the priest that would complete the ceremonies, by request of Kodami.  <br>
“…is there any in the audience witnessing this marriage that objects to the joining of these two beings, forever and ever, mind, body and soul?” Samsys bellowed out into the crowd.<br>
<br>
  With no answer, the priest continued in the ceremony.  “By powers invested in me by the great Lord of Plague Bertoxx…" the gnome went on.<br>
"I object… ssshe belongsss to me," a voice erupted from the back.<br>
The audience had turned around, wondering who this intruder could be.  Vaghris and Kodami already knew who it was.  Zackrin and Fendien turn to face Shu'It'Rben.  They both began to cast warding and augmentation spells.  "Hah! Your ssspellsss cannot harm me here.  I am protected from the magicsss of lesssser beingsss here," the Iksar shouted.<br>
"Honor Guard," Vaghris bellowed, and many of his Guildmates stood to the call, "protect the guests and my wife." Vaghris stepped down off the stair where the alter was.  <br>
"You wisssh to challenge me, Rogue?  You remember the lassst time we met don’t you?" The necromancer said in a sly voice.<br>
Vaghris simply shook his head and pointed lazily toward the lizard.  Bloodraeven and Ninnafaux lept from the pews and viciously hacked at the body of Shu'It'Rben.  Zackrin and Fendien both cast devastating spells that shocked the life (or death depending on how you look at it) out of him.<br>
<br>
  With the tattered and burned corpse drug from the hallway of the chapel, Samsys continued with the ending verses, "As I was saying.  By the power of the Lord of Plague, Bertoxxulous…." The gnome continued without interuption this time.  <br>
<br>
  The rest of the wedding went as planned, a feast following certain other rituals (such as the consumation in a private studio setup by Bloodraeven) before the couple rode back out into the forest of Nektulos, riding toward the home he had burnt so many years ago.<br>
