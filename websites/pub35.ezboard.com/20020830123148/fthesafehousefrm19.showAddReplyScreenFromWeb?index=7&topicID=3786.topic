Naturally speaking, it's actually stacked in favor of Shadowblades and Infiltrators:<br>
<br>
1) Shadowblades will always swing with both weapons<br>
<br>
2) Infiltrators will have more specialization points to take up Envenom<br>
<br>
When looking at Realm Abilities, Nightshades have some unique potential. But it is not free and comes at a cost where SB/Inf can spend their points elsewhere. Instead of analying it from the perspective that it increases your Envenom damage, I calculate things purely as a damage add, regardless of the source. On a per point basic, investing in Wild Arcana is not as beneficial as MoP, DR, or Dodger, but it does increase some damage overall. I didn't have much success with my Viper/WAIII Nightshade. I can see situations in hit and runs where chance strikes lucky in your favor and you make off with a critical can be beneficial in things like keep defense. When it comes to overall damage, your weapon damage will always be a higher percentage of your overall combat damage, more than poison. It is easier to see why MoP will add more damage since it focuses on the melee aspect of damage which occupies a larger portion of combat. If you do not stick around for combat, WAIII/Viper may work in your favor, but I found it mostly to get purged anyway and the target I went after was going to die anyway, Viper was only the final blow.<br>
<br>
In other words, for the same points that it takes a Nightshade to obtain WAIII, a SB/Inf gets more damage with MoPIII than a Nightshade with WAIII. The moment you start to say Nightshades are better at Envenom, you must equally say that SB/Infs will be better at Criticals or Dual Weapons. There is a tradeoff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 5:53:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3786.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshades</span><hr size=1> Good points Elaa.  Although an infiltrator has more spec points, neither the Inf nor the NS will likely take their envenom past 39.  Granted, this is a choice each must make, but since this is the standard, I like to use it as a constant.<br>
<br>
WA affects envenom, but also affects the DDs I believe.  In every encounter I've had with NSs the DDs do get used, so there is another potential strength.<br>
<br>
NSs also have access to MoP and Dodger, so I think in the long run with all of these abilities, perhaps the NS is a bit ahead in envenom.  Additionaly, with a DW of 18 I seldom have to go past my Creeping Death to apply two poisons, and feel that the SB swinging with two weapons is not much of a balance in this area.<br>
<br>
Also, the Thrust Inf needs to take thrust to 50 to get Dragonfang (and I think most probably do); I wanted to keep my Thrust at 39, but that gave me little chance in 1v1s. A NS can be content at a lower number (39 maybe?).  This difference sucks up 445 spec points which is almost all of the difference between 2.2 and 2.5.  I'm not sure what slashers do, but since Diamond Slash has such great damage, I imagine many slashers to that route. <br>
<br>
Of course, having a higher weapon skill will mean more damage for those infiltrators. So the Inf should be ahead in pure melee damage.<br>
<br>
Infiltrators have been somewhat forced into being a melee class with envenom.  This is pretty much true all the way through the Infs career.  Would it be fair to say that early in his career, a shade is a melee class with a little envenom and a couple of spells, then later becomes an envenom class with decent melee and a couple of spells?  And have the NS spell variances been fixed yet?<br>

Anyways here is my setup:<br>
<br>
Stealth 40+10<br>
Pierce 32+8<br>
CS 44+7<br>
Env 39+11<br>
CD 16+7<br>
(6points free i believe)<br>

<br>
I'm only at R3L6 right now which leaves me with 1 point that is goin to Wild Arcana. As you can see Stealth Env are a little higher than normal. As i was leveling up I found that i didn't like enemy assassins getting the jump on me because i was detecting them too late. Combined with the fact that epic had no Stealth items on it and other stealth stuff was lower in level i chose 40 as the end point so i would have less reliance on items for it. High stealth alos helps with scouting which is really my best RvR skill. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Env was similiar i orginally intended it  to be 40 as well to cut down on item reliance. The extra point in pierce would have been nicer to have in hindsight. :/ CS is highest because +CS items weren't common for most of my levels and I wanted to initial PA to be high enough to let poison finish a caster as that was meant to be my main target with finished specs.<br>
<br>
Dodger in my opinion is a must for a shade for PvE and RvR. Until i got it i had to be very cautious about yellow con mob abilities afterwards i could take orange con if i was very cautious about abilities. I chose MoP to increase the chance of my frontloaded damage being greater and help in melee. WA is my next ability which is there for increasing damage output as well. I intend to take WA and MoP to 2 maybe 3 depending upon how effective i find them after that I'm not sure...either start workign for IP to increase survivability or the self haste RA(forget the name)<br>
<br>
Right now my biggest problem is landing PA. I have a very hard time landing....even with plenty of reaction time and being lined up perfectly I have about a 50% success rate in RvR. In PvE it's another story altogether on even con's i had about a 90% success rate.....but mobs are dumber and there is alot less lag. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I don't solo for RP much at all I am much more successful in a group and I'm really not spec'd for more than Hit and runs. Keep assault/defense is ALOT of fun for me although I end up defending the walls more than i assault door bashers. <br>
<br>
I like my shade but with the PA problems I sometime have to think like Stuart Smalley to stay motivated to play. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
<i>Although an infiltrator has more spec points, neither the Inf nor the NS will likely take their envenom past 39.</i><br>
<br>
Yes, and then the infiltrator can either improve their weapon skill or their dual wield. The first choice will slightly improve their damage output. The second choice will slightly improve their damage output and increase the chance of applying both poisons.<br>
<br>
<i>NSs also have access to MoP and Dodger, so I think in the long run with all of these abilities, perhaps the NS is a bit ahead in envenom.</i><br>

I'm confused. What does MoP and Dodger have to do with envenom?<br>
<br>
<i>the Thrust Inf needs to take thrust to 50 to get Dragonfang</i><br>
<br>
But do they have to have Dragonfang? Diamondback, the hibernia evade/stun pierce style is a great PvE style. But come RvR time the usefulness is limited. It can be parried, blocked, evaded, or bladeturned.<br>
<br>
<i>A NS can be content at a lower number (39 maybe?). This difference sucks up 445 spec points which is almost all of the difference between 2.2 and 2.5.</i><br>
<br>
This is assuming an infiltrator has to have 50 thrust spec in order to survive, which they don't have to have. Let's say that infiltrators could only spend their extra spec points on weapon skills. Then their advantage is 20% more melee damage and a evade/9 second stun style. Still sounds better than a 60 damage shout and inferior str/con, doesn't it? But Infiltrators aren't forced into only using their extra spec points for weapon skill. They have options.<br>
<br>
<i>Infiltrators have been somewhat forced into being a melee class with envenom.</i><br>
<br>
All the assassins have been forced into being a melee class with envenom. Critical Strikes is nearly worthless in PvE, and has dubious value in RvR. For the spec points we spend on Critical Strikes, we get half the value of Archers speccing Bow.<br>
<br>
2.0 spec points were fine. Critical Strikes should be a unspecced skill (level based) skill. But I disgress.<br>
<br>
<i>a shade ... becomes an envenom class with decent melee and a couple of spells</i><br>
<br>
Envenom is still more useful at low levels than in is at high levels. Envenom, by itself, is never a good substitute for melee damage. As I said above, all the assassins are forced into being melee classes.<br>
<br>
The Infiltrators happen to have more spec points to fulfill that role--they can choose to be better at melee or better at dual wielding (realistically since stealth, envenom and critical strikes will likely all be high).<br>
<br>
The Shadowblades have marginally better hitpoints and better weapon selection to fulfill that role (slower weapons are almost always better, midgard has the slowest offhanders).<br>
<br>
The Nightshades can try to fill that role, but do the worst job at it of the three assassins. Nightshades have a few additional options with RAs and poisons, but the options are all costly and as there is a limit to how many RA points you can get there is a tradeoff if a Nightshade chooses to go the Poison route.<br>
<br>
<i>And have the NS spell variances been fixed yet?</i><br>
<br>
Yes! 3 casts of my DD plus 1 shout DD is better than my Perforate Artery now. Ashame I can't use that to pull in RvR. ;) All the more reason why I hate Critical Strikes though.<br>
<br>
As I've said other times, I don't mind being the weakest of the assassins. I want some nifty spells to make up for it. Supposedly that was what Nightshades were going to get for being weaker in melee: spells.<br>
<br>
P.S. Hey all you nightshades... you need to go on the warpath and get our shout turned into a 100ish point lifetap. ;) *Jalena incites a riot.*<br>

People number crunch instead of playing outside of the box or what works for them. Keep in mind however, I'm not knocking your statistical work, but that is all it is, a number that quantifies a style of play.<br>
<br>
But then again each template might have a DPS number associated with it, but in the hands of various users that number might fluxuate due to skill and profficency. I realized that my skillset would be augmented by the Venomaster template. I don't like going toe to toe with anyone unless its on my grounds. I also like hit and running. Therefore, in my hands that statistical number might be much larger than another more standard MoP template -- a template that I might fubar cause it doesn't augment my skillset.<br>
<br>
I was faced with a choice (and a reserved respec), and I went this route... and so far I think I'm going to stick with it. I'm a fort nightshade, and a venomaster excels at forts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uharanavei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haranavei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 10:46:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3786.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightshades</span><hr size=1> &quot;WA affects envenom, but also affects the DDs I believe. In every encounter I've had with NSs the DDs do get used, so there is another potential strength.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, as Maiya has said, WA doesn't affect our DD spell or shout.<br>
<br>
&quot;NSs also have access to MoP and Dodger, so I think in the long run with all of these abilities, perhaps the NS is a bit ahead in envenom. &quot;<br>
<br>
Let's compare RA specs between and infil and NS. Both will have MoP and Dodger. The NS will take WA and Viper for 'superiority with poisons'.<br>
<br>
Nightshade: 38 points<br>
<br>
--Aug dex 2 (pre-req)<br>
--Aug quick 2 (pre-req)<br>
--Aug acuity 2 (pre-req = 4 wasted points because this RA does *nothing* at all for Nightshades. It doesn't even raise our int stat like Mythic says it's supposed to, never mind that our acuity stat is actually strength).<br>
--Dodger 2<br>
--MoP 2<br>
--WA 2<br>
--Viper<br>
<br>
Infiltrator: 38 points<br>
--Aug dex 2 (pre-req)<br>
--aug quick 2 (pre-req)<br>
--Dodger 2<br>
--MoP 2<br>
--First Aid 2<br>
--Purge<br>
--3 points unspent. 2 could be spent on Aug Con and Toughness, which will give the infiltrator even more hit points ahead of the Nightshade.<br>
<br>
So, who has the edge? Well, the Nightshade has random crits with the poison, and double dot damage every 30 minutes, but the Infiltrator has augmented hit points, an out of combat heal, and purge. The Nightshade also has 4 points which give him NO return at all, with being forced to buy Aug Acuity. The Infiltrator will have better overall melee by virtue of having more spec points to play with, and also has 2 ways of dealing with the Nightshade's supposed strength: you can heal some of the damage from the poisons with FA, or you can purge the effects completely.<br>
<br>
Here's another example:<br>
<br>
Nightshade: 22 points<br>
Aug Acuity 2 (pre-req, does *nothing*)<br>
Wild Arcana 2<br>
Viper<br>
<br>
Infiltrator: 22 points<br>
First Aid 2<br>
Vanish<br>
<br>
Here, the Nightshade has superior poisons. The Infiltrator can negate some of the poison damage with an out of combat heal, AND has the ability to instantly stealth to either: help with a getaway or to get in a second PA. It's also worth noting that the infiltrator could also choose to save up ONE more point and just get Ignore Pain. <br>
<br>
Basically, Nightshades are being forced to buy their way to equality...unfortunately, all they are equal to are assassins with NO RA's. Infiltrators can merely use their RA's to continue to widen the gap.<br>
<br>
I think that's a problem.<br>
