(ramble)<br>
In a post above, someone compared the ethical action of reporting a bug and not using it for gain (exploiting) only worked for them if SOE/VI was performing the ethical action of removing detrimental bugs not just advantageous ones.<br>
<br>
If your behavior is solely based on whether the other guy is being ethical or not, you're not being ethical. You're using an outside force to define or excuse your behavior. You're saying it's ok to be bad and cheat (and you know you're cheating) because the Other Guy won't play by their own rules/won't fix the problems they know exist. Their wrong, in your eyes, makes whatever you want to do right.<br>
<br>
It's not FAIR (or 'just', perhaps) that SOE/VI expects you to report and not take advantage of useful bugs so they can be immediately fixed, but they won't stir off their fat asses to fix detrimental bugs. But that doesn't change the whole cheat/not-cheat situation. And whether someone else behaves fairly, justly, rightly, or ethically has nothing to do with whether YOUR actions are ethical (they could have bearing on fairness, justice, being 'right', etc). If punching someone in the face for no reason is unethical, it doesn't matter if that_guy_overthere is doing it constantly. Someone else doing something unethical doesn't make it ethical for you. Likewise, taking an action only because someone else ISN'T taking a comparable action doesn't make it ethical/unethical. And even so, even when you slide to rules, and breaking the rules, and is it ok to cheat (or right, or wrong, or what have you), whether the punishment is applied has no solid bearing. Like the speeding analogies, you know the rule. You broke the rule. You can explain it, rationalize, whatever, but you broke a rule knowingly. Like the speeding analogy, unless you get caught a lot or have a wreck, there's not a lot of tangible discouragement. But it doesn't make it any less of a breaking of a rule. A crime, in the case of laws. A cheat, in the case of games. Marking cards in poker is a cheat, whether you get caught or not. Cheating is (by and large) unethical whether there is an enforcing Power to slap you when you break the rules, or not.<br>
Lack of that punishment arriving doesn't justify the action, when it's clearly obvious it was breaking a known rule. It could be it's not considered important enough to invest the time in absolute enforcement (see: having to have a GM right there to witness the wrongdoing, to make sure it wasn't just hearsay). It could be that there were too many people performing the action for them all to be caught (with efficient use of limited resources). Some would skate, some would get nailed. It could be the problem is smaller than the impact of an actual fix would be (maybe they COULD remove all of the cheating xp/aaxp... but to do it would require potentially catching people who were advancing quickly but had nothing to do with the bug). Or maybe everyone involved, knowing abuser, playing around with it, or somehow blissfully ignorant, just got a soulmark and will be banned the next time they do something that could be considered against the rules.<br>
Invisible consequences can happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
But anyway, cheating, as defined by the terms of the service the game is run under, is bad. VI can take away your account for doing it (of course, they can also take away your account for looking at them crosseyed. They need no reason, they have no legal responsibility to prove their claims or opinions have merit. They can pull the plug on capricious whim, on anyone they want, at any time, legally. That might create a backlash within the user community if it was obvious abuse, but in the past has not across many times it's happened. Only twice that I recall have they EVER reversed a decision like this).<br>
<br>
But this all really comes back to fairness. VI vs. players is never, and will never be, fair. It's unfair if you're following the rules, and are punished as a cheater. It's unfair if you're cheating, and the designated punishment never catches up with you. It's unfair that griffins can attack ignorant level 10 newbies through the wall of an inn. It's unfair that your arrow can't hit a creature because a lamp post is 'in the way', or your spell can't hit the target from there because it's down a staircase and the stairs get in the way somehow, but that same creature can land a spell from around a corner with no line of sight at all.<br>
<br>
Sure, you can have reasons you'll cheat (exploit). Depending on the exploit chosen, it might have impact on others, it might not. Often it'll be indirect, like being able to take more spawns with less downtime (less to go around for others), or be able to spot the loot bearing critter (so you don't have to kill all the ones who don't have something good... which means the good drops aren't there for folks who have to slog through every krup knight). Sometimes it'll be direct, like trying to pvp someone with a speed hack. Or being able to stand in a piece of zone geometry that forces the critters to path through some totally different space and train the bejeesus out of people the exploiter doesn't like... with the exploiter never being around or in risk of being associated with the train ('It's just pathing').<br>
<br>
But even reasons don't make it ethical, or not cheating. It might make it excusable, but it doesn't take away from what it IS.<br>
<br>
Those who knowingly used the bane damage thing for gain (and not through normal xping), don't be so prickly. You cheated, so be it. You didn't hurt me, I'm not going to come for you with a lynch mob, or shout about how evil you are. I am going to be peeved that you don't want to ADMIT it's a cheat. Stop trying to say it was your just reward for VI making a buggy game. It IS a cheat, if you knowingly used it.<br>
<br>
You can have your reasons. For a some reasons, I'm sure I wouldn't cry foul. Those behaving as normal weren't USING the bug. Those who were doing superman stunts were. Tell yourself it's an earned thing, something you deserved, a justified cheat if you want, but don't argue about the cheating part. And if you ultimately get away with it (i.e. nothing tangible happens as direct consequence), so it goes. I'll hope it doesn't encourage you to keep on cheating as opportunity presents, because VI DOES like to shaft people, and just because they left you alone once doesn't mean it'll always be that way.<br>
<br>
And remember: It's not court. It IS their world. They can do whatever they want, at any time, for any reason, and not even share the reason with you, all perfectly legally. If they let people keep their AAXP from this bug, but ban someone for knowingly using a bug down the road that has far less tangible gain, they can do that.<br>
<br>
It's not FAIR, but it's vastly safer, to play the game as they would have you play it. Find the bugs, report them, don't consciously use flaws in the game mechanics to vastly outperform what the 'rules' allow. By all means, find ways to use existing things to your advantage, like the way the engine behaves (aggro management. How pulling works. How to manage CR in a room full of hostiles without dying. How far away you can cast without getting aggro, and still land the spell on a given mob. All examples of using the system by understanding how it works and staying within it. As compared to standing behind the wall because the monster can't FIT through the door to get you, which is an exploit based on the limitations of the game engine, or bugs introduced through other enhancements or fixes).<br>
<br>
If you DO make a habit of using bugs for gain, sooner or later it could bite you directly in the ass, and you'll have yourself to blame if you DO win the loser's lotto. It won't happen to everyone. But it will happen to SOMEone, over some bug or other. It's happened before, it'll happen again. And the best way to make it even less likely to happen to you is to just not do it. Don't exploit. Whether you think it's right or wrong, excusable or unacceptable, doing it can get you burned, and not doing it will usually be safer.<br>
I only put it that way because if VI thinks you're guilty, you're guilty even if you HAVE been behaving, usually... But it's easier for them to think you're guilty if you actually are.<br>
