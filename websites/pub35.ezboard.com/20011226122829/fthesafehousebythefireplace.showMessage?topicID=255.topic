<br>
OOC:Background:Just yesterday I started a Female Human Palidin, and named her Miyage.  He mission, to obtian a plate look on her own.<br>
<br>
It was a fine afternoon that Miyage found herself just inside the Freeport gates.  She was about to go join the Palidins of Marr but was overcome with curiosity of a place called the Old Ruins of Guk were special armor droped that few adventures would take with them as no merchent would buy what was deamed worthless junk, but Miyage would love to show up to the leader of the palidins already sporting some fine plate armor.<br>
<br>
So off she went, thru the gates of Freeport and past the militia men at the gate.  They already new her and that she aspired to be a palidin, one of the palidins they oft quarled with over control of the city, but they had no prove against her yet and her father was to wealthy of a businessman for them to just make her disappear as they did with so many street urchins.  Off she went and was soon in the East Commonlands, and although the area was patrolled by militia it was abundant with animals of the wild, orcs and the undead.  She didn't spend long here as she quickly ran to the tunnel that would lead her to the Desert of Ro.<br>
<br>
She followed the tunnel until it opened, as soon as she steped out an orc raider screamed an obsenity at her and ran toward her, as she ducked back into the tunnel the orcs attention was distracted and she was able to keep going without if further bothering her.  She passed a camp of Dervish Cutthroats who took no heed of Miyage who was dressed in simple peasent cloths and obviosly had nothing of worth and had not offened them.  From what Miyage heard they were busy planning a raid of a barbarian fishing village.<br>
<br>
Miyagi headed a bit further south then headed east across the desert toward the see.  All she saw was some hunting rattlesnakes who were more concerned with the small desert mice.  When she finnally hit the coast she continued to follow it south, soon she crested a hill and far in the distance she could see the Oasis of Marr, she followed the coast and nearly cuaght the attention of an anchiet walking corpse swaddled in cloth, shirveled and dry from the desert air.  She passed a small dock where several adventures waited together practicing the old maxim, 'Safety in numbers.'<br>
<br>
She only turned back west when she saw a small inn and beyond it a small break in the forbodding walls of voodoos that maked the last, sorthern most, and most dangerous area or the desert.  She made her way across the dune to Southern Ro without trouble and quickly navigated the pass, she followed the west wall south throu the desert and passed a camp with a not-so-mean looking orc and another Dervish Cutthroat camp, again they seemed to take no heed of Miyage.<br>
<br>
By now it was getting late into the evening and Miyage could already see the fires of the Orc camps, she would have to use the cover of darkness to avoid these camps lest the orcs cut her down in seconds.  She made her way between the camps watching for stray orcs and menacing coyotes.<br>
<br>
Now she had finnally made her way to Innothule Swamp, homeland of the trolls of which she hoped not to meet.  Wary of the frogloks she saw one and recognized it ment her no harm, but followed her movement carefully as it was wary of strangers.  Miyage had also heard of kobolds but didn't see any on her trip to guk.  She could not miss the entrace to the Froglok cave, many frogloks surrounded it and the guards let her pass without insident.<br>
<br>
She entered the cave and followed the path she heard on adventurer tell her would lead her into the deepest area's where minotuar resided alongside the frogloks and gargoyles guarded the border between the living forgloks and the ghouls that had traded there living form for great magical prowess.  When she finnally found the entrance to the ghoul frogs side she was getting tired and decided to set up camp in a corner of the dungeon.  Some time later a rogue by the name of Ralluwen Shadowstar informed her that he heard of a ghoul corpse with the shin greaves she was looking for on them, he said a bard had just gotten some and not a few minutes after another pair had been found.<br>
<br>
Miyage quickly found the undead froglok's corpse a salvaged the shin greaves, she was able to scrap away the bits of flesh still clinging to them and wiped them clean, when she tried them on they fit perfectly and would most deffenantly protect her legs from many blows.<br>
<br>
She next went to the other side where all the most powerful of the living frogloks reside, but before she got there she saw a powerful magic user kill several frogloks, and leave behind weapons crafted of high quality steel, she took several of them and threw away the old rusted sword she used to play with as a teen<br>
<br>
Once she got to the other side of Lower Guk she was able to walk around the living frogloks and there companion minotuars without problem.  She was wandering about when she heard a person yell that there was a basalt carapace near the assassin room, she knew were this was from tales she heard and quickly made her way there, but before she could get there she would have to pass into the undead side of Lower Guk, and as she approached the entrance she heard the granite cruch and flap of stone wings.  She knew that just beyond the door before her was those guarding gargoyles who would let none pass between the warring sides of guk.  Luckily a monk flew up the stairs and out the door, she could hear the gargoyles rush after him and Miyage was able to slip out, over to the undead tower where she saw a lone gargoyle corpse. Sure enough it was dead as most of it was smashed but remaining intact was a large area of its body.  This basalt carapace could easily be fitted as a breast plate.  She quickly placed it over her chest and ran back to the safety of the frogloks.<br>
<br>
As she neared the entrace again she heard a shout that some shin gloves had been found near the side of Lower Guk opposite her, the dead side where a few frogloks from upper guk wander.  She was over there quickly but she was afraid the time it took her might cuase the corpse or item to be lost or taken.  That however was not the case and she was able to get a pair of the guantlets still used by some of the froglok knights.<br>
<br>
It was at this time that Ralluwen Shadowstar again approached her and told her that not only was he impressed she was able to make it to guk, but that she was able to aquire the armor she had.  He awarded her with a pair of epolets made of a strong metal called Adamantite, they not only offered great protection but seemed to allow her better insight and wisdom.  She graciously accepted the donation and promised to use them nobley.  Ralluwen told her he didn't really care what she did with them, just that he was tired of trying to sell them and thought they should go to a worthy cause.<br>
<br>
Well it was about time for Miyage to venture back to Freeport and the trip back was as enventful as the trip from, thankfully.<br>
<br>
From this adventure Miyage started her career of questing/adventuring with:<br>
Jade Earring<br>
Shin Guantlets<br>
(1) Mesh Bracer<br>
Adamantite Epolets (only thing 'given' to her)<br>
Basalt Carapace<br>
Shin Greaves<br>
Fine Steel Long Sword<br>
Fine Steel Two-Handed Sword<br>
Bronze Rapier<br>
Fine Steel Rapier<br>
(2) Fine Steel Short Sword<br>
<br>
All of this more or less on her own and at level 1, with 0 experience and without dieing.<br>
<br>
My question is, do you think this is twinking?<br>
<br>
Also what should a palidin use, 1hslash or 2hslash? Looking at the numbers 2hslash looks like it might be better, but isn't Fiery Avenger 1hslash.  I will probably have her work on both... <p><B>Ralluwen Shadowstar</B><BR>

<br>
The helm dropped by deepwater goblins in Oasis looks like darkish plate.Their called Opoline Helms,and are no drop.They have an AC of 8,2 less then a bronze helm would.Their also used in the bard's quest for a Lambent Helm.<br>
<br>
Anyway,this covers getting a plate helm, greaves, breastplate, and gloves.So,anyone know the easiest way for plate arms,bracers,and boots?I would say silver-plated if their lore,since people camping the shin lord would have em,but their not.<br>
