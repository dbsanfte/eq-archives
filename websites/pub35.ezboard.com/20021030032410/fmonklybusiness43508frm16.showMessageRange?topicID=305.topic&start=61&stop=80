If people go read the cleric board, the general concensus is this is *not* the direction we wanted our class to go.  I'd much rather get bigger/better support spells (new Mark spells, more versatile heals, etc) than some lame ass hammer that forces me into *one* weapon, a weapon that I lose 140 hps if I wield.<br>
<br>
Not to mention this change, along with the Druid CH, does nothing to address the very problems they're trying to address.  Druids/shaman need a 'bigger' heal.  With the heal attrition we've seen in the game recently (heals stayed the same, people got more hps, so heals heal less), they need a new bigger heal.  They should have gotten the 2 heals that clerics got.  A 1K fast heal, and a 1800 point slow heal.  That'd close the gap that Druids/Shaman have with healing right now, and actually give them something useful (instead of some lame-ass 10 second stupid half-ch thing).  <br>
<br>
And if they really wanted clerics to melee, up their melee skills and lose the hammer.  Let us choose which weapons we want to use from the weapons that already exist in the game now.<br>
<br>
Stupid change.<br>
<br>
Note, I've been playing a cleric since Mar '99, a week after the game came out.  I love my char, love playing a cleric (regardless of how many folks say it's boring), and I find these changes just a slap in the face. <p><p><B><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9736 target="_blank">Niin</a></B> <BR>

When an epic rogue or monk posts logs and parse results that say a cleric out-damaged them, or even came close, I'll believe it. I intend on doing extensive parsing myself, both solo and in groups (yes, I already solo effectively, prior to the patch. With KEI, it's actually pretty efficient at 60). <br>
<br>
Another thing you need to consider is that the pet and MoR will do significantly less damage per mana in a grouping situation than you see posted there by the soloing cleric. Many of you probably don't realize, but the pet hammer poofs after every fight. In other words, you need to summon a new one for EVERY mob. It is, for all intents and purposes, a DoT spell that only works if someone is tanking (if it's agro'd, it generally dies in one hit, 2 at the most - it only has 100 hitpoints). That means it also takes up a spell slot. For grouping, we will still need 3 for heals (some use 4), and 2 for DA and DB. That leaves 3 for everything else we need. Possible choices are Pet, nuke, MoR, and yaulp. If we are going to melee, Yaulp will HAVE to be one of them. All those others are also non-swappable. We'll have to choose one or another, or take a chance, and drop one of our invulnerabilities (probably not a good idea, if we are going to get more agro). <br>
<br>
We all know how easy it is for it to SEEM like something more than it is. However, as melee characters, you of all people should be impressed ONLY by proven (ie parsed) data.  Until we see some, it's all wild speculation. <p><html>

You hit on average somewhere around 65% of the time on blue cons right?, did you remember to put in your max'ed skill cap, your level and your strenght? did you remember to change class from paladin (the default since it is made primarely for paladins) to monk? ect ect.<br>
Just because you don't know how to use the program doesn't mean it sucks. I'm not saying it's 100% perfect either, but it gives you a hint of what damage your doing. Since I can't log on and just parse my damage over an 6 hour period I will have to use whatever tools I can muster.<br>
<br>
The calculator said I do 29DPS with 57% haste, unchanged hit ratio, 221 skill and a 35/40 weapon with 27dmg bonus. It does not count: Procs, Special attacks (like Bash, or flying kick) or other special abilities gained by procs. Only if I start counting in things like Bash (The paladin epic is bash inabled even though it's a two hander) and both FD and Instrument of Nife procs do I reach 40DPS. And 40DPS might be pushing it if I have to be honest.<br>
<br>
But thats with a 30K haste item, a 25% self buff (aka, yualp V for clerics) and my epic. What happens if a cleric got my haste item? His DPS would raise alot since he would get more procs.<br>

The PoN community doesn't really accept the damage calculator as even close to accurate.<br>
<br>
It IS however extremely useful for comparing different weapons.<br>
<br>
That being said, at lvl 56 using the ToV 24/24 1HS weapon and max haste I do 25-30 DPS.  That of course will go up at lvl 60 and should go up 2-4 DPS with the bash damage increase today.<br>

No because Judgement is 350 mana which means it is 6 second cast plus 14 ticks medding or 90 seconds for 925 damage or 10dps.<br>

This is COMPLETEY STUPID.<br>
<br>
Clerics hitting 45dps with pet.<br>
<br>
Shamans can hit 40dps with RABID BEAR and a decent weapon (which they have to OBTAIN) and their pet adds a whopping 7dps.  So for 6 minutes every two hours a Shaman THE MELEE FOCUSED PRIEST can actually outdamage a Cleric.<br>
<br>
The rest of the time, the Shaman totters along at 10dps with a decent weapon massively inferrior to the Cleric.<br>
<br>
How stupid is this.  On a high AC mob CLERICS WILL NOW OUTDAMAGE PALADINS.<br>
<br>
What the hell is the point of the Paladin class.  A Cleric can now do more damage than it in melée and can cast far superior spells.  It's a broken change and was not needed.<br>
<br>
Clerics were *too* good and too ubiquitous.  Now they are even better and still utterly ubiquitous.  And you know what is worse?<br>
<br>
When Druids get their 40% heal and Shamans their 30% heal, Clerics will still be UTTERLY AND TOTALLY INDISPENSIBLE.<br>

Let's take a look at the real numbers here...<br>
<br>
Fight time = 2min 28sec (148 seconds) <br>
Mob Damage to me = 2343 <br>
My Total Damage = 6530 (or 41.3 dmg/second) <br>
- Melee Dmg = 835 <br>
- Bash Dmg = 179 <br>
- Pet Dmg = 2013 <br>
- MoR Dmg = 810 <br>
- Proc Dmg = 2692 (24 procs) <br>
My Total Mana Spent = 940 (5 Yaulp Casts, Mor, Mok, Pet, and a CH after fight) <br>
<br>
First off, this is based on a soloing fight.<br>
<br>
So, when a cleric solos and has good gear, they'll get somewhere around 35 to 40 DPS.  Keep in mind, this includes a somewhat significant mana cost.  IE, this isn't really non-stop sustainable.  The pet disappears after every fight and will require constant recasting for the most part.  I'm sure if you did some calculations of kill rate per hour, it's not really that high, especially if they try to maximize DPS with nukes.<br>
<br>
So, let's put this in context of a grouping situation...<br>
<br>
Cleric melee + proc here works out to about 20 dps for the fight.  Granted, some clerics are getting about 25 dps, but this isn't really imbalancing.<br>
<br>
Mark of Retribution accounts for 5.5 dps.  Mark is a Damage Shield, and thus would only apply to times when your Cleric is the MT.  Not going to happen too often.<br>
<br>
Pet damage accounts for 13 dps.  This will be used on occassion, but will last only for the duration of the fight.  Also, damage would be greatly affected depending upon the AC of the mob and position of the pet relative to the mob engaged.  Pets are notoriously vulnerable to ripostes and enrage.<br>
<br>
So, really what are clerics getting?<br>
<br>
33 to 38 DPS while grouping.<br>
<br>
A similarly equipped paladin should be getting something like 40 to 50 DPS in a group situation, more like 60 to 70 against mid-blue to low blue cons.  Clerics aren't a threat at all.<br>
<br>
Also, Clerics have poor damage mitigation compared to most melee classes, and their DPS won't improve much with added AAs or with better gear.  However, with these changes Clerics will offer something else to bring to the table for grouping purposes, IE damage to speed up kill rates.<br>
<br>
For those saying clerics are the most wanted class for groups I don't know what planet you're living on.<br>
<br>
Yes, clerics are highly desirable for raids, but in most grouping situations a cleric is neither Needed, or the most efficient class to have for many XP groups.<br>
<br>
In many situations except hard hitting mobs, I'll take a shammie or a druid.  Torpor is one of the most mana efficient heal spells in the game, and Slow is insanely powerful for most grouping/duo situations.  Not to mention the minimal down time when cann is involved.<br>
<br>
Not to mention, these changes are being put in with the new druid/shaman heals coming into play soon.  So really, all it does is give groups alot more options in respect to whether they have a viable group or not.  IMO, that's a good thing.<br>

and on a serious note... how bout you put up some logs to show your 30dps... vs a cleric doing 40 dps... i really, truely want to see them<br>
<br>
and remember you cant count mok or mor for the cleric's dps since they EQUALLY affect you. <p>Frenzy Style<br>

<br>
I was at the 105 haste cap, the cleric did not have a haste item and had Shissar for 66 haste. The cleric's logfile did not have his pet damage, and he was healing the party.<br>
<br>
My dps was an average of 80.<br>
<br>
His dps was an average of 27. Add in the potential for a haste item, the pet damage and going pure melee and not healing. I can see him clearing 55 dps easily.<br>

The DPS from MoR shouldn't even count.  MoR is a DS that is casted on the mob and it will take damage no matter who it hits.  Still, it would be like adding a druids DS to his personally DSP when he is medding.<br>
<br>
Also the pet can only be used in certain situations.  It's not useful against mobs with that have DS on them, or mobs that riposte often. <br>
<br>
We also haven't considered mobs that have a high MR.  I am sure resisted procs will severely hurt that DPS. <p>Baron Adax von Wrax and<br> his trusty sidekick Beign<br>

For all saying clerics didn't &quot;need&quot; an upgrade to match the new CH spells? Have you PLAYED a cleric lately? <br>
<br>
Clerics are ONLY useful where high level healing is required, which currently is realy only 5% of the entire game. Not all clerics want to sell their soul to the ubber guild and become a macro slave. Some of us LIKE doing things with smaller groups and being helpful in those groups.<br>
<br>
The damage is nice. But I JUST got though duoing shrooms in FG with my L55 onk and L58 cleric, and monk still keeps good agro and way outdamages my cleric and pet.<br>
<br>
+ this just gives clerics more options. In reality, I still had to back off and heal it wasn't all melee.<br>
<br>
The Yaulp spell also only works while standing, so the point really is to get clerics off their back sides and up doing something besides medding between CHs.<br>

<br>
MoR is a damage shield that lasts for 3 mins, but as it is cast onthe mob, it usually lasts less in a group situation. In a solo situation, it will be much better for 2 reasons: 1) Clerics have bad defensive skills (only dodge at 75), and thus will get hit more, ie more damage from DS. 2) DS will be in effect longer, thus increasing it's efficiency.<br>
<br>
Judgement is a good nuke yes, but is a pretty rare drop, and you still have to channel the spell while being hit at. Due to our specializations, we will channel heals much better then nukes. <br>
<br>
Yaulp V has mana regen, but you only gain 30 mana every 24 seconds, and it is canceled if you sit down.<br>
<br>
Pet is immune to riposte and AE damage(or atleast was on test), so positioning isn't vital. It only has 75 hp though, so if you lose agro by going out of range, pet is dead and needs to be recast. As said, pet poof after fight, but only after it goes back to your side, if you change target quickly you might be able to keep it.<br>
<br>
Proc rate on hammer is very random. I can attack for 30 seconds without one proc, and suddenly get 2 in a row with a 3rd not far away (this is with 200ish dex and 21% haste item). Proc damage is not fixed at 150, but random. Very rarely have I seen it at 140+, 100 or so seems to be most common.<br>
<br>
Bash seems out of proportion though. My hit rate (according to logger) is 35%, Max damage 39, average 22.<br>
<br>
On a personal note, I despise these changes. As a dwarf I have been using my lovely 40/38 hammer to add some DPS on fights where I am FM, and have both offense and 1hb maxed.<br>
<br>
EDIT: One thing I forgot: What matters isn't DPS; especially not when soloing when mobs have time to regen a bit more then in a fast killing group. What matters is mobs dead (xp) pr unit of time. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69618">

I soloed a bit this morning in velks, a cleric friend of mine is wondering around looking for spiders... sees me killing a spider, starts helping me ... and then tells me he has to stop because his proc went off 5 times in 12 secs 165dd each time. Plus his mellee. He didnt want to ks my mob, sad. Like someone said before, clerics are now better paladins than paladins. And you know what absolutely burns me up? PoN Leadership has consistanly told us to take a wait and see attitude towards changes on test, so we dont sond whiny i guess. Well we waited and now see we got gimped, and still no word from our so called leaders. Gah, sorry to vent steam here. I know its monk business not paly griping. But I do feel thankful that the monk community has also seen our plight, maybe our near-sighted moderators and leaders will too. <p><font size=1>If I was an Autobot, I'd be:<br>
