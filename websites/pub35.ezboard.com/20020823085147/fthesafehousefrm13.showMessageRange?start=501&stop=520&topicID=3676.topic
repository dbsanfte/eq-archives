But, the castle is surprisingly lacking in pathing bugs.<br>
<br>
There are at least on named and 4 centurians/generals per floor, and being able to clear a floor takes a while without 6 55 plus.<br>
<br>
I know a 60 Shammy that can pull the cents and generals all day, and before the patch could hold the castle pretty well after a group broke to the top.  Havent seen him mess with it since the patch.<br>

I can't see a wizard pulling the named vampires and living long, especially since two of them are avid nukers.  I have seen a group from the top guild on my server have trouble there since the patch, and when I went to spy on the lower floor I got hit with some Vampire IC that did over 700 damage against my 173 CR - I only do about 300 to myself with that spell - twice.<br>
<br>
I know Necro's, SKs, and even Shammy that rely on dots are pretty much screwed, no melee can even make a good attempt unless the castle is camped by a group already, and most other classes cant do enough damage to kill them fast.<br>
<br>
I have pulled of some amazing kills with my wizard, but one kill is not enough to investigate this camp, and I doubt even a hi AA and well equiped 60 wizard or mage could contintually clear certain spawns, leave certain spawns, and watch for others.<br>
<br>
In fact, if this is a triggered event, and requires some complicated chain of events ( vice the quest is just broken ) I believe you will need a couple very good groups to blanket the castle and still be able to track the zone.<br>
<br>
Whatever the case, I have yet to get a group stay past one pop of HG, and of course, he gets pulled within seconds.  I am trying to get a &quot;raid&quot; going so I can convince people to stay for a bit.<br>

1. necro pulls with shakle of spirit (undead slow)<br>
2. mage and necro camp at tree on hill across from entrance and necro pulls to there<br>
3. send in pets before mob reaches camp, necro fd's to give aggro to pets... mage nukes and heals pet, necro lifetaps/makes mana/heals pet.<br>
4. mage uses water pet for stuns<br>
5. on named mobs, mage nukes mobs and necro dots with fire dot (pyrocuror) vexing mordania (lifetap dot) and splurt (cool dot... ) when mob reaches 50%... then uses undead fear when mob almost dead so they dont gate.<br>
6. to pull named, clear first floor (easy, and take the first floor roamer (xenithen sterbla) then the tank roamer between floors when he comes back down. next, go out back of castle, use sense the dead while standing directly below middle of balcony, you'll target renaldok. cast undead fear, then shakle of spirit... he paths outside, run back down and wait for him... usually makes it out before fear wears off. last, pull trilexior from hill behind balcony... target him when he first roams onto balcony, then run down to castle below balcony ledge and cast undead fear... run to your right and turn left corner, hugging wall, and cast shakle of spirit when he's in range, and re-fear if you have time. go HALFWAY down the wall and chain click on undead fear till he's in range (at this point, he's on the ramp headed down and out) then go back out front and wait and camp spot (if you get too close to the corner as you go around front, you'll aggro the inside corner vamp spawn).<br>
7. screaming terror works great to interrupt casting, almost as good as stun (fear sucks though, gotta keep em feared before they start to cast or they finish casting through it)<br>
9. i advise keeping invuln memmed in case you cant fd through mobs chain nuking (hey, it happens...).<br>
10. me (xelera) and trinitii (made 500,000 PP over 2 months at tower and got some good loot.<br>
**now for heratius**<br>
1. necro pulls heratius same as trilexior EXCEPT make sure you have a fresh manaskin on and are full hp (he harmtouches for 940ish). you cant fear him, hes not immune, but it wont land... so pull with undead slow (and have jboots, runspeed 3, sow on for pull, buy sow potions if you have to).<br>
2. you dont fight him at tree. as you are facing the front of castle, you pull him over to your right, in open area, bordering on the hill on corner of castle and the trees you come to. Mage stands in center and nukes while pets attack and necro runs in large circles around her, keeping in casting range.<br>
3. eventually mage gets aggro, so then she starts running the circle, and necro stands in center.<br>
4. necro lands fire based dot and lifetap dot if possible, and then reslows... is about all it will take for him to get aggro again.<br>
5. swap circles again... pets do lots of damage especially when mage out of mana... mage uses fearless pet buff and 59 necro pet is immune to fear so he wont fear them off.<br>
6. we've died several times doing this, so its not flawless, but the times we did... we werent fm to start or full hp... it makes a difference... never failed when starting full mana/hp.<br>

<br>
Best way is to work from the balcony. To get there, levitate yourself and run from the hill behind the castle (while looking up so you don't drop as fast). As long as you aim for the middle of the balcony, and stay at the edge, you won't aggro the vamps there.<br>
<br>
All melee mobs (Cents, Generals) kill with roots and dots.<br>
All caster mobs (named vamps, flappy vamps) kill with nukes and mez.<br>
<br>
The only thing that won't die from those two methods is Heratius. You can't mez him, and you can't root or snare him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uitalica.showPublicProfile?language=EN>italica</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/11/02 4:19:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3676.topic&index=507>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Valdanov Zevfeer quest</span><hr size=1> 60 wiz with &quot;above average&quot; gear can solo the 4 named and 3-4 of the generals pretty consistantly and not be waiting on spawns much.

<br>
-Order of Autarkic Umbrage<br>
-Coterie of the Eternal Night<br>
-Valdanov Zevfeer<br>
+Akheva<br>
+Shak Dratha<br>
<br>
maybe he is a trigger of some sort ? had a friend hail him (was dubious con)  no responce. didnt have any Anhkeva blood to hand him at the time. (also dont know why you would have to flip-flop your faction, i.e. haveing to have good coteri/VZ faction here) seems unlikely that its a turn in mob, but its an option. <br>
<br>
idea 2.  has anyone tried ID'n the items dropped by the Emmisary ?  i have a belt and boots i will try to ID tonite and will post my findings later on. dont have a greatsword to ID.<br>
<br>
idea 3.  anyone tried handing in any of the items dropped by the Emmisary to NPC's in katta ? maybe nathyn ? seeing as how he is not terrably talkative about anything normally. (notice how he responds differently about valdanov AFTER you hand him the note from phenic ?  maybe its in this timeframe that you can gain additional clues? )<br>
<br>
well, just my few thoughts on the subject and hopefullness at seeing a conclusion soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       sorry if these are double posted ideas. i read back about the latter 1/3 of the thread again and didnt see them brought up recently. best of luck to you questors  ~ ~ ~<br>
<br>
thank Kania for her help with ideas. it was her strong belief that the emmisary has something to do with this. and i had forgotten that he gave the factions above <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       hehe posting at work, almost always half thoughts...<br>
<br>
*EDIT* ID'd the boots of shadow walking, same as name,  and same with the Belt of Oomgado. Greatsword has no special ID either. Tried handing all 3 items (seperatly) to Nathyn to try to get a reaction, nothing there.<br>

He is an a$$ling in Katta lower lvl tunnels, Validus Custudos type person although I don't think he's a guard ( no weapons ).  He walks from his room in the tunnel to the Bar to drink and then back again and when hailed says something like What do you want?  Leave me alone I am a very busy man.  Well I didn't like being talked to like that so after he refused to talk to me I assassinated him /snicker, he cons green to 60. Anyways he drops a no drop Confidential note/letter/report.  I haven't had it identified yet.  Like I said above this may have to do with another quest and I just missed it.  There are sooo many katta quests...... But maybe it has to do with VZ quest.  Anyways just throwing a bone out there since this quest is still unsolved.<br>

Hats off to Ping, Skirm, and all others who have choosen to share much needed quest information. If for some reason I missed a patch that  fixed parts of TM then pls disregard all that follows. Atleast this new information may help stop any further confusion.  <br>
<br>
I was following up on the most solid leads this thread had to offer and found that things have changed in TM.<br>
<br>
Heratius Grolden's Invis PH (the spot on ground on the balcony you trade copper with) NO longer exists<br>
<br>
Dead Heriatius the Invis assumed PH thats left after Heratius dies. NO loner exists<br>
<br>
The two Invis place Grave holders near the Stake Quest Camp. NO longer Exists. Nor did I ever come across  one to be called a Buried Vampyre. <br>
<br>
I did not check the Invis Johaius Breau Stake Quest NPC Vamps Will try that tonight. <br>
<br>
I witnessed all of these numerous time at one point in game. Did Verant simply fix coding or is there more to this then meets the eye. <br>
<br>
Heratius Grolden was on his normal 3 to 5 hour spawn cycle while a Uber monk friend his shammy and I were kickin Vamp Arses in the Castle. I noticed Emmisary Oom pop twice back to back.  At the time he poped a group was killing mobs around the Three Vamp hotels that the infamous Galinious and Drovalk and Bedlavar hang out at. Yes the three that turn into wolves. It has been mentioned before thats why I took note this time.  Shortly after we Killed HG on the balcony the three wolves made thier trek to the Castle. We  killed and nothing special happened.  I double checked ALL ashes that dropped. HG's Ashes are LORE and Stackable the Magnus Colicium Quest involving Avir Sterbla uses the average Magic Item No Drop Vampyre Ashes. ( these Are stackable) Never did I come across Vampyre  Volitias ashes that were LORE and Stackable. But was does seem to hold true it that VI seems to be using the Same Icon for All ashes thats why they are stackable. On a side note BEFORE HG died he let out a Bestial War cry. Could this text be trigger text?? For a rare spawn to pop.  <br>
<br>
Please help me Confirm this new information the sooner the better.  <br>

<br>
Finished Killing the shades last night in Katta...  I had druids located at all 4 corners of the zone and one in the center by the ramp.  After we were finished and i turned in the note to Phenic Dionicas, the druids reported a coteri assassin poped soon as i turned in.  We started tracking it and as we ran up to it, it vanished.<br>
<br>
[Phenic Dionicas says 'There is much that is disturbing about these revelations. I will make sure the Validus Custodus is alert than they already are to the presence of powerful vampyre among our citizens. If you can find this Valdanov Zevfeer slay him and bring me his ashes your Katta Castellum Badge of Service, and your Magus Conlegium Token I will bestow upon you an honorable reward.]<br>
<br>
Honestly from reading what PD says I would have to believe Valdanov Zevfeer is in katta.  Maybe dressed as a merchant from SH.  It would be the most logical suggestion.  <br>
<br>
Anyways we didnt have much time to search the zone for new spawns since the servers were about to be taken down.<br>
<br>
<br>
On a side note we killed HG in TM again and cleared the entire tower for another 10-11 hours with no luck of anything new happening.<br>
<br>
