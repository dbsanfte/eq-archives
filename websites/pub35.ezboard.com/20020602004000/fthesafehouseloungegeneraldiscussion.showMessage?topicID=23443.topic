Is this a good or bad thing?<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally think this would be a huge mistake. Sure it sounds good on paper, since it would be good for the “economy,” but in practice, it sucks ass. I’m thinking back to my UO days here, but I remember having to carry around spare sets of armor and weapons wherever I went in case something broke. Hoarding 20 or more suits of armor and sets of weapons in my house figuring I’d need them some day. Rarely using my best weapons and armor for fear they would break. Having to leave dungeon crawls to run to town to get my weapons/armor fixed. I’m sorry, but it is just plain annoying. Almost as annoying as spell reagents *cringe*.<br>
<br>
Plus, if equipment brakes, you can never get attached to or identify yourself with a piece of equipment. Many people have a personal goal to attain a piece of equipment, and that keeps them playing. To me, equipment decay completely ruins that aspect of the game. Not to mention that you’ll have to equip and dequip stuff all the time to repair or replace it as it get broken/worn. Whereas now in EQ, you just equiup your best stuff and go with it.<br>

Don't just let the items get worse, let them get better, too!  If you spend some time cleaning up the edge on your sword, let the darn thing get sharper.<br>
<br>
One of my all-time favourite single-player games was the CRPG &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot;.  That game uses armour and weapon decay very well.  If you've got a good smith, you can fix it up good as new.  If you don't want to bother, you can also just keep a spare set handy.  Too bad the sequels didn't live up to the original.  =p<br>
<br>
This has implications on camping, by the way.  If items are going to be breaking and *leaving* the game more frequently, then they must also *enter* the game more frequently, thus drop rates can (and must) increase.<br>
<br>
I like the focus that they're putting on tradeskills.  Right now, tradeskills are really only useful for quests - by the time you're tough enough to kill the mobs whose rare drop is required for a particular recipe, the item produced is useless (mechanically).  I just hope they balance things out so everybody doesn't end up as a smith...<br>

<br>
Having items leave the economy is good in general but it if it means DAoC style items then I am certainly not in favor.  Heck, I had bags full of the top-end equipment in DAoC, it was practically meaningless. <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Blackguard of The Nameless<br>

Ultima Online worked quite well with item decay.  No one gave a @#%$ about losing a full set of plate, They just buy a new one.  I am interested to see how this would play in the EQ environment, but .... Item importance is part of EQ, It doesn't make sense for such an item centric game to start item-decay.<br>

<br>
A totally different equipment setup than in EQ.<br>
<br>
As well, raids in EQ make people die over and over again. Every game with equipment damage (except diablo) causes damage to your equipment when you die...<br>
<br>
A game with equipment damage is truly a different game in all aspects than a game without it.<br>
<br>
It's a much better concept to increase item prices from npcs and lower cash drop rates, than to have to repair items. <p><center><font size=2><font color=ashen><u><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101490>Pren, Human Master</u></a> on The Tribunal Server

For example if you were raiding and sword got dull, you should be able to sharpen it.  They can eliminate things like twinks by making their tradeskills less efficient at lower levels.  So if you gave a twink a high level sword, he wouldn’t be able to properly fix it, but a high level with good skill could.  Or if something breaks like armor, a twink being too low cannot repair it, as a minimum trade skill may be required.  <br>

It's not that making your own will save you a little money - it saves you great whacking heaps of money.  The problem is, in the time it takes you to develop that skill, you can go out and kill stuff that drops yet *better* equipment.  Vendors (and tradeskills) are just *horribly* broken.<br>

There can be level restrictions to receive the quests for items, so that low levels wouldn't be turning in high level items and powerleveling themselves.  And lots of people would love to be able to further fix their factions.  <br>

<br>
verant is going to toss out all its experience and basically turn itself into a new comer.  very odd.  decay or no decay i dont think one is greater then the other but tossing out your game experience is crazy....<br>
<br>
nobody is going to work camps or gear the same way with decay.  its not going to pack them in.  i played uo before this and i didnt give a rats ass bout my gear cause it was all so fleeting.  And i left the game fairly easily cause of that.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
as for what i would like... creativity. i would like non-permanent decay.  thats to say it breaks temporarily.   the components to fix it would be more common from the zone that you got it from.  for example if your armor came from kael as a rare drop then another rare drop would be a dust that when combined with your decayed item makes it new again.   So somepeople in your raid would be coming for armor drops others dust drops for their armor.  This also gives designers flexibility with decay rates another way to add dimension to gear. i sword that is powah but decays extremely rapidly then is gone forever is interesting but blah.  on the otherhand a sword that is powah but decays extremely rapidly but is also refreshable via rare drops is more dynamic. <br>
<br>
basically its ammo for everything =)  guns should be permanent but everything magic should have a metaphorical ammo... thats it!  <br>
<br>
non-permanent decay     <br>
<br>
That would give the same sort of constant work for your gear feel... sigh... but it wouldnt give the hell no i aint work for this crap its not permanent feel...<br>

DAoC stole the majority of it's ideas from EQ. It's interface, it's classes, it's magic system.. ALL OF THEM reak fo EQ.  Item decay has been around a hell of a lot longer then daoc.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there is a way to do this right.  As long as items can be constantly repaired, and wear is very slow, then it's not as burdensome as you think. Also, drops HAVE TO BE much MUCH faster if item decay will be in eq2.  Lucky for me, in DAoC, my armor rarely decayed (I was an int caster), but my staff did through use of my channeling through it.  I had a insanely good one-time-only drop staff that I overused and it finally decayed beyond use. But, I could go and buy a new staff from a vendor that was decent enough to use until I came across another dropped one.  <br>
<br>
It gives the game variety. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/u45thparallel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>45th Parallel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/24/02 12:40:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23443.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Equipment Decay, Good or Bad?</span><hr size=1> Level restrictions alone are plenty if your goal is to stop twinking and get rid of no drop.

<br>
Besides, I was just thinking that EQ1 already has item decay in a sense. The Yak, once the uberest of items in EQ, is now virtually worthless in the post Centi economy. Even if the old items don’t break, they still leave the economy in a sense.<br>
<br>
- Great idea Darkefang. Add to that more quests for upgrading your current weapons, in which you have to turn in the old weapon (ie, old weapon is destroyed). But being able to “donate” any item to raise faction or get xp would be a great way to get equipment out of the economy/world.<br>
