It is not balance that a slash infiltrator whups serious ass, and has enough points to spec high CS AND envenom, because I cannot, neither can Shades.<br><br><br>Some people just can't see reason I guess. Is this officially a NS and infiltrator only board now? When I used to lurk, I saw tons of people whining about how overpowered SB's were, didn't see an ounce of proof, and you all seemed to enjoy that, odd, somone shows proof about soemthing, and is attacked every single post eh?<br><br><br>hehehehehehehe<br><br>Mill <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uoldmill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Old Mill</A> at: 6/10/02 10:18:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugalium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 10:44:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3506.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: parsed 32k rps worth of logs, infiltrator vs sb damage&a</span><hr size=1> Mill look through my posts, you will find that I have supported your position a number of times, heck in another thread you said you had a lot of respect for my post, but now I am just a smug ass because I dared question the point? I understand fully the limitations, I understand fully the issues at play, I understand fully that its been going on forever and anyone that hasnt seen your points yet, lives in a big dark cave or is oblivious to them.<br><br>I am sorry that some infiltrators were asking for SB nerfs. You know what, there are more of us in numbers and thus we have a larger collection of jerks and pricks. Dont for a minute think that SBs dont also have jerks and pricks of their own. I am NOT going to be appologizing for the few jerks and pricks that sat around pissing you off before. I am sorry that Albion is percieved as the favored realm. Where you around when it was Midgard that was percieved as the favored realm? Dark Age of Midgard and pretty much exactly the same trash talking about Midgard that I see now about Albion. <br><br>You question what I want when you are focusing on one infiltrator template, one that few people use and will only get smaller when respec finally happens? My vision of balance includes a detailed look at all potential templates, not just one. Till the discussion swings to a full view, its about personal balance not class balance.<br><br>What I see is this. Post after post saying the same thing. What is the point in that? No new information, nothing, exactly the same post just repeated. Everyone respondes in pretty much the same way each time, no swinging of opinions because everyone has read it so many bloody times they dont actually even think about it any more, just repost a new version of what they said before. Everyone, lets just do ourselves a favor and save some time. Just bump the old thread instead of starting new ones.

They at this point are screwing both.<br><br>At this point, they need to clone over CD/DW to shadowblades, that would end any percieved or real damage dispute, and open up some choices once again.

When you're both unbuffed would be a better comparison (as most of us don't have buff bots unfortunately). Being unbuffed also makes enervating have less of an effect (and IMO enervating should be included in the damage results since Mill can't use high level debuff poisons). In normal RvR there's lots of things going on, and the only real test is a CONTROLLED test, although these logs do give a vague comparison.<br><br>IMO, speaking from nearly 500k experience RvR'ing w/ mostly fighting other, non-buffed infils, after the LA nerf, and alb with BOTH str relics (so they get +20% damage edge over me), vs slash infils and 50 thrust spec'ed infils I have about a 50/50 chance who wins. It becomes VERY dependent on the rolls, whoever gets the first hits/poisons in, etc. Vs 50 thrust infils, they get their evade style w/ the 9 second stun, it's over for me. IMO SB's still DO have better meele, but the higher poisons/weapon spec closes that gap in real play, and if alb on my server (galahad) didn't have the 20% str (like if we were equal) I would think SB's would have a slight advantage. I did used to straight up murder infils before the LA nerf, but at that point midgard had both str relics so I attribute it to that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3506.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3506.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3506.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3506.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3506.topic&start=101&stop=102>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3506.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3506.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3506.topic&index=20><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3506.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3506.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3506.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3506.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
