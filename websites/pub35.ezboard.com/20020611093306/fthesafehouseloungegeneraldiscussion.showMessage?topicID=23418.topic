Basically the situation is this:<br><br>When someone gets a new item from a guild event and it replaces a droppable item then what should they do with that item?<br><br>I see three alternatives:<br><br>1. If they have a compelling reason to keep the existing item (like for resist gear or its a situational weapon) then they should keep it;<br><br>2. If not and the item being replaced was won on another guild event then it should be passed on to another member of the guild; and<br><br>3. If they hunted for and either looted or bought the item then is it reasonable to have them hand it down or should they have the right to sell it?<br><br>I see arguments both for and against (3).<br><br>Its fair to say that they're only replacing the item because the guild helped them get the item so its fair enough that the guild should benefit from the hand-me-down.<br><br>On the other side, that person used their time and energy acquiring an item.  It should still belong to them and thus they should have the right to sell it or whatever.<br><br>I don't see a clear case for one side or the other on this issue so I'm curious what other people and guilds do.<br><br>Just say a person wants an item I'm replacing.  We're both melees.  We're both the same level.  I've worked for that item.  Hes had the same opportunities I've had.  If he wants it, why doesn't he have his own already?<br><br>I pay attention to my gear.  I try and get good stuff on my own time as well as guild time.  I see others who don't.  Can't a hand-me-down be construed as subsidizing those who don't expend that effort?<br><br>That being said, the &quot;guild helped you replace that item&quot; is a compelling argument (imho) which leaves the problem unresolved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujondinsottovoce.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jondin Sottovoce</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 5:10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23418.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.supernet.net/~langston/bow.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild hand me downs</span><hr size=1> Make the guild over all better.
