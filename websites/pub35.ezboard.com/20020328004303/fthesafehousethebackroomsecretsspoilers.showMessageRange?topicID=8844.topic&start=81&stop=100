<br>
well, and warrior too now, I suppose.<br>
<br>
To go over the skills:<br>
<br>
Acrobatics: (3 skill levels) - Yay! I get to pay massive amounts of xp (total of what? 18 points?) for something that monks get for free: uber safe fall skill. Foff.<br>
<br>
Adv. Trap Negotiation: (3 skill levels) - Oh happy happy joy joy. The most inane ability of the rogue in EQ, and arguably the most boring (I just love sitting on traps, disarming them every 20 seconds).  This skill is worse than useless, since you can already disarm traps faster than they become active again.<br>
<br>
Ambidexterity: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - I already hit 90-95% dual wield rolls. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Chaotic Stab: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - Nearly a saving grace, but... about as roguely as a twohanded sword.  Should have allowed a greater flanking area for normal backstab.  Instead of being able to only get stabs on the back 120 degrees, that should have been upped to the back 240 degrees, to include flank attacks in backstabs.<br>
<br>
Double Riposte: (3 skill levels) - HAHAHAHHAHAHA.  Foff.<br>
<br>
Escape: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - wow. once every 72 minutes? Can you shaft me harder? Is it worth even having a hotkey up for this skill?<br>
<br>
Poison Mastery: (3 skill levels) - Might have been useful. If poisons were stackable.  If they didn't require farming rare components off of greens, or worse, harm touching greens (yay scorpkis venom).<br>
<br>
Purge Poison: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - oh @#%$. another once-every-72-minutes skill.  I'm not a f~ing paladin or SK.  What's with this once every game day crap?  What? would I abuse this skill on... trakanon? pfft.<br>
<br>
Personally, i'd rather boost stats than bother getting most of this crap.  And we all know how worthless stats are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uhippophobiccowboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippophobic Cowboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/19/01 1:04:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Guys, dont worry, go over to a monk forum and you'll find they're none too happy with their new skills either.

<br>
Chaotic stab: useful when your soloing right? well personally I find when soloing using &quot;INSTILL DOUBT&quot; works awesome, and if your pressing down chaotic stab, your not going to be able to use instill doubt, so you have to choose. As a rogue I am able to solo currently in Maidens taking down mobs that hit for 130 with instill doubt. Will I be able to with Chaotic stab and giving up instill doubT? do you know how much free dmg I get with a single instill doubt success? its alot.<br>
<br>
Escape: no offense we got the shaft here. it should be 3 skill levels, 3 points each maybe, and the timer should decrease 72, 36, 18. Keep in mind if this is absolutly identical to feign death, that we are only hidden after we use it, unlike monks who are feigned. So even if we completly wipe agro, the mob is just going to reaggro us if we are near to it and our 72 minutes is down the toilet.<br>

These are actually complaints I had a long time ago that everyone told me to STFU about but maybe you guys will be more receptive.<br>
<br>
Just because they are melee archetype's doesn't mean they should effect all melee classes identically.  Finishing Blow is a toy for Monks and less useful for Rogues.  It would become drastically more useful if it raised the maximum level for a mob that can be assassinated (presuming they are under a % of hp) along with raising the standard assassinate percentage.  Same basic principle can be applied to the monk's abilities.  It would help with soloing drastically if assassinate would work on an ID'd 55 that was running with 50% of it's hp.  First skill level you can Assassinate sub 50% mobs up to 48, second skill level is up to 51, final is up to 55.<br>
<br>
Get rid of Adv. Trap Negotiation all together, traps never really did work.  Replace the skill with one that allows a rogue to slow a mob's movement, before you think it's a bad idea lemme explain the context.  You take a throwing dagger, aim at the Achille's Tendon of an enemy and throw, presuming the dagger hits the tendon is severed and the mob moves much slower.  So it would be a percentage increasing up to 10% on every landed throw that was issued from behind a mob, the code is already there for determining whether a projectile was thrown behind a mob (remember assassinate on thrown weapons?) so it would be a pretty easy one to code and it would help solo'ing a bit.  Poking an ID'd slow moving mob.  Of course there would have to be a check to see if the mob is susceptible to such attacks (it wouldn't be that realistic if you tried it on a beholder now would it?)  More useful than Adv. Trap Negotiation if you ask me.<br>
<br>
Chaotic Stab is actually pretty realistic when you think about it although poorly named.  Fighting a guard and stabbing your Ragebringer through their side and puncturing a lung is quite possible.  VI should add 2 more skill levels if you ask me though.  75% chance at the second level to do up to 1/4 maximum backstab damage.  50% chance at the third level to do up to 1/2 maximum backstab damage.  If it fails the 75/100 or 50/100 check (respectively) it still does minimum backstab damage.  More roguely if you ask me.  I always really thought backstab should do some damage from the front, of course it would be more of a sidestab but that's just semantics.<br>
<br>
Escape could be much more helpful if they changed it from 1 to 5 skill levels, first skill level 72 minute refresh, second skill level 36 minute refresh, third skill level 18 minute refresh, fourth skill level 9 minute refresh, fifth skill level 4 1/2 minute refresh.  The amount of time spent hunting for the skill points required is immense but it improves a skill.  The only problem is that with this skill a less honorable rogue could use it to train people, that's really the only reason I can see that VI wouldn't implement it.  Of course Necro's, SK's, and Monk's get actually the same skill with a far less refresh time at a much lower cost.  I would like to see Escape.<br>
<br>
Acrobatics should cost barely anything to raise your skill level in.  Nine points for a third level is idiotic.  If the skill point requirement was lowered it would actually be a good ability.<br>
<br>
Ambidexterity is a crock. But real ambidexterous people are equally skilled and equally strong in both arms.  Strength modifier for off hand damage, not as high as primary though, would be my solution to an utterly useless skill.<br>
<br>
Purge Poison makes no sense, it's really pretty stupid considering that Rogues are a melee class.  If VI really wanted to give us a purge poison ability they should grant us the ability to make a potion that will purge all poisons from our body, not an ability that does it.  Get rid of Purge Poison and give us what I always wanted, a &quot;Deft Hands&quot; skill.  Three levels, first level increases the mob level that can be pick pocketed to 50, second to 55, third to 60.  At the third level you also get the ability to pick pocket magic items (incidentally allowing you to disarm magic weapons as well).  Of course I can hear every other class over every server complaining &quot;A rogue just stole from the MOB I was killing.&quot;  For that the solution is a secondary item pool only accessable by pick pocket.  Now before anyone jumps on my back because of the fact this would increase item influx they have to realize that the odds of pickpocketing anything off of a level 60 mob is VERY VERY difficult, if everyone remembers from their youth how lower level mobs were easier to steal from than higher level mobs they'll realize how hard it will be to steal from higher level mobs.  The second loot pool would have to be generated independantly from the first.  Rogues always had hordes of loot and were the richest of all classes, with this skill we could reclaim the title of richest.<br>
<br>
I await the flames of my peers.<br>

One one hand, I'm totally happy that they'll finally have a unique ability that they can use that will serve them well while taking down big bosses, but I feel like we're in the slow lane and everybody else is in faster cars.  We've been double-backstabbing with a 15 damage piercer since Kunark...  Big damage is our greatest asset -- and we're not making much progress.<br>

My intentions is not to argue but have the other classes benefited significantly more since kunark?  I started EQ when velious was already out so I honestly wouldn't know.  Yes the other melee classes are getting damage output increases but it is still too early to determine if they are going to surpass rogues.  SoL hasn't even been out a month.  I'd say 90% of the &quot;good&quot; loot hasn't been discovered.  SoL is pretty much still BETA.  Upgrades and Nerfs are coming so I'm just waiting.<br>
<br>
On another note.  I would trade all of our class skills for just  ONE class skill: Flurry. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uslinkerdread.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlinkerDread</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/20/01 7:13:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Also Chaotic Stab is a childish reference to what should be refered to as  &quot;Circle&quot; in may popular muds imo. <br>
