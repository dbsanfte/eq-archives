Sure we're dealing with different mobs here with slightly different loot tables, but the situation is essentially the same.  Killing a mob with no risk of being summoned or taking damage because of a glitch in the setup of the zone (if he can't hit you with arrows, you shouldn't be able to cast on him, you can't cast on mobs through walls....).  Absolutely it's an exploit, but someone said it's little experience and I have no idea what he drops so I don't know how long it'll take for something to be done about it.
