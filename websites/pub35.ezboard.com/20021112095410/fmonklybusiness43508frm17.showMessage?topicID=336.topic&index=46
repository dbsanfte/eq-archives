If monks were the best melee dmg output everytime what would rogues then have? There can only be one class as the best at something. I'm sorry but that is just the way it is. Warriors are the best tanks. Rogues are the best damage dealers. Rangers are the best with a bow. Monks are the best with their fists. Paladins have the ability to be the best against undead. Each class has it's own unique things they are the best at. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Er, do you even realize how pathetic fists are? With epic, it's 9/16 for each fist. There's Kunark-era weapons that are better than that. Not to mention, monks aren't asking for the best melee damage output either.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
You can't be the best at everything. Damage stacks. You can have 3 damage dealers hitting a mob and all are bring something useful to the group. If you have two tanks in a group then you have one tank too many. How many people can a mob hit at any one time? Just one person. Defense doesn't stack like offense does. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Quite correct. But what advantage does a monk have over a rogue in a group? Or a warrior for that matter? Just think about the pre-NToV monk, which is what this patch has hit hardest: 1100AC, 2500hp, wielding a 29/30 Kunark-era weapon, tanks like Kleenex. Think about the pre-NToV warrior: 1200AC, 3500hp, wielding a 44/44 Luclin-era weapon, tanks like a tank. Where's the comparison?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Monks still have a very large role to play. They can do alot of damage from any side of a mob. They can pull better then anyone. Yes, sk's can pull but fd can't be interupted.. sk's spell version can. Both have a chance of failing. Monks are also on a seperate dmg table then the plate classes. This means you put out more damage. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Keep in mind, pulling has nothing to do with damage. Monks are on a separate &quot;damage table&quot; than the plate classes in terms of taking damage as well. So the SK will survive to pull two mobs back to camp, and the monk won't make it back. Where's the monk role? Again, keep in mind, we are not talking about monks with 1300+ AC and 3000+ HP. We're talking about the pre-NToV monk.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
The monk role is one of damage dealer. That is what you do. There are alot of ways you can do this role. A secondary role is as puller. As a primary damage dealer you should not be tanking any hits. Your job is to put out damage not absorb it. The disc's you have allow you to live thru the times you might get agro, and FD helps in those times too. The whole point of all your defensive skills is to allow you to live in case your dmg output gives you unwanted agro. The reason you have unwanted agro is because you are doing more damage then most people. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Pre-NToV monks don't get unwanted aggro. Hell they don't get wanted aggro, even. Until recently, both myself and the other 55+ monk in my guild were using tranquil staves on raids and not getting any aggro. Point is, pre-NToV there just isn't that much monk damage. You're talking about a 29/30 two-hander, or 9/16 + 13/21 one-handers, in most cases, or something pretty darn close. Pre-NToV Luclin-era warriors have 13/20 and 12/20 weapons, and 44/44 two-handers.<br>
<br>
The reason we need mitigation ability is to pull. Frankly, if Verant just tossed out our mitigation and gave us 90% of rogue damage I'd see a point to being a monk. However, that's not what they did. They tossed out the mitigation of the pre-NToV monk while leaving the damage unchanged. The difference between 9/16+13/21 and 15/20+14/18 is HUGE, and the difference between 1100AC and 1300+ AC is HUGE now, bigger than the difference for any other class. Basically, the role of pre-NToV monks is very unclear, and Vex Thal monks can still do a heck of a lot but it's unclear what they're supposed to do. Monks aren't hybrids, their role should be crystal-clear.<br>
<br>
So coming back to the point of this thread: what is the role of a monk? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uchavr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chavr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 1:55:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monk role? Absor, you out there?</span><hr size=1> The rogue in the group can't pull like a monk, and then once the mob gets back the monk can slap on dps.  The warrior in the group has the same problem as the rogue... no pulling ability and the warrior won't even touch the monk for dps.  Sk's can pull, but they can't do monk dps.<br>
<br>
How hard is it to see?  Monks still have a well defined role as damage dealer and puller.  Before the change was made ya'll also had a overpowered defense in comparison to your offense skills.  <br>
<br>
Heck, the way ya'll are talking about defence and the need to be a tank you should have had your dps yanked down instead of your defence.  Maybe you would feel better then.  <br>
<br>
I'm truly sorry you feel that because you can't be a tank anymore your class is broken.  Seems to me monks are still dishing out as much damage as before and their role has always been damage dealer.  Oh well, I'm done with this.  The few monks that are trying to bring hard info are being drowned out the people that only see things the way they want to see them.   <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94313>Chavr Wyrmbane</a><br>
