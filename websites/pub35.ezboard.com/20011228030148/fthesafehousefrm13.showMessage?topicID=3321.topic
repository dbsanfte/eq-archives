<br>
Last night I got my first coldain ring after killing untold number of Tundra Kodiaks--thanks to Murm for having one of those pelts already...saved me a ton of time.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, Boradin was up for the second quest, so myself and my faithful druid friend decided to give it a shot.  Well, when he got to the giant fort, the Giant Commander killed him in I think two swings...<br>
<br>
Is there an easy way to void murdering the poor little fellow?  We tried harmonying last night, and it didn't seem to work out for us...<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I did it *almost* solo as a 60 rogue, but I nearly died killing the orcs at the rygorr fort. a necro fearing the orc and healing me saved the day.<br>

He then turns northeast and walks towards the ruins (where Corbin Blackwell/Warden Bluke are).  After a short stop, he arrives at the broken walls with the single giant and orc.  Kill them in advance if you want him to survive.  From there, he travels straight south and takes another rest.  He continues to the orc fort and stops in the entrance (so kill the orc fort guards in advance).  Finally, he returns to his original location.<br>
<br>
All in all, he's just trouble looking for a place to happen.<br>

These quests are pretty easy..depending on if you want to do them how they are written or if you just want the end items..<br>
I have done these quests at least 20+ times each step.. for friends, for myself.etc. I have done them the way they were intended the first few times, then after that i messed around with it and this what i came up with. You can realistically do all 9 rings in approx 5-6 hours total.<br>
<br>
these done as a  level 60 rogue with good gear/quest gear... not alot of velious quest armor but alot of good situational gear<br>
<br>
1st ring solo... is self explanatory<br>
2nd ring solo..(if you are able to solo regular frost giants, and orcs, and have some type of sow/jboots) train all three giants to garadains crew and let the dorfs kill them.. hand to boridain, then follow him, when he is almost to the prison area run down and solo the giant and orc.. then stick with boridain get to orc fort first and solo orcs if noone is camping, then follow to the hill and kill the kodiak.. hand stuff in.<br>
3rd ring solo..self explanatory kill and make item.<br>
4th ring solo..need same as step two plus a fungai tunic or other regen form item. spawn giants and if you cant solo pull ghrek then train the giants to all the dorfs,the trick is.. putting enough damage on ghrek to not get ksed by the dwarfs... a good way to do this is to use a  root item on the giants to split then train them. IF Tain dies no biggy... when he respawns again..use the line to spawn giants then hand in the item... done.<br>
5th ring solo.. spawn scarbrow and solo pull him to the far off dorf huts... have dorfs assist you to kill him, loot item... done<br>
6th ring solo.. get icefang to go his way.. stay with him to kill any random giants... then once he gets to poxbreath pull poxbreath away and either solo kill, or have dorfs help you, then for roderick make sure you gte to his spawn point soon after a patch... youll get him in no time..  done<br>
7th ring solo... solo kill the guards... turn in items to the captive... then attack him and pull him to the dorf huts he is supposed to be at and root him there... run out of his agro range he will despawn... then go back and turn in.. very simple.. if you want to go kill the giants and orcs that spawned otherwise they will ander to orc fort and then toward garadin i believe<br>
8th ring.... since they upped the chief i couldnt solo him, but all i needed was one other person... i.e. cleric...paladin....warrior...shadowknight. to do this... spawn the war run into fort.. solo pull chief kill and loot head invis and run back to garadain... stick with him till he yells &quot;CHARGE&quot; hand in item and you have 8th ring<br>
9th ring can all be done with a single group.<br>
I go tmy brewing and poison makign skill up to what i needed..<br>
step 1..1 group kills murdrick quick.<br>
step 2.. i could solo this part the dorf captain is easy as hell to kill. HAlf the time i assassinated him first shot.. loot and move on.<br>
step 3 peffen.. 1 group.... spawn...druid kites the running mobs... everyone else attacks peffin.. peffin dead loot up done..( only time this is hard is when people dont kill the giants and leave them up!.. after you kill peffin, then use your group and kill the runner giants and then single up the giants around the fire. although this spoiler i am writing is cheesy as hell.. i still dont recommend not killing the mobs, or leaving mobs up that dont despawn for others!)<br>
step 4.. 1 group go to iceshard manor and kill everything spawn doridain and do cycle.... ( at this point do cycle as many times as possible so everyone has a head... what this means is next time if you are in a hurry and only one person needs, you can go clear room and spawn doridain and leave without doing cycle... you will know why if you have done this, or when you do this..)<br>
step 5.. 1 group.. go kill the councelor.. if your KS then figure the way to pull her... it isnt that hard. Nothing will assist her when she has been spawned on her alt version side.<br>
step 6... get box, combine and hand in grats on 9th ring.<br>
<br>
ring 10..well basically all you need is about 4 solid groups from your guild to do this... trust me... you will get about 6+ groups of other high levels wanting to help with this quest..<br>
just read the war info already posted in the safehouse and if you have gotten this far... you should be able to do this part, if not the first try then soon after.<br>
<br>
Good luck with my cheesy ass spoiler... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3329.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3328.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3321.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=3321.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3321.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3321.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
