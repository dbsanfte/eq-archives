&quot;Reason Casters love that idea is because they get extra loot to sell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Spoken like a person who has never played a caster. Unless a caster can solo camp for loot, they as broke as the rest. Almost all of us who win a roll, sell stuff and buy what we want. How does this favor a caster? Good luck getting a cleric or ench on that fbss camp if its NBG... <p>Kilcano, 57 gimp ranger<BR>

<br>
I don't expect strangers to care about my &quot;needs&quot; with respect to loot.  It was @#%$ back when fighters wouldn't let me roll on an FBSS back in the day (&quot;What do you mean I don't need it?  I could trade that for an SMR, at which camp, I might add, I never ever see melees except my friends that I bring with me&quot;) and it's @#%$ now.<br>
<br>
NBG among strangers is just too easily abused.  Some folks will only go to camps where their loot might drop (we've all seen the ugliness that can erupt in a group when one guy &quot;just likes chef better&quot; and one guy &quot;just likes disco better&quot; and everyone pretends that they're not really arguing about loot) and it's too easy for bad people to stash gear that would demonstrate their lack of need. (&quot;Why no, I don't have a heiro cloak.  The one you saw on me last week was a loaner.&quot;)<br>
<br>
When I'm with strangers, I roll.  When a stranger groups with my regular crew, and something drops, everyone rolls.  If the stranger wins, yay stranger.  If one of the five of us win, we NBG among ourselves. <p>----------------------------------------<BR>Aanadien Jones, 60 Enchanter<BR>

(I am a rogue as main, war/ench/druid as secondaries)<br>
<br>
Just like I have always said, and someone else just said, NBG is just an excuse for people to be greedy and look good doing it.<br>
<br>
Everyone can use everything from pick-up groups, first time I whent to KC a lupine dagger droped(15k at the time), I thought &quot;kick ass! I can sell that @#%$ and buy a locustlure(8k) and maybe a piece of mrylokar with it.&quot; then this ranger in our group says &quot;I'll call NBG on that&quot;. I said &quot;hmm? whats NBG?&quot;<br>
<br>
that is the day I began to hate everyone about 8 times as much as before <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I found out earlier that the dude had already sold one lupine dagger.... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> [big]Example.... </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->[/big]<br>
<br>
Lets say Jonny the ranger and slikdhik the rogue are grouped in KC. Lupine dagger drops, and jonny the ranger wants it, but NBG does not exsist in this world , so he has to roll instead of being a greedy cack. slikdhik wins the roll, runs off and buys himself an FBSS and a locustlure(he got lucky then).<br>
<br>
ok, now jonny is like &quot;damn, I need a lupine dagger&quot;. then someone pulls that one dude... and he drops a notivagant blade or whatever the hell. jonny is excited. everyone rolls, and Jonny wins!!! omfg!!!@#)!@(#! jonny sells the novi blade(or trades) and gets his lupine dagger. <br>
<br>
WHAT THE @#%$ IS WRONG WITH THAT SYSTEM?!<br>
<br>
I dunno, whatever <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It lets you know who's out for themselves or for guild. <br>
<br>
Last night, we (diff. guild) were in BW. Gorgul spawned,  our melee was weak (level wise) so we fear kited him. <br>
<br>
Treeweeve dropped. 1st time I have seen it drop in 11 kills. They immediately said roll. I said no, war gets it. <br>
<br>
War had been there 3 days. Other melees 1st night there. <br>
<br>
War level 43 with ry'gorr. SK with rubicite*level 40*, 2 druids ( 51 &amp; 40) &amp; me (cleric 50)<br>
<br>
They all agreed. If next one dropped, then we'd roll. It's stupid to roll &amp; then have a another player get paid 1k for something the war in the group needs. <br>
<br>
If I was grouped in KC and some Donal's dropped &amp; they said roll. I'd leave. I firmly believe in NBG. <br>
<br>
As for sentiment, I'd explain person XYZ gave me this on  that day. Mosty Guild Leaders would understand.<br>
<br>
As it is, we already plan on going to FM &amp; getting Shroud of Nature for the druids. Should they roll as well? haha, I can see that happening. <br>
<br>
Plus, war with 25 sc, 10 str, now battles will be easier &amp; I won't go OOM if we get 3 on a pull (darn spawns at ramp)<br>
<br>
I also like a point system for raid gear. Player X has been to Hate say 20x, player Y 2x. Player X would get 1st dips on a piece they needed or they can pass on a drop. Very rarely have I seen this contested. Only time it's an issue is if it's a pickup raid, then it should be random. <br>
<br>
As for casters wanting something so they can get an SMR. GO CAMP THE SMR!!!  gah, you're at the wrong spawn!  /bonk hehehe<br>
<br>
<br>
Or do what I did, camp HGs for 3 months and get plat, then buy it in ec. simple. <br>
<br>
best of luck with the guild!<br>

I don't care either way.  If the caster I'm with gets a new book that dropped, great for him - I have no interest in whatever he was holding before.  I don't want him to give it to me to sell.  It all evens out anyways.  You sell your old stuff for cash when you win something, I sell my old stuff for cash when I win something.  Doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Almost all of us who win a roll, sell stuff and buy what we want<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The excuse that people need it to trade for other gear is nonsense.  I have looted almost everything I equip.  The exceptions are player made rings and one earring, Mrylokar arms, and a Frog Crown I have had for 35 levels.  Every single other weapon I wield, and piece of armor I wear, has been looted or quested.  Gravy items won were enough to buy those few pieces and more.  That's what GRAVY is for, stuff no one needs or will equip.  Roll THAT stuff off that no one will equip, and trade it for stuff you will use.  I don't need to take the Elder Spiritualist gauntlets that a Druid in the group would be ecstatic to have and equip away from him/her to go and finance my own equipment upgrades in EC.<br>
<br>
If it's for a twink of yours, I don't @#%$ care.  I had one guy trying to argue he needed the Soulbinder that dropped in KC for his twink SK.  Too @#%$ bad, your SK isn't here.  If your SK wants a Soulbinder, he can come here and kill the Captain for it.  The six characters in the group are all that are taken into account in loot distribution.<br>
<br>
I have probably benefitted personally from NBG less than everyone I have ever played with.  It doesn't matter that I'm a melee, I don't care.  I camped the basement in Karnors for almost a month in an attempt to get Mrylo Gauntlets.  We looted over 25 Books of Obulus in that time.  Every single caster who ever grouped with us walked away with one.  Three rogues who could use them walked away with Mrylo Boots.  Pally and Monk items that dropped were gravied, (I don't think I ever grouped with one down there).  I walked away with nothing from that month except a lot of xp, a lot of fun, and I think 1 or 2 Books that I won as gravy when all casters with us already had one.  So spare me the NBG benefits only melee line.<br>
<br>
I don't see any difference if I am playing with friends or strangers.  I am happy to see a warrior I met three hours ago walk away happy with his new Cobalt boots, just as I would be for a friend.<br>
<br>
The looting system preferred doesn't determine whether someone is greedy, whether it's total random, or NBG and gravy.  What makes someone greedy is being *preoccupied* with loot.  Period.  If you are worried about &quot;getting your fair share&quot;, you are greedy.  I can tell immediately when someone is preoccupied with how loot will be distributed, asks 10 times what drops where we are fighting, and wants stats from every item announced while we are still finishing a fight - THAT is someone who's greedy and is generally booted shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>
I just try to treat others how I want to be treated, and don't concern myself if I don't get any drops for 2 weeks - who cares?  Eventually, my upgrades come around and I'm happy.  It's worked fine for 60 levels for me in guild, with friends, with strangers, xping and on raids...makes no difference what the situation is. <p><font size=4><font face=hanzel, verdana, arial black><b>Kuurus</font></b><BR><font size=2><font face=hanzel, verdana, arial black>Assassin and Guild Leader</font><BR><font size=2><font face=hanzel, verdana, arial black><i>Retired</font></i><BR><font size=2><font face=andy, hanzel, arial black><b><A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/bwarcry97210>Cry of War</A></font></b></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukuurus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kuurus</A> at: 1/27/02 10:55:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uyadensamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yaden Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/27/02 10:54:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21954.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG</span><hr size=1> NBG is just a joke, it just gives a means for melee to abuse it.<br>

NBG in its purest form(though you would have to trust people) is that the worst equipped person loots every single thing no matter what until he can get gear and not be the worse(something he can equip he wears, what he cant he sells and gets something he can wear)  With NBG in effect everywhere everquest economy would not existm all that plat you loot of mobs would be only for tradeskills and food.  I could go on forever about this but im gonna go play now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=21954.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=21954.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21954.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=21954.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=21954.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21954.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21954.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
