I have spent countless hours trading exp time for skill time.<br>
<br>
One area I thought I needed more work on was PvP battle. Now I do not play on a PvP server, so I have been spending time around the Freeport arena just seeing if anyone wanted to have some fun.<br>
<br>
I had been trying for about a week to find people around my level to duel without much success, when I came across a necro sitting in the arena. I am 31, he was 39. <br>
<br>
I was going to leave when he sent me a tell saying he wanted to duel. Sure. I need practice so I jump in with him.<br>
<br>
He has a pet cast already and the fight began. I was doing well but in the end he was too much for me. I had worked him down to two bubs though.<br>
<br>
I told him congrats and thought I'd be heading on my way when he asked if I would like to go again.<br>
<br>
Sure I said and I determined that this time I'm going to put to use what I have learned from the safe house. I put on my resist gear instead of normal gear, applied some poison and hopped into the arena. <br>
<br>
He gave me a tell saying he would'nt use a pet this time to give me more of a chance. Mistake.<br>
<br>
He opened with a root. I immediatly began hurling daggers. The root broke quickly and on my run to him I resisted what ever he tried to cast ( I think engulfing darkness ).<br>
<br>
He made the mistake of casting again on the spot and I was already on top of him. I poisoned him successfully and I used the circle method when he began his spell casting and landed a nice backstab. <br>
<br>
He didn't stand still this time. He took off across the arena and rooted me again. He hit me with some dot and his root broke. I start running at him again throwing daggers along the way. I hit attack and landed a few more blows.<br>
<br>
He than ran again and I got yet another backstab on him on his way out.<br>
<br>
Now to this point I had not been paying attention to my health or his. I was too focused on what I was doing. I got rooted again. He hit me with some spell and root broke. Daggers came flying when I got in range. I saw him casting again as I approached. I used the joust method, I learned here at the Safehoust, hit him twice as I ran through and circled when I got just past him and hit the backstab key.<br>
<br>
<br>
142 point shot and his corpse was at my feet. At first I wasn't quite sure what happened. I thought a gaurd or something had killed him. Then I got a tell from him saying he can't believe he got owned by someone 8 levels below him.<br>
<br>
I can't tell you how proud I was. That was the most excitment I have had to date in this game. I wouldn't have been able to pull that off without all the reading I have done here on the Safehouse. Thank's to all that have shared techniques and tactics. It helped.<br>
<br>
I will say we dueled one more time. He of course cast a pet this time and once he finally got engulfing darkness on me, I was pretty much done. Once again though, I did get him down to two bubs.<br>
<br>
He told me after the fight that was the last time he would duel a rogue. His reasoning was if I could do this to him being 8 levels below him, he was scared to think what would happen if was around his level.<br>
<br>
I may have been lucky. Maybe he wasn't that good a Necro. If he had a pet in the second fight I might have lost. These all may be true, but I still feel pretty good about my learned abilities now.<br>
<br>
Just thought I would share and say thanks SafeHouse.<br>

<br>
Next time if you want to screw over his engulfing darkness (or any debuff really) nab you a pumice stone from the local herb shop in town. It's about 17pp and has 5 charges of nullify magic.<br>
<br>
/wink<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work man :)<br>
