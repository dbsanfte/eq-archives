Our guild recently went to VP (just b/c many people had never used their keys before) and got a bunch of useless toys for people and a good drop or two (Rend robe?).<br>
<br>
BUT, it was kind of a pain scrambling to find out the info. I mean, no biggie 'really' you just pull dragon, pick, and dish out 32k damage faster than he kills you all, BUT knowing which resists to load up on a bit more would be nice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Preface:<br>
<br>
	I have never written a guide like this before so I'm certain it will be confusing and slightly lacking.  Feel free to direct any questions to Prysenius on Solusek Ro or at jlunsfo4@attbi.com.  I had a lot of fun learning how to pull in Veeshan's Peak and I suggest most people take the time to learn it themselves.  It was an extremely rewarding time.  However, here is a spoiler guide for those interested.  It can impress your guild a great deal to get single dragons to camp so quickly.  These are all steps I learned first hand, with the help of a few really good monks in my guild.  In the end, we find this the most simplistic way to clear Veeshan's Peak and this is the exact strategy we use everytime we do the zone.<br>
<br>
Setup:<br>
<br>
	After zoning into Veeshan's Peak there is a peninsula 120 degrees to the left.  This spot is completely safe and a good spot to setup for your Coth chain.  To properly setup chain you need to do two things.  First of all bind sight the entry wurms up the ramp and across the bridge to see if any of them see invis.  You'll need to pull and kill each wurm that does see invis.  The other option is snare parking which I will go over under the Hoshkar pull section.  Once all see invis wurms are out of the way you need to do one of two things based on the faction of your mage.  If your mage has ring of scale faction (easiest way) simply have him invis and run to the safe ally.  The safe alley is up across the bridge and to the left.  Going right at the fork across the bridge will bring you to Hoshkar's lair.  Have the mage go all the way to the back of the safe alley and call to there.  If your mage is KoS to ring of scale you'll need to get bind sight on Hoshkar and Silverwing and be sure both are plenty out of the way before the mage makes this run.  Dragons have unusually large aggro radius so be sure both are near the pools area (description of pools under balcony dragons).  Get your entire raid called to that spot and buff up for the first dragon.  A given for this entire spoiler is that if there is a see invis wurm you'll need to kill it.  An important note about Veeshan's peak:  drakes always see invis, racnars never do, and wurms sometimes do.<br>
<br>
Silverwing:<br>
<br>
	The first dragon you'll want to pull is silvering.  The easiest way to pull Silverwing is to have two bards both bind sight on Hoshkar and Silverwing.  Wait on pathing and once Hoshkar is near pools (or even pillars works) and Silverwing is in position pull him.  The wurms guarding safe alley path pretty regularly so just wait until they and Hoshkar are out of the way and pull Silverwing there.  Silverwing will gate to pools so be sure to use any means possible to counter gate.<br>
<br>
Hoshkar:<br>
<br>
	This is the second dragon you'll encounter.  You have two options of where to fight and how to pull Hoshkar.<br>
<br>
Option 1:  This option is far easier to setup for but a much more difficult fight.  You can simply do exactly what you did for Silverwing and wait for the wurms to path and pull him to the back of safe alley.  The pros of this is the pull is very simple and if you wipeout CR is very easy as you die at a safespot.  The cons of this is it can be very difficult to stop Hoshkar's gate when all your melee are slowed.  Hoshkar gates to the lair just up the ramp and to the left.<br>
<br>
Option 2:  This option is far safer as he can't gate but much more difficult to setup.  There are 2 wurms that path in Hosh's lair and 2 wurms on the ramps outside.  The easiest way to seutp is to do the following for this.  Get a ranger in a group with the mage and have them load up invis and snare and levitate.  The timing on this is very critical.  Hoshkar paths through pillars, through pools, and into picture room.  He goes to the top of picture room, stops for a moment and turns around and walks back through pools, pillars, to zone area/lair.  Once Hoshkar starts his voyage back from the top of picture room send your ranger out invis to snare all of the wurms.  He needs to get all four of the wurms.  This gives you about two minutes on Hoshkar's pathing to snare all four and get called.  With a little practice the ranger can get all four snared and run across the bridge towards zone in and get called in one round.  Mobs snared and unaggro'd dont move so you successfully parked all the wurms that would have been in your way to the side, and they are no longer a threat to your party.  Hoshkar will then get to bridge and turn to zone in.  As soon as he turns to zone in have your entire party (they need levi) run to the left into Hoshkar's lair.  There you are in an empty lair and in two minutes Hoshkar will be upon you.  The pros of this are he cannot gate and the cons are that the setup is tricky and the CR is hard.  All the times we've killed him have been in lair.  Once loot is done hurry back to safespot and try to beat the snares wearing off.<br>
<br>
Transition:<br>
<br>
	Once you drop the first two dragons you need to get your party to pools.  If you turn right from safe alley and then turn left (not going to the bridge) it brings you around a ramp.  At the top of the ramp you see a room I refer to as pillars.  Go past the pillar room and continue up another ramp.  Here you see 2 drakes and 2 racnars in front of an arch.  The pool room is just to the right and then an immediate left.  There are purple platforms in pools that is entirely safe.  The goal is to get your mage there to call your party.  Our strategy for doing this is as follows.  I sing Selo's Accelerating Chorus on the party and DA train the drakes, racnars, and wurm all the way to the end of the hall and to the right at the dead end.  I have one monk follow me making sure all mobs get there.  At that point I have a necro, another monk, and a mage rush for the purple platforms.  If the mage dies in the process the monk/necro are responsible for getting to the platforms and rezzing.  Then the monk that ran with me drags me to camp.  After calls are done you have your entire party positioned at pool room.  In this room are two double doors, that is Phara Dar's lair.  Across the pools from where you came is a ramp up to the left (and picture room).  This leads up to the three balcony dragons.<br>
<br>
Xygoz:<br>
<br>
	Position your party all on the purple platforms and have you and a monk get ready to pull.  Have the monk invis up and feign at the end of the balcony.  He is there only to assure that the pull is solo.  Have a rogue move up to the door at the far end of the baclony, this is Xygoz's lair.  When you go behind the locked door there is a ramp to the left and a bridge.  On the other side of the bridge is another door with drakes behind it.  Directly behind the drakes is Xygoz.  I move right before the bridge and sing Accelerating Chorus.  I run across the bridge and when I hit the end of the bridge I start DA.  Moving past the door I DA tank the drakes for a few seconds and Xygoz charges me.  As soon as I'm sure I have Xygoz aggro I use Accelerating Chorus to get back across the bridge.  By this time DA has dropped so I start up song of travel.  As soon as song of Travel is about to pulse simply click of Accelerating Chorus and head to picture room.  I stop at the top of picture room until the monk sees Xygoz leave his lair.  At this point I run to the bottom of the ramp in picture room and wait to see him appear at the top.  Immediately turn and run back to your party and you will have outrun all other aggro.  This brings to camp a single Xygoz.  This method of DA/Accelerating Chorus/Song of Travel/waiting will be used for the following dragons as well.  I won't go through the entire process again but will explain the look of the lairs.  Selo's Accelerating Chorus has made all of these last four pulls extremely trivial for bards.<br>
<br>
Druushk:<br>
<br>
	This is the middle lair and the easiest of all the pulls.  Behind the locked door is a short ramp with a door (and drakes) at the bottom of it.  Right behind this door is Druushk.  I DA in the middle of the ramp and charge behind the door.  Druushk will aggro as soon as you hit the door and you can take off and get up song of travel with ease.<br>
<br>
Nexona:<br>
<br>
	This pull is supposedly the most difficult and many guilds skip Nex just because of the pull.  In my experience, however, I haven't found him anymore difficult than the others.  There is a long twisty ramp behind the locked door.  At the end of the ramp is a bridge with a drake behind it.  I run across the bridge (with accelerating, not song of travel) and start da as soon as the drake hits me.  You turn right and go down the ramp and through the double doors to Nexona's lair.  You need to do this quick before the bridge goes up or you lose precious seconds clicking on it to make it drop down again.  Once behind the double doors Nexona will aggro.  Turn quickly and once across the bridge get Song of Travel up.<br>
<br>
Phara Dar:<br>
<br>
	Behind the double doors in pool room is Phara Dar's lair.  My pull technique is slightly more risky as it gives him an opportunity to gate but the pull is so incredibly simple.  Behind the double doors you turn right.  Follow the path as it curves a little bit to one set of double doors.  This is where I start accelerating chorus.  Running past the first set of double doors you will see some drakes.  Start DA as soon as you see the drakes and run past the next set of double doors.  Once in this Phara Dar will aggro.  Run back out of both sets of doors and once you get back on the path get Song of Travel up.  It's harder to lose aggro here so be sure to not stop and go all the way to pool room.  Get on the far side (across from Phara's entrance) and slightly to the side of your raiding party.  Wait thirty seconds and pathing will make Phara Dar walk directly into the middle of your camp all alone.<br>
