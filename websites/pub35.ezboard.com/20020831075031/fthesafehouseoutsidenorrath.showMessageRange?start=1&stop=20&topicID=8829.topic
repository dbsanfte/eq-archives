ASSOCIATED PRESS <br>
 <br>
SEATTLE, June 1 —  A proposed tax could hit Seattleites where it really hurts: their coffee mugs. A group of child-care advocates, seeking more money for early education, filed an initiative Friday that would place a 10-cent city tax on Seattle’s lifeblood - espresso drinks. <br>
 <br>
BUT IN Seattle, where voters have already voted to tax tobacco, meals and hotel rooms, among other things, initial word of the proposal caused barely a jolt among the area’s latte lovers.<br>
       “Coffee, in a way, it’s kind of a luxury item,” said Patty Grazini, who frequents the Diva Espresso Bar in Seattle’s Greenwood district. “As long as the money went to the programs it was supposed to, I would support it.”<br>
       The Early Learning and Care Committee, which is made up of parents, teachers and child-care directors, expects the tax would raise $7 million to $10 million a year in this coffee-addicted city.<br>
       The money would be used to increase wages for child-care teachers, help low- and middle-income families obtain quality child care and increase the amount of high-quality care available in Seattle, said Lisa Moy, campaign manager of the initiative.<br>
       The committee has until early August to collect the 17,228 valid signatures needed to get the initiative on November’s ballot.<br>
       Melissa Petersen, barista at Diva Espresso, wasn’t so sure the initiative was a good idea. Another 10 cents is a lot to ask for a drink that already can cost $3 to $4, she said.   <br>

  <br>
         “They’ve got a smoking tax, regular taxes, why not a yuppie tax?” Petersen said sarcastically. <br>

<br>
And thats part of the problem. It's easy for the majority to vote a tax on a minority activity.<br>
<br>
I hope they never find your minority activity, and decide to add extra tax to it.<br>
