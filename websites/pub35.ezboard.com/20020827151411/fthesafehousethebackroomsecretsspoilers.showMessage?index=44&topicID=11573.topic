Suuuuure it is.  You just keep telling yourself that and maybe that fragile little ego of yours will stay intact.

<br>
Nobody asked for this to become a dumping ground of &quot;all things spoiler&quot;.  Nobody spends anytime trolling other boards asking people to come here.  Nobody asked for the traffic and nobody would cry to see it cut back.<br>
In the meantime, don't be surprised if a class-specific thread pops up and people here make effort to individually redirect it to the right board, and/or offer information to keep it as relevant as possible to the rogue community.<br>
<br>
Memnenth, I think the idea of a &quot;Other Class Forum&quot; has been suggested before and ruled out by the staff.  As it is, there is not much of a hard-line being taken, but to create a forum for other classes would be an act of invitation.  Currently, I believe the staff that, even if little is done to <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>dis</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->courage class-specific threads, they are taking no action to <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>en</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->courage it either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrumoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grumoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/22/02 4:38:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Options for the visually impaired</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Then why are you here?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

The crap that sometimes spills out onto this message board is entertaining.  However, I will admit on occasion there is some real information here.  Obviously, no thanks to the people screaming about this being a rogue only board though.<br>

That's cute.  Nice detective work, Sherlock.  Anyway, let me clue you in on a little something...you don't run this message board.  Yup, as hard as that is to believe you don't make the rules here.  If I would've made a post in the wrong forum the mods on eqtraders would've moved it to the appropriate forum.  The moderators are the ones who determine what is appropriate and what isn't appropriate for a forum.  If the mods wanted this to be a rogue only forum then they can start deleting all posts non-rogue related.  <br>

Listen I know why Remmi created this message board in the beginning, but back then he didn't have 20 different forums for the Safehouse either now did he?  No kidding this was originally a rogue message board, but due to whatever reason it has evolved into something beyond that.

But your statement was that the entire site is just a spoiler site...a vast difference.  That forum is a SMALL part of the Safehouse and by no means defines the site.  Not even close.<br>

Gruumor, you're so very typical of the bad examples of our guests (Memnenth being a very good example).  You make up accusations and claims with nothing whatsoever to support them.<br>
<br>
I have not, nor anyone else, claimed that they run this board.  I am not a mod.  That does not mean that I am not entitled to voice my opinion or to take a stand where I see fit.<br>
<br>
Just because you can't be respectful of a board does not mean that people who do not like it should hide in other forums.  To quote, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;let me clue you in on a little something...you don't run this message board&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Please, oh wise one, show me where I, or any of our locals here have said that only rogues should post.  Please, show us all where we have sinned.<br>
<br>
Re: spoiler board - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;but due to whatever reason it has evolved into something beyond that&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
More like mutated as a result of external influence.  Which still does not change the intent in the least.  If a million people came here and decided that they wanted the forum or board to be something else, that wouldn't make it so.<br>
<br>
And since you like to quote the titles:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The Back Alley<br>
Spoilers and secrets of <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>the trade</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <br>
To what trade do you think they're referring?  The roguely trade.  Remmi et al have allowed its use to expand to be much more general, but that doesn't change it into an All-Class forum, just a general forum.  Subtle, but important, difference.  A subtlety lost on folks like you, Gurmoor.<br>

Anyway, I found the following very amusing...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;You post the description of ONE FORUM. Yes, that's the purpose of THAT forum, and the Safehouse welcomes players of ALL classes to contribute there on any quest or spoiler they have information on.&quot; - Kuurus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Lannelala says it's a rogue only forum while Kuurus (albeit he is kind of confused in general) says it's for everyone.  So, which is it?  <br>
<br>
Oh and Lanelala of course I had to point out that you weren't a mod.  You seemed a little delusional there for a bit and thought you knew what was allowed on this forum and what wasn't.  If the mods truly wanted this to be a rogue only forum they should just delete all non-rogue posts then there wouldn't be any hassle.  People looking for those &quot;l33t stratz&quot; would leave...end of story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukuurus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kuurus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/22/02 8:08:48 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Options for the visually impaired</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Kurrus, I was referring to this forum...not the entire website.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

While the general board is mostly post such as &quot;RB COMPLETE WUWU ROXX&quot; and &quot;WTF NERF MANABURN ONLY ROGUES SHOULD BE DOING 150+ DPS A SECOND!  BOHOO ME&quot; or the ever delightful &quot;RB NEEDS A COOL PARTICAL EFFECT LIKE A HUGE TORNADO AT THE TOP.  IT WOULD BE ROUGELY&quot; (spelled it wrong again ^_^).  The main source of information is the back alley.  In fact if someone would have made a spoilers only board it would be 10 times more popular than the safehouse.  But its too hard to have everyone jump ship for a new board.  And while the old posters here sit around circle jerking and pointing out someone posted their sig twice or the mod with EQW running in the background while he lvls up his lvl 24 rogue in hhp constantly refreshing the MB so he could see if someones sig is over the limit or a discussion about EQW needs to be locked (oh the irony!) the people who ask a honest question get a smart assed reply about this being a &quot;rogue only&quot; board and to check another board.  Or getting a suggestion only for the rogue class even though he is a wizard.  Yes no wonder this board is commonly known as the $hithouse because thats what it is.  Ego tripping rouges (^_^) spouting out stuff they dont have the slightest clue about trying to save the purity of the board.

Who's calling whom delusional?  Show me where I said that once.  I said that the admins (of old) may have started this forum that way but it has become a general section.  <br>
<br>
Another &quot;bad arguer&quot; trait (that's your 2nd for those who are counting) - misquoting and taking things out of context.<br>
<br>
And now you're just resorting to name calling because you've not a single leg to stand on.  Trait #3.   Steeeerike!<br>
