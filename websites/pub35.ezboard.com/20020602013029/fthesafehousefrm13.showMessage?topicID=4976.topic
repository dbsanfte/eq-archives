Then a couple of friends sent me a tell asking me if I wanted to join them in HS, of course my greedy little mind thought nothing but, &quot;Nice I'm gonna be an erudite!!!&quot;, and I joined them.  After three days of camping nothing but the entrance, and a couple of short ventures into the available wings (we didn't have a full group so we stuck there) I finally looked at my faction messages and realized that the VS faction I had been working on couldn't get any worse, DOH!  Now with the new changes to the &quot;secret handshake&quot; you can only trade while sneaking, not hiding, and of course right accross from the skelly I have to hand the sarnak warbraids to, there are 5 or so blue con skellies that'll hand me my head on a silver platter by the time I hit trade.<br><br>So my question is, does the red wine quest in Neriak raise VS faction for the outpost?  If so will I be able to do it while sneaking?  Also the OT hammer is 2HB (a skill we don't have) but all/all, can anyone confirm with any certainty whether or not I can weild this crazy thing?<br><br>Meff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubearberry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bearberry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/02 10:54:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4976.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looks like I wasted a lot of time in OT...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Now with the new changes to the &quot;secret handshake&quot; you can only trade while sneaking, not hiding<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>You could never trade while hiding.  You became visible when you opened the trade window.  The only difference now is you have to click Hide off manually instead of having it come off by itself.<br><br>EDIT:<br>The red wine quest does not raise VS faction.  The only ways I know of are to do the warbraid quest, or kill dragons in VP.
