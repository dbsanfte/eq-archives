Bard song tash stacks with everything, part of the nature of bard songs - chanter tash won't overwrite it and will stack.  You can do if before or after, but it only lasts 3 ticks unless refreshed.<br><br>Of the two warrior disc tactics (Mighty Strike while berzerk or Furious) I would say Mighty Strike makes more sense and has worked for us against VS.  If the mob is stunned from crippling hits, he can't pingpong (as opposed to Furious), so everybody can go for fully offensive attacks (other melee and nukers) from the get go.  Low delay weapons, timely shouts of when the next warrior starts his Mighty Strike, and making sure the warriors don't regen or get healed out of berzerk mode before using their disc are imperative.<br><br>There is no mention of Nortlav being slowable or not on the shaman boards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urottingmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RottingMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 12:28:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11178.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nortlav Strategy Check - What am I missing?</span><hr size=1> What he is proposing about &quot;bard&quot; tash has to do with weapons that proc lesser forms of tash.
