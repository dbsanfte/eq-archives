<br>
<br>
Now looking back on it, I suppose I can see where I might have been at fault, but that's only if you want to get all technical about it.  The important thing is that we're all still here and have just as many digits as we did before our little excursion… for the most part anyway.<br>
<br>
I'm getting ahead of myself now though, back to the beginning ah, yes, the beginning…<br>
<br>
I guess it all started back about a month ago, I don't quite remember exactly why come to think of it, but for some reason Wixramiablo convinced me to go on a picnic with him off on some tropical desert island.  Seeing as how I had nothing better to do I agreed.  After hiring a few pack mules to carry our beer, we were off.  The trek from the gates of Freeport to the docks in the desert oasis of Ro was a short one, and largely uneventful.  We made good time and soon found ourselves mulling about the piers, waiting for the next departure.<br>
<br>
I guess we'd been there several hours, I'm not exactly sure, time flies when you've got 3 pack mules full of beer.  Anyway, we'd been dosing on and off in the warm sun for goodly while when we were quite abruptly snapped out of our drowsy state.  Some poor dwarven chap, a familiar looking dwarven chap at that, was running towards us for all he was worth screaming oaths so fowl they'd curl even Ozaak's toes.  <br>
<br>
Now the reason for all this hootenanny was really quite obvious, it's excruciatingly hard to miss a 50 foot tall giant, especially when they're swinging tree trunks at you.  Now this familiar looking poor dwarf was in quite a pickle.  He had an ocean on one side of him, and a rabid tree-wielding giant on the other.  That's the kind of thing that ruins weekends, you know.  <br>
<br>
So I did what any red-blooded mighty hero would have done, I threw a rock at it.  Hit him right in the eye too.  Now here's a tip for all you giant slayers out there, giants, especially the rabid tree wielding ones, don't like being hit in the eyes with jagged rocks.  This particular giant was no exception.  He quickly turned his attention to me and drew back to crush me with that awful looking maple of his.  <br>
<br>
Wix, who was either much more, or much less drunk than I'd thought was faster though.  "Grab yer ankles!" he screamed as he charged the giant.  Now I don't know about you, but a 3 foot tall fur ball charging a large foaming-at-the-mouth giant with a big spikey tree in his hand isn't something <i>I</i> see every day.  <br>
<br>
Apparently it wasn't something that our large stinky friend was accustomed to either, he hesitated for a second.  And that was all we needed.  I'm sure the alcohol played no small roll in this but I drew my pig stickers and followed Wix's lead hollerin' for all I was worth, our friend did the same.  I guess the site of a hollerin gnome, a screaming halfing and a caterwauling dwarf triggered the giant's "uh-oh" switch cause he turned and ran like Zulian's mom after a donut down a hill.<br>
<br>
The whole thing was really quite impressive to say the least, I was rather proud of myself as I returned to the rickety old dock.   Our dwarven friend, who upon closer inspection actually <i>was</i> Ozaak seemed a great deal less impressed than I.  He trudged over to one of my pack mules and nonchalantly drank about half of what the yak was carrying.   Now that's not to say that I wouldn't have minded sharing, but he could have at least asked.  Oh well, better not to dwell I suppose.<br>
<br>
Wix, being the friendly sort of fellow that he is immediately invited Ozaak to accompany us on our picnic.  <br>
<br>
"Absolutely not! I'd rather swim in a troll stew than be seen with you two!" he replied bitterly, as only Ozaak can do.  The irony that would come from that statement, is I'm sure, lost on him.  But I appreciate it.<br>
<br>
Deep down I think the crusty old dwarf does really likes us, or our beer.  Either way it only took several reminders that we'd just saved his life to get him to come along.  <br>
<br>
The ferry that would take us to a large island fairly close out into the ocean arrived shortly thereafter and we boarded, through the back of course.  Ever since that new tax secretary had been elected in Freeport ferry prices had skyrocketed.  It was unjust to charge heroes like ourselves such a high fee.  How we managed to sneak the mules on is another story entirely, which I might just decide to share some day, its really quite ingenious I think.<br>
<br>
I'm getting off track again, I tend to do that sometimes, have you noticed?  <br>
<br>
So the ferry pulls up to the island where were ever so discourteously thrown off, I'm going to write a letter to the ferry commissioner about that some day, I think.  <br>
<br>
By now it was getting rather late, and my stomach was telling me that I had a layer of acid burning a hole in it, which is a most uncomfortable feeling, mind you.  So we decided this island was as good as any other and unpacked our basket.  Never in all my days have I tasted such pickles and meat pies. <br>
<br>
"These are some mighty good pickles and meat pies," I said to Wix "you make them?"<br>
<br>
"Of course I did!" he replied defensively, "do these look like anything anyone else would make?"<br>
<br>
I couldn't really argue with that, so I nodded and finished my portion, and part of Ozaak's.  But that's just between you and me.   <br>
<br>
By the time we'd finished night was beginning to creep over the horizon and it was quite clear that we'd be spending the evening on the island, as the ferry probably wouldn't be back until the next morning.  Wix and I didn't really mind though, it was a nice summer night and sleeping by a toasty fire out in the wilderness is good for you.  Ozaak, oddly enough, was indifferent.  I honestly think that dwarf could fall asleep in a pit of brownies if he really set his mind to it.  No sooner had we finished eating than a steady snore coming from his general direction pierced through the quiet night air.  With the aid of the remainder of our ale, me and Wix soon fell asleep too.<br>
<br>
<br>
I couldn't tell you exactly how long we slept, it's rather hard to keep track of time when you're sleeping, I have a theory on that.  Remind me when I'm done telling the story and I'll share it with you.  Where was I? Ah yes, sleeping.  And quite a good sleep it was.  I only wish it could have lasted longer.  Sometime before dawn (see my comment on keeping track of time) I was stirred awake by a loud thumping noise.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Now all of you who've spent a night drinking know that you're usually awakened the next morning by a loud thumping noise, but this one was different.  It was coming from outside my head.  I turned to ask Wix if he'd heard it too, but the spot where he'd been sleeping was empty.  Startled, I whirled around and found myself staring into the most hideous looking face I've ever seen.  At first I thought it was Ozaak, but then I realized that although Ozaak is quite ugly, his ugliness is no match for that of a troll.<br>
<br>
I was then rather unceremoniously thumped on the head with a large club.  I screamed and held my throbbing forehead.  I wont go into detail about what I said, partly because I don't exactly remember, but I'm sure it wasn't very nice.<br>
<br>
	"Gah! Stoopid ganome, joo uppozed to fawl down!"<br>
<br>
	I was then thumped again, only this time, I did fall down.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	I awoke, to what I found out to be a few days later in a crude wooden cage.  I sat up and rubbed my head, which had a noticeable lump resting atop it now, then scanned my surroundings. We were in a cave of some sorts, the stoney walls formed a box on all sides around the cage.  Except to the far side, where an apparent door, if you could call it that let to another area.  The cage was quite a bit bigger than I was, and looked as if it had been built to hold a lot of people.  The bars were so far apart that I would probably have no trouble squeezing through them.<br>
<br>
	"Don't even think about it, I already tried."  It was Ozaak, who was giving me an unfriendly stare from the far corner of the room, next to an unconscious Wix.  "There's trolls running around all over the place out there."<br>
<br>
	"Well thanks for offering to take me along." I replied, rather tartly.  Ozaak shrugged. A sudden thought came to me, and I reached down to my belt looking for something.  "I still have my daggers" I said.<br>
<br>
	"Good, then go kill the army of trolls outside will you? And please hurry I'm beginning to gather dust."  I frowned, there was no reason to be rude about it.<br>
<br>
"I couldn't be exactly sure, since they are trolls but it almost seems as if they're in some sort of a panic"<br>
<br>
"Any idea why?"<br>
<br>
"How should I know? Do I look like someone who understands trolls?"  I chose not to answer that.<br>
<br>
"So how are we going to get out of here?" I asked.  Ozaak pointed to the opening at the far end of the cave. "Well it's a good thing you're hear, I never would have-'" <br>
<br>
I was cut off when Wix began to stir.  "So I guess he's not dead." Ozaak observed in an indifferent tone.  It took a few minutes for him to regain his composure, and then I explained our situation, as much of it as I knew anyway.  <br>
<br>
We'd probably been sitting in there for several hours when we saw a big ugly bulging face peak in.  It turned around and shouted something we couldn't understand and then stepped in.  The troll, who stood nearly to the ceiling of the cave, a good 10 feet, easily three times again the size of me, glowered dubiously down at us.  He was looking us up and down from outside the cage when another troll, slightly shorter entered.<br>
<br>
"joo say da stoo iz uh'wake?" he barked at the other troll. The tall one nodded and pointed at our cage.<br>
<br>
"jah." He replied. Then, as if only then noticing we were there, the second troll peered down at us<br>
<br>
"gud, don let stoo ezcape dis time!" he roared, "joo get no eat if stoo zcapes!  Narf want to eat da greenz!?"  Narf shook his head enthusiastically.<br>
<br>
"If stoo runz 'way gin I clobber dem!" he said viciously, looking suggestingly at us.  <br>
	<br>
	"Why do they keep calling us stoo?" I whispered.<br>
<br>
	"Stew, not stoo." Ozaak shot back.<br>
	<br>
	"Oh" I gulped.  As interesting as it sounds, I can think of a lot of things I'd rather be than stew, or stoo for that matter.   It was at this point I resolved that I would most certainly not be made into some troll's stew.  <br>
<br>
	The shorter troll left, and Narf stood in the room to watch over us, doing his best to look menacing.  I give him credit for trying, but he would have been much more intimidating if he'd just stood there and stared at us.  All this puffing up his chest and growling nonsense made him look more like an overgrown ape than a fierce troll.  <br>
<br>
	"So now what?" I murmured to Wix.<br>
<br>
	"We should be able to overpower one troll.  We did scare off a giant, you know," he whisper back.<br>
<br>
	"True, but trolls are a lot stupider than giants." Ozaak joined in, "stupid to the point of bravery."  <br>
<br>
	"I once saw a lone troll try to attack Kelethin." I said nodding.  I looked over to Narf who was glaring in at us. "No chance of sneaking past him is there?"  Wix shook his head.<br>
	<br>
	"Doesn't look like it"<br>
<br>
  "Wait till he's asleep?" I suggested<br>
<br>
"Its got potential, if we are going to sneak out of here I'd rather do it in the dark when the trolls aren't awake. Rather than in broad daylight." Ozaak chimed in sardonically. Wix gave him a flat stare.<br>
<br>
"You, my friend, have an attitude problem."  Ozaak shrugged.<br>
<br>
"..among other things"<br>
<br>
<br>
So we decided to wait until dark, then make our stealthy escape.  The only problem is, when you're in a cave.  It's hard to tell when it is, in fact dark.  So we relied greatly on this big troll to let us know when to make our move.  <br>
<br>
I guess all his antics meant to intimidate us took a toll on our large green friend, because as the hours flew by he looked more and more tired.  Eventually, he nodded off.  <br>
<br>
Now I know what you're thinking.  "Oh this is too easy! How convenient that the guard just fell asleep like that.  Its not like that EVER happened before"  Well let me tell you something.  That's the way it happened and I can't change it.  So sorry if you were expecting some great tale of how we outsmarted the troll guard, if I ever have the time I'm sure I can make one up for you if it really means that much, but for now this will have to do.  <br>
<br>
And that's it, so we snuck off.  Never to be seen again, and certainly not to be made part of any stew.  So that is why, with great chagrin I have to inform you that the mules we 'borrowed' from you will not be coming back.  <br>
<br>
I can see where you might be quick to anger, but please take into account that by the time you read this I will be most likely 2 continents away from you and much to far to chase.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With all my love,<br>
<br>
