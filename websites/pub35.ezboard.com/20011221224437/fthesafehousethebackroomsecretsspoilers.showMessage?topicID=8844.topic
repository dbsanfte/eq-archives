If you look at the spdat file, there's a lot of new and insane poison-based dots (I think there was one that did 20k damage) where this ability would be the most valuble thing to a rogue in a top end fight.  When a priest can't hit you with a cure poison, you got the button there to save your life.<br>

That said, I'm glad they didn't go through with the throwing skills, but there should be more levels to escape to reduce the timer on it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upherret.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pherret</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/01 12:55:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> I also have a hunch that those Shissars are going to be trouble with their poisons.<br>

The only problem with Purge Poison is that it has that long use timer.  If you're getting poisoned every fight, it's not going to help much, unless the cleric is OOM and you're about to die.  The General Natural Poison Resistance seems more useful and for once, I am thankful for our class poison resistance we get. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrishameyegouger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grisham EyeGouger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/01 2:42:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Very nice Vaslin, Rarely post but this deserved a compliment.

some of these are okay  for pvp(cure pox, bane of knife, or backstab from the front) but really suck otherwise. nothing to really worth spend leveling 51 though 52 16 times unless your 60 on a raid or farming.<br>

<br>
Raven, I think you read the Archetype section wrong (unless you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  really do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> want to put off getting Chaotic Stab for that long <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The first skill level of each Archetype ability costs <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>two skill points</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->. The second skill level of each Archetype ability costs <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>four skill points</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->. The third skill level of each Archetype ability costs <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>six skill points</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So for the prereq for Chaotic Stab:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The Class abilities are only available to characters level 59 and above that have spent twelve skill points to purchase Archetype Abilities.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You'd only have to get to the 3rd level in 1 Archetype Ability to have spent enough points to get a Class ability.<br>
<br>
That's<br>
2 skill points for 1st level +<br>
4 skill points for 2nd level +<br>
6 skill points for 3rd level =<br>
12 skill points spent to max that Archetype Ability...<br>
<br>
At least, I sure am hoping that that's what is meant for the prereqs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rook>Rook</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/ez_icons/personal/pi_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/5/01 4:04:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utotteswede.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TotteSwede</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/5/01 5:33:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Nah, it means you don´t have to spend points in lvl 1 (or 2) but can spend 6 pts directly and get lvl 3 (or so I think at least =)<br>

<br>
The 3 skill points into Improved Natural Regeneration &amp; 3 points into First Aid, would indede be sufficient to start acquiring Melee Archetype Abilities.<br>
<br>
To get class abilities you must spend 12 points in Archetype Abilities.  The minimum number of points you can spend for one level in one Archetype Ability is 2 points, followed by 4 points and then 6 points.  Meaning that it should be impossible to spend 3 points in one Archetype Ability.  You could spend 2 points in 6 abilities, 12 points in one ability, or 6 points in two different abilities.<br>
<br>
When describing points and abilites people need to make a distinction between points spent and levels of abilities gained.  Raven does bring about an interesting point though.  Spreading yourself out a bit more instead of devoting points all into one area may increase ones overall utility more than specializing.<br>
<br>
Personally, im still debating, but I'm thinking of:<br>
point 1: Natural Regen level 1<br>
point 2,3: Natural Regen level 2<br>
point 4,5,6: Natural Regen level 3<br>
point 7,8: Combat Fury level 1<br>
point 9,10: Finishing Blow level 1<br>
point 11,12,13,14: Combat Fury level 2<br>
point 15,16,17,18: Finishing Blow level 2<br>
point 19,20,21,22,23,24: Chaotic Stab<br>
<br>
If it truely takes the roughly the same amount of exp as is required to get through level 51 to gain a skill point, exp wise thats like going from 1st to 59.5th level to gain 24 points. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I hope that the post, where I saw people saying that the same amount of exp to get through 51st would be needed to get one skill point, was in error.<br>

<br>
Your math on Natural Regen is off, it's one point per skill level period.  Which would get you three levels of Natural Regen, and three levels of first aid - the same number of points spent, but you get twice what you thought you would. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uprodigious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prodigious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/5/01 2:47:12 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> i'm planning on doing:<br>

if you have a bad pull say in nTOV and its gonna be a wipeout you have to haul ass unaggro out of aggro range and sneak when you shadow so that you are not immediatly readded to the hate list...remember it doesnt make you non kos and it doesnt make you invisi unless you are out of range so using it right after a backstab may save your but in a fight if you are over aggroed it wont save you from a raid wipe out in 99% of the cases. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulurik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/5/01 7:51:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What?</span><hr size=1> What is it about the regen that people are finding so attractive?

First aid would be the best deal in my opinion.  Healing faster than a mrylokar BP with bandages seems quite nice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=8844.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=8844.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=8844.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=8844.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9186.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8875.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.emailToFriend?topicID=8844.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.threadControl?topicID=8844.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8844.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8844.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers>The Back Alley</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
