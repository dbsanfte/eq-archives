Absor, you out there?</span><hr size=1> In response to Chavr, a lvl 60 Pally's comments...<br>
<br>
Why are there so many non-monk &quot;monk experts&quot; coming her to tell us how much monks needed this nerf?<br>
<br>
I would &quot;assume&quot; that a lvl 60 Pally wouldn't be an ideal one to tell the monk community what they should, and shouldn't be able to do, or what they &quot;should&quot; do.  I mean do you claim to know as much about the monk class as an actual monk who's played that class for months upon months from lvl 1 to lvl 60?  I won't begin to tell you what Pally's are best at, since I hardly consider myself an expert.  Yes, I know the pally basics, heal, do damage, do MORE damage to undead, cast stuns, keep aggro, Lay on hands, etc, the basics.<br>
<br>
And I'm just boggled why this monk nerf went in with the other, obviously needed, profound nerfs to Wizzies and Mages.<br>
<br>
4 or 5 Wizzies taking out a Dragon, who's supposed to take a raid force to kill, and doing this without the Dragon having the possibility to resist this offensive spell, all within a 6 second cast time = obviously overpowering, and trivializing to the game.<br>
<br>
Mages summoning an infinite number of mod rods, having anyone be able to use them at will = virtually infinite amounts of mana = virtually no need to factor in mana conservation when raiding = trivializing of game content<br>
<br>
Monks, a pure melee class that just happens to have good to great defensive skills, and above average melee skills = makes the game trivial and was obviously a nerf waiting to happen? not hardly......<br>
<br>
And without a doubt, if this nerf is to hold strong, the monk class will be forever gimped unless they give us some other offensive compensation for this defensive nerf, afterall, we're looking for a &quot;balance&quot; here right? we're losing a bit of defense, so IMO would make sense to improve our offensive abilities.<br>
<br>
And btw, SK's get Feign Death too (2 different FD's to be exact), and have significantly more hp's than monks, and will now mitigate damage noticeably better than monks, so this should = SK's will be the new pullers, monks will just be a gimped rogue as far as his job on a raid-type mob.<br>
<br>
I have stripped my monk of his gear for now, and it conveniently fits on my new Beastlord.  And yes, I started a monk cuz they were badass, and they could solo, if I get any &quot;well good riddance&quot; etc comments.  IMO they are not the class I bought into they once were, and therefore my interest in them has taken a dramatic plunge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wubao>Wubao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1700<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 1:17:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> nah, monks do more damage than warriors all the time</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that is, dmg between a monk and a warrior, using same haste is so undiscernable that it can be in fact lower, higher, or the same.....but in any situation, it differs so slightly as to make no difference<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I accept your challenge.<br>
<br>
PRE-level 13 monks have dual wield, warriors do NOT. Monks outdamage warriors from the get-go, levels 1 to 13.<br>
<br>
Then we get to the pre-51 game ... <br>
<br>
Compare monk WEAPON SKILL CAPS to warrior SKILL CAPS pre-50.<br>
<br>
Monks are higher.<br>
<br>
Compare monk weapons commonly available pre-50 to warriors commonly available pre-50. Monks are comprable or slightly better.<br>
<br>
Pre-50s, the higher atk rating and the higher weapon skills put monk damage above warrior.<br>
<br>
IN THE 50s ... MONK WEAPON SKILL CAPS tend to always be a step ahead of warrior weapon skill caps until level 60.<br>
<br>
Monks get a higher damage table at 55 and 60.<br>
<br>
Monks and warriors get triple attack at 60. Monks still have that higher damage table.<br>
<br>
Monk weapons in the high end game tend to be superior in damage output than warrior weapons.<br>
<br>
Warriors are forced to sacrifice some DPS in order to use enraging blow weapons to maintain aggro when you get into the AoW and beyond game.<br>
<br>
Monks have Flying Kick as a special attack, which does more damage over time than the warrior options of SLAM and KICK.<br>
<br>
Overall, from level 1 to level 60 and beyond, monks have held a DPS EDGE over warriors of the same level and same haste. Be it from dual wield in the early days ... higher skill caps in the middle levels or higher damage table in the end game.<br>
<br>
NOW, that being said ... monks SHOULD do more damage than warriors. Or else there'd be no reason to PLAY a monk as a warrior would be the superior selection if they had higher DPS.<br>

Absor, you out there?</span><hr size=1> The issue here is that there are two types of monks.  You have the extremely well equipped monk and then you have the average monk.  But even then, that doesnt change anything.  A monk with high level gear compared to a warrior with the same level of gear, OR a mid level monk with gear compared to a mid level warrior with comparible gear will be pretty much equal.  I was talking to a monk today in our local uber guild and he said that the damage difference between a monk and a warrior (in the end game) with equal gear, was about 5%. You say our role is &quot;puller, FD, mend&quot;.  What happens when verant, who already stated that mobs were never intended to be &quot;pulled&quot;, decides to change something else.  We've already seen it, FD is nothing like it was in its original form.  So many things have changed with aggro, and how FD effects mobs.   You say we have alot of discipline abilities that help us.  Offensively, we have 2 disciplines that are remotely worth using.  Innerflame and hundred fist.  Inner flame just gives us a x3 damage for about 18 seconds, and hundred fist gives a haste boost for about the same time.  Thunderkick, Silent fist and Ashen hand are all pretty much never used (thuderkick is used as a novelty, but nothing more).  Defensively, our most useful disc for pulling is stonestance, which halves damage taken for about 18ish seconds.  Whirlwind (riposte disc) and voiddance have long reuse timers, so they are not really effective for pulling.  So, of all our discs that we have, only 3 are really used commonly, the others are either novelty or only used in dire situations.<br>
<br>
You also mention that we have so many available equipment options.  While monks are certainly getting better gear (with the release of velious and luclin), I think were still behind the curve as far as gear is concerned.  One reason is because monks are limited to blunting weapons, while other tanks are able to use any type of weapon.  Combine that with the fact that alot of the really good blunt weapons are also usable by other melee classes, kinda makes it a moot point.  Going back to equal monk vs. equal warrior in dps, the gap there is sometimes not very large, so to say monks offense is overpowered can be misleading somewhat.  I see rangers going 900+ crits with their bows, I hear of paladins doing 1500-3000+ damage to undead mobs with slay undead (granted that is situational).  You dont see many monks being able to pull off those kind of crits, or that kind of damage in general (granted, im speaking from the mid-range monk point of view).  <br>
<br>
I'm all for warriors getting a boost, and it's great that they got one, will make high level mob encounters that much easier, however, it was done at the monks' expense, which I think could have been done differently.  <br>
<br>
Many times people have stated that you dont see monks tanking in high end raids, and that is true.  I doubt you will ever see a guild choose a monk to tank vindicator, statue, AoW, Ntov, sleepers or VT mobs.  In xp groups, yeah, a monk can tank in a cinch, but so can warriors, pallys, sometimes rangers and maybe even rogues.<br>
<br>
From what ive heard, the mid-range monks are feeling it more than the upper end monks.  This is where the patch went wrong.  They didnt solve the problem at hand.  The problem wasnt with mid-range monks, it was with uber monks who were able to get close to 1500AC and 6k hps, and were able to stand toe to toe with alot of the upper end mobs.<br>
<br>
I dont hold anything against uber monks, they spent their time to get where they are, however, this whole ordeal didnt fix the problem.  It may have dilluted it a bit, but uber monks will mostly likely continue being able to do what they have done before, while mid range monks will end up having it harder.  So, what was fixed?<br>
<br>
Now then, the damage is done, and it's unlikely they are going to change or reverse what has already been done.  What can they do about it?  Well, for starters, why not increase monks offensive power enough so that they were at the same point of soloability as they were before, and this will put them enough ahead of warriors to justify the nerf (5% damage difference isnt enough of a gap, and at its current state, warriors now have the best of both worlds, better damage mitigation, better AC, better hps, and equal and sometimes better offense).  This will allow monks to solo as effectively as they did before, but they will not be able to tank like some of them were able to.  <br>
<br>
I believe that every class has it's place, and that no class should be more powerful than any other, everyone should be equally powerful, but each class should be powerful in the job they are meant to perform.  Sure, we'd all like our characters to be the most powerful class in the game, but that isnt going to happen, and wouldnt lend to a fair and balanced game.  If monks are to have damage mitigation equal to that of a ranger, paladin, or a chain class, then our offense should be boosted beyond them to offset those classes having magical abilities or having much more powerful special attacks. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.cox-internet.com/tgxweb/ezboard/grigglogo.jpg">

<br>
sorry buddy<br>
<br>
next argument.......compare monk weapon skills to war wep skills...pre-50? um, they are the same, with regard to HTH being higher, yet, if any monk uses fists (like they should), they are out of the competition on SUCKING anyway.......what it in fact is, is that warriors slow down in leveling their wep skills at level 40, yet monks continue to get the 5 per lvl all the way on up, with bonus caps removed here and there...<br>
hybrids suffer from the same thing on an even larger scale, they dont gain wep skills from 40 to 50 at all, they are already at 200 at 40, and dont get to go over until 51......(or 50? im not sure)<br>
what do weapon skills relate to? they relate to MISSES.....so yes, someone who misses less will do more damage......i give you that one.....but then you go on to say that monk weps are equal to or better in ratio/effects then warrior weps available at the same lvl? what are you smoking? super-wu-tang-asian-herb? mr lvl 30 monk with a fighting baton is a twink, buddy.......where the hell do you think monks can even GET actual WEAPONS before lvl 30 anyway? less we wanna use store bought staves (which were fun to run around with in beta looking cool).......im not including luclin, luclin is new and has fucked up EQ beyond repair as we are seeing now anyway, so all the HTH weps dont count (could count in all the war weps up there then too but i dont know luclin well enough).  i think its time you try playing monk again using only what you can personally rip off a cold dead corpse.......youll be outdamaged by untwinked warriors your entire life......<br>
monk fists are a joke, but thats what youre gonna rely on......<br>
<br>
sorry buddy<br>
<br>
next argument......after 50 monk skill caps take a leap over warriors again, to make up for some of the nonsense theyve had to put up with.....they even get a higher dmg table (which NOBODY knows the effects of), and they even get upgrades to their fists (which are equivalent, at lvl 50, to that fighting baton i mentioned)<br>
monk weapons in the high end game, you say, seem to be superior to dmg output then war weps? well i dunno what CRACK yer smoking now, but how do you calculate damage output of a wep? the only way _I_ know how to do that, realistically, is by calculating its ratio and stat/proc effects.......and in this realistic way to compare weapons damage output, monk weps dont even come close to warrior weps........the best droppable monk weps in the game right now will get you looking at the 2 lifeproc weps (the katar and ulak, of which i use).....having BOTH a LOWER ratio then your common fleshgringer, which is not even close to being the best droppable wep in the game and even comes off a lower lvl encounter.....not only do they both have lower ratio, but they both have less dmg proc, but lets disregard procs for the moment and give monks benefit of the doubt (something we'll have to do alot if we want to actually try and make monks 'seem reasaonble at melee dmg')<br>
<br>
sorry buddy<br>
<br>
next argument......monks have flying kick......yup, you win this one...not even gonna touch it.......except to say that when a warrior stuns an opponent, with slam lets say, the opponent CANNOT USE DEFENSIVE SKILLS......such as dodge block etc (the war can still miss of course)......this works on NPCs, dunno if it works in duels, used to all across the board (as dueling was considered targetting an NPC, but PvP servers needed that to be changed or every wizard/necro would just own joo).....however, i still agree that monks over time do more damage with FK then a warrior can even hope to do with slam or kick (even though war will do considerably more dmg after a successful slam)<br>
<br>
<br>
one thing you neglect is that wars all throughout the game will have more str then a monk.....good wars will also have more dex......good wars will also do lots of crits.......this added up gives them an equalizer in the fact that monks will have higher skill caps........in the END END END game, both monk and war have maxed str and dex, so a monk outdamaegs a war.....especially one that followed your example in sacrificing DPS to enable him to hold aggro etc.....<br>
<br>
if a war WANTED to, however, (and this is the case with 99% of players from 1 to 55, until they start getting into end game), he/she could easily equip him/herself to outdamage a monk in 9 out of 10 situations.......<br>

<br>
&quot;next argument.......compare monk weapon skills to war wep skills...pre-50? um, they are the same, with regard to HTH being higher, yet, if any monk uses fists (like they should), they are out of the competition on SUCKING anyway.......what it in fact is, is that warriors slow down in leveling their wep skills at level 40, yet monks continue to get the 5 per lvl all the way on up, with bonus caps removed here and there...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
- So you say monk weapon skills are equal to war weapon skills pre 50 and then go on to say that past level 40 monks keep raising their skills (with dual wield maxed at 252 at level 36). <br>
<br>
40 skill raises = big difference. As if you were not contradicting yourself enough already you say that a monk misses less than all melee pre 50 due to this skill level disparity (psst. they also give us raw atk bonus in the offense skill department). <br>
<br>
A warrior can't hold a candle to a monk pre 50 damage wise in similar equipment, and post 50 if you see each and every one of the logs posted regularly on this board you will see that on average monks do outdamage warriors by a good margin. <br>
<br>
&quot;where the hell do you think monks can even GET actual WEAPONS before lvl 30 anyway? less we wanna use store bought staves (which were fun to run around with in beta looking cool).......im not including luclin, luclin is new and has fucked up EQ beyond repair as we are seeing now anyway, so all the HTH weps dont count (could count in all the war weps up there then too but i dont know luclin well enough). i think its time you try playing monk again using only what you can personally rip off a cold dead corpse.......youll be outdamaged by untwinked warriors your entire life......<br>
monk fists are a joke, but thats what youre gonna rely on......&quot;<br>
<br>
If you're not a moron, you will diligently sell spell reagents to higher level players for decent cash and will not be prancing around with a fine steel great staff at level 30. Don't compare damage with not knowing what the fuck to do as a low level character to aquire money and items. Plus, monks are on a higher damage table than the rest of melee pre 50, and post 50. That means that if you equip a warrior with a jade mace at level 30, and a monk with a jade mace at level 30. The monk will hit harder than the warrior with that same weapon. <br>
<br>
Monk fists were meant as a pre kunark weapon and widely outdamaged whatever a warrior could muster in the old world as the monk leveled. <br>
<br>
Harder hits + less misses = more damage (amazing, no?). <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;if a war WANTED to, however, (and this is the case with 99% of players from 1 to 55, until they start getting into end game), he/she could easily equip him/herself to outdamage a monk in 9 out of 10 situations.......<br>
<br>
