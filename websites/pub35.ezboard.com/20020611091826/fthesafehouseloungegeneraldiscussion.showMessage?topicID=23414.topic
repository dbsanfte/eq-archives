Basically it was 'those who level fast' and 'those who level slow'.  Those organized guilds who leveled fast moved on to Venril and Trakanon faster than any others... They get VP keys, and were able to farm VP 3-4 months without anyone coming up to challenge them.  All the while, the rest of the servers followed in their footsteps and began to collect the items needed for VP keys... then...<br><br>Velious hits.  People who are reasonablly well equiped begin to spread out into spawns, learning the factions, and dropping mobs.  The line here was drawn in that some people simply lacked the strategy for the new high end difficulty encounters.  Those that were willing to max factions were the first to learn quests and upgrade their items (kael armor, skyshrine armor) and the ones that were first at getting armor were the first to farm the ubermobs.  Finally sleepers keys were the big race for velious, and that race ended in removing the sleepers tomb loot entirely from the game.  The line between 'have' and 'have nots' was drawn for good.<br><br>Now, in luclin, the line is drawn in a different style.  Its all about time investment and long camps, that involve incredible time consumption that very few guilds are willing to put up with.  Farming Serubane or Shissarbane weapons puts 'uber' on a whole new level.  <br><br>only those guilds who have either <br><br>1)mass number of people to hold down the camp 24/7 <br>2) have people that play constantly...<br><br>are going to ever really see the farming of these mobs.  Those that havent begun the farming, arent going to see these mobs before PoP pure and simple.<br><br>So now, the true 'have' and 'have nots' line is drawn in the dirt for good.  FoH is the only guild on their server, at least for an INCREDIBLY long time, that will see seru loot.<br><br>Now, if you all agree with that, I'd like to hear comments on it.  What do you think?  Is this good, or is it bad?  Do you approve?<br><br>My opinion is this:<br><br>I think its great to a very limited extent.  As long as its 2-3 mobs in the game that require this kind of time investment, and the time investment is justly rewarded (pre nerf BP from seru, for example... not post nerf... which is kind of horrid).<br><br>But for your average high end guild, most are going to choose to continue to farm NTOV until they've gotten every possible item out of it.. before they'll move on to the basement of SSRA.  That's not that bad of a thing, I guess, though it will continue to put pressure on the high end mobs that do NOT require ring events or farmed items to defeat.<br><br>Anyways, sorry if this seems like rambling.  just wanted to get some opinions. <p><center><table COLS=2 WIDTH="400" border=1><tr><td><center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>Tabb Alt</font></font></b><br>Test Server Cleric<br> <p>Proud Member of<br> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2><a href="http://www.primalbrood.com/">PrimalBrood</a> </font></font></center><br> </td><td WIDTH="10%"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48478"><img SRC="http://www.prexus.com/uberwolf/tabb.jpg"  BORDER=0 height=177 width=120></a></td></tr></table></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulannellavelglarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lannella Velglarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/lannella/leaf.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 1:17:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23414.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/lannella/nextlevel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The line has been drawn...</span><hr size=1> A guild on DRo, apparently, just made such a decision.

We want what they've got, but we can't or don't want to put the time into it.  Is the game designed around that 2% of players?  Sort of.  <br><br>Because of that 2% most of us won't:<br><br>1) Go to PoM<br>2) Go to Sleepers and see the sleeper sleeping<br>3) Ever kill a Kunark dragon (because mana burning wizards count to 3 and unleash faster than any guild can coordinate)<br>4) A bunch of stuff in Luclin<br><br>Is this the creme de la creme collecting their just rewards for suffering through Verants roadblocks?  Or is it punishment for those that develop a little slower?  Or both?  Well, it's all subjective.  I can certainly understand Verant's intention to put in challenges for the top 2%.  I can understand the top 2%'s desire to be &quot;the first&quot;.  And I can sympathize with the 98% that is coming up along behind and missing out on a lot of content I'd love to see... <br><br>But, maybe there should be a REAL *end* to the game.  The top 2% inevitably sneer at the attempts to keep them busy.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ualdarionshard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aldarion Shard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 11:28:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23414.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> yup</span><hr size=1> i have to agree.<br><br>what is so wrong with the concept that a person who plays this game, say, 4 hours a night should be able to SEE everything?<br><br>no, not kill all gods and dragons adn kings.  but SEE them.<br><br>i firmly believe that Verants roots in the twisted universe of time-sinks that are MUDs will keep them in this ridiculous mindset forever.<br><br>note to verant-- Hi, i play everquest.  when will i get to enter PoM/Vex Thal? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugooda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gooda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 11:29:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23414.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The line has been drawn...</span><hr size=1> How about a Sleeper type event that uber_farm_guild_2003 causes that takes them 6 months to collect all the keys to open uber_zone_105, that causes the door to be permantly opened for the whole server.<br><br>*gasp*<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukidkod1ak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kidkod1ak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 11:47:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23414.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The line has been drawn...</span><hr size=1> You know Gooda thats like the best idea I have heard in a long time.

They have some how managed to give players obstacles and something to do, who spend more time playing this game, then the developers have spent creating it. They have a product that allows me, a casual player less then 15 hours a week to have fun/something to do, while at the same time, Johnny ubah, 40+ hours a week, also has fun/something to do. <br><br>I can't imagine how they satisfy a player who plays 40+ hours a week. If you think I am exaggerating the time mentioned above, just visit the board of your server’s ubah guild. 40+ hours a week is nothing.<br><br>Also, I salute the Ubah players too! I am sincere. I really do admire their commitment to setting a goal and then reaching it. Can you imagine the pressure the leader(s) of such a guild is under? And can you imagine the PITA of motivating 40 some people to the same goal everyday? Hell, sometimes I feel guilty when the group I am in whipes out. How about when a whole guild gets crushed?<br><br>Now, on to a selfish issue, I love those 40+ hour a week albinos.

So please upgrade the BFG 8800 with the BFG 9000, I have been saving for the BFG 1200 anyway.<br><br>I am happy for the ubahs, enjoy yourselves my brothers and sisters. Will the ubah tire of what they have set out to do? yes, but don't give up! the prize is at hand! <br><br>I am happy for the casual player, because you are never going to run out of things to do. Will you ever see the sleeper? No, but so what? There is so much great stuff that doesn’t require 50+ people and hundreds of man-hours to do.

The thing about sleeper keys is they are built into the natural progression of a guild.  To some extent thats not true, but to for a large part it is. Further the sleeper keys are fairly &quot;come out for this *woot* go home&quot; events.   The luclin keys on the other hand are not in the natural progression of a guild.  There is nothing like go fight a dragon (learn more strategy, get some loots, get a key, go home) for luclin keys Acrylica for example involves somthing akin to a progressingly difficult caller quest: for one key for one person.  In other words in the larger pattern the time spent on luclin keys is time spent JUST FOR THAT KEY.  Again that is soooo much different then sleeper keys.  For the old velious patterns to hold you would have to get acrylica keys from the RoF quest say a 25% chance at wave 3 and a 100% chance finish wave 4.  THEN the key would drop in what would be a natural progression for a guild.<br><br>Again on so many levels velious shows itself to be a master stroke of design next to luclin.<br><br>So to put it into context i look at the sleeper key and got hell ya verant were getting those one day.

Its been the concept from the begining.  People who work harder get the better rewards, and some of those rewards are getting to go places that the normal person cannot go.<br><br>Think about this, would Sleepers be considered special if it wasnt keyed after guild x released sleeper?  No, it would be another farm fest.  Mind you I dont agree with the way ST works (releasing him SHOULD be a positive thing) but its the same thing with VP, VT, Emp, Seru, ect ect ect.  It would not be special, there would be no point in getting more powerful because everyone else can go do the same things you do ... other than the fact you did it first, which only lasts you so long.<br><br>However, something like Veen mentions where if say someone killing Ventani had instead opened up a whole new zone called Happy_Smile_Land for the mid 50's crowd, then THAT would be fine, and a positive thing.  But if, say, releasing the sleeper opened up ST to joe schmoe ... then what was the point of releasing the sleeper ever?  That would be stupid.

Thats a premise that the game is based on, and the only way to get there is though *gasp* work!  The same things those people in uberguilds do!  Wowzers!

The uber guilds are able to do things because they've got a lot of certain classes, a lot of play time, a lot of numbers when they need them.  How much content do you need to actually set aside just for them?<br><br>Now, it's one thing if the uber's get there first and others get there later.  That's no big deal.  VP, as an example, isn't that bad.  Most of the stuff spawns often enough, only Verix is really annoying and his area is decent xp.  The rest, a small amount of time camping mobs that are xp sometimes to a 60 or else swing by with a tracker from time to time.  It's cake if you aren't in a rush.  Sleepers, similiar type of situation.  Kill a few mobs you wouldn't mind killing for other reasons.  It takes time, it takes effort, but neither is excessive.<br><br>Are Serubane weapons and what it takes to get the Vex Thal key though?  Time will tell... but I don't fancy forced hunting in various places for hours on end to get keys.<br><br>Gear and levels... that will eventually even out.  Numbers will eventually matter less due to gear and levels.  But time... time doesn't change.  No way to increase drop rate, no way to decrease spawn time, no way to increase spawn chance.<br><br>Anyway, I'm not going to worry too much about keyed stuff.  My guild can't handle what is in Vex Thal and we can't handle Seru.  We won't for quite a while.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unumruk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numruk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md96-jma/eq/canada.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/24/02 7:52:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23414.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/palad/smallskel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The line has been drawn...</span><hr size=1> Well I think Verant just wisened up, and realized they have all those &quot;uber&quot; people that will willingly pay them to beta test their game.
