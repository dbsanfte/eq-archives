<br>
Hi all.<br>
Don't bother, I didn't even bring my wallet. I knew what sort of crowd I would be hanging out with…<br>
<br>
I just popped in to let you know that I am going to start reading this thread shortly. But I'm also not the only one reading these threads. And I have a preliminary response from the team about the possible (and I repeat – possible) changes to be made to rogues (and, actually, some other classes as well):<br>
<br>
We've decided on another tack for changing Evade.<br>
<br>
Instead of setting you to 120 (current Evade), or reducing your total hate by 33% (our first intended change), this is what we are thinking of doing.<br>
<br>
If the rogue is #1 on the hate list, a successful evade will lower his hate to a point between the 2nd and 3rd person on the hate list.<br>
<br>
If the rogue is NOT #1 on the hate list, a successful evade will lower the total hate by a few percent, allowing &quot;pre-evade&quot; to remain a viable tactic.<br>
<br>
At no time will Evade increase a rogue's hate, it will always reduce it. <br>
<br>
Now for other changes:<br>
<br>
Bind Wounds: Skill cap pre-50 for Warriors and Rogues was 100. We are likely to be moving this to 175, with a max skill of 210. This would mean a 70% binding well before 60th level. We're also adjusting other classes caps higher as well, but in reality, only Monks, Warriors and Rogues used Bind Wounds with any frequency, and only Pure Melee and Priests will be able to bind to 70% of maximum hit points.<br>
<br>
Pick Pockets: Instead of a hard level cap at 45th for target NPCs, we're leaving it as it stands up to level 50 for the player. After a player is past 50th, it is (Player Level)-5 to set the level of an NPC whose pocket you can pick. All other pick pocket restrictions will remain in place, no magic or no-drop items can be purloined. So, to simplify this, at 60th you can steal from 55th or lower NPCs.<br>
<br>
Instill Doubt/Backstab/Special Attacks. We are not going to change the functionality of this, but we are going to make Instill Doubt gray out backstab and vice versa until the timer has expired. This should make it easier to know when you can use the skill, and prevent a lot of dud Instill Doubt attempts.<br>
<br>
We simply can't make stackable poisons without a great deal of coding, and we feel that poison as it stands now is workable.<br>
<br>
Hide and Sneak through zonelines/logoff/linkdead is possible, but once again, will take a significant amount of coding and testing. We're not saying no to this, but we are also not promising that we will do it.<br>
<br>
Alan<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
______________________________________________________________________________<br>
Evade: Best viable option (so far)<br>
Instill/backstab: Best viable option<br>
PickPocket: More than we coulda asked for<br>
Poisons: Admittance that it's possible == More than we coulda asked for<br>
Hide/Sneak: Admittance that it's possible == More than we coulda asked for<br>
<br>

This proposed change destroys the rogue class.  Putting us at 2nd to 3rd on the list does 2 things.  Makes the top 3 on the list rogues at all times, and makes us dead shortly after. <br>
<br>
I will be the 1st to admit... rogues can dish out a ton of damage... and evade may have been a bit overpowered with how far down the list it puts you... but cmon Kendrick, lets have a compromise.  This proposed change is out of control.<br>

<br>
I have become VERY vocal on this issue. Probably downright obnoxious. That is how strongly I feel about this proposed change and I will speak my mind fully to try to disuade the powers that be from implementing it.<br>
<br>
Let me try to be as honest as possible about this.  Any rogue who is passive about this proposed change cares nothing for their future as a character.  Damage dealt is the reason I have grown to love rogues. I put up with pre-evade life.  And backstabbing for 7.  It almost made me quit.  ENOUGH with the 6 month too late changes already... I understand the need to &quot;balance&quot; and I can accept that.  But for crying out loud... does it have to destroy a whole class? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uminionx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MinionX</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 7:46:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~minionx-podw/pokepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Absor comments in rogue thingy...</span><hr size=1> I personally believe now that if you want to work at verant..<br>

Mucking around with evade sounds like disaster waiting to happen.<br>
For those of you that haven't fought big targets like trakanon yet, you get like 2 chances to evade and you are dead.<br>
<br>
Evade as it is may very well fail due to the lag and movement bug in such encounters. In its current form, an uber mob probably will turn on you several times in the fight even with chain evading. This lowering you down 2.5 spots on the hate list is a major nerf. I can see the dead rogue jokes all over again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Before they messed with the hate list evade moved you down like 6 on the list (assuming the list was 6 long ?)

I think they would rather implement something like this: *ONCE the rogue does XXXX amount of damage, the rogue will be automatically DT'ed.*  But then, that's pretty much out of the question.  Thus, they figured out a way to overall lower our damage output without being that direct.  I believe that we can still be good damage dealers... Just going to be dying a lot afterwards...

The sentiments I have shared on this board are not unique, as many other avid rogues see the implications as well to this change. When you play an everquest rogue for 150+ days of your life and you are involved in just about every game dynamic there is, you tend to get a feel for what works and what won't work.  Like I said before, I admit that evade may have been somewhat overpowered in it's currrent state.  Yes there are fights I can go with autoattack on the whole time and due to preemptive evading I never get aggro once.  However those fights are few and far between, with the norm usually being a necessary near death evade or disc.  Evade is not fool-proof, even by skilled players.  This being said, I could handle an nerf evade... the 33% reduction in hate sounded fine to me... the &quot;placed between 2nd and 3rd on list&quot; nerf is not. Maybe I have misinterpretted what was said by kendrick, but given his example in the other thread I think I am quite accurate in assuming they are going with the latter.  <br>
<br>
I will not reserve judgement until how I see it works in-game.  The fact is a change like this should never get implemented in the 1st place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uminionx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MinionX</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 8:17:33 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~minionx-podw/pokepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Absor comments in rogue thingy...</span><hr size=1> I have a feeling the Crys spear will be popular for main hand use again..<br>

<br>
Actually I never really felt evade was super powerful.  And we all know how aggro works with the tough mobs like Velk.  My &quot;position&quot; on the hate list never meant a damn thing as much as my proximity to the mob.  Hmm.  <br>
<br>
I think it would be nice if a successful evade made the mob attack the closest warrior to give the illusion that their taunt actually did something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucilob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cilob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 9:05:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.carolina.rr.com/sg/images/cilob.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Absor comments in rogue thingy...</span><hr size=1> Hmm can you imagine in a group with two rogues it will be constant ping pong regardless of the other classes.

Ahh, memories... having a Trident of The Seven Seas in Sol B, and telling the party &quot;ok EVERYONE has to attack the mobs with ALL THEY HAVE, or I will die instantly, nuke at will, attack your hardest, and you wont have to heal me 'tooo much' and I will get a couple backstabs in&quot;<br>
<br>
Or, in the avatar room, way back in the day... &quot;OK Wizzie, NUKE your hardest nuke, I'll get a backstab in right away, and the mob will be right back on me, don't worry, I can pull mobs off ANYONE&quot;<br>
<br>
*grin* anyone else remember those days? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubedrenkenpigsticker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bedrenken Pigsticker</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/bedrenken/halfman.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 9:56:36 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bedrenken/bedrude.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Absor comments in rogue thingy...</span><hr size=1> I do Woodash, and that's why I'm quitting EQ now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Bedrenken Pigsticker<Br>

<br>
What would happen? Oh, the tank would taunt the mob off me. Yeah. It would be aggroed on Mr. Paladin for all of about 1.2 seconds, IF THAT, before a single double-attack with my MUCH faster primary weapon spun it back around to face me.<br>
<br>
I imagined that I could do a lot of damage with backstab. But unless there was another rogue in the group, I rarely saw the back of a creature to try it out after the first 20 seconds of combat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uslapus1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slapus1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 2:41:49 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://microsoftninja.virtualave.net/portrait.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Absor comments in rogue thingy...</span><hr size=1> WOOT PICK POCKET<br>

2)The bind wound thing is great also. <br>
3) The bug fix on the buttons greying out is nice also.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the cookies. As for the evade thing, it was buggy anyway. Maybe there tinkering will make it work right. I know people at VI, don't think it was buggy. I have been wipped from the hate list with it. I have evaded and had the mob continue pounding on me. I have passed mobs fighting pc's and hit hide on the other side of the dungeon, and had their unengaged mob cross the dungeon to get me. It's not working as they think it is now. When they change it, if it automatically  sends you to the third spot, evade may actually be getting an upgrade. It may also help us maintain our hate list position above of casters.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the spokesman for these changes is not competent at public relations (not Kendrick). As a spin doctor his skills are very poor. If the evade changes had been phrased in a different way, the concerns over this issue would not exist. Needlessly upsetting customers is pointless. Below I have put an example of a different approach to the coming changes in evade.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
As part of the class balancing review of Rogues, we will be taking another look at evade. We have been receiving complaints about evade displaying strange behavior. These reports began this fall after we expanded the hate list to 60 players. These reports include evade wipping agro, not causing the mob to switch targets after a successful evade, actually causing the rogue to increase agro on failures, and pulling mobs across dungeons.<br>
<br>
I realize evade is a pivotal skill for Rogues, so we are proceeding with the utmost caution in how we change it. Our goal is to fix the current bugs and allow rogues to control there agro on a finer level.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwindupbirdie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Windup Birdie</A> at: 2/8/01 11:36:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwiggystabsalot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wiggy Stabsalot</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.followmearound.com/images/artwork/lostchild.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/01 7:37:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Absor comments in rogue thingy...</span><hr size=1> I'd like to post and thank Wendy for stepping up on this.  If people like you and Tigole get behind this, it helps us all.  I've definately seen you post before, but never in this fashion.  It makes me happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To sum up, when I posted the changes that Verant is proposing on my guild board, I was asked to make a link to where it said this because it was hard to believe that Verant would make evade so ineffective, even if you aren't a rogue.<br>
<br>
This effects everyone.  This isn't a problem that is going t go away.  This is a change that is going to get everyone saying &quot;Verant, please fix this&quot; once it goes live.  Class balance isn't about milking Verant to get your class to be the best, it's about overall improvements and changes because rogues tanking will effect an entire raid, not just rogues.<br>
<br>
Verant, please, don't make me stop attacking to reduce aggro.  It's what we do best.  It's like cutting warrior hps, or nerfing CHeal, etc.  I've always loved playing a rogue.  I've played a rogue since the week EQ went live, and I know some have played longer.  I don't want to quit, but if I start becoming a liability to my guild on raids, I will. <p><hr>
