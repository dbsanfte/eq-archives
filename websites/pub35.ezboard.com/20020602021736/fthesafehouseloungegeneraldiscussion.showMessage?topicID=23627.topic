<br>
Since horses were introduced, what about trained animals/pets you could buy.  (Yes yes class balancing and all that crap =P)  The pet may not fight, but be more like a wizard's familiar, giving a sort of buff or effect, maybe a proc like the beastlord pets.  This would take more pp out of the economy, yay for VI!  I have no intention of buying a horse, though I can afford the 9K one and still have a some plat left.  <br>
BUT a pet that would A) Look cool, B) Provide a use other then run speed, thanks jboots, C) Give me a new toy/fun, and D) Take plat out of the economy for Verant.<br>
<br>
Was also thinking, dunno if at all possible.  Make an EQ variation where zones are switched around, switch the karana zone layout with say rathe mountains.  Change it up, make it so people can explore again.  Not know where everything is, exact locs, if the zone is now safe for your level...<br>
This might bring back the awe-inspiring feeling everyone had the first time they logged into EQ.  <br>
<br>
I remember my first experience, I made a half-elf ranger, looking around surefall glades I got stuck inside the building not knowing how to open the door rofl.  When I went outside I see two people just chilling sitting on a hill with their wolf!?!?  I get a weapon and pointed towards Qeynos, I die along the way, and go make a new character to check out the rest of the world.  <br>
<br>
Now-a-day everything seems bland, same ol' same ol'.  On innoruuk message boards several people in the last couple weeks have announced they are quitting.  More dynamic content please!<br>
<br>
---The idea about the building spires and druid rings requiring help from many people is also very good, there was thread a while ago on that.  <br>
<br>
Anyone else got ideas/comments? <p><CENTER>

I'm sure EQ2 will have more expandability for a dynamic world but we're stuck w/ the infrostructure we got for now. <p>--------------------------

<br>
Well, a lot of Wizards don't like having their drake/imp constantly flapping and making noises in their ears or making it so their view is obstructed.  Verant is planning to make it where Wizards can choose whether or not they want their familiar flying around or just the buff.<br>
<br>
Imagine going to a raid where everyone on it had a familiar:  Can you imagine the lag of having 50 people and 50 drakes flying around?  That's the main reason I'd be against it.<br>
<br>
It is a cool idea, but I just see too many problems with it unfortunately. <p><div align="Center"><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg" alt="Cantatus - Phantasmist and Artisan of the Karana Server" width="253" height="75">
