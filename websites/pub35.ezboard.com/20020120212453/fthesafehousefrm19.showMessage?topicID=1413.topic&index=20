<br>
Well considering we are generally called Assassins and Scouts are generally called Scouts... yeah, I did kinda expect us to be better killers than scouts. <br>
<br>
Best RvR players? Exactly what do you base that on? What constitutes a good RvR player? Going around killing greys and greens? You killed a purple caster? Where they AFK or something? Cuz when I attack a purple this is what I get:<br>
<br>
You miss.<br>

<br>
Where we meant to do that? Cuz you said yourself Scouts make better killers... so why couldnt a scout do that? And you mean to tell me that our role being a caster/archer killer makes us the more interesting class in the game? Im finding it hard to follow your logic here.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think many DO know how to play their class. But since you seem to be so uber in your skills... and you are so disappointed with the threads here... feel free to pass on your infinate wisdom to us.  <p><b>Xumten, Assassin<br>

Pretty much.  I'll let my account slide until they come out and say one way or the other that SBs will be given their illusion spells or not.<br>
<br>
Until that happens, at least the shadowblade class is NOT done, balanced, or viable because the addition will completely change the class.<br>

Personally, give me detect hidden that works (i want to be an archer killer), a bit more damage in CS (i'd love them to be from the BACK as well, perf RVR is overly difficult), a few more spec points to play with and something fun in disguise/illusions, and I'm completely satisfied and STILL having fun.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ya see, herein lies the problem. You stated your having fun with your rogue(and we all have), but you have listed problems you see. I'd like to point out that 99% of the rogues &quot;walking out&quot; want those exact things. You just summed up the general consensus on our issues. But ya see rogues have been asking for all of those basically since the class was introduced. So the difference between you and the ones who have walked out is that your not fed up yet with the problems you yourself have listed. Really, thats the ONLY difference between you and the ones walking out. We all love the class. We all had fun, at some point playing it. But again, at some point, you'll realize how useless our class is. <br>
<br>
Rogues have been pigeon-holed by poor design into the role of the archer-killer. But we dont even do that role very well. We've just learned to adapt to that role relying on poor dynamics to get that job done. If we were truly designed to be archer killers then rogues should have an inherently(based on our class not our stealth skill) better ability to detect stealthed players. We should also be able to move faster while stealthed.. again inherent to our class... not our stealth skill. <br>
<br>
I'm not &quot;walking out&quot; on the game. I want to play an assassin. But DAoC assassins are archers. So my nightshade has been shelved.<br>
<br>
Can a nightshade be a terror in RVR? Absolutely. Just under one condition. That everyone is green and grey to you. <br>

What PvP game would be complete without griefers?<br>
<br>
-- Future statement from Mythic<br>
<br>
The other night a pair of kobold shadowblades were killing folks left and right in the gorge. One was orange to me. I found him, assembled a force against him, and scared him off (lost him in the water; poison likely killed him).<br>
<br>
The other was purple to me. I could not detect him, and he was one-hitting casters. Myself and two rangers managed to follow him about using the "too close to an enemy to hide" trick. He was purple to a level 36, so I imagine he was quite high level.<br>
<br>
So he wasn't even all that terrifying. I told my hunting party to keep turning and twisting and moving and he'd have no chance of stabbing anyone. After a half hour of the three of us wandering around with him, he left, knowing if he failed to one hit either myself, or the rangers, we would be able to easily kill him.<br>
<br>
I haven't had the desire to play my Nightshade much since then. I'm terrified I'll become a bottom feeder in RvR. I fear for my honor.<br>
<br>
Three problems caused this scenario: A. because a high level assassin has nothing else to do, they prey upon low levels, B. because detect hidden doesn't do anything no one was able to see the invader even though we were standing right on top of him while he was one-hitting casters, C. one-hit stay-stealthed kills are a huge bug. As big of a bug as archers stealthing before a crit shot hits the target. I hate nerfs, especially to mine own broken class.<br>
