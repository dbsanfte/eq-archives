<br>
Excerpt of Valdanov Zevfeer's Research Journal.<br>
Blood type nourishment results...<br>
<br>
Grimling: Negative, this blood is of the least nourishing of all humanoid blood types thus far tested.<br>
<br>
Galorian: The Galorians seem to have a blood composition that enhances a vampyres physical strength for a time but must be injested in moderation as it seems to also have an equally strong negative effect on the vampyres mental processes.<br>
<br>
Netherbian: This blood may as well be water. It provides no sustenance<br>
<br>
Tegi: the bloods of the various sub-species are quite facinating.  Although not nourishing enough to sustain a vampyres physical needs the blood seems to increase the vampiric bodies to certain elemental forces while at the same time decreasing others.  The effects of the blood are fully dependant on a presumed elemental affinity the various clans of Tegi possess.  <br>
<br>
Akheva: I have just begun experimentation with this strange blood.  I was not even aware of the existance of the creatures known as Akheva until a short time ago when a Shade paid me a visit offering to assist me with my research by providing what he claimed to be the blood of a creature that contains the properties I have been searching for.  I have already depleated the supply of blood that the odd Shade provided and have yet to see or hear from him again.  Hopefully he will visit again soon with more blood so that I may continue my experimentation.<br>
<br>
That is the end of the book.  Not overly revealing, just interesting.<br>
<br>
Turn the book into Phenic and....<br>
<br>
Phenic Dionicas listens to your account of the events that have occurred since last you spoke and reads through the journal. 'This investigation is getting more and more baffling the further we delve. Among other things, I am wondering if the shade that was imprisoned in the chest is the same that was providing Valdanov with the blood for his research. Take the belt that the shade was wearing with these instructions to Governor Lathin at the Magus Conlegium. In the meantime I will pay a visit to Nathyn Illuminious.<br>
<br>
I actually waited around for a little while, around ten minutes but Phenic never budged.  I am wondering if he actually leaves or not or if anyone has actually waited around for a while to see.  Would be curious to get that dialogue.  Just another thought.  <br>
<br>
Maybe if we could get some galorian blood and turn it in to Nathyn we could cause him to loose his mind a bit and force an attack or otherwise trigger him somehow.<br>

<br>
Valdanov spawned right in front of my eyes last night in the castle/cathedral on the Top floor. He like all the other vamps casts Invis on himself after spawning and sees through invis and invisu.  Bloodred to a 54 Sk. Conned threatning to me while all the other Vampires are dubious. He smacked me for 300damage and I barely got off a FD.  Instead of going back to spawnpoint he went down the ramp and shortly dissapeared from my target box and I stood up again.  Niether I nor any group where pulling from this area before or while he was spawned. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps<br>

The real question is.... what is the random generated spawn time on the bugger? Knowing Verant, it is a 3 day spawn, and he requires a full size raid force to take him down, so you'd have to aggro him and kite til people arrived from wherever. This also taking into account that you sit there for endless amounts of time waiting for him to pop. Chances are the quest is bugged and he isn't supposed to depop so fast, but Verant would never admit that. <br>
<br>
Could you give a general location on the top floor that he popped at? Right by ramp, out on balcony, etc, just something to go by, and maybe i will Fd up there and watch for the bugger for a couple hours or something. Doubt this quest is ever gonna get solved unless someone gets *extremely* lucky.<br>

<br>
autoik(sp?) umbrage.....seems like umbral plains keeps coming to mind<br>
<br>
this clue goes to the fact that akheva is the last spot known for the Val zevfeer as in the journal Val got blood from an &quot;odd shade&quot; and went there to satify his curiousity.<br>
<br>
so these clues lead to that general area<br>
<br>
3 spots not highly adventured in<br>
akheva<br>
umbral plains<br>
and at least on my server vex thal(keyed)<br>
<br>
the other clue is that the tegi clan he had gotten some results from them but very unconclusive(perhaps this is important and there could be a clue under twilight seas where the tegi clan is supposed to be?)<br>
<br>
grimlings were mentionedas a negative but Val was supposed to be there<br>
<br>
netherbain was mentioned and was also negative perhaps a clue there as well<br>
<br>
snakeman temple was never mentioned and there are still locked doors with boss type mobs in there and many unsolved quest items drop within those walls.I mention this because they are a different species whom seem extremely powerful and are under study by the castle people which are related to this quest so although an unlikely source Val could be there as well.<br>
<br>
griegs in is a dubious source and is not mentioned anywhere except some poster it has been contested alot and failed a few searches for him by people I would suggest this is a rumor and move on.<br>
<br>
I will be completing this quest as it is very interesting to me.<br>
I will look back here from time to time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and post any new findings<br>

I wanted to see if he had a quest to give the Helm as a reward to help a friend out and I did the search here because of excellent non lurkers like you posting prime info, This is the only thread I found mentioning him, and the only reason I clicked this thread was because of his name at the top )<br>
<br>
Notes : I hadn't hailed any NPCs before seeing him spawn<br>
           <br>
there was no one in the zone hunting Vampires, just 2 Sk's hunting Guards up in front of Katta and a group of lower lvls hunting DSW's at Grimling zone.  Could he have been triggered from inside Katta?<br>
<br>
He conned Threatning to me at Dubiuos Faction to coterie of eternal night, after he wandered off it was about 5 mins before he despawned,  None of the other Vamps assisted him when he attacked me BTW.<br>
<br>
Time I was in the Cathedral  was about 3 am CST, guve or take 15mins. <br>
<br>
If you want to &quot;check&quot; my creds I am a longtime poster on the Knightswatch Sk boards, I promise you sir, I did see him and he did attempt to beat the hell out of me. luckly I am one of Innoruuks Chosen ) <br>
