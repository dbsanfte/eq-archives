I suggest making casted disease at least as effective as mob disease, it only seems fair (and would really help out shammies and cabbies who need it).  As casted disease is now, it's one of the worst debuffs in the game AND is cureable to boot (you'd think that if it was the only cureable debuff it would be more effective than the others.  Doesn't that make sense?).  I'd suggest adding snare and an endurance hit to the current disease, and possibly scaling up the str debuff to something respectable, but not as good as a normal strength debuff (-15 at all levels the way it is now).<br><br>Of course, you may already know this but Mythic has never 'officially' acknowledged it.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit: Of course, this bug has been around forever, but it's still a bug.

Hiding in tall grass or behind trees does not work because we can click around and still find them. This worked quite well for me last night.<br><br>*Opinion* I suggest cutting their range to 3-4x the normal detect hidden range since that allows us to find someone we know is nearby but doesn't totally negate their stealth. It also needs to take level into consideration. A low 40s guildmate told me he was also seeing the archers at clipping range.<br><br>*Bug* True Sight should not give us the too close to an enemy to hide message. Even a refresh rate of 30 minutes means at least one archer has it up in every major fight and I simply could not stealth when it was up even when they were at max clipping range. This wouldn't hurt me much when solo but it hurt me tremendously when I was with my group last night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/9/02 8:22:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3123.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bugs</span><hr size=1> Tell ya what, run to whoever compiles the bug reports from pendragon and feedback from the pendragon board, and you probably could avoid most of this.<br><br><br>Bug - one-shot kills where you stay stealthed are not functioning, this was NOT a part of 1.50 when it was on pendragon.<br><br>Bug - many of the epic helms are un-dyeable.<br><br>Old Bug - Re-stealthing after sprinting STILL continues to drain endurance.<br><br>Old Bug/Possible Issue - Pets still see through stealth, once you are on target you have to run a long way (think from portal keep to milegate, and even that is sometimes not enough) before they will stop targetting you.

Your not suppose to see anyone stealthed while dead.<br><br>-Also I dunno if this really falls under a bug, but a yellow con infiltrator last night did max perf damage to me while I was standing.  I had been sitting saw him coming and stood before he struck.  I'm suspecting he still hit me as if I was sitting, either by the result of lag or mythic's code taking to long to check the info or a combination of both.<br><br>-Somehow archers are stealthing and staying stealthed while poisoned.  At least one archer that I watched last night after he managed to kill me and another shade friend.  My poison did 3 ticks of damage to him AFTER he stealthed and it never broke his stealth.  He also restealthed way sooner than 10 secs after he left combat with me.. it was more like 3 secs.<br><br>-Pre 1.50 bug - Somehow on some targets poison is only doing 1 tick of damage then wearing off. (This was happening before 1.50 so not a result of purge).<br><br>The last two may not be a bug they may be exploits.  I've suspected a couple of people for having some type of exploit / cheat in the past couple weeks.  That stealthing and staying stealthed 3 secs after battle and going trough 3 ticks of poisoned while stealthed is just absurd. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/9/02 8:27:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3123.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bugs</span><hr size=1> The coming into view thing has always occured.<br><br>As you reach the detection bubble, the game first reports you as unstealth and then quickly adds yours stealth status.

You will not become stealthed however. You get the hide and unhide messages, but you do not actually enter into stealth mode. As a result you can run at full speed and remain untargetable by enemies until they enter combat range (too close to enemy to hide). <br>- Our name tags show up when we are in “shadow mode” and close to an enemy, making this semi-transparent skin kind of pointless in RvR against the non-detect hidden players… it acts like a red flag. <br>-If you are stunned while on a climb spot on a keep, you can still climb up and down. <br>- When Player X is stealthed and Player Y walks into the range where Y (with Detect Hidden or not) can reveal X, the following happens: <br>1 - Player X appears FULLY to player Y. <br>2 - Player X goes translucent to player Y .2-.5 secs later.<br>This needs to be fixed<br><br><br>CRITICAL STRIKE<br>Bugs<br>- In my tests on Pendragon with Braack the Garrote “hindrance” effect does not seem to work, my running speed was not reduced. This may be a pendragon only bug.<br>- I very often /stick, then try to Perf an enemy (rvr and pve) and it says the target is not in view, even though I’m standing right in front of it. The min distance you go to when using /stick needs to be tightened.<br><br><br>OTHER<br>Bugs<br>- True Sight stops you from rehiding.<br>- As for the One shot Issue- The TL's are speaking to Matt about it right now. <p><a href="http://www.tarnished-dagger.com">The Tarnished Dagger</a>Tickling your spine since 1999.<b>Elvoril</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaredeus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aredeus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/9/02 8:44:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3123.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hello - list o' patch problems</span><hr size=1> I can vouch for Garrote not working on live servers either.

Static tempest is ultra bugged. 1) it drops a loot bag on the ground at center of AE; 2) herald specifically calls it an AE stun ... it's been reported as an AE mez since 1.50c and still is now on live. Test was done (on live yesterday) on grey blodflags 3-4 of them mezzed, one of them zapped with thoothgrinder DD and came running for thane as mez was broken by DD. Other mobs stayed mezzed; 3) it is not functioning as a trap ability but as an instant (or less than 2 sec duration) AE mez. People entering the area after initial use are not subjected to it or have insanely high resists to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxorin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xorin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/9/02 9:37:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3123.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why bother posting bugs here?</span><hr size=1> See TheTweety that started this thread?<br><br>Yea?

In this &quot;bag&quot; I have alternate weapons in the first 4 slots, and a stack of each venom type in slots 5-8. I dragged a venom stack onto a weapon, dropped it, and instead of the usual envenom attempt taking place, the venom stack in my inventory swapped places with one of the weapons in my inventory, as if I had dropped the stack of venom onto that inventory weapon rather than onto a weapon in my hand. I *think* that the second time I witnessed this, the venom had been in slot 7 in my bag (second from the bottom), and the weapon it swapped positions with was in slot 2 or 3, while I was attempting to apply it to my third equipped weapon (the one in the 2H slot). I didn't pay particular attention to the details the first time it happened, as I thought it was a one time anomaly.<br><br>This happened twice yesterday to me, early in the day before the game was taken down for the 1.50B update, probably during the same play session. I submitted a less detailed in-game /bug report shortly after it happened the second time, so you can check the logs for that if you want a better time frame. I haven't witnessed this happnening again since then. That may just be luck, or it may be that the anomaly was either fixed in 1.50B or just a strange state my client got into--perhaps some sort of &quot;lag&quot; on my mouse's XY coordinates reporting which caused the client to think the mouse was still over the weapons in my bag instead of the weapons in my hand. This bug needs corroborating evidence from other people before it should be escalated to the dev team. Anyone else confirm it?<br><br> - X<br> <p><P><font face=verdana size=1><b>Xil, Saracen Infiltrator<br><a href="http://www.dragonriders.net">Dragonriders</a><br>Bedevere<br></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=czerisgawaine>Czeris Gawaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/9/02 11:31:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3123.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bugs</span><hr size=1> Guys if you want Sanya to keep coming here, please listen and respect her wishes when posting to her threads.<br><br>Please don't hijack the threads.<br><br>Thank You <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3123.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3123.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3123.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3123.topic&start=81&stop=82>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3123.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3123.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3123.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3123.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3123.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3123.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3123.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
