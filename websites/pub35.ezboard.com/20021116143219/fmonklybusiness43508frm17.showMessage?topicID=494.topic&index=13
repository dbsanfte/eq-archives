Can you even admit that it is possible to have to nerf a class for the good of the game if you have let something get out of hand?<br>
<br>
If they made wizards capable of doing 500DPS indefinately without aggro, would you be against the nerfing of wizzies to restore game balance?<br>
<br>
When most of the everquest community, the EQ live team, and even a large percentage of monks admit that monk tanking was overpowered considering the rest of the abilities that monks get, doesnt that tell you something?<br>
<br>
Oh, wait, I know!  They must all be idiots or arses.<br>

Oh yes, please give me 500dps without agro and I wont loose another word about the nerf. Ok, im no wizzy just kind of &quot;melee wizard&quot;, so give me 400dps and we still have a deal.<br>

Yes, you are right, just on VERY rare occassions I admit that a nerf is needed and good. And thats usally not a class nerf. They just screw up with unreal items again and again. Also our &quot;balancing&quot; should have happend with adjusting some uber items, not with beating the whole monk class down.<br>

Attention SOE,<br>
<br>
This nerf was not needed, and didn't solve any problem that you might have sought to fix. Perhaps sharing the &quot;problem&quot; you think the monk class has with the monk community will yield a response by MONKs with possable solutions, or not. eaither way this nerf needs to be reversed!<br>
<br>
We would also like to make it knowen to you that our offensive abilities have never been addressed and we feel it is no longer balanced with rogues and warriors. Please take a hard look at the current offensive discaplines and the current lack off any remarkable Alternate advancement ability such as rogue assignate, wiz manaburn, pally undead proc, etc.<br>

<br>
IMHO, you are 100% correct with this statement.  The proliferation of 100-125 hp items that were monk, caster, and other &quot;paper armor&quot; classes could use, coupled with the AC cap that every level 60 with average gear is above.<br>
<br>
You and I agree, if uber monk items had been 10 AC 50HP 50ATK, +proc other other +DPS items, while plate tanks got 40AC 100HP items, there would never have been a problem.<br>
<br>
They screwed up with loot bigtime. They made everyone get a heck of alot closer to the same (+massive HP, everyone has capped AC) so that the most important factor that decided if someone is a good tank or not was avoidance.<br>
<br>
The question is, how long would it take to fully re-itemize every piece of equipent in game, and how would you as a monk feel to log in and see your previous 55AC 100hp aow legs (and every other piece of armor you have) nerfed to 10ac 50hp and +ATK?<br>
<br>
They let things get out of hand with items. Would you advocate a change to items similar to the one I hypothetically stated above?  Would you be any less pissed to log in and have 900-1000 AC and 1000 less HP with some +DPS perks?<br>
<br>
In order to preserve the game, you have to balance the classes. One cannot be clearly better than the others, and that is the road that monks were headed down.<br>
<br>
Look at the number of monks on any server.  Now look at the number of knights.  Why do you think there are so many more monks than hybrids?<br>
<br>
Make equipment and buffs scale with the classes, nerf the AC on some monk items so that your typical monk is considerably less AC than other plate classes, and remove the AC cap (adjusting mob abilities so that encounters are not trivial due to increased mitigation) and the monk nerf would never have been necessary.<br>
<br>
That scenario is waaaaaaaaaaaaay more work for VI than just nerfing monks mitigation/avoidance tables.<br>
<br>
Now do you see why VI chose the route they did?  They know they screwed up, and they used the simplest approach to fix it that they could.  The fix isnt the best choice, but it is better than it was before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utibbil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tibbil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/21/02 1:55:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can someone tell SOE this??</span><hr size=1> AC cap is kinda hard to deal with.

  You all get the idea.  I can tell you .. Im about the only one among my friends still playing EQ.  Another still does .. all the rest (and thats quite a lot of gamers) have stopped, or never even started.  Im just bored and playing till the game I want comes out (Shadowbane).

About 5 man days (MAX) of a temp database programmers time.<br>
<br>
You could do it by a simple item swap quest (a la Primal Velium Fistwraps.)<br>
<br>
Take all 100+hp ALL/ALL items and remove MNK from them.<br>
Implement hand in quest, where monk can hand in now useless item and get a slightly different item with less hps (say 75max), and maybe vengeance 1 instead or something.<br>
<br>
Items aren't exactly hard to create.. Most likely items will be stored in one big database table on the server.. adding 200/300 lines to it (there aren't THAT many 100hp all/all pieces of gear) isn't really going to be that big a chore.. <br>
<br>
And the quest would be as simple as SWAP item code 06782 for item code 27182. Hardly challenging stuff, a primary school computer studies pupil could make those sort of changes.<br>

Hail, Velious Monk Nerf Quest Bot00<br>
<br>
Hello Herrick, Would you like me to make you [Ring of NerfSky] [Flayed Gimpybastage Hide Leggings] [Vyremm's Earring of Wussiness].... blah blah blah...<br>
<br>
Couple of IT programmer temps could do it in a day, plus a couple for system testing, and bugger all UAT (since VI make us do that for them, which is why nerfs occur =P)<br>
<br>
Yes the top end guys will lose a few hps, but will still have more hps than any other monks in the game, and still rank in same place in the hierarchy. At least it addresses the root cause somewhat, rather than changing mitigation mechanics for a class that have been in place since day one.<br>

After all they get paid a lot of money to do their job. And its not that many items that would have need a nerf. They are probably in a database and a small program, made by a student in a few hours, might be able to adjust the stats.<br>
<br>
Last not least, those that have such items and loose a part of their usefulness, would OF COURSE pe pissed, and I really feel with them as well. But better it hurts the 3% that made VI nerf monks, than nerf 100% and probably the not targeted 97% most. <br>
<br>
If I had to decide it, I wouldnt nerf the class and I wouldnt nerf the items. Just improve plates midigation a bit, and change the items for future drops. No big deal, noone has a reason to be pissed. Much work? As allready stated, not really, and if so, well, what are we paying for.<br>
<br>
Do you really think the plate classes wouldnt have been happy with the increase, even if there never has been anything said about a monk nerf ?<br>
