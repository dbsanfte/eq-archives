data</span><hr size=1> Since the numerous posts on VT have degenerated into name calling, he said/she said, and havens for rumours stated as facts, I went through them and tried to pull out the &quot;hard facts&quot;<br><br>Here's what I got:<br><br>&quot;remains of Vah Kerrath&quot; Loc 1600, 80, Umbral Plains<br><br>You say, 'Hail, remains of Vah Kerrath'<br><br>remains of Vah Kerrath says 'Fleshy mortal, can you not see what I am cursed to live in eternal anguish? What is it that you seek from me? <br><br>You say, 'I seek a key to Vex thal'<br><br>remains of Vah Kerrath says 'I will not reveal the secrets I have discovered so easily. Since I am unable to leave the protection of the whisperling circle, I will need you to aid me in releasing the Elysian spirits from their tormented states. Destroy their remains and release their spirits from the grip of the shadow curse. Return four of their skulls to me as proof of your deeds. Only then will I impart my discoveries to you. <br><br>At that point you go kill Elysian skeletons and get 4 skulls, and give them in.<br><br>Faction with whisperlings got better.<br>Faction with Akheva got worse.<br><br>remains of Vah Kerrath says 'You have done well. Clear your mind of all distractions and ask the whisperlings if you are worthy of my knowledge. <br><br>Now remove your current target.<br><br>You say, 'Whisperlings, am I worthy of his knowledge?'<br><br>an ancient whisperling says 'This fleshling has done little to convince us of its worth.&quot;<br><br><br>At this point the quest is &quot;broken&quot;, however at some level of faction you may continue with this.<br><br>You say, 'What is Vex Thal'<br><br>an ancient whisperling says 'The city of shadow is sealed by powerful magic. Only one who wears the Talisman of Akelha Ra can pass through the seals of the gate.'<br><br>You say, 'What talisman of akelha ra?'<br><br>an ancient whisperling says 'This medallion was a piece of the talisman shattered long ago by the storm that swept through the maiden's eye. You must first find the ten silver links that <br>were once attached to the talisman. They lie scattered throughout all of Luclin. Return the talisman to me when you have reunited the medallion with the scattered links.'<br><br>He hands you a &quot;Medallion&quot; which is a 10 slot tiny box with a combine button <br><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Random info:<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Itraer Vius shouts 'Bring forth the sacrifice and make ready the ceremony! <br>Akelha`Ra must be reborn!'<br><br>The Itraer Vius shouts this once a game day at 4am (I think).<br><br>This is the name of the talisman, so there must be a connection.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>General opinion is the links are NOT the 10 seals from Ssra<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Currently if you manage to get beyond the door, you get &quot;pushed back&quot; at the zone.  This also occurs at other &quot;dead-end&quot; zones (such as in the water of LoIO) or when a zone is down.  Implies that either A) you need an item to zone (likely), B) you are zoned by opening the door (unlikely), or C) The zone isn't up yet<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There are multiple gems droping in Umbral, however there are more then 10 so these being the links is generally considered doubtful.<br><br>Additonally there are more then 10 Acrylia Runes.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Screenshots of Vex Thal have been &quot;leaked&quot;.  Some pictures appear to be emulator (no mobs, just geometry) while others appear to be from guides gone berserk (has mobs).  Either way this implies the zone is functional, and mobs are placed.  Whether the zone is complete, or itemized is still in debate.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Another theory on how the zone works is you need 1 key to open door, then every member has a seperate key to actually zone.<br><br>If this is the case, the medalion quest appears to be for the personal entry (what everybody needs to enter) and the actual &quot;Key&quot; portion is not in game.  This should come when we no longer get a &quot;you are not worthy&quot; responce when we have max ally whisperling faction.<br><br>Furthermore, the &quot;key&quot; could be in place, however you may need to possess an item that proves you are worthy.  This is all speculation, and I'll stop it here.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Gnome  Binkl Dirkwater.  Unknown use in Umbral<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Binkl Dirtwater'<br>Binkl Dirkwafer says 'Ey! What're you doin' here! This is my home. Shoo. Look at you. What's wrong with you. Here you are in the middle of giant rotting flesh beasts, abnormal trees, fanged giant death horselike things and you are worried about pleasantries? GO AWAY! You are insane.'<br><br>You say, 'what home'<br>Binkl Dirkwafer says 'Fleh! Don't make fun of my home. It's my home. Go away.<br><br>You say, 'what pleasantries?'<br>Binkl Dirkwafer blinks and stares at you for a moment. ''Are you daft?'' '<br><br>No faction hits on death, unknown faction (perhaps Beta Nuetral)<br><br>&quot;One interesting thing about what he says when hailed, he talked about different beasts, and also mention some &quot;odd tree's&quot;... I don't notice anything extremely different with the <br>tree's in this zone, nor have i seen any mobs which look like a tree. Could it be some sort of hint as to a clickable tree? He does not respond when asked about what odd tree's..&quot;<br><br><br>Please feel free to add &quot;hard&quot; data here.  Such as the location of Binkl Dirkwater, exact responces to queries, new identifications from objects (such as, &quot;guys, this thing I got from xyz identified as 'silver link'&quot;)  Just try to keep it objective so it doesn't degernate like other threads.<br><br>(board admin, if you want to remove this b/c its redundant, I won't be offended it the slightest.

Whether or not it will teleport multiple people is beyond me... however, I think it is very safe to assume that this is not the case.<br><br>The zone is populated.  Itemized, I cannot say for sure.  Overall, the zone is fairly large and very detailed, with some areas sealed off behind doors that I can only assume are triggered to open as there was no other means of passing which I noticed.<br><br>No mob named Luclin or any variation of it exists in the zone.  I suppose it is possible that she does exist as a triggered spawn though.<br><br>From just pure exploring, the zone does not really seem to be that difficult in my opinion.  MOST of the rooms are populated only by a few mobs, but some are rather heavily packed with guards.  I noticed very few roaming mobs, and LOTS of safe areas, especially near what I assume to be two mini bosses.  Aggro range did not seem to be all that large.  Clearly I have no idea how difficult the mobs themselves are.<br><br>All in all, it's a pretty beautiful zone.  I speculate that there is a lot more lore yet to be discovered regarding this zone.  Upon exploration, I ran into a few items which were somewhat heavily guarded floating on pedistals.  I believe they were a sword, a shield, and a book.  The items could not be interacted with, but it definately made for some nice eye candy.  <br><br>I do hope that there is a little bit of lore surrounding these items and whatever may lay beyond the unopenable, unpickable, unkeyed door I spoke of previously.  I really got the feeling that the 30 minutes I spent running around just to find that door itself was only the beginning of the dungeon itself.  There's a lot more in there, and I'm dying to see it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uevilzues.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EvilZues</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/25/02 10:03:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4219.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Consolodated Vex Thal hard data</span><hr size=1> This is my first time posting on most forums so plz let me know how I do Plzkthx. <br>    <br><br>    I've been looking over wtfh this key can be.  theres 3 options for the key in my opinion. 1 door key w/ key to zone in. 2 Group key (SS key...) 3 VP key style with more BS.<br>    Of all these different key ideas, theres 10 items we will need it apears.. Links.  I've done combines w/o full up containters, But this seriously looks like 10 items need to be found.  Been a few ideas about this but nothing concreate as so far.  I've had a few ideas about a 'Link' so far so let me throw out a few in suggestion.  In EVERY expantion there has been new trade skill items to work with. Exepect Jewlery Crafting with SoL.  Vi makes an anoucnement that JC will take a totaly new direction with SoL /shrug (Grand Master Jewler here btw).  <br>      So now begins the hunt to find 10 items that will match up in 'links' -- theres the whole bit with Sshra temple stuff (never seen 1) I personaly don't think all 10 will come from the same zone.   Look at the lore of the link persay-- ME was destroyed years ago in a storm that swept through here, personaly I would say 1  link were looking for is droped/found here.   Looked up anything that could even resemle a 'link' nothing found interms of search engine wise-- dosen't mean it hasn't been found just not posted as of yet.<br>     The search continues- looked at the bracelets from UP- 6 not 10 /shrug anyone else find any bracelets similar to thouse found in UP???   Basicly this is all thearoy to get people to stop saying BS and work on the Quest-- IF you run across anything that can resemble a 'link'  Earing/neck/ring/random item -- PLZ identfy before posting state what the info is--  been working on this for 3-4 weeks now still nothing new as of yet.<br><br>    P.S.  If you run across anything on Bertoxx  /tell Elexxie   58 Enchanter--  Give me a tell or evilzues@hotmail.com  Working to Find out how to get INTO Vex Thal.. ie if you got in there GREAT! now help me to find out how to... cus I'm working on the quest to...

You needed 9 talisman pieces and a tooth - that makes 10 items to make a key.  The box once it has its 10 items in it will combine to make a talisman that once used like a key will allow you to zone in.<br><br>Clue - <br>an ancient whisperling says 'This medallion was a piece of the talisman shattered long ago by the storm that swept through the maiden's eye. You must first find the ten silver links that <br>were once attached to the talisman. They lie scattered throughout all of Luclin. Return the talisman to me when you have reunited the medallion with the scattered links.'<br><br>Now there is nearly 30 zones on the moon so each zone has a 1 in three chance of the required item needed.  The harder the zone the more likely.  They are a common item to each other and are referred too as silver links.  A stone/gem seems unlikely to be a link.
