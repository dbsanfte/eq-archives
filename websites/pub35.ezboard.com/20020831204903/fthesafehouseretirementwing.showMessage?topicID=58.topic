I'd periodically show up in the future, if it wouldn't cost me the monthly payments just to keep the account alive.  I've had a fair amount of fun, and 4 months is probably the longest I've played any game.  But, it seems that all I do anymore is try to figure out where the next obtainable item is and try to trick a group into accepting me. <BR>  <BR> It seems like all the punk-ass teenie-bopper summer players are back for Thanksgiving vacation, and all their rudeness just made me realize that there is no entertainment in a game where you depend on others to be nice (or at least respectful) to you. <BR>  <BR> Overall, I think EverQuest has an excellent foundation for being a great game, but the developers didn't do anything to that full potential.  Rogues are decent, but could be so much cooler.  The other classes could use a little bit of this and that as well.  Items and monsters are improperly distributed.  But since I'm quitting, that's for some other crusader to comment on. <BR>  <BR> Anyway, I'm bound in Arena right now, and will appear a few more evenings just to screw around.  If you're nearby, offer (nicely) to duel, become a recipient of my low-20's equipment, or just group up for some silly kamikaze runs or something.  Just say you're a SafeHouse reader; I'll understand. <BR>  <BR> And under the ugly chain coif is...Jaamosan.  Probably none of you have seen me in the game.  I've only grouped with another rogue once, and all the rest of the time, I'm hidden of course.  However, a few may remember that I have posted here from time to time, and I hope the game is enjoyable for those who continue to play. <BR>  <BR> Good luck, and may the shadows seem just a little darker in your presence. <BR>  <BR> -Jaamosan, barbarian rogue, level 24 <BR> -Mercenary of Halas. <BR>  <BR> BTW, my gear will be given away or sold at reasonable prices to those I deem worthy.  (No twinks.  No rude people.  You'd best cons blue or better [lev 18+])  I have a fair collection of poisons and poison components.  Other than that, it's just a dragoon dirk and a few other nifty trinkets. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/ucaowyth.showPublicProfile>Caowyth</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/24/99 6:18:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Throwing off my concealing armor</span><hr size=1> Sorry to hear that you will be going. =( <BR>  <BR> Tunare will be miss the Tallest Rogue in Norrath. <BR>  <BR> Caowyth <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/ukarlek.showPublicProfile>Karlek</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/00 6:00:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.main-rheiner.de/homepage/julius.makanec/karl.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Throwing off my concealing armor</span><hr size=1> It is with sad heart that i learned today, <BR> that a good friend and a wood elf rogue of 42nd some season, registered Safehouser of old, <BR>  <BR>      ~ Lowinor Silverleaf ~ <BR>  <BR> departed forever from Tunare... by the act of deletion *smirk* *sob* <BR> This was done deliberately, in mutual consent and joined-forever-in death by his beloved Tyanwenae, the Ranger, his RL spouse too... <BR>  <BR> He will be remembered forever for his unselfish help and equipping a young rogue back in may or june with his ever first banded armor pieces...  <BR>  <BR> May your future incarnations lead a happy existence somewhere else, in higher realms!
