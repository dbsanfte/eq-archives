<br>
A dark ominous figure stood stolidly. The moon consumed the sky behind him, his silhouette concealing most of it. He was unmoving, but his cloak billowed in the chilling wind. Motionless. His face, concealed by the shadows stared straight ahead. If it weren't for a brief shudder that ran over him, you could swear he was a statue. <br>
<br>
The wind, the biting wind, it permeated even the toughest of hide. The moon welled up behind him, while he, himself seemed to grow in stature with it. That indescribable gaze, though you could not see his eyes, they burned coldly into the space ahead. A mind-numbing feel of dread crept through the air. It was deafening, a silent roar. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, a blink. An instant passed... and the image flashed back to life, but he now appeared through a window frame. The dark figure then crept forward towards the window. His steps made no sounds; his gate was incredibly fluid for his apparent size. He intently peered inside. The space inside appeared void, only the intensely cold moonlight shone in onto the wooden floor, and he blocked most of it. He stared inside for a long while, not as if in awe, or in a stupor, but an intentful, piercing gaze. He was judging his next move. <br>
<br>
He kneeled down and grabbed a broken board leaning up against the ramshackle wall. He methodically slid the window open. Once again so fluidly, and so slowly that the window did not make one audible creak. He propped it open, and began to climb in. <br>
<br>
Slowly he crept in, slowly; it seemed to take years to climb in. Sweat built on his brow, and bead by bead gathered. It edged slowly past his temple, followed his rigid cheekbone, and flowed into a large scar running from his cheekbone to his jaw. From there it hit his jawbone, paused, and slid off his face. His ears were so attentive that when it crashed to the floor it startled him, but he did not flinch like any fool. He finally lowered himself, both feet onto the floor. His breathing was heavy, but steady. He turned to his right, and faced a cot. A figure lay huddled in the blankets, oblivious to the uninvited stranger. <br>
<br>
The figure took a step forward into the room, and looked around intently. Not much could be seen in the inky darkness, but he felt no movement and heard no breathing.  A few books lay strewn on the floor, only visible in the cold light of the moon.<br>
<br>
Satisfied he was alone, he turned to the bed and drew closer. He watched over the helpless being in the bed. The tenseness in the air was almost tangible. Suddenly, there was a glint of steel; the figure raised his right hand high, angling for the most deadly blow. Fury filled his eyes, and his dagger in fist began the downward arc. The blade made no noise at all as it sliced the air. As it neared the bed he let out a gasp. A cold feeling pierced sinew and spine, his spine. He went numb. <br>
<br>
He slowly and painfully turned to see his assailant. A face in the moonlight looked grimly upon him. His own face turned to a look of horror. He tried to speak, but his face and throat spasmed and he only let out an inaudible curse. He then let out a large sigh, and collapsed. He fell limply to the floor, a dull thud as his head crashed into the wooden floor.<br>
<br>
The assailant crouched over him, and looked into his eyes, &quot;Sorry friend, I'm not ready just yet.&quot;<br>

<br>
“What a pity, good muscle gone to waste.” <br>
<br>
He rested his back on the splintery wall, and glanced around the room. A dark, drafty, ramshackle of a thing, but it had kept him safe for the last few months. Now it was time to leave.  One of many enemies, maybe one he had not even met face to face, knew where he was and wanted him dead. <br>
<br>
There was no time to waste, and not any reason to waste it. He had no acquaintances here, no friends. The only thing he really found to like here was a tavern he was growing fond of.  The Stale Waft taveren.  A moderately sized, dimly lit place.  It had a warm place, a back wall with a few tables where he often sat by himself and ran over his thoughts, or just watched for a drunk with a carelessly revealed pouch of gold coin. He never made himself known to any of the patrons, many wouldn’t recognize him if they ever saw him again, it was simply easier to stay alive when you don’t have many friends.<br>
<br>
Though sometimes he would get lost in his thoughts.  He would get caught up in memories of long past, his mind would wander and he would live them again.  People he had met, heists pulled, and patriarchs assassinated.  The time he did in various holds and prisons, none of which has been able to hold him to this day.  He would then snap back to reality, with a slight startled jump as he realized he had let his guard down.<br>
<br>
He pulled out a thin dagger, and cut some shoddy stitching around the edge of his mattress.  After digging through a bit of down and cloth shreds, he pulled out a small leather bag, and a small neatly carved wooden case, then tossed them on the bed. The bag was full of gold coins, but had been packed with cotton to keep from unnecessary rustling of them. He then turned and withdrew the dagger from the man’s back.<br>
<br>
Looking it over intently, his eyes drifted off up towards dead space again.  A brief second later a half hearted grin crossed his face, and he shook his head looking down. He grabbed a cloth, and pinched his fingers around the blade. He ran it through the cloth to remove any blood on the blade, the kind of thing that draws animals near when you must live on the run. He sheathed his dagger into a small unadorned sheath on his ankle, then put the bloody cloth in the man’s pocket.<br>
<br>
He rose with a long groan and walked over to his closet. He pulled out a black leather cloak, with some very small, silver runed insignia on the inside of the hood next to his ear, and a dark metal clasp with the same insignia. It was a simple dagger, but ornately crafted onto the clasp. He then pulled out a belt, with two sheathed daggers; ornately crafted handles, but the blades couldn’t be seen. <br>
<br>
He picked the wooden case and leather pouch, weighing each in his hands.  He then tied them to his belt, drew his cloak tight and strode silently out of the house. <br>

One might be dead, but who knows how many others might have been employed, bounty hunters weren’t an uncommon occurrence these days. The moon was rising high now, lighting much of the roofing, and the dew was beginning to collect making his tedious progress even slower. He came to the end of a long roofline and lowered himself to the shadows. <br>
<br>
He glanced around, making sure no one saw him slip down. A biting wind shot through the streets and allies. <br>
<br>
He didn’t trust the men guarding the gates, most guards worked on their own accord, and it was a good job for a bounty hunter to take up for a short while. He ponder his way out of the town.  He started off again, on his silent walk, opting to take a wider, slightly better lit alley to get him closer to the town walls.<br>
<br>
Seetek heard something, and instantly slipped into a narrow alley to his right. He froze just around the corner, back to the wall holding his breath. After a few seconds, he began to slide back towards the street, along the wall to listen what was around the corner. A woman was talking to a guard; it took Seetek a moment to focus his ears.<br>
<br>
“Yes a prowler, I watched him go from a few roofs over, and slowly make his way until he was right over me, then he hopped down and disappeared into the alley. Honestly, I don’t even know why we have guards, all the penny-weighters and smugglers. What do you suppose made it into, or out of the city?”<br>
<br>
“Miss I’ve had a long night, if you want to go this route we can, but do you really want to?”<br>
<br>
“Why can’t we have some <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> real</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> protection around these parts for once?”<br>
<br>
The guard sighed, “We’ll look into this prowler situation, go back to bed.” The guard turned and headed towards the gates, muttering curses about low pay.<br>
<br>
Seetek was no fool; he knew who the prowler was, and that the city guard may be corrupt, but they still work for their rations. He glanced around, jumped and grabbed the overhang of a house. Positioning his hands for the upward slope, he swung himself up onto the roof, and slowly crept towards the town wall that it rested next to. He did not see himself jumping the height of the wall, up to the ledge, nearly twice his height above him.  So, with incredible skill, he began to scale it. <br>
<br>
Finding almost invisible crevices he pulled himself up, slowly, to the top. With a sigh he rolled up onto the ledge. A guard patrolling the wall spotted him. <br>
<br>
“You, who goes there?” the guard shouted, in a thick slightly slurred voice.  He then reached to his side and picked up a bow leaning against the stone wall.<br>
<br>
Seetek bowed, but never left eye contact. He judged the man about 30 feet away, unless this man was a phenomenal athlete, Seetek could bolt and get away safely. He said back to the guard, “I’m up here for the view.”<br>
<br>
“I’m sure you have heard of the prowler around here tonight no doubt?”<br>
<br>
“Nope, not heard a word, having trouble with the townsfolk my good man?”<br>
<br>
“Well,” the guard reached behind him quickly fitting an arrow into his long sturdy bow, “Since most of the towns folk don’t climb the city walls to have a look at the view at such late hours, I must assume you are up to some sort of antic. And I’m afraid I can’t let you leave until you have been questioned, friend.”<br>
<br>
Seetek glanced around. There was no way but down, he nodded at the guard and smirked, “Yes, friend,” and with blinding speed he dove headlong off of the wall and out of the city. <br>
<br>
The arrow went zinging by, now many feet behind him, slapping the stone wall uselessly and breaking. He swiveled in mid air, glanced at the ground, and landed running. His cloak made him virtually invisible past the town light, and into the countryside he ran.<br>
<br>
“Alive for another hour, now where to go?”<br>
