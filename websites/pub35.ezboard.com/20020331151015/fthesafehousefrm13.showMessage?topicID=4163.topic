I am Aetherthane D'zitherak, Priestess of Innoruk, seeker of the fabled and ancient Staff of Ankexfen. Have you ever hard of this relic before?&quot;<br><br>Vaslin says &quot;I have not heard of that staff&quot;<br><br>A visiting priestess says &quot;Long ago there existed a race known as the Ankexfen, after their progenitor Hazeg Ankexfen, who were created by Rallos Zek during the Elder Age. This race was quite intelligent and cunning. They quickly expanded their knowledge of magic and other planes, yet constantly yearned for more power. So along with their ogre counterparts, they set out to master the Plane of Earth. Alas, their attempts proved futile and the combined might of the other gods forced Rallos Zek back to the Planes of Power, leaving his creations to the whims of other gods.&quot;<br><br>Vaslin says &quot;What happened to the Ankexfen?&quot;<br><br>A visiting priestess says &quot;The wrath of the unnamed gods was grim. Thousands of ogres were instantly slain - their empire left to crumble under the hand of retribution. The giants were flung across the face of Norath like seeds to the wind. The Ankexfen's fate was more severe. The entire race was exterminated, but from the ashes were born the four goblin races. Exactly how this happened is unknown. But what is known is that each goblin was stripped of any knowledge and was neither informed of the other clans nor of their origins. Each clan was then transported to a separate environment to help preserve the gods will. However, the gods were not without mercy and each clan was granted a section of the staff. Upon each staff a crystal was adorned. These staves served to aid the goblin clans in understanding their environment. These remnants of the Staff of Ankexfen are what I desire. Bring them to me and the Priests of Innoruk shall reward you.<br><br>These are the four Crystal Staves:<br><br>Ice Crystal Staff - Permafrost off of the Scryer<br>Fire Crystal Staff - Solusek Eye off of the Goblin Drunkard<br>Water Crystal Staff - Lake Rathe off of Webclaw Murkwave<br>Slime Crystal Staff - Beholder's Maze off of King Xorbb<br><br>[Give her the wands of Ice, Fire, Water, Slime]<br><br>A visiting priestess grins evilly as she disassembles the staff and holds forth a runed wooden rod.<br>...<br>A visiting priestess cackles with glees as she slowly assembles the runed rods, and with muttered incantation and in a flash of light disappears leaving only a note that slowly drifts to the ground.<br><br>You gained experience!<br>Your faction with PriestsofInnoruk got better<br>Your faction with KingAythoxthex got better<br>Your faction with PriestsofMarr got worse<br>Your faction with ClericsofTunare got worse<br>Your faction with PriestsofLife got worse<br><br>[She disappears, and an ogre guard spawns and attacks.]<br><br>[Receive a Scroll of the Flayed Goblin Skin - Identification reveals it is written in Dark Speech]<br><br>&quot;some cryptic and illegible words of neriak and blue flames&quot;<!--EZCODE HTML START-->  <hr><!--EZCODE HTML END-->You say, 'Hail, Zanotix Ixtaz'<br><br>Zanotix Ixtaz casts an icy glare at you and says 'I, Zanotix Ixtaz, am the greatest weaponsmith in all of Neriak. Have you disturbed me to purchase one of my superior products or have you come to learn the art of crafting [indigo sabres]? '<br><br>You say, 'what about the blue flame?'<br><br>Zanotix Ixtaz gazes at you for many breaths, studying your eyes before looking back at his forge and saying, 'The Blue Flame. This is what allows us to forge our ancestral armor and weapons of adamantite. That and my unmatched skill that is. Many souls were [ritually] sacrificed to spark the flame that now feeds off the constant flow of hatred and envy of the victims . Some call it the Flame of Vengence.' Zanotix stares into the flames, poking at it absently. '<br><br>You say, 'what is the ritual?'<br><br>Zanotix Ixtaz says 'The Ritual? Well I was young when it took place. I don't really remember. I've had so much on my mind lately, what with all these new taxes. For instance, I need to come up with an extra 75 pieces of platinum just to cover the forge tax. I don't know what I'm going to do.....*cough*. '<br><br>[Hand him 75 pieces of platinum]<br><br>Zanotix Ixtaz quickly pockets the coins and says, 'Go see the Librarian, Nallar. Tell him Denouncer Ixtaz sent you. Do not return here for at least 3 days, now go, Dark Elf.' <!--EZCODE HTML START-->  <hr><!--EZCODE HTML END-->You say, 'Hail, Nallar Q`Tentu'<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu says 'Lower your voice, Dark Elf. These tomes hold many secrets, as well as curses. Say the wrong word loudly enough and you may end up a frog, dead, or worse. Heed my warning for I will not repeat it. '<br><br>You say, 'denouncer ixtaz sent me'<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu stiffens at the mention of the title. His eyes dart back and forth about the room before speaking to you, his voice almost inaudible. He says, 'Why are you here? What do you want of me? I am nothing but a lowly librarian. I've already paid my debt, I have nothing else to give.'<br><br>You say, 'What is the blue flame?'<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu 's face twists into an expression of complete confusion. The librarian says, 'The Ritual? Of the Blue Flame? Yes I know of it. But why wou..never mind. The ritual is fairly simple. The sacrifice is [flayed] and thrown into the fire just before death overcomes it. The flaying brings out an almost euphoric state of hatred and despisal. It's this that feeds the flame. The influence of our Father blues the flame and allows it to melt our adamantium. '<br><br>You say, 'What flayed?'<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu says 'The flaying is done by our priests and the Denouncer. Flaying itself is used in many other rituals as well. For instance, the skin of a flayed goblin can be used to record a misdeed. The perpetrator records the misdeed upon the skin, an ancient practice which allows the victim to wreak [vengeance] upon the one who wronged them, or their ancestors. The perpetrator shows strength by allowing the victim a chance at vengeance, even though the victim is usually dead. '<br><br>You say, 'What vengeance'<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu says 'Vengeance can only be wrought if the victim is given the goblin skin. Since the victim is usually dead it's not much of a danger. But..it has been known to happen. Ironically, this vengeance is possible through the use of the Blue Flame. This flame can act as a doorway to the nether realm, to [summon] the spirit of a victim. On the skin is recorded the House name of the victim and the reason for the deed. '<br><br>You say, 'What summon'<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu says 'Only the Denouncer can call forth a vengeful spirit from the flames. But before he can do so, he'll need blood from a member of the victim's House. Once the blood is cast into the flames, the spirit will emerge only for a short time before the negative pull of the other world draws it back. Why do you ask so many questions on this? Do you have one of these skins? '<br><br>You say, 'Yes'<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu says 'Ahh, well I'll assume if you could read it you wouldn't be asking these questions. Fortunately for you I do have the ability to read these skins and will do so for only one star ruby. These spirits will often reward those who give them their vengeance. With my translation you may find the name of the House. Hand me the skin and a star ruby and we'll see. '<br><br>[Hand him the flayed goblin skin and a star ruby]<br><br>Nallar Q`Tentu takes the scroll and removes an ornate magnifying glass from a pocket. After some examination and many frowns along with interjections of 'Hmmm,' he hands the scroll back to you and says, 'Unlucky for you indeed. The name of the House has been removed. This can only happen when the House itself is wiped out by another House. All record of that House is destroyed if the attacking house is succesful. You still have a chance though. Many House refugees find homes in other Houses. The Everliving Mayong is known to take in any Teir'Dal rabble, try his castle.'<!--EZCODE HTML START-->  <hr><!--EZCODE HTML END-->[Go back to Zanotix and give him a vial of noble blood from Mistmoore Castle]<br><br>Zanotix Ixtaz accepts the vial and looks you over, eyebrow raised. He says, 'Well, a sacrifice to feed my forge. You have done Neriak a great service, Citizen Seiryu. I shall burn it now.' He then holds the vial up the the flames, the blood seems to glow brightly as he stares into it. Then suddenly, with the shout of an arcane phrase, he throws the vial violently into the flame. The force shatters the vial, spilling the blood about the flames. Almost immediately the flames flare up to the ceiling. When they die down a presence is felt within the flames. '<br><br>[Cast see-invisible on yourself]<br><br>You say, 'Hail, vengeful spirit'<br><br>[Hand the vengeful spirit the flayed gnoll skin]<br><br>vengeful spirit flares brightly as you place the scroll into the blue flames of the forge. The scroll quickly catches fire and burns out in a flash of white fire. In it's place is left a hammer. As you snatch the hammer from the flames you hear the spirit begin to cackle wildly and fade away.<br><br>Your faction standing with NeriakCitizen got better.<br>You gain experience!!<!--EZCODE HTML START--> <hr><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqcaster.com/images/hammer4.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Congratulations to Seiryu on the Quellious server for being the first person to complete and to publish the details on the quest!!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvaslin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaslin</A> at: 2/20/02 11:15:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uriphter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Riphter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/19/02 1:45:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lost Quests - The Blued Steel Hammer</span><hr size=1> But...
