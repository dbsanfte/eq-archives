<br>
And I've surfed the web like a madman looking for reports and tidbits about everyone else's experiences there.<br>
<br>
And so far, the Planes of Power seems to be the exact opposite of what Shadows of Luclin was.<br>
<br>
It hasn't been patched heavily.<br>
<br>
It has delivered on many of the things it advertised.<br>
<br>
It has so far really upped the level of questing and involvement in the game while taking measures to maintain balance to those quests and prevent farming/mudflation (character flags and soulmarks seem like they may work at keeping content/loot/quests/items a progressive, group oriented adventure instead of ye ole Bazaar camp).<br>
<br>
Anyways, what's this got to do with the recent monk changes?<br>
<br>
The monsters in Planes of Power and the dynamic that SoE seems to be going for with the expansion, that's what.<br>
<br>
The mobs there hit pretty hard (even the yard trash, which is most of what I've been hit by).<br>
<br>
But, their hit points and armor class and defensive abilities and regeneration aren't excessively insane, like one might find in Velious or Luclin.<br>
<br>
A LOT of the initial encounters so far are designed to be 1 to 2 group doable.<br>
<br>
This means it really is restrictive on the power level of the monsters.<br>
<br>
SOOOOOOO ... back to monks.<br>
<br>
Many of the hits I've taken from PoP mobs have been for full damage. (I'm level 56, btw, not 60 or 61).<br>
<br>
I couldn't SOLO these mobs, toe-to-toe style.<br>
<br>
Before the change I probably could have stood a chance.<br>
<br>
I believe the change was made for this very reason. To protect some of this content and keep it not-so-trivial.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I've been able to tackle a lot of these mobs with small groups of 3 to 4 people. And not really needing the perfect group makeup either.<br>
<br>
The recent changes may have benefitted warriors a LOT in making them very VERY good tanks for these encounters.<br>
<br>
That, however, I feel is a good thing (warriors are sort of supposed to be doing that kind of thing).<br>
<br>
I don't know. The jury's still out on all of this, obviously, as more and more of the planes get explored and opened up.<br>
<br>
But ... I have a feeling they made this change to our specifically in regards to Planes of Power and because of that they won't be changing us back to what we were before the patch.<br>
<br>
And I seriously doubt they're going to WANT to up our damage any. BUT, you are all welcome to keep that debate going. Maybe it'll get some response (it did before).<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd share with ya my take on monks and the planes.<br>

<br>
Good example, the level 55 Skellies in the Grey (the ones surrounding the lake).  Can't solo them with my monk (lvl 60, fungi, primal, 3.5khp unbuffed).  Add a cleric, and sure, no problem (takes 2-3 CHeals a fight iirc). <br>
<br>
The mobs in PoP are just too hard to solo for a Monk.  A Monk could only solo low blues efficiently (before the patch). Try anything harder, and you'll get owned.  Add a decent support class, and suddenly you can take on mobs that are LOTS stronger.<br>

Your point is well made Wubao, and your speculation may well be right. If one considers though that any mob you might be able to solo pre-nerf, a Necro, Druid, Shaman, Wizard, Mage or Beastlord (and Rangers situationaly with animals) can solo post-nerf. Then one is left wondering why the Monk was singled out.<br>
<br>
Anything that a Monk might have gotten even close to making trivial any of the above classes would have made trivial while the player was eating their dinner.<br>
<br>
And remember we're not considering here who or who shouldn't be able to solo, but rather whether PoP content should be saved from being trivial by nerfing a class.... Trivialised content is trivialised content whether is a Druid making it trivial or a Monk.<br>
<br>
In the old world many of us will remember the disparity between the Caster and the Melee. Some might have regarded it as a period of the tyrany of the Caster. During Kunark things were rebalanced so the Melees were once more a potent component. At some point it was felt that this needed to be readressed with further Caster balancing... abviously the initial mess in the old world had been forgotten... and some might speculate that we're back to where we started with Casters able to aquire XP and wealth far far in excess of what a melee might hope to aquire.<br>
<br>
Given this, I would suggest that it is the Casters that are able to trivialise content, not the pre-nerf Monk bottom feeding in Velks. Because that's all the solo Monk was able to do... bottom feed in the mud.... we weren't quad kiting, we weren't rooting and rotting, we werent snare/fear/pet kiting, we weren't sat behind a pet nuking or playing pet cleric.<br>
<br>
In PoP we haven't had our abilities to churn through solo xp buffed across the board with spells.... we were nerfed, so that bottom feeding is that much harder.<br>
<br>
VI wants you in a small, small box with narrow parameters of play... meanwhile they'll dream up more and more things the caster (and by reflection the Hybrid), can do.<br>
<br>
After over 3 years of play, the most they can come up with for pure melees is one taking damage, and two doing damage... and each of the three having to compete with Hybrids for their right to do it. <p><hr />

<br>
For instance, yard trash mobs in Plane of Innovation.  They kick my ass and I feign them off when they're above 50 percent.  Chances are I wouldn't have been able to solo them (well enough to consider soloing them for exp) before the nerf.  I can easily see soloing them with my magician.<br>
<br>
So while I agree with the actual effect of the nerf, a crippling of the monk's ability to solo, I don't really agree with that reason because there are and always have been classes that can solo better than monks.<br>

Yup the effect of the nerf has been hard on monk soloing, harder than on monk tanking infact.<br>

<br>
* Monk Defense. Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks. Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment. This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose. <br>
<br>
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character. It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br>
<br>
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness. This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game. Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br>
<br>
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power. The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this. Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class. Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem. <br>
<br>
Monk defense will be altered somewhat. It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes. (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.) It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to. As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br>
<br>
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it. What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks. The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.&quot;<br>

<br>
Many of the recent patches have had this effect.<br>
<br>
Spellcaster NPC changes, resist changes, the XP smoothing out, the XP table tweak, and the monk mitigation change have all made it harder, and less efficient for the average/casual soloing monk who doesn't 2-box.<br>
<br>
So yah, I agree they're putting us into a smaller box or limiting our options.<br>
<br>
Hadn't considered how they planned to deal with the standard soloing classes.<br>
<br>
PoJ doesn't seem to have enough room for them to solo. (Tight hallways and cells, and the threat of adds).<br>
<br>
Disease does though. Disease definitely has a lot of room for the soloing kiter. And has little patches of flies that would be insane quadding fodder.<br>
<br>
Gonna have to wait and see what the druids/wizards do with that.<br>
<br>
I still think Verant wanted to bring the hammer down on the soloing monk, for &quot;fear&quot; of what it would do in Planes of Power. Or at least if/when they finally do start responding to our pleas of why did they do this, I have a feeling they're going to hide behind Planes of Power and make that the official excuse.<br>

If we're talking about the &quot;right to solo&quot;... each of the classes mentioned solo SOOO better than the Monk it's really not funny.

Hey lets get rid of a Wizards nukes and turn him into a pet class... fuck that he might have chosen a Wizard based on what was laid out infront of him. lets just rede-fucking-fine him.<br>

And to drive the point home... out of the pure melees, Rogues is the only one who can backstab.... yes its an assinine statement that doesn't actually mean a thing.<br>

Very true Grazzel. Just the addition of Fungi, Silken Whip of Ensaring and Truncheon of Doom can allow a warrior to solo decently. Most however don't make those gear decisions, even though the later two are dirt cheap.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I play both a warrior and a rogue, and I'd like to make a comment about this. This is purely my opinion, but it's a statement backed with many days of playing these classes.<br>
<br>
Yes, some warriors can solo, but no warrior would put on a fungi to do so if they knew what they were doing. Firstly, the two most soloable warrior races (ogres and trolls) cannot even wear a fungi (though they can wear the no-drop Luclin version). Secondly, and perhaps most important, you're talking about an AC 21, -10 to DEX/AGI chestpiece. Warriors as a rule do not have high DEX and AGI, and they'd need both to proc their weapons and to avoid being hit.<br>
<br>
No...a soloing warrior would rather have a cobalt BP (AC 45, +12 STR/STA/DEX, 100 pt right-click post-combat heal) or some similar BP (heavy rubicite, heraldic plate, etc.). The prices are similar, though.<br>
<br>
I'm not denying your original points about soloing, I'm just saying that what's good for an agile monk kind of sucks for a lumbering warrior once they've hit level 45 or so.<br>
<br>
Peace.<br>

I'm sorry but the only race that can not wear a non luclin fungi in the Vah Shir so you are wrong here. This item has been out since Kunark and being that you don't even know what races can wear it shows your vase ignorance as a whole.<br>

Very polished, very well done.  I have suspicions though that later planes will see a lot of patching (the ones that probably didn't receive the most attention from testers).<br>
<br>
HP and AC (mitigation) are key to being a tank for any PoP zone.  When compared to Warriors and Knights, we can not fill the role as tank.  At least I can't.  We're about on par with Rangers and Bards now (maybe better, maybe worse, depending on gear).  With slower in group, I can tank yard trash with a healer, but it slows down exp grind quite a bit cause it wont take the healer long to be OOM.  If the mobs had any more HP this wouldn't even be an option.  Add more damage to the group and Monk tank might be more viable.<br>
<br>
Feign Death is our last and most useful skill.  Without it, we'd be passed up for just about anyone else in game for groups.  Get used to it, and learn to be the best puller you can be with what you got.  What makes this sad though, is all the basic exp groups for the initial exp zones (Nightmare, Disease, Justice, Innovation) don't really need a FD puller.  Almost all yard trash can be singled (only Innovation presents a pulling challenge from time to time).  Graveyards make CR a bit pointless if you wipe anywhere further than zone-in.  The only thing I can say though is FD seems to be working <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>very</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> well in PoP.  Mobs in this regard act much more like Kunark/Old World era mobs instead of Velious or Luclin mobs.  Maybe VI has finally embraced FD pulling.<br>
<br>
I expect a lot less monk twinks these days (esp. since PoP offers monks so very little when compared to hybrids).<br>
<br>
Or quit.  VI isn't listening.  Other classes don't care.  It's a bit depressing. <p><hr>

Heheh, okay, you got me there, Kokeui. I've never owned a Fungi on any of my characters, and I was under the impression that the reason why this item existed...<br>
<br>
Fungus Patch Vest   <br>
(drops in Fungus Grove)<br>
LORE ITEM  <br>
AC: +21, Str: +2, Agi: -10, Dex: -10, Int: +2  <br>
Weight: 2.0 <br>
Classes: Warrior Rogue Bard Shaman Beastlord  <br>
Races: Barbarian Troll Ogre Iksar Vah Shir  <br>
Effect: Fungal Regrowth <br>
 <br>
...was specifically to allow the large races to have a fungi tunic.<br>
<br>
Still, my point is valid: if you were a warrior, who lives and dies by mitigation, would you want the above (same stats as the regular fungi) or would you want this...<br>
<br>

Classes: Warrior  <br>
Races: Dwarf Ogre Troll Gnome Dark Elf Barbarian Erudite Halfling Wood Elf High Elf Half Elf Human Vah Shir  <br>
Effect: Invigorate <br>
 <br>
Hmmm...a difference in raw AC of 24, in DEX of 22, no loss in AGI, 10 more STR, +50 HP's (+116 HP's at level 55 due to +12 STA), and the 100 pt heal every 15 seconds at level 45+. Let me think...<br>
<br>
I may not know my monkly gear that well, but I do know warriors. I do not denigrate your monkly knowledge, please do not make belittling blanket statements about my knowledge based on single errors...and if you do, please learn to use the right word, m'kay?

Ummmm hrmmm.  My base dex without buffs is like 120ish my agi is like 120ish as well.  Don't care about agi and dex and AC.  The 40-50ac you'll lose will be made up by the health your always regening.  Don't knock it till you try it.  Ask any monk with a fungi how fast their solabilty goes down.  Its alot, im living it right now it sucks.  You should actually try gearing yourself for solo'ing, you guys have access to weapons that slow for crying out loud /drool, get your regen up and you'll see how much faster you solo that way.
