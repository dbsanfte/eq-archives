we all know dying sucks, no matter how it happens, and so does getting your corpse camped. you know for a fact that if you just finished trying to kill the toughest mob in youjr life, it has 10hp left, and you cant barely move from lack of health, then, whats this, someone comes up and stabs you in the back. it sucks, it just plain sucks, but you deal with it. but we all know, that when that happens, you will be heard to yell @#$!.<br>
<br>
and2, you dont own the place, you never have, you never will. this is not boot camp. if you want to fnd out what ownage is, try getting summoned and binded to veeshans peak by a crazed GM. thats ownage, not you pretending to be king on a player vs player server.<br>

<br>
&quot;EQPvP 101 The Basics: Attitude<br>
<br>
For those just starting on a Zek Server <br>
<br>
Lesson 1: I came here to annoy people<br>
<br>
Repeat after me, 'I came here to annoy people'<br>
<br>
If you are not here to kill and harass other players until they cancel their account, take your blubie ass to Friendly Ro, Mithaniel Campsalot, Happy Thule, or better yet just move to Bostwana, because they don’t have Everquest there and most have never even seen a video game. You can live the rest of your life without anyone calling you a “gay homo fag”, so you can build up your self esteem enough to get a girlfriend. As every Everquest player knows, having a girlfriend is the most important RL quality you can possess, so if you have one be sure to mention her as much as possible over /guildchat and during /ooc smacktalk. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 2: Somebody called me gay. How did they know about my experience at summer camp? I was pre-pubescent and just experimenting, so it doesn’t really count… right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You are an insignificant WORM. Everquest is not for WORMS, it’s for MEN. In fact I don’t think any video games have yet been made for worms, not even WORMS. So plan on people talking @#%$, plan on having your sexuality questioned, plan on seeing the word “the” misspelled. <br>
<br>
When people talk @#%$, are you just going to listen and go back to gaining XP? No, you miserable shell of fossilized worm feces, that would be playing the game the wrong way. Remember, WORM, you did not come here to slay dragons, you came here to DESTROY the self confidence of others. The sooner you get it through your bluebie head that you are an ANIMAL and REALIZE that this is what you wanted to be, the more MENACING you will become. You are not a gawky teenager playing Everquest, you are a FIERCE AND SCARY beast! You’re a MAN! RAWWWRRRR!<br>
<br>
If somebody calls you a homosexual and claims to have had sex with your mother for a modest amount of money, stand up for yourself and tell them that they are, in fact, the true homosexual, and that the claims of your mother exchanging sex for money were a thinly veiled attempt at covering up the fact that their mother is a prostitute. <br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 3: You just got PK’ed, what now?<br>
<br>
<br>
Aweee, did Mister Meanie come gank you and take your spawn? Do you want a tissue? Super soft or regular strength? With or without aloe? What’s the difference? It doesn’t matter. Nobody cares about you, WORM. That spawn now belongs to Mister Meanie, because he is better than you. Nobody cares that you died. Want to cry? Go ahead, maggot, nobody will listen except to laugh. Just like when Dad laughed at you when you said you wanted a My Little Pony playhouse for your 11th birthday, and nobody cared about what you really wanted, and mom said “Tony I don’t want you to be so different” and you said “mom I just want the ponies because they’re cool and I like horses!”<br>
<br>
“My final answer is no Tony, your father agrees with me”<br>
<br>
“That’s right son, I don’t want no boy of mine playing with pink horses”<br>
<br>
“but all my friends like horses and Julie said…”<br>
<br>
“ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE GIRLS, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? CAN’T YOU GO PLAY BASEBALL OR SOMETHING NORMAL? QUIT CRYING!”<br>
<br>
“Oh Dan you’ve really hurt his feelings”<br>
<br>
“GET YOUR PANSY ASS TO YOUR ROOM! I can’t stand to watch you cry.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 4: You are at the bottom of the food chain<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Zek, Mister Worm. You will eat dirt and like it. As an insignificant worm, you are supposed to like dirt. After all, you gather your life-giving nutrients from organic material in the dirt, which makes bacteria grow in your gut. As the dirt passes through your body, the bacteria in your stomach is added to the soil. Plants can then grow bigger and stronger with the bacteria-rich soil, and animals who eat the plants will be more healthy, and animals who eat the animals that eat plants will get more food, and so on. We would like to thank you, Mister Worm, for building the foundation of our wonderful world! But remember, as a worm, you are on the bottom of the food chain. We could crush you at any time we want, and while that will only weaken the foundation of our world and eventually lead to our demise, we don’t have the foresight to realize this. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You may ask, who are ‘We’? We are the first generation players of the Zek servers who run this place. We have eight times the amount of /played time that you do. Our guild sold enough plat on playerauctions to purchase each member a toilet-chair. Think of this as a jail cell, and we run the block. Or better yet, imagine it as a high-school, and we’re the bullies. Except instead of hanging out in the weight room, we hang out in the A/V room. <br>
<br>
And if we can’t kill you because you’re out of range, hiding, on the same team, or whatever? We’re the Gods of this server, it doesn’t matter. We can stare at you menacingly. We can say really mean things. Just remember, you EARN the right to breathe, and eat something else besides dirt. You EARN this right by being tougher then the people who are telling you that you don’t have this right. You EARN your respect, and your reputation. You EARN the right to stop being a worm, and start being a rat.<br>
<br>
When you actually move up from Worm to Rat, you own the worms. Just be careful, because some worms have cats as friends who like to eat Rats who get too big for their ability to produce death. If this happens, I suggest making some dog friends. Or better yet, a monkey/dog/machine gun hybrid friend that could kill dogs, cats, rats and worms with its semi-automatic laser beam arms. That would be awesome.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 5: The man’s game<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So you’re mad that somebody killed you when you were low on health? You’ve obviously learned nothing, worm. Go back and read lesson 2. <br>
PvP servers are not for pansies. It takes a strong MAN to play this game, and in no way is it for pansies. Did you hear that dad? I’m playing a tough man’s game! I don’t need girl toys! I’M NOT A PANSY DAD, I’M TOUGH!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I’M TOUGH!! <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
The whole blueby thing is quite funny.  Considering that most Best of the Best have been won by non PvP server characters.  That Elite Jail cell PvP didnt help all that much.<br>
<br>
Face it, PvP in EQ is broke.  Lets say it together &quot;PvP in EQ is broke.&quot;  good!<br>

Apparently all the PnP stuff is gone off the other zeks (so I hear).  Hopefully it is going well.  PnP has no place on a pvp server.  There is no backing off.  My god has given me the specific mandate to kill you.  I kill you, I stand on your corpse and kill you again when you come for it.  Then with a little luck, I kill your friends when they come to help, and camp their corpses as well.  You get me, I bring all the biggest mobs I can find in the zone to welcome your friends, then resume camping your corpses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hows that xp loss taste?&quot;<br>
<br>
But I digress.  The only annoying thing about sullon is being caught with a load of plat on yourself, lom, low on health, and having to flee from a fight.  I've only seen more bull**** while driving by a dairy.<br>
<br>
&quot;I pwned you.  Tell your friends you got pwned by a green druid&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dude, you couldn't pwn your way out of a paper bag.  Stay there, I'll be right back&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;haha, loser!  my supermodel girlfriend is asking me to log off, c-ya wuss&quot;<br>
<br>
Not trying to build up Sullon.  It just seemed ludicrous to me after playing on Sullon for a while that play nice policies were in place on other Zeks.  Why not only enable PvP in the arena...  Oh wait, they did on the blue servers.  Hoping the transition is working well for you folks (if that rumor is true).<br>

P.S if you have a lvl 60 char on RZ i think your a moron and dont plan on really enjoying the game for what it was meant for......i just play my RZ ranger when i feel like slumming:P<br>

would rather be on a server where a monk can actually wear his fungi tunic and consider himself safe:P<br>
<br>
P.S.S if you ever see my ranger everwood on RZ be sure to kill me and know that 20seconds later i will just log too my 56 ranger on ECI with full ToV and let you simmer on that while trying not to get PKed for the 6th time that day:P<br>

Sorry if you like a game where the only challenge is to overcome the horribly unimpressive NPC AI.<br>
<br>
I play a lvl 60 cleric on Rallos Zek.  I have nice gear.  (tov stuff, that shard from burrower, etc)  My guild earned the right to doing all of this stuff because for a few months there was an allout war between a few guilds.  The victors remain on the server, the losers mostly went to legends or quit.  Yep, we missed out on doing some of the big stuff first because we were pvping.  So?  That's another part of the game that I happen to enjoy.  Does that mean we waste time?  Not if we enjoy it.  Currently there's very few things my guild hasn't killed, and after this weekend hopefully Emp will be eating dirt and we'll be on to VT.  Have fun with your 56 ranger tho :/<br>

Why do PvP servers lose? Why do blubie servers win? Because we have fun doing other things besides leveling and raiding, and it's true, we don't have as good gear for the  most part. I remember back when I played on Tallon my guild went in to kill Naggie....we all buffed up, and we're about to kill when &quot;uberguild_01&quot; comes and starts a 50vs50 war.....so what happens? My guild gets wiped. What happens next? &quot;Uberguild_02&quot; comes in and whipes out &quot;uberguild_o1&quot;. How much fun is that? Very much fun I can say. Different people like different things....personally, I like PvP servers. I LOVE being able to kill the person who killed me last week...revenge is a sweet thing. I LOVE being able to kill the person who repeatedly trains the zone time after time, and you know the GM's won't do crap about it (or by the time they do, it's 12 hours  later and he's already logged). And the people on this post aren't trying to say that you aren't playing &quot;real eq&quot; by playing on a blue server. We're not saying that we're any better than you cause it's harder for us to level. That's something we chose. ALL this post is trying to say is....you come to our server, DO NOT whine after you die, because it will happen. That's what makes us the most upset <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Infact, I got killed last night by an enchanter who had Yvolcarn in CS dire charmed.....sheesh did that suck.

::grins:: Never traded with the pointy eared ones. And I'll remind ye the Shanks began in the Safehouse, we were born here in roleplay and always have been one of the unofficial Safehouse guilds along with some others that are no longer with us.<br>
