He'd often watch people start their day, and half wonder what their life was like.<br>
Everyday he saw several in particular that were of interest. Two were a young couple, who owned a shop and loved eachother very much.<br>
He watched them kiss hello and stock their store.<br>
&quot;Normal life...&quot;<br>
He realized just how much he wasn't connected to the world.<br>
&quot;All I am is a lot of beliefs, combat moves, and several traits loosely nailed down to a shallow and ever-changing personality. Yet I feel nothing wrong. I walk on the earth as if it's a dormant volcano, just waiting the next blast... Is that anyway to live...?&quot;<br>
Coriard interupted his thoughts with the smell of breakfast and a call to come in.<br>
He played with his food until Coriard tried to throw a butter knife at him. He caught it in the air by the blade and jammed it into the table.<br>
Coriard wasn't startled.<br>
&quot;Not bad.&quot;, he muttered.<br>
&quot;I'm giving you the day off today, go to town, enjoy yourself.&quot;<br>
Xvar looked at him in disbelief.<br>
&quot;Noone can train everyday, it's not healthy. While you're there get me some bread and pork alright?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, sure, no problem.&quot;<br>
Xvar wasn't sure what to do, the idea of coming here purely for enjoyment was a foreign concept to him.<br>
He walked around, getting himself a fried rat as a treat. As he began to eat it he bumped into a girl, probably of his age or so. He wasn't sure what to do, he apoligised and helped her up.<br>
She blushed and giggled and ran off, turning around once or twice and pointing him out to her friends.<br>
Xvar was confused.<br>
He belched and got what Coriard needed then began to return back. On the way he stopped by a small shrine to the &quot;7 Saviors&quot; everyone was happy to see him and cheered him.<br>
Putting on a grin he bowed humbly then left, they always gave him some free treat so it was worth the crowd.<br>
On the way home he saw the girl going into her house, and felt the urge to make note of it. He wondered why it was important.<br>
Shrugging he noted the location and went home... <p>"If I had a dick I'd go get laid, but we'll do the next best thing."

The most confusing thing was their very existance, rather then what they were. But, what they were confused him just as much.<br>
Somehow he had never noticed girls his age, in fact he hadn't really noticed anyone. He wondered why it had taken so long, and why now?<br>
In fact, this might have been the most confusing part of all, now, while he was training to be a rogue he was gaining feeling?<br>
Coriard could sense this.<br>
Xvar was adept in the artifices of the shadow, but of the heart?<br>
He shook his head violently, denying he felt anything.<br>
&quot;I'm becoming WEAK!!&quot; he screamed.<br>
Coriard sat down on the table next to his hammock.<br>
&quot;Compassion, and feeling, are not always a weakness, and you are not necessarily destined to be a rogue...&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, different people fight and want to be the best for different reasons.<br>
When I was young, I wanted revenge, nothing more, nothing less. But as I got older my hatred cooled and I simply wanted to be the best. My passion for revenge was stronger, so I ended up growing weaker....&quot;<br>
Xvar hung on every word, although mystified, he felt the words made perfect sense.<br>
Coriard say besides Xvar, looking somewhere distant.<br>
&quot;You might need to find something to fight for.&quot;<br>
An image of the girl ran like a lighting bolt through Xvar's mind.<br>
&quot;Don't worry Xvar, I can make you the best -- you just need to figure out why you want to be the best.&quot;<br>

It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?<br>
I know you got my last two e-mails, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect.<br>

Hey Kor, "I drank a fifth of vodka, ya dare me to drive?"<br>
You know that song by Phil Collins from "The Air In The Night"?<br>
About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning?<br>
But didn't? Then Phil saw it all then at his show he found him?<br>
That's kinda how this is. You could have rescued me from drowning.<br>
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy.<br>

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call.<br>
I hope you know I ripped all o' your pictures off the wall.<br>
Think about it.<br>
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.<br>
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it.<br>
I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me.<br>

But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you.<br>

---------------------------<br>
Xvar questioned himself extensively. The long inner monologue continued far into the night, resulting in a near nightmarish half sleep that plagued him until dawn.<br>
Coriard understood Xvar's dilemma and told him to take the week off and figure it out.<br>
&quot;My training will be of no use to you unless you know why you want it.&quot;<br>
Xvar decided to see the girl, somehow just thinking about her made part of him feel like it made sense. But most of his confusion was like a thick despair, veiled only by his own ignorance of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  living</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
He only knew of hate and war, and Sett's death.<br>
Sett's death made no sense to him, and yet he somehow understood Sett needed to die, and that he would never have been able to live whether the war had came to their sucess or not.<br>
Xvar felt almost silly as he straighten himself up, Coriard smirked and walked to his side, putting a hand on his shoulder like a father would.<br>
&quot;You have lived life like a cold hearted soldier, go now, live life as a boy.&quot;<br>
Xvar looked up at him, amazed that Coriard could seem to sum up the full span of his feelings with such a simple sentence.<br>
He walked to the market, it's platform well worn by the steps of the elven tree dwellers.<br>
It was the first time he had really noticed it, he never thought much of it, but after visiting several food stands he smiled.<br>
He then saw the girl, she looked dressed up, as if for some special event.<br>
He handled a pear looking for bruises, as she as if out of nowhere simply appeared by him.<br>
She smiled at him as he gaped and dropped the pear. The merchant cursed, and Xvar gave him it's price.<br>
&quot;My name is Serhan, what's yours?&quot;<br>
He stumbled in his words slightly, &quot;Me? Oh, Xvar, uhh, Hi, nice to meet you.. uh...&quot;<br>
Another man, Xvar's age but bulkier put his elbow up on the wall of the stand and flirted with Serhan.<br>
Xvar frowned for a minute, then had a thought, he grabbed the choiciest piece of fruit, bought it, and handed it to her with a smile, &quot;Here, hopefully I won't drop this.&quot;<br>
He felt completely satisfied with the simple sentence and began to turn around when the other man grabbed him by the shoulder.<br>
&quot;Serhan is my girl, you stay away from her!&quot;<br>
Serhan prostested, &quot;I am not, leave him alone, he's been perfectly civil.&quot;<br>
&quot;Him? Just some scruffy rogue's apprentice with you? Never.&quot;<br>
Xvar's eyes narrowed, but his expression was unwavering -- as was his tone.<br>
&quot;Let the girl alone, we barely exchanged a sentence, don't embaress us all with your ignorance.&quot;<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What!?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  dare</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> denounce me! I come from a well to do family!&quot;<br>
The other man threw a punch.<br>
Xvar grabbed his arm in mid air and squeezed it while turning it to the side.<br>
&quot;I told you, leave her alone.&quot;<br>
With one clean movement, and none from his feet he threw the man into a hay stand.<br>
As the man yelled while stuggling in the hay, Xvar smiled at the girl, then walked away...<br>
She stood dumbfounded as the man pulled the hay out of his hair by her side and asked if she was ok.<br>
&quot;A fairy tale....&quot;, she mumbled.<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh nothing.&quot; She said with a smile.<br>
&quot;Imagine that, a rogue flirting with you. He obviously doesn't realize you're promised to me. And he doesn't know who I am either.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh yeah, you're dad's the self-pronouced master artisan around here, he probably doesn't even care.&quot;<br>
She sighed, and bit into the pear. Musing over the mysterious boy named Xvar...<br>
Xvar lay back in his hammock thinking. Wishing he was a hero. Suddenly what he was dreaming about hit him like a brick wall.<br>
&quot;A hero? Me? But I never wanted to be one before.... What's going on?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What's wrong with me!!?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
His dirty fingernails made small red indents in his palm as he opened his fist.<br>
He picked at the dirt with the point of his dagger, thinking.<br>

This stories done. You killed it. He is a hero remember his last adventure? He was one of the seven best "light" fighters in the world. So I won't check here anymore, it's ruined. <p><CENTER>

The way he saw it, killing all those people for no obvious reason did not make him a hero.<br>
This story is purely about the development of his characther, not just the events in the world. Although they will effect him, they are not the focus.<br>
<br>
How am I killing the story by introducing the idea that Xvar is going through a &quot;personal identity crisis&quot;?<br>
Not all heros, or villians have to know exactly who they are, and I feel in this case it adds depth to his characther...<br>
<br>
Xvar has lived <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> his life as if he had no heart, as a simple warrior with no life or experience at living.<br>
He does not even fully comprehend who he is, or who a hero is. Or if he wants to be who he is or not.<br>
If you felt this killed the story then fine, I'm not changing it. <p><img src=http://SoBB.homestead.com/files/image1.jpg>

The effects of little sleep were catching up to him. Light gray circles under his eyes and slight fatigue humbled him into a slow walk.<br>
----------------------------<br>
Serhan walked through the market, impervious to her suiters' flirts.<br>
She sat back on a bench, resting her back on one of the great trees that holds up Kelethin.<br>
She felt some paper crumble under her back and turned around to look.<br>
In very faded black ink well worn by rain and wind it read:<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THE WINNERS OF THE CONTEST ARE:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->&quot;<br>
She scanned through it and only 1 name seemed to jump out at her and looked legible.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Xvar&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
----------------------------<br>
Coriard walked up behind Xvar, Xvar thought he was sneaking up on him and just as he was about to turn around Coriard held something under his nose.<br>
The edges of the room blurred and swirled as he fell to the ground, asleep like a rock.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry Xvar, but you need it.&quot;<br>
Xvar's dreams were cloudy, and there memory stayed with him even when he opened his eyes.<br>
He dreamed of the harbor, and of Sett, and of so many dying.<br>
He reached for them, but they fell back into the black hole that was his subconsious...<br>
He woke up in a cold sweat, panting, his hands shivering.<br>
&quot;Sett.. what could I have done to save you?&quot;<br>
Xvar nearly screamed, but managed to contain his rage. He stood up, Coriard was nowhere to be found and it looked to be about mid day, maybe a bit past lunch.<br>
Shaking the coppers in his pocket he decided to go get something to eat.<br>
-----------------------<br>
&quot;Aww c'mon Serhan, run away with me, what do you want with a fool like Yurd anyway?&quot;<br>
&quot;I have no choice, I am promised to him, leave me.&quot;<br>
The discouraged suiter moped off and Yurd soon took his place beside Serhan, boorishly flirting...<br>
-----------------------<br>
Xvar walked down the platforms when he overheard a couple of people, obviously talking in secret, he listened in on them.<br>
&quot;What will be do about the King?&quot;<br>
The other man didn't look nervous at all, &quot;Kill him of course, we can find an assassin easily here.&quot;<br>
Parts of the conversation he could not hear, mostly it was just tidbits.<br>
&quot;Once we have control of this army, we'll band up with the orcs, we've got them on alert too...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes but what about...&quot;<br>
&quot;No problems, I'll have someone dispose of him as well, him and the apprentice.&quot;<br>
&quot;But what if they'd be willing to work for us?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hah, never. We'd better just get rid of them now before the apprentice is fully learned in the artifices.&quot;<br>
The other man nodded morbidly.<br>
&quot;I don't like all this killing, is it necessary?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes. Don't worry, we're disposing of obstacles for the true path we will create. Just stay calm, don't get scared.&quot;<br>
Xvar had positioned himself so he could see one of their faces, the man with the deeper voice who had all the plans was very tall and stout. He looked to be a barbarian, whilest the other one, who's face he couldn't see looked to be an elf.<br>
&quot;What if someone discovers us?&quot;<br>
&quot;Soon that will not matter.&quot;<br>
The elf nodded.<br>
&quot;Well, I have everything in place, we're all ready to begin.&quot;<br>
&quot;Good. And I'm sorry to inform you, but we won't be needing your help anymore.&quot;<br>
The elf step back several paces, and as if out of nowhere someone else pushed him off the platform and shot him with an arrow on his descent.<br>
&quot;Good thinking, I'm sure that foolish druid had levitate.&quot;<br>
The thud was not even heard, and when he was finally found, the arrow was that of an orc, and it was not considered something worth investigation.<br>

The two thugs that had been hiding in the shadows stepped out and bowed to him.<br>
&quot;Yes Af-&quot;<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Do not say my name fools!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
&quot;Forgive me sir!&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't let it happen again -- now go.&quot;<br>
The two thugs stood up and ran off, one looked to be an iksar, who jumped high in the air onto a roof and jumped from roof to roof. The other was an elf. He threw his cape around him and walked 3 steps before fading into nothingness.<br>
Xvar was not in the least suprised.<br>
&quot;Who have I stumbled upon?&quot; he thought to himself.<br>
The barbarian threw himself backwards, he dissappeared before he got even remotely close to hitting the ground.<br>
&quot;He was not a rogue... He must of been a shaman...&quot;<br>
He to pulled his cloak over himself and shadowed.<br>
&quot;Farren!&quot; the iksar hissed, &quot;I ssssmell ssssomeone....&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmm suppose it's the apprentice Tyu?&quot;<br>
&quot;He doesn't sssmell like I thought he would if he issss, but that doesssn't matter.&quot;<br>
Tyu stood up, arching his back and fully opening his nostrils, sucking in a huge breath.<br>
He closed his eyes and analyzed the smell.<br>
&quot;Yessss, it'ssss assss we feard, he'ssss clossse.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmph, he must be cloaked, did you bring the fog with you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yesss. Here.&quot;<br>
Farren took the bottle, uncloaking, then threw it up into the air as high as possible.<br>
Xvar knew the second it smashed on the platform he would be seen.<br>
Smirking, he jumped to the rope, just as the fog hit the platform, blocking his actions from site, but not revealing him.<br>
He swung from rope to rope then lept from the last onto another platform.<br>
&quot;How can I tell Coriard not to come home...&quot;<br>
Xvar immeaditately knew what to do and ran at full speed to the falconer....<br>

If the falcon reached Coriard before those two thugs did, then he and Coriard would have to devise a plan...<br>
If not...<br>
The worse case scenerio came into his mind..<br>
&quot;What if Coriard is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> killed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by these thugs? Then what shall I do?&quot;<br>
His thought loosely manifested itself into a low mumble that the falconer heard.<br>
&quot;What's wrong lad?&quot;<br>
&quot;Nothing, I have to go. If the falcon returns send him out again for me with any news.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sir...&quot;<br>
Xvar's eyes narrowed and his blade flew to the man's throat, stopping short by less then an inch.<br>
&quot;If I don't see the falcon, I assume you wish to die, understood?&quot;<br>
The falconer gulped nervously, &quot;Yes.. Yes sir!&quot;<br>
-------------<br>
It then dawned upon Xvar that he had nowhere to go, so he went back to the platform parallel to the house.<br>
Both thugs stood ready.<br>
The one called Farren stood picking his teeth with his dagger, whilest the one called Tyu stood sniffing the air.<br>
Xvar made sure he was not downwind.<br>
&quot;It'ssss getting late, ssssupossse he heard of usss coming for him and fled?&quot;<br>
&quot;Not likely.&quot;<br>
&quot;And jussst how do you know that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Their house was not disturbed at all, backpacks and armor were still there. If he was to flee, even with short notice he would have taken those things, correct?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yessss....&quot;<br>
&quot;Honestly Tyu, sometimes I think you're loosing your edge.&quot;<br>
Tyu hissed and bared his teeth, Farren stood unintimidated.<br>
&quot;Let's not fight, it's useless and will get in the way of our objectives.&quot;<br>
Tyu turned around and sniffed the air.<br>
&quot;Smell him yet?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, he'sssss not even closssse.&quot;<br>
&quot;To bad, I'm getting bored. How 'bout the apprentice, smell him?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, him neither, but I know he mussst of been here recently...&quot;<br>
Farren nodded, &quot;More evidence they had no idea we were coming, simple coincidence that they weren't home.&quot;<br>
Tyu grumbled and walked to the edge of the platform, looking down at some orc pawns.<br>
He spat and hit one of them right on the head, it cursed, threw it's hammer up about 10 feet, only to fall back on it's head and knock it right over.<br>
Tyu let out a laugh.<br>
&quot;Foolsssss...&quot;<br>
Tyu stretched and yawned, and mid yawn he stopped and stood stock still.<br>
He sniffed the air with pure curiousity.<br>
&quot;What is it? Do you smell him?&quot;<br>
&quot;Maybe... Not sssssure, sssssmellsssss like beer and him.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh how perfect, he'll be far easier to dispose of drunk, we can simply push him off the platform, it will look like and accident.&quot;<br>
Tyu sighed, &quot;Aww, I had wissssshed him to be a little harder then that...&quot;]<br>
&quot;Yes, so had I, but we have to do our job.&quot;<br>
----------------------------<br>
As Coriard walked up the platform steps a falcon landed before him and screached.<br>
&quot;Well Hello friend, what's this?&quot;<br>
A drunken man pushed him to the side and walked up the platform.<br>
&quot;Don't mind that rude man friend, tell me, what is this message you bring?&quot;<br>
-----------------------------<br>
&quot;As soon as you see him come up simply push him off, no questions asked.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yesss, good idea.&quot;<br>
A rather fat drunken man had just crested the last step when Tyu pushed him off.<br>
The man scream profusly until he hit the ground.<br>
&quot;@#%$, he wasn't Coriard.&quot;<br>
A falcon flew right over their head towards Xvar.<br>
&quot;What the...&quot; Tyu said watching it fly to the next platform.<br>
&quot;@#%$! He's been alerted, come Tyu, we were tricked!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessageRange?topicID=459.topic&start=201&stop=219>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=466.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=846.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=459.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=459.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=459.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=459.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
