I didn't include Pendragon or Mordred in the lists because they are not representative servers.<br>
<br>
Looks like we can draw two conclusions from the latest data:<br>
<br>
1. Assassin influence is basically stable from the period in which Archers topped the lists.  As a class we have been neither helped nor harmed by the drop in Archer dominance of RP totals.<br>
<br>
2. Assassin balance, in terms of RP's gained, has never been more even.  The last two 7 day periods have seen an increase in the number of Nightshades (Hibernia waking up and doing a lot more RvRing?) and a slight decrease in terms of the number of Shadowblades and Infiltrators represented.<br>
<br>
Assassins still appear substantially more often than you would expect taking up 53 out of 375 slots polled, however this is a far lower total than the Archers took up in aggregate before See Hidden.  Also there are a few classes, Runemaster and Skald notably, that appear more often than any of the Assassins.<br>
<br>
All of this sounds like good news to me for Assassins.  Now we just need to track and make sure that the last few weeks are not just an aberration. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubaym.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baym</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 2:48:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3672.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top 25's for the last 7 days: SB 19, Inf 18, NS 16</span><hr size=1> RPs mean more about time played and not balance.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/unandurius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nandurius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 2:58:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3672.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/phaas/phazer-avatar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top 25's for the last 7 days: SB 19, Inf 18, NS 16</span><hr size=1> <br>
The reason assassins and archers often have lots of hp is NOT because they are a strong class, or kill easily, but because they have the ability to go into RvR solo, avoid big groups and pick their fights. Stealthers _survice_ much easier than any other class because they are not found/killed as easily. Because of this, RvR is a lot less frustrating for stealthers and generally assassins RvR  more than non-stealth classes.<br>
<br>
High realm point scores are ONLY an idication of the amount  of time spent RvR'ing and shouldn't be used to judge a classes &quot;power&quot;, only their popularity.<br>
<br>
Any class can make the top25 rp tables, if you look around you'll find even &quot;unpopular&quot; classes with high rps.<br>
<br>
Archers lost their ability to solo-rvr, so you aren't going to see many of them in top25 rp earned. Assassins still have that ability, for now, and they are becoming more and more popular. On my server alone the number of level 50 assassins has quadrupled over the last month. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ushadowerbdc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowerBDC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 3:06:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3672.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top 25's for the last 7 days: SB 19, Inf 18, NS 16</span><hr size=1> &quot;High realm point scores are ONLY an idication of the amount of time spent RvR'ing and shouldn't be used to judge a classes &quot;power&quot;, only their popularity.&quot;<br>
<br>
However you cannot say the converse, lots of time RvRing does not necessarily turn into lots of RP's.  Because some classes are just not that gifted with the abilities to easily gain RP's.<br>
<br>
The distribution of RP's to various classes is likely heavily weighted by three factors:<br>
<br>
1.  The number of people playing that class in RvR.<br>
<br>
2.  The skills that they are gifted with bythe game system.<br>
<br>
3.  The combat skills that they bring to the table themselves.<br>
<br>
All that the recent numbers suggest is that there is not that much difference between the Assassins when you take all 3 of the above factors into account.<br>

Sheesh even Ubergnome aggrees that SBs need adjusting and we know that was like pulling teeth. Either get on board or move aside. But standing in the way of unnerfing recent nerfs and adjusted obvious imbalances just makes you look like a greedy 2 year old.

<br>
Comparing just the number of people in the top 25 from each class on the servers doesn't tell us very much.  You need to compare the number of RPs gained per class to the amount of time played per class to determine the relative strength of each class.<br>

I think we live longer and get more rps as the groups die around us.  We are often the last to die in an ambush.  This allows us to collect rps.  <br>
<br>
I do think that class skills impact these numbers, but they are not likely to be the main contributing factor.<br>
<br>
If your arguement is the case and the classes are ballanced then lets look at rps for the realms.<br>
<br>
Albion has 35.6% of all the rps (1869.2 million)<br>
Hibernia has 33% of all the rps (1729.2 million)<br>
Midguard has 31.4% of all the rps (1648.2 million)<br>
<br>
Those numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand rp points accross all the servers except mordred and  Pendragon.<br>
<br>
Ok so here we would say that alb clearly needs to be nerfed.  Hib is okay and midguard needs help.  Remember we are talking a difference of 4.1%.  That's a lot given that you are talking about a difference of 221 _million_ rps.  <br>
<br>
I know people will say wait albion has more people and that's the difference.  I am willing to bet that that's correct.  There are servers where alb is killing the others and there are servers where mid is killing the others and there are servers where hib is killing the others.<br>
<br>
From the pattern I saw when I looked at servers and totals in rps I would suggest this:<br>
<br>
The problems people are experiencing are based on population differences more than anything else.<br>
<br>
We need to push mythic hard to put in something to ballance population differences among the servers.  Until then you just can't judge rps as a measure of anything.<br>
<br>
I really think that's what makes people upset.  I feel completely gimped, but I play on a server where alb is dominant.  They have both str relics and have had them for 3 or so months.  It's really frustrating for everyone in my realm.  A lot are fleeing to Mordred which will either make it better or worse (depending on who in alb is bored and goes too).<br>
<br>
Having said that I feel that the sb template in terms of playability is slightly gimped.   Right now imo the best spec is a five spec and if you gimp 34 left axe then the five spec is gimped.  The inf does not face this problem at all.  They either need to give sbs the points to spec left axe higher or make the 34 and 39 styles pretty powerful.  I don't mean overwhelming but powerful.<br>
<br>

Note: I think this is worth looking at I am going to repost a part of this message on a separate topic. so if u want to talk about the problem of population differences please post there<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

REALM POINTS MEAN NOTHING.<br>

If you have 6 hours of free time to RVR each night your going to have more realm points than the guy that has 1.5 hours.<br>

How can you HONESTLY base balance issues on numbers of realm points?<br>

Don't give me any spin, answer the question.  I read your bs mathmatical drivel, it was complete and unadulterated SPIN.<br>

But if your class is totally jacked/gimped then your rp`s will never get consistently high. so I believe one the whole the assassin classes are doing well-only compared to the other classes. this in no way says that between the 3 of us we are equal. Just that our class type as a whole is fairly viable. there are issues that need to be addressed for sb`s and ns`s. personally I will admit that I am very happy with the way the infil is shaping up for the end game of daoc. I wouldn`t mind if sb`s gotsome LA love and I do feel that ns``s could use a hand in their stat -or lack of stat dept. But I do feel as of late we have been screaming for eveything to be handed to us and we should be careful what we ask for.<br>

<br>
While it is true that more time played= more RPs I do not think time played skews the statistics.  This is because I do not think there is any correlation between time played and preferred classes.  If people who play for hours at a time always chose the same 2 or 3 classes, then it would.  Let's presume that 20% of the players are power gamers spending more than 4 hours per day playing the game, do you honestly believe that they make different race/class choices than the rest of us?<br>
<br>
If anything, more time played= better able to judge if a class is fun.  I know many people who choose not to play assassins or some other class because they think it is too much trouble or it is boring.  If NS, SB, and Inf. classes are represented relatively evenly (within a given tolerance) then it implies that they are equally fun to play.<br>
<br>
RPs are a good measure of popularity because it implies that the player has at least raised the character to 20 and the top players are undoubtably 50.  The last 4 weeks is a good measure of current balance because it allows patches to normallize within the community.  Archers will continue to have the highest RPs for a while due to their long dominance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ushadowerbdc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowerBDC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 7:35:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3672.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top 25's for the last 7 days: SB 19, Inf 18, NS 16</span><hr size=1> Amending my initial totals since Nimue is available now.<br>

All I did was post numbers for the last 7 days.  I indicated that I thought that the Assassin classes were roughly balanced, and far better balanced than they'd ever been before.<br>
<br>
Somehow, in your febrile imagination, you turned this into a call for nerfs.  Where you got that from I don't know.<br>
<br>
Let me go on the record loud and clear:  I don't think any Assassin class is in need of nerfs at this point.  Nothing that I've posted at ANY point since I've been coming to the Safehouse has advocated nerfing ANY Assassin class.<br>
<br>
So, I think it's YOU who are calling for nerfs at this point, based on your previous posts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubaym.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baym</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 10:05:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3672.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top 25's for the last 7 days: SB 19, Inf 18, NS 16</span><hr size=1> Really, please post where I said nerf infiltrators.

Get over the Doublefrost nerf.  It's done.  They're not going to change it back, no matter how hard you plead.<br>

<br>
I'll give you a perfect example of this using a bit less data:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/realms/Tristan/shadowblade.php">www.camelotherald.com/rea...wblade.php</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
shows us the top 25 shadowblades on tristan.  You may notice that i currently have the 10th spot.  I have been in this spot for a few months and the only time ive RvRed in that time is to kill the albs and hibs that drop by upplands and gank ppl that are trying to exp. (since im playing an alt)<br>
<br>
Now if you want more acurate numbers you would have to record the RP gained by each class everyday and chart it out.<br>
<br>
So im sure  can happen in the top 25 on all servers.  One person might have a hell lot of RP and hold the spot for months even though they arnt gaining any more RP.<br>
<br>
---Added later---<br>
Now if you want to get some more realistic numbers take the top 25 for each class add there RP and devide by 25 to get an average.  In theory the class with the higher avereages should have the easyest time in RvR.  And compairing the numbers for say shadowblades and shamans you can clearly see that shamans have a disadvantage. now shadowblades to hunters you can tell that hunters have a clear advantage.<br>
<br>
But as we all know data is worthless unless you can do somethign with it. <p>----------<BR>

Just because you don't understand mathematics or statistics doesn't make it drivel or spin.<br>
<br>
RPs do NOT represent ONLY time played in RVR.  That would only be true if our skills were equal and we were playing exactly balanced classes.  The problem with the raw RP stats is that they don't mean anything unless you compare them to something like time played.<br>
<br>
I'll use a simple example.  If I play a Nightshade and you play an Infiltrator for an equal amount of time (say 500 hours) and all other things are equal (e.g. our skills, the speed of our connections, our PC power, etc.) and you get double the RPs I do then the difference can only be that the classes are unbalanced and the Infiltrator is more powerful.<br>
<br>
It's the comparison between the time played and the RPs earned that's important, not the raw numbers.<br>
<br>
Please don't use big words (like mathematical) that you don't even know how to spell and clearly don't understand. <p>Sanlail Swiftpaw

Am I confused about how to read this?<br>
<br>
The last 7 days will reflect current trends in character choices.  Most players with level 50 characters have lots of alts, and they tend to play them when their primary is not fun.<br>
<br>
One real way that these results are skewed is due to consider the number of targets each class has and factor that into the equasion.  Further, I tend to group when I am getting RPs so I get RPs when I'm not getting a kill... which skews the results.<br>
<br>
I think a key reason that Infultrators are doing well because they are running in packs, I rarely see them solo, so if they find me solo... I die.  Heck, a group of 4-5 invisible Infs will kill just about anything.  This goes back to numbers though and not to class balance.  To get an accurate assessment, you would need to examine how many total Infultrators on the server durring the past 7 days vs. number in the top 25.<br>
<br>
Part of the reason that the number for SBs is down is because of the nerf... a lot of them quit playing SBs on principle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3672.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3672.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3672.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3672.topic&index=20><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3672.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3672.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3672.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3672.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
