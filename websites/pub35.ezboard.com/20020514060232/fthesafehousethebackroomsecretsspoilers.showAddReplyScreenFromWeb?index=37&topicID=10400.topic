Seems fair to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
chanter is to melee, as mage is to caster. That would make casters better, and mages wanted.<br>
<br>
Also you think trak isn't trivial with Velious loots? Dain/tormax with ssra loots? Next expansion loots will make ssra mobs easier too i am betting on. Melee have always gotten tools to help with the next uber, while casters had their same spells they used on trak for that Vulak encounter. Heck, take all the wizards/mages/necros out of the game, and nothing becomes any harder except VERY high AC luclin mobs.<br>

Frankly, I was stunned at what Verant did there, showing clearly that they had some trouble grasping the mechanics of thier own game.  But, I'll put that aside for the moment.  I am certainly in favor of focus items for casters entering the economy, I simply think they ought not to be done in the manner that they are here.  Hell, make em buffs or something even if you must but summoned items that are superior to everything dropped over the last three years?  Umm, enough of that now.<br>
<br>
So, I still don't much care for the anti-melee sentiment that I read lately.  It does remind me of caster-envy from back when but that's neither here nor there.<br>
<br>
Many say that a Rogue (or other melee character) does way too much damage in a raid.  In reality, a Rogue that has the support of a Tank, an Enchanter, buffers, a healer and preferably a Bard will; provided they have also kept up their equipment, skills and AA abilities, produce a great deal of damage in a situation where the target is not highly melee resistant, has an ass that can be stabbed and doesn't disable melee through AE, knockbacks, damage shield or other means.  (heehee, I refuse to fix that sentence...)  They don't do this all on their own, nor does anyone on a raid.  Rogues need rides everywhere, they need support in terms of healing, buffing and a solid tank who can hold aggro.  <br>
<br>
Despite what some here like to maintain, we also don't solo worth a frickin' damn and rely on groups to even get to the point where we become effective.  Yes we may get into groups (that have a tank, a healer and CC already) more easily than a Wizard or Mage.  I won't debate that.  Still, do keep in mind that this is our only option for experience gain.  I have spent many a night /lfg for hours only to log out and not play at all.<br>
<br>
Other melee characters have their own issues.  Ask that Warrior next time just how he got to OS before he went /lfg.  It isn't always as simple a life as you see on the raids.  What about the fellow who isn't one of the Main Tanks of the guild, he often feels a little put out.  The Monk who doesn't get on the pull team much likely feels the same.  <br>
<br>
Pah, enough already, I'm not here to make converts.  I guess what I'm getting at is that to simply say that class A does too much damage is missleading in two ways.  First off, a character in a raid is supported by everyone on that raid and the damage that 'that one character' is doing should rightly be attributed to every porter, CoH Mage, healer, buffer, tank, strategist, organizer, puller and scout on that raid.  Secondly, when a class is pared down to damage and little else, it is not too much to expect that they *should* do a good bit of damage in most situations.  <br>
<br>
Yes, casters need balancing in a number of areas.  I'm all for finger-wigglers being able to contribute more damage (or more damage directly as opposed to indirectly as they often do now) to both experience groups and raids.  Still, I don't think this focus item plan was a good way to go about it.<br>

It's not that they are &quot;that good&quot; it's that caster haste is vital.  If your only option for haste at 60 was a FBSS, trust me, you would think it was gold.<br>

<br>
Aside from that - if a melee can buy a Sword o'MightyWhupAss with 10% Haste from a vendor for 9pp, if a melee can buy a Ring o'BrutalHits with +10% damage increase from a vendor for 9pp, etc.  - then we can talk again, huh?<br>

<br>
Absor had this to write:<br>
&quot;We certainly considered leaving the focus items on the Test Server for a couple of weeks to try to work out all the little details of item balance and presentation before rolling them out to live servers. But we decided to go ahead and include them in the recent patch so we could get a broad range of feedback, show casters that we recognize some of the issues bothering them in game, and because we were pretty excited about focus items and expected players would be too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Which translates to:<br>
&quot;We know that the items were not properly tested for balance and effect, which is for example why the Chokers allowed chanters to summon up free platinum bars, but we really needed to throw this stuff untested out to the players to have something to show for on our third anniversary.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwalkabout.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 6:15:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &gt;It's funny that so many people still don't know that 10% haste does *not* mean that a melee is really swinging 10% faster, while a 10% casting haste is exactly that.

<br>
Actually, I think you're wrong. With say a 15/25 RB your're swinging 40% more, but the delay isn't reduced by 40%. New delay is 17,86, (and not 15), which makes you swing 40% more frequently and doing 40% more damage.<br>
<br>
What casters have been given is a reduction in delay. If we e.g. use the mage spell Shock of Fiery Blades as example, which has a cast time of 6.8 seconds (or 68 delay if you want), and with a 20% focus item a casting time of 5,44. If described as a 'swing increase' a 20% focus item has 25% haste. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubedrenkenpigsticker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bedrenken Pigsticker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://bedrenken.homestead.com/files/pics/halfman.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 8:25:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Its sort of funny, enchanters also have this thing called clarity for casters.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uremeliogemweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remelio Gemweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 9:15:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=47>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Actually, unless it was ONLY with platinum bars, the choker did not work on the enchant metal line of spells before..

<br>
So, let's see if I got this straight:<br>
<br>
A spell line which has been in the game since DAY ONE (haste) makes it so that casters can't be balanced unless focus items are summonable by mages.<br>
<br>
I gotta have some insight into THAT logic.<br>
<br>
I need to know how casters are &quot;underpowered since Kunark&quot; when they can, without a single swing of a sword kill up to 30ish dark blue mobs at once, RAKING in the exp.   You guys have ditched melee in favor of AOE, taking the chanters with you, raking up the exp and aa points while melee end up fighting single mobs in Fungus grove as 'table scraps' (with no chanters around to cast that overpowered haste spell).  THEN you want to be the 'superstars' in raid situations too.<br>
<br>
I suppose those complaining about haste buffs never ask for KEI, PotG, those &quot;underpowered wizards&quot; don't use mana-free nukes, epic healing/manarobe combos, I suppose all the modrods I see laying on the ground are really decorations, now you need SUMMONNED items that replace uber mob loot.  <br>
<br>
There is one melee item in this game that can compare to focus items, something which adds a percentage to total damage all other factors being the same, and that's Primal weapons.   A melee with primal &gt; a melee with priceless.<br>
<br>
Thing is, you dont' see mages summonning primal weapons, you have to kill a MINIMUM of 12 first brood dragons to get one piece of primal.<br>
<br>
Hey I got an idea, screw it, put the focus items on ST loot tables on the named golems, then maybe we can convince them to go there too and leave their aoe groups or quad kiting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueiago.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eiago</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 10:30:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casters arent lazy</span><hr size=1> If the game did not have any haste, and mages suddenly could summon a fbss, would you bag your uber non haste belt for it?<br>

Because otherwise there is no concept of risk vs reward.<br>

Because summoned items are too 'easy'.<br>
<br>
This game has become an outlet for folks with large inferiority complexes. Segregating themselves into the elite and the 'casual players' (code speak for 'losers') gives them a sense of accomplishment and superiority that they don't find in other pursuits. Anything that threatens their sense of challenge will supposedly ruin the game.<br>
<br>
Focus items are meant to be a class balancing tool, not an uber reward for the lucky few. When melee were rebalanced a while back with across the board improvements did casters scream bloody murder for nerfs? Were those improvements 'too easy'? Now VI takes little baby steps towards caster balance and your precious 'endgame' is somehow tottering on the edge of ruin? I'm just heartbroken.<br>
<br>
Balance is for the 90% of the player populace that just wants to spend a couple hours a night enjoying themselves in a single group dungeon crawl or what have you. When only 2 of 7 caster classes even need apply, thats when you know things are unbalanced.<br>

we keep bringing it up because melees like you consistently forget that melees too get FREE DAMAGE UPGRADES EVERY TIME THEY HAIL AN ENCHANTER FOR SoS.<br>

mages give out 10-15% items.<br>
20-30% items WITH STATS will drop, making mage items look crappy.<br>

I am SO heartbroken mrylokar daggers don't drop off orc pawns. Beating a tough mob gives a sense of accomplishment indeed. <br>
<br>
Denelor&gt;Focus items are meant to be a class balancing tool, not an uber reward <br>

<br>
Is that so ? In case you missed it the summoned items are all/all, I fail to see any *class* balance rectified by all/all gear. You should also go read the statement absor made today, where (some) dropped items will be retro changed. I am taking a wild guess and I don't think the orc pawn drops will be of the same quality as say the vulak class drops /snicker. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unenelar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nenelar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 1:01:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casters arent lazy</span><hr size=1> Actually, EQCaster does seem to be missing something...I'll send you an email Vaslin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udenelor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Denelor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 1:03:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casters arent lazy</span><hr size=1> Walkabout, I have no problem with high level mobs dropping nice items. If you feel special because of your pixels, well jolly good for you. The problem I have is with the sentiment expressed by some that *only* people that kill high level mobs deserve something that I thought was supposed to be a class balancing tool. <br>
<br>
If VI has other ideas for caster balance, and focus items aren't it, so be it. I'm big enough to admit when I'm wrong, but the patch message where they were first introduced was worded so that it seemed like this was part of the caster balancing process. The only thing I'm up in arms about is the idea that caster balance should only apply to a select few, when melee balance was an across the board thing.<br>
<br>
re: focus items being all/all, well duh. I have no problem with a rogue wearing a focus item if he/she wants! What was your point again?<br>

<br>
The only reason the ring was nerfed was due to the 8.5 sec CH. (and due to really fast casting spells like scars of sigil).<br>
<br>
They stated that higher level focus items would start dropping in the game. This is just like winning a haste belt or primal weapon. Casters are long overdue for a revamp. Focus items are an excellent way to do it.<br>
<br>
They also stated that they are tryign to be able to flag certain spells as &quot;non-hastable&quot; such as CH. This is just the beginning folks, and every new thing they put into the game will eventually be tuned. (remember the Mistwalker?)<br>
<br>
Relax, and enjoy the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers>The Back Alley</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
