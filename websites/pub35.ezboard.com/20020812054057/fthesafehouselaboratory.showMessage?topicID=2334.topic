It is here: http://pub175.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessage?topicID=2045.topic<br><br>However, that plan calls for you to have tons of cash. I recently submitted a plan for skilling up to Eqtraders which requires as little cash as possible. I thought I would post it here as well. Comments and observations are very much welcomed!<br><br>****************<br><br>Before you begin, work on your pottery skill until it is up into the low 100s. It doesn’t cost too much and the money you will spend will save you tons in vials. Besides, you have 20 levels to work on it. I am sure there are guides to getting your pottery skill up there. Once you can, make all your own vials. Saves you tons of money. Also, get some CHA gear as well to reduce the cost of suspensions and to maximize your re-sale value.<br><br>20-24         You start with Make Poison (MP) at 20, so go right for Asp Poison (Contact I). The Asp Poison Sacs for this can be found on various snakes throughout the world. I hunted for mine in EC and NRo and Oasis. I also checked all the merchants in the EC, NRo, Freeport area. As you are hunting for snakes, kill all zombies and mummies that you can. Save all the embalming dust and zombie skins. Also, I killed all cats for puma skins. I was doing this at level 20 and getting experience every now and then, which was nice. This will take you all the way to MP of 24. WOO!<br><br>25-56        Head up to Lavastorm (north of Neriak newbie zone forest, which I can never remember the name of). Here you can kill Drakelings, easily, for their Putrid Bile as well as Basilisks for Basilisk Eyestalks. The Basilisks were giving me experience at this time. The ingredients don’t fall like rain, but you can get a good amount of them with relative ease. Start by making Basilisk Poison (Muscle Lock I) with the Eyestalks. This will take you up to MP of 34. Then switch to Putrid Bane (Injected I) with the Bile until you are MP of 56. Optional: kill the Imps and try to get Ashroot. I found this difficult and the mobs didn’t drop it too often, but you could do this now as well.<br><br>57-77        Back to Nro and Oasis of Marr. Continue slaughtering zombies and mummies. They will drop embalming dust and zombie skins. Again, check the merchants. Most players will simply sell this stuff off. I once found 2.5 stacks of embalming dust on a merchant. You could try to auction for it as well. Regardless, start making Lyxt Wing Dust (Liq Silver I). This will take you up to MP of 77.<br><br>78-108        At this point, if you have some Ashroot, you can make Festering Nettle (Low Resist I) up to MP of somewhere in the 90s I believe. However, easier way I think, is to head to Beholder’s Eye and start slaughtering Muddites. Again, in your low 20s you can get xp here, and the ingredients come fairly regularly. I think they are stackable too, can’t remember right now. Anyway, get as much Muddite Mud as you can and then grab some plat (yup) and head to WK to see Toxfodder (-3000, -13400). Now get comfy. Begin by buying Alocasia Root and making Atrophic Sap (Weaken II) until you are at MP of 98. Then start buying Coyotetail and, with the Muddite Mud, make Eyeburn Solution (Blind II) until MP of 108. If you run out of Mud, you can also buy Lactera and make Aching Blood (Contact II) up to 108. Keep in mind to sell back everything you make to not only keep room in your inventory, but minimize the costs involved. I went from my 60s to 98 with only spending about 120pp.<br><br>109-130/140   Now, if you’re rich, run to Halas and buy Gelsemium Root and make Brain Freeze (System Shock II) and Gelsemium Petals and make Powdered Balanity (Feeble Mind II) up until MP of 140. If you’re poor, like I was at this point, go to Unrest and get Grave Mold and Darkbone Marrow (and more zombie skins) and make Leprous Puss [awesome name!] (Flesh Rot II) up until MP of ~130. Then head to Halas.<br><br>130/140-160   In Everfrost, start slaughtering orcs. They will drop Lixt Wing Stalks which you can use to make Languid Lixtwing (Dizzy II) up to MP of ~160s. fyi: You can also get other ingredients here for lesser poisons.<br><br>160-180        So now you’re at ~160. Again, one of two ways to continue. Either run back to Lavastorm, slaughter goblins for their Soot Hemlock and use that to make Dilapidating Ash (Low Resist II) up to MP ~180. Or, again if you are rich, run to OT and slaughter Succulents for their Succulent Sap. Then run to LoIO and buy Crystal Nightshade and make Zek Frost (Berserker Mad II) until you are ~180.<br><br>180-204        Head up to Field of Bones in Kunark and lay waste to the scorpions. Easy killing. Collect Heartstring Venom Sacs and make Stiffening Ergot (Paralyze III) until you are MP of 204.<br><br>205+             I am told that skill ups in this range are few and far between and as such, many rogues simply use their practice points to get up to 250. This can be done at a trainer in High Keep named Stanos. But it will definitely cost you. Many other rogues continue to make poisons. If you go to Fironia Vie, you can buy Creeper Ivy and make Spirit of Sloth (Muscle Lock IV). This has a trivial of over 250.<br><br>And there you go. Like I said, I have not run this entire course yet, so if anything is off, please let me know. Also, some things to keep in mind along the way:<br><br>1. Make your own vials whenever you can to reduce cost.<br><br>2. DO NOT apply the poison you make unless you want to use it in the field (more on that below). Instead, crank your CHA over 126 and sell the poison back to the vendor to further reduce cost. The re-sale on poisons is really not too bad.<br><br>3. It is debated as to whether DEX is the primary stat for skilling up (I think it is like smithing, either INT or WIS or DEX, whichever is higher). All I can say is that I had both DEX and INT cranked up and I got good skill ups.<br><br>4. Feel free to use practice points along the way to supplement this plan, that’s what I started out doing. However, I would encourage you to save them for the last 50 points, which is what I am doing now.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>*****************************<br>And now my guide to raising your Apply Poison skill to 250:<br><br>1. Get a whole bunch of Snake, Spider and Asp venom.<br>2. Apply to weapon.<br>3. Repeat until 250.<br><br>Happy poisoning!<br><br>Thanks: Kiki’s Poisonous pages and The Safehouse poison FAQ.<br> <p><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif"><br><b>Restyn</b><br>Rogue of Saryrn Server<br><font color=008800><i><b>Half elf ... all rogue</b></i></font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/urestyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Restyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/9/02 10:28:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ujayrodjunteau.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jayrod junteau</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 5:55:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2334.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to Making Poison 0-250</span><hr size=1> great and easy way to max dex... group w/ an enchanter and have them cast boon on you... while your invis... of course buy your items before doing this.<br><br>I do this trick to get dex to 255 w/o dex gear and can get int up w/ int gear.  <p>"Doubt my style?

EQTraders has Basalisk Poison listed as trivial at 84! I seem to remember it going trivial much lower than that for me. Plus, I would trust the stats from this site, since it is all rogue.<br><br>Anyway, if you're making Basilisk Poison and it is trivial, but Putrid Bane is not, then don't worry about the Basilisk Poison. Shift and just work on Putrid Bane and maybe even Lixt Wing Dust (which uses Embalming Dust).<br><br>As for why you are failing, it could just be a run of bad luck.

( I was going to say pottery and fletching as well, but I can't say those weren't because of skill ups because I'm simply not maxed on them). But I am maxed for my level in poison making and when I had the better dex gear on as opposed to off (176 Dex compared to 207).  With Dex gear on = avg'd 5 more sucesses on SoS per 20 attempts. Gear off = 5 less. (+/-1) <br><br>I'm at max skill for my level, so not sure how you can account for the greater successes with Dex gear vs without, when I am looking at my own hard facts. You could call it a fluke, but at this point I've made hundreds of poisons while maxed and the numbers come out in the same ballfield.<br><br>Also why recommend people buy 200- 250? They can MAKE money on SoS with charisma gear. Say it ain't so? If you make your own sealed vials and purchase your Ethereal Susp, Creeper ivy with 125 charisma taking into account all raw costs, you will make 6pp minimum per potion sold back. <br><br>I made 3700 plat going from skill 200-225. All it cost was my time to make sealed vials and the potions. <br><br>Spend your money how you like, but there is no reason to simply recommend buying them because you don't know a better way or do not have experience getting there yourself.<br><br>Not that it matters, but I'm no n00b to tradeskills. Just do what works for you. But in my mind, you are better off buying 170-200 when the points are a bit cheaper and the potions don't sell back for shite, then buying 200-250 when the points cost more and you can actually make money making the poisons and selling them back. <br><br>One last comment...you do shabby research and ask for our comments after you submit it to eqtraders?<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>     However, that plan calls for you to have tons of cash.

What is the motivation? Are you looking for attention or do you really want to help?<br><br>The reason why I ask this question, is you made the statement on eqtraders when you posted this here, that you wrote the guide because you could not find &quot;one guide&quot; out there on poison making. That made me ponder your intentions for a minute. <br><br>Because if you are writing this in order to aid other rogues, you should be concerned about giving out misleading or inaccurate information. For one, your strategy for people 200+ is to simply &quot;buy&quot; those points because &quot;that's what most rogues do&quot; and &quot;making the poisons will cost you that much anyway&quot;. Yes, I have a problem with that and you should too. It's simply wrong. You should feel a bit sheepish in general about giving out information you have no personal experience with and stating it as what &quot;most people do&quot;, when your skill level is 120. I know from personal experience that I can make money from levels 200-225. <br><br>I'd be more than happy to support and even commend you on a guide you create for skill levels you have experience with or even a guide where the information was well researched for the 200-250 range, but your guide simply is not. When you are at a skill level of 120 and writing a guide to 250, with statements that are false, that is where I have a problem.<br> <br>Your rationale for this guide, rather than directing people to an already very well written one by Furina, was to save money. Your guide, in final analysis is more costly. <br><br>I'm sorry if you feel this belittles you, that is not my intent. Your freedom to post ideas and strategies are not at all what I am objecting to. It's when you write a guide and also promote that guide on a board (eqtraders) as a primary resource, then yes I want it to be a well written guide coming from someone who either researched thoroughly, or has done the actual work getting there.<br><br>I'll end it with, just addressing this comment:<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If someone has a differing opinion, like you appear to have, then by all means voice it.

Then remarkably, my dwindling finances did a reversal.  I no longer lost cash... in fact I began to make about 20-30pp per stack of 20 vials I went thru.  Admittedly, this is no money making exploit, but it did mean that with good CHA gear, from 210 to 225 skill I MADE MONEY instead of losing it.  And most importantly, I didn't have to spend hours farming greens for reagents.<br><br>By the time I reached 225 skill, I put about 800 pp back in the bank (yes my fellow droogies, do the math... it takes ALOT of poison making attempts to get from 210 to 225), so my net cost from 178 to 225 was only around 1200pp.  (Still debating if the CTS in my wrist is worth it :P )<br><br>When I hit 56, I am gonna hit up one of my guildie Chanters and Shamans to buff the ever-loving snot out of my stats before I hit FV for the next 5 skill points.

No harm in having both Int/DEX buffed for PM'g. 220-225 went pretty fast for me with just 6 stacks of Vials (Dex 207/ Int 10<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Also, unless there is something new with mobs near the vendor seeing hide/sneak -  You can sneak/hide to buy Creeper Ivy in FV - I've done this as a DE with no FV faction. After hunting goblins for an earring for one day, I became dubious which made traveling easier.<br><br>Retsyn, the argument has always been you espousing what &quot;most&quot; rogues do. There is no right or wrong here other than making false claims you have no factual basis to back up. <br><br>If I were to claim (based on the many Grandmaster PM Rogues I've gotten advise from) that most rogue's make SoS and turn a profit, it would be false as well. I am responsible enough, not to make that claim. <br><br>Give advise, suggestions etc all you want, but I will call you on making claims as to what most rogues do and when you continue to call Furina's guide the &quot;if money were no object&quot; guide, I'm going to also ask you to back that up. <br><br>With that, I have said my piece on this matter. <br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uharlowerogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HarloweRogue</A> at: 7/9/02 10:51:26 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/urestyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Restyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 10:13:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2334.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.magelo.com/res/eq/itemicon/0307.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to Making Poison 0-250</span><hr size=1> I'm done discussing this Harlowe.<br><br>Take care and have fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udarkdirkdevertibrator.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkdirk Devertibrator</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 9:04:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2334.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to Making Poison 0-250</span><hr size=1> Harlowe, who cares?
