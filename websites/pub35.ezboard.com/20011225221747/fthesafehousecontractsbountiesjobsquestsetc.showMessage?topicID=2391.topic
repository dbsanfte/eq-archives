HE wouldnt say a darn thing... he just attacked any dark elf char under 15 he saw. Till a high elf talked to him in Elven saying somethign to the effect &quot; waht are you doing here&quot; (thank @#%$ i traded ogre for elven once) and he replied &quot;Look out for these vile creatures the Teir'Dal&quot; and then he said &quot; I will protect you (enter name here of HIE)&quot; I then tried to talk to him in elvish and said &quot;I am no dark elf&quot; he replied to me &quot;You are a mere puppet of the dark elves!&quot; and then started running around at super speed again. I tried casting some DD's and Dot's on him but didnt get a single reply msg and the NPC took NO dmg!!!! However the younger people there would attack him and do dmg and then die. Well tahts when i started getting angry! Killign all these poor newbs and not taking on someone his own size!!  I started in by saying &quot;Picking on the young ones hey~! you lil wimp! fight someone your own size!&quot; and he started RUNNING again! when he stopped i said &quot;Turn and fight me you coward!!&quot; I continued calling him a coward till he apparently got tired of my yells of him being a wuss and he double lifetapped me for 944 dmg each. When i died i didnt take any loss of exp though and quickly made my way back. He was suddenly gone. And apparently he started killin all the other people after i had pushed him over the edge LOL. HE left in a burst of flame and said &quot;I will come back with friends and we will destroy this forest&quot; or something to that effect. <br>
<br>
Waited about 3-4 hours for him to come back with mroe elves and he never did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I wanted his blood on my spear! <br>

GMs use some kind of &quot;special ability&quot; that makes them immune to attack from players of a certain level or higher.<br>
<br>
They do this to keep high-levels from ruining low-level dynamic quests. <p><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="http://www.succubus.de/perpic1.jpg" height=110 width=80></td><td nowrap>

<br>
I was in SK and there were like 3 dark elf NPCs with 3 small treants.<br>
<br>
Apparently, they had taken the treants as saplings and twisted them to evil.<br>
<br>
One of the treants broke free of his mind control and started attacking the dark elves.<br>
<br>
I couldn't attack anything cause I was too high a level.  Eventually a pack of lowbies got together and killed the dark elves.<br>
<br>
What was really cool though was the hour leading up to that point, where the npcs all hung out in a pack around the spiroc town and killed anything that wasn't a dark elf.<br>
<br>
I had lots of fun.  The little treants actually bowed to me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubodisattvawynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bodisattva Wynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/01 9:07:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GM EVENT!</span><hr size=1> I was in CB once and three Orcs spawnd and were obviously GM controled.

A Madman &amp; A Spectre.  I forgot the name of the spectre but the madman's was Deepclaw or close to that.  Typical GM &quot;kill all the newbies for no reason event&quot; thing. Wait, it gets worse...<br>
<br>
The Spectre was going around nuking for 200ish saying, &quot;Bake me like a spectre!&quot; &amp; &quot;Kite me to the docks!&quot;  It killed my friend once &amp; he got PO'ed.  He sent me a tell with what was happening &amp; got a 34th SK friend of his to get the madman down to low health before he warped somewhere across the Oasis.  He kept saying, &quot;THE BRITISH ARE COMING!!&quot; over &amp; over. He was playing his druid at the time &amp; he was boucing all over while he was tracking.<br>
<br>
After a while they completely disappeared from track.  I did a /feedback &amp; a /petition to ask them to come up with a better roleplaying event &amp; if their gonna do a slaughter newbie event then to at least make it in roleplaying sense.  To me this is just board guides/GMs getting back at the players cause' of the daily /petitions &amp; stuff.<br>

This was YEARS ago when Innoruuk actually came down from hate to Kithicor and amassed an army of undead there. They marched out of Kithicor through the commons, met up with some inkies from Neriak at east commons, then conquered freeport. From there they took the boat from freeport through the ocean of tears and were preparing to conquer Felwithe, Kaladim, and Kelethin. My friend had a Human necro who worshipped Innoruuk and the GM's took him as their herald to spread the word of hate. He was riding on the first boat with the armies and he got off the docks waving to the PC's who had no clue they were all about to die. It was a wonderfull event, up until my friend died when the dwarves and light elves routed the forces of hate, and Innoruuk retreated to hateplane.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just recently I got to meet the Queen of Neriak and the sage and herald of Innoruuk on the Zebuxoruk server as well. It was pretty cool. One of the rangers on the server was in DE mask form and harassing the GMs continually about Brell and stuff. Eventually he ate a GM deathtouch from Queen Alliandre Thex (or whatever her first name was) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2419.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2387.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2391.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2391.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2391.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2391.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
