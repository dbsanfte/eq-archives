To be truthful a lot of this post is just a summary of how I feel , and a method of me venting.<br>
I am not what you'd call Uber. I have played for nearly three years as a Human Monk and have watched the Monk class change steadily, often not for the better. While my equipment hasn't been great it isnt bad either,at level 59 I stand at an awesome  1080 AC and 2275 hp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have never had anything against other classes, I have even posted to the fact that I enjoy feigning at the feet of the warrior and watching the damage clock up as a  rogue engages. The fact that a lot of the time I don't fight in an exp group, but go looking for another mob to feed into the group mincer machine pretty much sums up my existence.<br>
<br>
This isn't intended as  a testimony to my Monk , I don't yet plan on packing him in, but its getting  a little close for comfort.<br>
<br>
Soloing is I think out. Its not that the damage taken has necessarily gone up a vast amount. Its that it is unpredictable. Against a con blue Velks spider I clocked 8 hits of which 4 were max hits and 1 was 3 hp lower than max. Now OK I could have been unlucky, but it near killed me . I have tried soloing several times now and its not so much impossible, but it is uneconomic. The chances of dieing are simply way to high. This is partially the fault of the random number generator maybe, but beyond a certain tolerance level that makes soloing impossible.<br>
<br>
I don't tend to get chance to raid pull an awful lot. However just pulling relatively soft mobs in UP proved difficult. Again if I can outrun them I can pull and split. However any mob on you stands  a good chance on max hitting and an extremely good chance on stuns. While I managed to avoid dieing this time it was a bit closer than I'd like , especially considering these were hardly high end mobs.<br>
<br>
Tonight I joined an Akheva group. Nothing special just pull and kill easy blues for the night. I died twice. I died easily and without much warning or anything I could do. Again the mobs tended to stun me , at which point it was game over.<br>
<br>
I have noticed a lot of posts tending to view Monks as whiners. I don't think that is valid. I have spent three years playing this game , and currently have  a  debt at the bank <br>
( ie to a friend ) of 200 pp. Monks tend to struggle to  make cash. I have spent virtually all my cash raised on upgrading my armour etc. I have in terms of weaponry an IFS. All told pretty typical for a level 59 without any twinking.<br>
<br>
My damage output is typically reasonable but nothing special. Warriors at my level can outdamage me, while  a Rogue outstrips me by a wide margin.<br>
<br>
Again its not that I envy either class. They both excel at what they do either tanking or damage output. <br>
<br>
The problem is for me that my gear , my stats , my resists, my weapons, the trade skills I have taken up, the zones I have researched, the maps I downloaded from EQ atlas........ are all geared towards pulling. Its no different to telling warriors they are now damage dealers while saying to rogues they tank. The role I used to have has gone. If I am supposed to deal damage why do I have mostly tanking discs ? Why did I put no points at startup into str ? In particular why is my weaponry sub par whereas my armour is better ?<br>
<br>
I feel genuinely to have lost my way. I am not being defeatist , I'd just about cope with re inventing myself as a  damage dealer. But if I am supposed to deal damage where are the common Monk heavy hitting weapons ? <br>
<br>
As far as I can see , this nerf wasn't aimed at me. I couldn't tank any high end mob for longer than Voidance lasts. I would normally expect on a raid to be helping pull but never really rejoining the raid, either due to aggro or damage already taken. <br>
<br>
Post nerf I don't have a role, a part of the Vision or at this precise moment any real reason to play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ajackhykick>ajack hykick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/26/02 1:06:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=593.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Yep ...
