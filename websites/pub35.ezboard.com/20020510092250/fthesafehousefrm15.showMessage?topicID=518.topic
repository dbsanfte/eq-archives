Its from a rogues perspective so I'm sure there are problems from the casters classes too that I'm not as aware of.<br><br>Charm poofing pets.  Currently any charm cast on a player pet will get the message that this npc can't be effected but when it wears off the pet poofs.  As a result of this the classes that depend on pets.  Mages and Necros lose them when fighting any class that can charm but especially bards since their charm lasts only seconds. <br><br>Solution-Its a bug figure it out and fix it.<br><br><br>Pet kiting.  This is where a pet class runs around in a circle with their pet on a melee who can't hit back because of the melee range bug.  This is extremely lame since the melee has no chance ot hit back.<br><br>Solution-Either fix the melee range bug so that melees can hit moving targets or give pets a large % penalty to all damage done to moving players.  The same one that exists for the melees.<br><br><br>/Pet Attack Name /Assist. This trick allows pet classes to target players from afar. Vs other casters it gives you the ability to always land the first blow even if your not smart enough to actually find and target the person. Vs melees it allows you to kill or hurt the melee without ever comming into view because you can simply target them and spam a spell till they walk into range which is more troublesome as it is very unfair to the melee.<br><br>Solution-add a new response if the person being targeted with /pet attack name is not close to the pet in question AND in sight.  The pet should say I cannot see him/her master.  In order for this not to ruin coh /invite name should be made a valid command so you can invite people from anywhere in the zone.<br><br><br>Casting through walls.  Again the melee is denied the chance to fight back.  This is not fair and is very poor design and not helped by the fact that the pet attack name assist trick exists.<br><br>Solution- Ever noticed you can't nuke an npc through a wall or ceiling? Thats because it uses code to prevent casting on npcs not in line of sight.  This same code could protect players without limiting the use of heals and buffs to los.<br><br><br>Hill bugs.  Sucks to have someone run up a hil and disapear then start nuking enough said I think.<br><br>Solution-Its a bug fix it!<br><br><br>Levitate.   2 things.  1) hovering over water and casting on people who can't hit you.  2) floating way the hell in the air where you can't be hit.<br><br>Solution- Either improve pumice or make it so you can't cast any offensive spells while levitated like scale of wolf<br><br><br>Shaman dmg shield potions.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with these being around except for the fact that they stack with druid and mage ds. This brings the druids potential dmg shield from 38 to a ridiculous 69 per hit.<br><br>Solution-Make the potions and druid/mage ds the same spell line so they wont stack.<br><br><br>Zone control.  Its very annoying to be attacked by an enemy who you killed only 5-10 minutes ago.  Even more so if your a melee and they are a caster bound in the zone.<br><br>Item loot.  Its a broken concept.  In no way does it award the better pvper.  In fact I think it tends to reward the people who use the most cheap strategies and wear the least gear to lose themselves.<br><br>Solution- remove item loot and make the penalty for death the inability to log on that char for a certain perdiod of time.  Starting with a short amount of time in the early lvls and a longer time later on.  This would be for me preferable to both exp loss and item loss.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urhainy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhainy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/31/01 6:00:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> I agree with you on most things but I don't think levi or shaman DS potions or anything like that are bugs, that's what golem wands are for. And as far as item loot, only one server has item loot and 3 don't, maybe you should move servers. Not being able to log on would frustate most people to no end. <br><br>And I'll add a bug to the list: <br><br>Charm bug. That bug where your sitting there minding your own buisness a lvl 50 in a lvl 10 zone sitting near a guard. When suddenly a large rat attacks and next thing you know the uber newbie guards are tearing you apart... and you eat a nice exp death to a lvl 14 druid.. When someone charms something and has it attack you, for some reason the guards join in even if you don't attack back. That's a horrible bug and needs to be fixed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=elegance>Elegance</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/1/01 10:20:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> what a fantasticly short list...lemme see if I can find a longer one.<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=215.topic">pub13.ezboard.com/fthesaf...=215.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=elegance>Elegance</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0> at: 11/1/01 10:25:36 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/1/01 3:03:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> #1 bug: melee range bug. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/2/01 12:40:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> I don't agree with removing zone pulling.<br><br>Simply put casters have many many ways of disingaging from combat without death and pure melees have none other than pulling the plug.<br><br>Divine Aura<br>Harm shield<br>Shadowstep<br>Yonder<br>Gate<br>Spirit of Cheetah<br><br>and the big one...<br><br>Running.

On teams servers the difference between forcing someone to leave the zone in defeat and killing them would be a lot smaller, the fact that rogues have a difficult time finishing off non poisoned oponents (or at least I do) would be less meaningful,  and death to a group of 4 wizards would be less meaningful but for those of us on rallos zek who wont go around fully bagged anticipating defeat ,it is.<br><br>It also occurs to me that perhaps i haven't explained this as well as I could have and perhaps you who read this see this as a defense of cowardice but until you have had to play in an environment where you have to fight again and again when a single defeat means the loss of something expensive and or hard to replace and at the same time watch countless casters shadowstep run or gate away even at very low hp I don't think you'll get it.<br><br>Do NOT nerf melee gate )). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwolandgrauensturm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woland Grauensturm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/2/01 4:59:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> <br>I find it ridiculous when melee players complain about PvP. At least on Vallon Zek, they dominate the high level gameplay. I was doing well pet kiting a level 60 paladin yesterday with my 56 necro pet that had MR buff (so it resisted or broke most roots), well, except that the pet took heavy damage from the coldain ring dmg shield, and that pally eventually turned to pet and smacked it with a few hits from his epic. Note - pally fled eventually, which isn't very common.<br><br><br><br>No, the big problem in PvP is the huge advantage that hybrids and melee's have towards casters and priests. Given how PvP works on the coin only servers, it is a joke that spell damage and pet damage is reduced to 66%, while melee damage, damage shields and archery, does 100% damage. <br><br>All sorts of damage should have the same reduction. That would be a huge improvement for PvP balance.<br><br><br>I do agree with some points on the list though, like bards poofing pets, and line of sight abusing.<br><br> <p><BR><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://hem.passagen.se/stigard/eqpics/Zarloth_tagline.jpg" width="420" height="150"></p><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/2/01 10:14:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> The lvl 60 game isn't the entire game.  Nerfing all melee dmg down to 2/3 at all lvls would be horrible for the melees and hybrids.  As far as pvp being dominated completely by hybrids and melees in the high lvl game I just don't see it.  Maybe because I'm 54 and it really changes at high 50s and 60, maybe because melees can't wear as much droppable armor all the time on rallos, but I just don't see it.<br><br>The only unbalancing factor in melees favor at lower lvls is the gear available to twinks and you clearly can't balance the game with twinks in mind without screwing over the people who aren't twinks.

You begin casting, he runs around the corner, &quot;You can not see your target from here&quot;. He runs back, hits you for a round or two, you begin casting, he runs around the corner.

Cleric has to wait till the warrior is back in his line of sight before attempting to cast another complete heal, if the warrior can live that long...<br><br>The gap between melee and casters is so huge it's not even funny. As a chanter I can't even dream of damaging an even con melee. A 55+ rogue can kill me in one double backstab and a couple hits. I can run around the corner and tash and dispell exploiting line of sight, but not like I'm gonna get one of my nukes to stick. Even if I did, you think I'm gonna kill a 55-60 melee with my leet 350-400ish nerfed dmg nuke?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uurshulgi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Urshulgi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/23/01 9:08:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hehehe</span><hr size=1> Levitating over water......try swimming under the water and their spell can't affect you, concept tks.<br><br>Pet kiting?

First off your post on the dmg shields was utterly inaccurate dmg shields are as it stands almost useless vs high dmg 2h weapons and very strong vs fast one handers even without shaman ds potions.  DS are quite strong and useful as they are even without the ds potions that thankfully most casters are too cheap too use atm.  As a rogue I MUST pumice casters with dmg shields or I WILL kill myself on the dmg shield allready.  That in itself says they are strong as they are.  Think about the average hit by a 1h weapon vs the dmg shield dmg taken and then take in consideration the amount of dmg required to kill a druid who can chloroblast themselves.  You may not have had enough experience to test this in your DUELS since you are on a NON PVP SERVER but its really not hard math.<br><br>-Highest druid dmg shield is 38 counting both the ac + ds + the pure ds which stack.  This Ds does 25 in pvp due to pvp reduction.<br><br>-Pretend the average hit of a given melee is 40 with a 1h weapon (this isn't unreasonable considering you can hit for one with your offhand and for 11 with mainhand even at 60 and this IS an average)<br><br>That means that for every 40 dmg the melee takes 25 dmg 63% of the dmg that he dishes out.<br><br>Now pretend the druid has 1600hp buffed.  Now suppose he uses chloroblast on himself 4 times at a cost of 700 manna. he will heal 1712 hp.  Meaning the melee has to dish out 3312hp and take 2086 dmg.<br><br>Effectively speaking in other words duel wielding melees allready have to pumice and dmg shields are allready strong and don't need to be doubled with a potion.  <br><br>Now you might at this point argue that dmg shields are too weak vs heavy hitting 2h weapons but Id agrue that you can't make them strong vs 2h weapons without making them too strong vs duel wielders.<br><br>You might then argue that if a good pvper has to pumice off dmg shields anyway what does it matter if they are stronger? Because you have to hit them for a while just to interupt casting while you work on getting dmg shields off and the dmg you take during that time period is signifigant allready without shaman potions.<br><br><br>LEVITATE<br><br>Perhaps someone didn't notice I suggested making lev like scale of wolf OR improving pumice.  I have no problem trying to get levitate off but without golem wands sometimes its almost a ridiculous thing trying to get lev off before they kill me or I have to run.  Also note levitate is a pretty low lvl spell in most cases making golem wands NOT an option at all lvls and not even an option in nearly all fights at high lvls.  I admit that making it like scale of wolf would probably be bad as you suggested but a faster casting pumice would solve this issue as well without taking away your ability.<br><br>I would like to note something here that may be of interest regarding the nature of pvp combat.  Most fights on rallos zek in my experience don't end in one parties death.  Most of the time I escape death even when losing and the same can be said of my oponents (except for those gimp naked casters).  What often follows is repeated engagements until one party dies (and even after that sometimes) or until someones friends show up.  This fact makes golem wands although sweet when you use them not a factor in most pvp fights.<br><br><br><br>Next &quot;hill bug-it affects casters to when some melee runs over a hill and we lose him because we can't see where he was going.&quot; Even more reason to fix it huh?<br><br>Next &quot;melee range bug-try turning off autoattack when you're out of range and then turning it back on when you catch up to someone, some people refer to this as jousting.&quot; /nod thats what happens when 2 people rush at eachother trying to hit eachother.  What happens when someone is trying to get away is you get a string of msgs telling you that you are too far away followed by a hit or 2 every once in a long while.<br><br>PET KITING<br><br>Lets define this better... <br><br>Strategy A - running around with the pet hitting you between their attemts to cast<br><br>Strategy B - not casting and instead running around in circles while the pet by itself wears down the melees hp knowing that the melee can't touch you and waiting for the melee to get low so you can finish him off.<br>  A is ok B is not.  B is in fact exceedingly lame.  Fixing the melee range bug so that the melee can hit the caster while hes moving in the same way the casters pet can hit the melee while the melee is moving would solve this. This would put the casters pet and the PC on equal footing and would force the caster to use strategy A something that all non gimps allready do imo.  If its not possible to fix the melee range bug then the same result could be obtained by giving pets reduced dmg output on melees who are a) moving and b) not snared.  Not as fair as just fixing the melee range bug I admit but it would put pc and pet on equal footing...<br><br>LINE OF SIGHT<br><br>&quot;Line of Sight-only abused by gimps. Blue servers would love it if you couldn't use line of sight for heals to. Would make ToV take twice as many people hehe.&quot;<br><br>Let me first make 3 points clear...<br><br>A) On RZ all pks abuse line of sight as well as many many many others.<br><br>B) Verant has the ability to choose on a spell by spell basis if a spell requires los.  You will easily note how all bolt spells for example require los no matter the target.  There is absolutely no reason in my opinion making all nuke spells los only would have ANY effect on heals.<br><br>C) 6.1 second nukes suck in pvp except as opening moves.  As a wizard spells that are used would be lures (4.5 seconds) and draughts (3 seconds) soon to be 4 and 2.7 seconds for those with the quick dd skill. I suggest you back up a few steps and start casting as he sticks his head around the corner.<br><br>One last counter argument.  You say your a wiz trying to kill a warrior in a dungeon.  Lets say instead your a warrior trying to kill a wiz in the open.  The situation is reversed is it not? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/23/01 1:20:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hehehe</span><hr size=1> Upon reconsidering the DS issue I decided that use of DS potions is a rare thing for the same reason that golem wands are rarely used.

Many other games manage to deal with calculating player positions MUCH better...<br><br>As far as people running out of range for that 6.0 nuke why do you even care the nuke never sticks to melees anyway /snicker.  Even if the dd did stick you would need to mez or stick str debuffs in order to hold the melee still or you would die anyway.  Honestly I don't think an enc wins any fight with a melee by playing wizard ANYWAY. I see an enc as a fantastic addition to a group pvp fight NOT a solo killer or  wanna be wizard personally.<br><br>On the nuking through walls thing.  Have you ever thought of following the melee around the corner? If your gonna say but but he'll hit me! I suggest you don't stop right after the corner and instead get some space between the 2 of you before nuking. I honestly see the idea of a melee running back and forth to get a few hits as utterly ridiculous.  As a caster I think I would just back up AS I SAID and nuke them as they come around to me in fact you might consider starting your cast when you hear them come running.<br><br> Casters run around corners to get away from melees all the time.  Then start nuking from out of sight.  In fact a typical strategy involves making the melee lose track of you then nuking through a wall.  What I'm asking for is to require both parties, caster and melee to have an awareness of their targets position in order to attack and to give both parties a way to respond to that attack.  In other words a level playing field.  You complain about the idea of melees using walls and branching coridors to get out of line of sight and avoid being nuked when casters use the same strategy as it is.  The only differnce is that melees can't attack you from around that corner or behind that wall if he manages to escape behind it.  I would expect both parties to be able to deal with not being able to hit the other until they come within just fine and the pvp experience to be more interesting for it.  In fact a good pvper allready knows he has a much better chance of a kill if he keeps his quary in sight.<br><br>Next as far as blatant exaggeration.  I think correct me if I'm wrong here but I'm under the impression that a 55 mage would have something like 1.2 or 1.4k hp (counting 250hp self buff and assuming pog or similar quality gear) and as to a 55 rogue having close to 3k hp don't make me laugh as a 55 rogue in good gear I have 1650hp in resist gear and only a bit higher in hp ac gear. Good gear being pog armor, dwarf quest armor, epic that sort of thing.  No tov stuff here. <br><br>Btw double 400s are pretty uncommon hell I almost never hit sitting people for more than a total of 600.  Not only that but backstabs can be avoided by not turning your back. In addition our dmg output is compensation for having low hp and ac so get over it. Btw FYI as far as doubles you have to figure that only like 1/2 of backstabs are doubles and often enough either the 1st or the 2nd misses (unless your sitting).  Double backstab is great but melee hits follow different rules than spells and you can't act like a rogue backstabs for double 400s every 7 seconds.  If we could our unbuffed dps would be 114 just from backstabs at 55!  In fact I think it goes something like...<br><br>20% no hits landed<br>60% 1 hit landed<br>20% 2 hits landed<br><br>And giving the max dmg as the average is so completely false its ridiculous.  Saying a rogue can double for 400 is nothing like saying a caster can nuke for 800.  A double 400 is actually more like getting a nice crit.<br><br><br>You present yourself as the disadvaged party and claim a need for cheap strategies in order to survive but I as someone who has been through a lot of pvp say this is BS.  As a rogue lvl 55 is actually feeling a lot more balanced to me but nothing like being overpowered.<br><br>It occurs to me that people who do badly at pvp are often those who don't start the fight.  The person who starts the fight no matter if its with a sitting double bs or a nice nuke and an attack from a pet has quite an advantage. Might wanna try it some time.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urhainy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhainy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/24/01 10:30:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> I PK solo more often than grouped and I never die to casters, the ONLY time I die vs even cons is when I get too close to a melee.

NOT if you dive into the water or run around the corner. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/26/01 7:43:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broken or poorly designed aspects and strategies in pvp</span><hr size=1> So you prefer it set up in such a way that only you can exploit it in other words?<br><br>Melees using it to escape is less important than casters exploiting it to get kills.<br><br>As I said before if he goes around a corner follow him.  If you lose track of him and can't find him to nuke well your basicly in the same position the melee is in if he loses track of you.  Whats unfair about that?<br><br>Interesting pvp is where both parties have to think about where and what their opponent is doing.  Not try to lose him so you can get some cheesy hits off from behind a wall. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uurshulgi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Urshulgi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/27/01 4:18:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> pointless to argue with you</span><hr size=1> I'm not going to post any more responses to your whines about how all casters are exploiters.<br><br>Yes I can often channel Scars of Sigil and do 200 dmg if I'm super lucky and his resists suck. <br>Do you know how much damage a rogue can do in that short period of time that he's in melee range? Doesn't backstab have close to a 120degree arc in which it works?  <br><br>Tell you what guy, how about a level 60 caster and a level 60 melee switch characters for a day and see which one is whining when they are done.  As a rogue you could just camp the bank in thurgadin all day and rack up massive kills on those poor bastards.  If you pvp as a legit caster and don't use los I guarantee you would no longer dismiss casters complaints about high level pvp.<br><br>At least you aren't alone in your opinions that melees should be gods in pvp, you have plenty of support from the jerry's kids that verant pays to develop their game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=518.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=518.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=518.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=518.topic&start=81&stop=81>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=518.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=518.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=518.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.threadControl?topicID=518.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=518.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=518.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
