With D&amp;D, all you really need are Players Handbook, DM's guide, some paper, some dice and some imagination.  Some people say that you would probably need the Monster Manual as well, but you could probably get away without them if you run some city campaigns and get the feel for the game before investing more <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zoogie>Zoogie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 3:03:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> I'd say the most important thing would just be the PHB and some dice . . . newbies don't really need the DM guide or the Monster Manual. <br>
<br>
An even more important thing, though, is finding some people you can actually play the game with. If there aren't any players in your area (or aren't any that meet your prefered RPing/Hack and Slash ratio) you can try www.webrpg.com (for Chat Room style games . . . It costs like three dollars a month, I think), www.pbem.com (for Play By EMail games . . . they're kinda slow, but they allow a lot more time to write some good RPing posts.) , or www.openrpg.com (not sure about this link, but openRPG is supposed to be what replaced WebRPG when it started charging cash. A bit more buggy but essentially the same.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukambic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 6:42:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kambic.homestead.com/files/gate.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> What kind of dice am I lookin for (like what number of faces/how many/etc.) or will that come with the book/be explained in the book?<br>

You can also get a d100 (hundred sided), but it's a lot cheaper to use 2d10 (two ten sided dice), taking one of the dice to be the &quot;tens&quot; column and one other to be the &quot;ones&quot; column. <br>
However, dice are cheap, so just buy a couple of each. Make sure they're different colors, so it's clear who has rolled what. It'll make the game go faster. <br>
The most important rule about dice is: Always know where they are. There're few things more aggravating than getting a bunch of people together to play a game and then find out that no one has any dice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Decide if you want to go pre-prepared adventure or Dungeon Master created adventure first.  If you want to get your feet wet quickly, definitely go pre-prepared.  The only drawback to this is that you may find it hard to truly clear you own mind of these store bought images when you want to create your own world within the same rule set.  You'll probably be more original if you make your own world first, then buy some adventures based on the same rule set and mold them into your world.  It just takes a long time to really create a campaign.<br>
<br>
If you're into role playing over combat rules, miniatures aren't really needed - you can all play the fights out in your head, if the DM has a good mental image of what he feels is going on.  If you like tactics, you HAVE to play with miniatures.  I only played sans miniatures when I was a kid and couldn't afford them.  I much prefer playing with the painted pewter things.  You will find you use extra dice for monsters, so LOTS of dice!<br>
<br>
Man - this is bringing back memories ...<br>

Forgotten Realms is a Tolkien'ish world, and has an immense amount of material available. It's written from a DM's point of view.<br>
<br>
1. Get Player's Handbook, 1 d4, 3 d6, 2 d8, 2 d10, 1 d12, 3 d20. This will give you the absolute essentials for playing D&amp;D. Of course you can make do with 1 of each type of dice, but the numbers above are, in my mind, the minimum for running a smooth game.<br>
<br>
2. Dungeon Master's Guide, more dice, and I would recommend getting the Dungeon Master Screen package. DMG will allow you to get more of an understanding of the game, and is a great tool for inspiration and guidelines for the Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master Screen will allow you to keep your notes, maps, dice throws, etc hidden from the players, and it also has most of the useful tables printed right on it, so you don't have to look up everything in the books all the time. Don't let the players read the Dungeon Master's Guide for now. It's no disaster if they do, but some things in there are better off kept as a secret. Besides, the more advanced rules in there might confuse them, and they may even start questioning your way of DM'ing.<br>
<br>
3. Monster's Manual. This will make it a lot easier for you to create adventures, and some pre-made adventures also require you to have this to look up the stats of the monsters. Most good pre-made adventures will include stats though. This should also be kept hidden from the players, for the most part. You can let them flip through it and look at a few pictures and things if they insist on doing so, but don't let them study the stats and behaviours of the monsters. That knowledge will make your campaigns a lot less interesting. There are few things as exciting for players and DMs than when the players have to scramble to find ways to hurt your seemingly invulnerable monster. It's no fun if they just go &quot;Oh, another Lycanthrope, pull out the silver swords and whack him&quot;<br>
<br>
4. Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. This is very nice if you are going to make your own adventures. It gives you maps, world history, deity information, hex grids and a number of useful things. I believe it also contains a small book with minor adventures. This is by no means necessary, but will make it easier to fit your adventures into the world of Forgotten Realms, and will bring more depth and consistency to them.<br>
<br>
5. Adventures, if you wish. However there are many great adventures to be found on the internet, including on WotC own website. When the players get more experienced though, I would recommend getting a few of the really classic adventures like Dragon Mountain.<br>
<br>
You can buy all these things used if you live in an area where RPG's are moderately popular, or at conventions. I HIGHLY recommend getting 3rd edition (Mostly labeled just Dungeons &amp; Dragons), and not Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Second Edition. I use the latter in my campaigns, but that is because I own a lot of material with that ruleset. 3rd edition is a lot easier to learn, a lot more intuitive (bless the d20 system), and all the new material WotC releases is for the new system.<br>

I have only played with miniatures a few times, and they are not really needed. If you and the players have a vivid imagination, and you are decent at drawing a rough sketch of the battlefield, that usually makes for more interesting battles. However, when 25 goblins storm your players, miniatures are a necessity. You may be able to keep track of the goblins with a lot of sketching and noting, but the players will not. Once the battles get larger than 12-14 persons/monsters (including PCs), miniatures are recommended.<br>

OH MY GOD<br>
<br>
Thank you so much bro!  I am in the same boat as Kambic, always wanting to learn but never doing it.  And around here, I have the damndest time trying to find people eager to play.<br>
<br>
I used to have AOL and the chat rooms there had PnP style gaming on occasion which I played and enjoyed.  Thank you so much for posting that webrpg link!  Finally a chat place that supports PnP like AOL used to(somewhat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

Couple of things holding me back though...<br>

Fricka, it all depends on the GM. It can be short sessions or long. I don't think when I was doing PnP that we ever played any chars that went above 9th level. With a decent GM you can easily manage just an hour or two at per session and still make good progress. Err, so long as you don't spend 2 hours buying a frigging horse like my usual group did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zoogie>Zoogie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 1:57:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> Coggins, no problem. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A whole lot of AD&amp;D 2nd Edition books typed up. Don't tell TSR or they'll bite your head off. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Fricka, AD&amp;D (and most PnP games, I presume) are extremely flexible. It all depends on what the players and the DM want to do . . . However, since long games usually are more interesting, they almost always get split up into &quot;sessions,&quot; which don't really have a set time . . . My RL group usually played one three hour session per week. Numerous sessions make up a &quot;campaign.&quot; <br>
<br>
It's not like EQ, though, where you sit around a camp and just kill monsters for hours. Games which don't have stories are almost always . . . really boring. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Learning the basic mechanics of the game (i.e., what you need to know to be a player) doesn't take very long . . . I made my very first character (Gnome Rogue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) about one hour after I got my (2nd Edition) PHB.<br>

Four to six hour sessions were the norm for my group when I was playing (junior high / high school).  It can indeed take a while to buy a horse, or to find a lantern, or any number of things.  It depends a lot on the people you are playing with.  There is only one DM, so its not like EQ where if someone wants to craft, you can hunt for a while.  If one person decides that tonight, he is by G. going to role-play a dickering horse buyer, then the whole group will wait for him to finish dickering, or for the DM to warn him of the &quot;dark stormclouds above, threatening a sudden, non-resable lightining stroke&quot;.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you have a group of folks who are in synch about what they want the game to be and are organized, two hours can work, IMO.  In general, expect it to be kind of like a guild raid - usually roughest in the beginning - works much better if you play with the same folks over and over.<br>
<br>
If I were going to play with strangers (many game shops have sign up sheets for pick up games) I'd expect to have to play a few sessions and/or with a few different groups before finding a bunch and a game that I was really enjoying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukambic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 5:00:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kambic.homestead.com/files/gate.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> Ok that little link what do I do with it, save all those txt and zip files or what?<br>

IF your completely and utterly new to Pen And Paper style and are thinking of playing DnD 3E I would highly recommend before purchacing the 3 Core rule books just simply purchace the Dungeon and Dragons Adventure Game.<br>
You can check it out here<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.playdnd.com/welcome.asp">www.playdnd.com/welcome.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Basically its the new D&amp;D 3E basic set has real basic rules premade characters about 14 mini scenerio's all the dice a whole bunch of cardboard Tokens(minitures) a dungeon map and on the back of it a 1inch grid map you can use for custom adventures.<br>
<br>
Basically I'd suggest you use this to feel out your friends intrests in playing first explain this is an overly simplified version of the game but will give ya's all a taste for what its like.<br>
<br>
As far as online play another option is Kloogle works.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://kloogeinc.com/werks/index.html">kloogeinc.com/werks/index.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Only disadvantage to this proggy is it doesn't have big community following yet and doesn't have the gamebrowser  feature of webrpg..but feature and style of it for me is the most appealing of the online table tops i've seen.<br>
<br>
I personally haven't played DnD since highschool and been itching to play again but I'm just a wee bit to nervous to jump into complete strangers champaigns..somepeople are a wee bit to outthere and kinda to serious with their play styles for my tastes(from reading all the champaign talks on DnD boards) I'm kinda right in the middle halfway between a roleplayer and a rollplayer. <br>
<br>
But i can say i sorely miss PnP style dnd with a fun group thats lighthearted but takes the game serious is just the catsAss.<br>
Well at the very least all these 3E books I've bought will prepair me for NWN's heh&lt;G&gt;<br>

<br>
Sounds good so far.. but you should get the Dungeon Master's Guide, too. Actually, it's even more important than the Screen in my eyes.<br>
<br>
About your question, 4 people (incl. GM) is a good size to start with. P&amp;P RPGs are best played with 3+1 to 5+1 (+1 being GM) people, although it is possible to play 1+1 or 6+1 or even more, too...<br>
<br>
The Dungeon Master's Guide has a LOT of information on how to &quot;be&quot; a GM, so getting it would certainly help. And it isn't that much of a problem if the GM never has played yet either, but he should try to get at least a basic grasp of the rules (or at least character creation) before he invites the rest of the group for the first game. Skimming over combat rules certainly doesn't hurt either. Of course, the best thing would be if he had a rough idea about the complete rules set, but it isn't necessary.<br>
<br>
A few good rules to keep in mind:<br>
<br>
1. The game is about fun. Fun &gt;&gt; rules<br>
2. The GM shouldn't play against the players, but with them<br>
3. It's more important to know where a rule can be found, not to know the rule<br>
4. See 1. <br>
