I would put on my woolen wrap and head into town. It was not that far from my home. I walk for about two miles and then I can start to smell smoked meats, fine rums, fresh baked goods, and even not so fresh baked goods that not so honest merchants try to pass off as “top quality”. It is a shame that people like that are still in business but I guess some people are just too stupid to know the difference between reality and the truth, fantasy and fact.<br>
<br>
 That was the problem around these parts. Everyone is searching for things that are not really there. The first thing that I see when I get to the market square is all of the different kinds running about…searching. Just… searching. Give me, “A potion for this, a spell for that”. “Make me beautiful, make me strong”. Make me into something that I am not, someone that I can never be on my own. The worst thing is that they beg for those desires, they steal and bribe and lower themselves to try and be something greater. Maybe people just have too much time on their hands lately. They do not see all of the work that has to be done. I on the other hand spend my time productively. Work is part of life. When you stop your work you become useless, then to me, you are worthless. Work, strength, and my independence are very important to me. I do not have to fuss over or worry about anyone. Depend on one person, yourself. Trust one person, yourself. Live for one person, yourself. Die for no one. That is what my father always said. That is a warrior’s way of life. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I always stick to the same routine when I come here. My treat is the first thing that I get. I buy a small cup of berry rum and small chunk of sweet bread. I never keep those kinds of things in my home. It is so important for a warrior to stay fit. Too many sweets can make you lazy and slow. That is why I savor every moment of eating my one treat this day. The cup is rough against my lips but the rum makes up for that. It’s smooth texture rolls down my throat and fills my belly with a warm gush of strength, and the occasional giggle. I taste my sweet bread in small nibbles so it lasts longer. It is truly a lovely way to start my day. <br>
<br>
There is a long bench for customers that want to sit down and eat their meals. I walk over there, but as usual; the bench is too crowded for me. So I walk over to a stubby cobble wall and prop my self up for a moment while I enjoy my weekly treat. I do not talk with anyone. I just listen to the nearby conversations. Yes, I just listen to all of the silly news and gossip that is floating about the town. Most would think me to be very boring. Maybe they are right but I get enough enjoyment resting in the shade, feeling the breeze against my face, watching little wee ones pass by. That makes me content. Of course I always have to do one more thing before I get up. I stretch my tiptoes down to the dusty ground to see if this week they touch or not. My toes never do touch but I do it anyway.<br>
<br>
Topper is the one and only merchant that I sell to. Her prices are honest and fare. So every seventh day I bring her four bear pelts, four wolf pelts, various animal teeth and bones, and other small treasures that I work for. I usually end up leaving with three gold and some copper. Half of my money goes to buying water, fruits, and vegetables. The other half I walk home with in my pocket to save. I always keep my hand tightly around my left over coins. There are dirty rouges in just about every corner you turn into. And they sure as hell are not getting anything that I earned.<br>
<br>
Now I can never get out of the market square without bumping into Marvin. He is three feet of stubborn, pushy, over confident mass. That is all he is, a mass of useless skin and weak bones. He owns a popular business in town passed down to him from his parents, given to him. He is the only merchant that sells silk. His silks can be any color under the sun. He makes silk dresses and cloaks, bags, sashes, anything one would desire. Sure he creates things that are soft and rather beautiful I will admit but they are completely useless. I mean, you cannot work in silk or fight in it. It won’t stand up to rain or dirt. You certainly can’t run through a forest or climb rocky hills. All he produces are more reasons for women to prance around and say, “ Everyone look at me, I am dainty, innocent and so weak and helpless. Please take me home so I can please you, cook for you and tend to your every waking need so that I can feel needed and pretty. Buy me jewels and lavish things to wear so I can make other women jealous of me by bragging about all of the riches I receive from exploiting my body and flaunting my bosoms!” Yuck! Sometimes I am ashamed to call myself a woman.<br>
<br>
Trying to walk swiftly is very hard. It is so crowded I can’t even see more than two people ahead. Keeping my head down in hopes that Marvin might not see me I push through a group of a few High elf wizards. Of course standing near them he spotted me. How can you not spot a two and a half foot Halfling dressed in dirty silver armor in between tall blond haired blue-eyed slender elves draped in flowing gowns and jewels. Yep, you just can’t miss me. “Hey Dralilli! It’s me Marvin, over here!” I did not understand how he thought I could not see him, hopping up and down frantically waving his arms through the air. I always went along with it though. I walk right past him and pretend I do not hear anything. I always hope that he will get the message. Yet there he is, right by my side running along to catch up with me still shouting my name. So as usual I stop and greet him with “ May I help you?” Not in a nice manner mind you. I try to look and sound as rude as possible. But no mater how mean or ugly I get he is just Marvin and he does not understand. “Dralilli, greatest news this week! Just the other day I was just playing around with some left over dies and some left over berries I was snacking on.”<br>
“ I am surprised there was any left over to the looks of those plump cheeks, I muttered low.”<br>
“ What was that? Well anyway, I was playing around mixing them together and I came up with this lovely new shade. It is a soft violet color, almost gray. So it is very feminine, yet natural, stylish, yet strong. I know how you like to look strong.”<br>
“ Marvin, listen I do not like to only look strong, I like to make sure everyone knows that I am strong!”<br>
“Well sure Dralilli, I like to look strong myself, but you’re a fine lady. You should let your hair down sometimes, wear something that isn’t always hard between your legs.” My face reddened with embarrassment.<br>
“ Why you perverted, rude little shi…”<br>
“Hey calm down, I was talking about you always wearing armor. Dralilli, I don’t want you to be upset with me. How’s about you let me make you up a picnic or something. I could make you a pair of silk gloves or a ribbon for your hair.”<br>
I just watched him babble on and on, he was trying so hard to be nice to me, but I just could not accept his invitations and gifts. There was just no more room in my heart. Even if their was, I would not know how to let him or anyone else in. I had to stop him from going on and on, it only made me frustrated and even more distant. “ Marvin, a few hours ago I finished skinning and gutting a bear in 85 degree weather. Then after that I plucked whiskers from a mangy rat and scaled a piranha. So I am guessing I have small pieces of fur and mangy little diseases stuck to the dried guts on my hands. And because it was windy I probably have fish scales scattered through my hair. You know for a fashionable, stylish look.” Hoping that would discust him enough I gave him a tight frown.<br>
“ I love it when short women talk dirty, Marvin snickered.”<br>
“ Ughhhhh! Leave me the hell alone!” I quickly ran off. He can make me so angry! I do not know what it is. He is so perverted and childish. He thinks that if he says something sweet I will come running to him like a trained dog! Well I will do no such thing. But I think the thing that upsets me the most is that I am mean to him and I say gross and stupid things, yet his spirit does not break. Marvin is always happy to see me after every rejection and insult. I don’t understand why he can’t accept the fact that I am a warrior. We are different. Yes that is it I told myself over and over again. Trying to sooth this unknown pain. We are different, too different. I said it until I felt tears in my eyes.<br>
The walk home seamed longer than usual. A strange wind blew through the air. It dried the tears from my eyes but did not heal the ache in my heart. I entered the forest where my hut stood at the end of the hill. Just to add more coal to the raging fire within me I saw something that never made me upset before. There was a group of people my age hunting. A wizard was there, her cloak rippling in the breeze, long yellow hair swaying with the same melody as the treetops. Bright flashes of colors sparked from her hands and enveloped her group of friends with strength and courageous spirit. I could tell the handsome wood elf next to her was a druid. He too was giving the gift of his powers to his friends. An array of colors, encouragement and laughter erupted into the sky. All of those different people working together. Gnomes, elves, Halfling, it was absurd… it was wonderful. It was what I always wanted. Too many days I traveled through these woods alone. All alone! I never once talked to anyone. I guess I carry two shields when I leave my hut in the morning. One to protect myself against wounds and diseases, the other to protect myself from a world I know nothing about. <br>
<br>
I finally reached the front door to my hut. I did not open it.  I just stood there blankly and stared at the cracked wood. I did not want to go in.  I knew as soon as I entered I would fall back into the same routine.  I would sleep and wake up to another day of knowing everything that would happen.  What was I doing? Twenty-three years of being alive on Norrath and I have never left the place where I was born.  I have never conversed with someone any longer than a few minutes. Never stared into the penetrating almond eyes of a wood elf.  Never touched the rich, exotic skin of an Erudite.  Never felt the surge of exhilaration from a casters touch, or anyone’s touch.  Never lived life.<br>
<br>
I faded out of my thoughts and drifted back into reality.  I fumbled for my key, unlocked the warped, creaky door and slung in open.  I dropped by bags down in front of my bed and looked around my home.  So much work to be done.  Maybe I really don’t have time for friends, for fun.  I probably wouldn’t like being bothered by people all of the time.  I don’t even think I could get along with any women.  We would have nothing in common.  Right, nothing in common.  Who would want to be my friend anyway?  I started to put away my things from the market.  Just organizing my kitchen space like I do every seventh day.  Then, though the rustle and clanking of jars and goods I heard a hard scratch against my hut.  It was a deep, ripping sound.  Almost like…Oh my @#%$! I quickly ran to fetch my shield and sword. “ My helmet, wear the hell did I put my helmet!” The ripping became deeper, penetrating, crushing against my home. “ I can fight without a helmet, no @#%$ damn bear is too tough for me!” I ran to the door ready to swing it open and charge.  But before I could, the large famished beast punched through the door with his sharp-clawed paw.  This was closer than I have ever come to a living bear.  I could smell his sour, rottened breath.  I felt drips of saliva rain on my bare face; his deep cry deafened my ears.  I charged forward screaming “ Rrrahhh!” My heart was kicking wildly against my chest, my veins swelled.  Sweating, stabbing, screaming, raging against this unwelcome beast! I swung my sword every way I could think of.  Slicing, piercing, plunging! I felt as though I too had become the beast, out of control, untamed.  Blood splashed into my face trapping my eyes. I did not care I closed my eyes and just kept on fighting, wishing, pleading to every @#%$ above to let me come out of this alive.  I wanted to fall over, I felt weak and hopeless.  My legs quivered and folded to the ground. And just as I fell, so did the beast.  He dropped with one last cry. I think it was a cry of forgiveness.<br>
<br>
  I lay there, saddened.  Was this what a warrior’s life is supposed to be like.  Death and pain? For some reason I felt defeated.  There was blood everywhere.  I did not know whether or not it was my blood or the beasts.  I saw my wounds, leaking, but I did not care, my body numb.  I just lay there, in a pool of the very essence of life.  <br>
<br>
I do not know how much time had passed.  Just as I could start to feel my pain, I realized I could not move.  Then I heard a tap against the side of my house.  I could not move my head to see who was there, but I did not have to. I knew.  I felt him there.  “ Dralilli, oh my @#%$, what happened? Oh let me help you up. Oh dear you are hurt badly. Oh dear, how, when, oh sweet Dralilli.” He came over to me and surprisingly scooped me up in his arms and took me over to my bed.  He looked at me in such a way that no one ever had.  He had some sort of love in his eyes.  He looked at my cuts and the blood on my limp body just shaking his head sadly.  I lay there silently just letting him clean my wounds and sooth me.  “ You know Dralilli you are so lucky to be alive.” As he spoke he sounded like he was going to cry.  <br>
“ How did you get here, why did you…”<br>
“Shhh my sweet Dralilli, just rest, just rest.  I followed you here.  I thought you would be angry with me coming here, so I waited at the edge of the hill for a while.  I was just thinking about what I would say to you.  I was afraid you would turn me away. He smiled at me and stroked the top of my head, running his fingers through my hair.  So I see you finally let your hair down.”<br>
“ It fell out when I was fighting, I whispered”<br>
Marvin put his fingers to my lips.” Shhh you stubborn little warrior.” Hours passed and Marvin just kept cleaning my wounds.  All I did was stare at him and enjoy every minute of it.  “You know Dralilli, I came here in hopes of you accepting a gift I made for you.  I really think you will like it.  Wait right here, he he.” He pulled out something from his leather bag.  “Actually I brought you two gifts.  Since you can’t open the package I will do the honors. I hope you like them.  I put a lot of thought into trying to figure out what you would like.” He untied a bow around the package and placed it in my hand.  Then he revealed his gifts.  “ Now the first thing I made you is a blanket.  The weather is so hot now, so you can use this at night and stay cool.  The second thing I made you I think you will love. This is a pillow I made you, in the shape of a heart of course.  I figured they wouldn’t go to waste because you can use them every day.  So you can pamper yourself in silk and it won’t interfere with your lifestyle.  And if you did not notice this was the new color that I made special for you.  See, it is a soft violet color, almost gray.  It’s very feminine, yet natural.  It’s stylish, yet strong.  I know how you like to be strong.”  I smiled when he said that again.  I now saw the beauty in his words.  “ And of course it is a heart.  It is just like yours.  Soft, beautiful, and of course so very strong.” He gave me the biggest smile that I have ever seen on anyone’s face.  It warmed my body. <br>
<br>
The sun was going down and Marvin said he would stay the night just incase I needed him.  He slipped my new pillow under my head and my blanket over my body.  The silk felt wonderful.  I rubbed my face in the pillow over and over again.  I felt beautiful when I did.  I thought of all that I had missed out on in my life and I realized that now I was going to take it all back.  Starting with Marvin.  The funny thing is I thought I did not know how to let anyone in.  But I did not have to, it just happened. So I did not question this gift that I received that day.  I just embraced it and never let go.  From that day on I only carried one shield and let the magical powers of love protect my heart.           <br>
