max piercer damage = 15<br>
epic = 15/25<br>
vulak = 15/19<br>
<br>
that doesn't leave too many dmg/delay combos left for a middle of the road weapon now does it?<br>
<br>
The Rhag might not be the most uber mob, but it does take a guild sized raid to beat it.<br>

So I vote for, quit your bitchin.<br>

Make this weapon 14/21 or something and it'll be used in mainhand over ragebringer still no doubt, and hell people said 13/20 outdamaged 15/25 under most circumstances so I don't got a doubt in my mind any non-backstab damage freaks would use a 14/21 in main. 15/22 though off of rhag1, quite absurd, they obviously stepped over the line, off of rhag2.. maybe, he requires at least a little more effort.

<br>
think about it like this. When kunark came out, imagin if a BP that was same stats as mrylokars BP cept 2 less AC, and only healed 85 HP per cast dropped off of efreeti? <br>
<br>
Whats the point of making all these hardcore encounters if you can get almost same reward by just taking 1 group into another place and raping up?<br>
<br>
I might be biased becuase I use the tunare dagger now, but that is not even near the point =\.<br>
<br>
there is no suck thing as risk vs. reward, becuase there is no risk in EQ. but there is a such thing as sacrifice vs. reward. <br>
<br>
clearing tunare pharking boring... sacrificed alot of time doing it, and sacriced alot of time to earn the dkp to win it. I don't want to see some level 57 rogues running around with stuff almost as good as mine. I am a jealous jealous man.<br>

All I am seeing here is resentment and jealousy from the non 'uber' guild members towards the 'uber' guilds.<br>
<br>
First off not all of the high raid oriented guilds have 'walked' over the smaller guilds.  Maybe that is the case with your server but not all.  Sometimes you have to fight for what you want.<br>
<br>
Yes, a guild who can clear NToV and PoG has put in a lot of time and effort and usually skill in accomplishing those goals.  And because of that they get rewarded.  When someone else is rewarded with nearly the same for a lot less work, it cheapens the reward they received for putting in more work.  It means less now.  You feel slighted.<br>
<br>
Imagine all you rogues who have worked and quested for your epic.  Yeah its not hard but you stil lput work into it right?  Now imagine if tomarrow they add a 15/26 dagger with 20 str 10 stam dex agi and a 30 percent haste effect that begins to drop off the kobold king in sol b.  wouldnt you be upset?  All of a sudden the work you put into acquiring your epic means almost jack since now people who havent worked as hard for it have something almost identical.  You would be upset to. <br>
<br>
Personally i like working for what i get and being rewarded accordingly.  Getting stuff handed to me for almost no work is not my idea of rewarding.  It means nothing.  I didnt earn it.  Its not something i can be proud of having.<br>

   its kinda like driving cross country and stopping for a soda and yelling at the people buying gas for $1.05 a gallon because you paid $1.45  2 hours ago in a different state<br>
<br>
 VI did say that more  rogue weapons were in the works post epic.. this isnt the best, but it is post epic.<br>

yelling at the people?  I think most of the peopel upset arent yelling at the other peopel but at verant.<br>
<br>
And diff prices in diff parts of the country for the same thing is due to inflation, diff laws on wages, local average income, and greed.  Which i would hope wasnt taken into consideration when we are playing a game.  Bad analogy.<br>
<br>
The uber guild people were pointing fingers at verant.  The non uber guild people pointed fingers at the uber guild people.  Now the uber guild peopel are pointing fingers back.  Simple as that.<br>
<br>
You need to stop acting like children.  And thats both sides.<br>

<br>
same thing happened with veeshan's peak (even with drop buffs) when velious came out.  this is the same trend that has always followed with expansions.  better dps weapons and better ac/stat filled armor (tougher mobs too).<br>
<br>
how can you uber &quot;experienced&quot;, (lol, yeah right) &quot;raiding&quot; rogues that are bitching not see this?  the high end stuff in luclin isn't even in game yet.  you will see better weapons/armor than these in all likelihood as they finish this expansion.  please don't continue the bitching.<br>

And Grimjaw's analogy is a good one. You needed the weapon then and you couldn't get anything better, so you payed more than you would have had to later, but that still doesn't change the fact that you wanted it right then. No one was forcing you to go kill the uber mobs and get that dagger. All I'm seeing from the uber people in this post is people who quantified themselves as better than the normal person because of time spent in a video game. You feel slighted because now people who didn't spend so much time playing can get something similar? I'm sure you learned this a long time ago, but you still don't seem to understand, life isn't fair.<br>
<br>
Sure, you can try as hard as you want to make it fair, but someone's always going to get screwed. And what makes your time spent raiding any better than my time spent helping friends get not-so-uber loot to make themselves better and cement friendships? Because your was absolutely boring and mine wasn't? Well, that was your choice, I'm not complaining that I can't get uber equip because I didn't spend my time like you did.<br>
