<br>
1. The only thing a rogue is good for in combat at high-levels is dealing insane damage. It's not our job not to deal damage and &quot;analyse&quot; the fight<br>
<br>
2. I was more hinting that if a rogue creates double the hate the tank of the group does, the reason is either<br>
<br>
a. the rogue is too high and too good equipped <br>
b. the tank is too low or too bad equipped.<br>
<br>
I would say that I am a pretty good rogue. <br>
But if I am grouped with a level 53 warrior that is using yak and CSS and has hardly any haste items or planes equipment, I won't expect him to be able to taunt the mob off from me (using RB, SCD and full Kunark armor). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uchemistrius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chemistrius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 8:35:20 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://216.83.6.2/00sm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> Well, looks like it's time to crack out the AC/HP gear again...<br>
<br>
Just some mumblings here:<br>
Evade was implimented because rogues were getting hosed before anyone in the group had a chance to catch up in &quot;hate value&quot;.  Essentially, our &quot;hate rate&quot; was higher than anyone else could get close to.  As it was, even being reset to nearly zero hate, a rogue could be back at the top of the hate list in only a matter of a few combat rounds.  Yes it's true, why? Looking back at our &quot;hate rate&quot; we'll see that it increases at about 2x the rate of anyone else's.<br>
<br>
Lets look at Kendrick's &quot;arbitrary number exampple&quot; for a second.<br>
Rogue was at 10k<br>
Warrior was at 5k<br>
Monk was 2.5k <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  (which seems a little low for me but we'll go with it)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
now for convieniance of numbers we'll break that into 10 &quot;rounds of combat&quot; (assumption is that Kendrick's example reflected ONE evade cycle)<br>
Rate at which hate is gained (hate/round):<br>
Rogue 1000<br>
Warrior 500<br>
Monk 250<br>
<br>
So in our little example, Mr Rogue evades and gets set to 3750 (assuming the evade was sucessful...Mr Rogue was tanking so there was a good chance it wasn't <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Warrior 5000<br>
Rogue 3750<br>
Monk 2500<br>
<br>
now lets advance three (yep 3) combat rounds into the future just to see where everyone is at...<br>
<br>
Rogue 6750<br>
Warrior 6500<br>
monk 3250<br>
<br>
Oh Crap! Mr Rogue is in hot water again! What will he do, I know He'll evade...No wait, he's got 7 more combat rounds before evade cycles.  Crap, pull out the res stick cus Mr Rogue=OWNED.<br>
<br>
Now, lets see if we can suggest a way to fix this while still giving rogues a working evade and VI the change that they're after.<br>
<br>
I think the main idea is to make rogues responsible for their damage and still keep them off the top of the hate list.  Having the hate reset to between #2 &amp; #3 on the list was a valiant attempt but still falls short within a second or two of combat (rather terminally I might add).  One could suggest that you could reset to average between #3 and #4 or even #4 and #5 (on large raids there's actually not much difference in hate values in the top 10 anyway) Oh wait I think I just stumbled on something there too...This change absolutely hoses rogues on multiple group encounters.  Wow, that was shortsighted.  <br>
<br>
Anyhoo...<br>
<br>
The heart of the problem is the &quot;hate increase rate&quot;.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  IF</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a rogue can sucessfully regain #1 on the hate list significantly before evade cycles, we're dead (cripes and that's assuming no failure).<br>
<br>
Resetting to nearly 0 hate is wrong, I can accept that.  Resetting to between fixed positions on a hate list is wrong too.  How to appropriately handle this is really a tricky problem (it's early here and I still haven't had my second cup of coffee).  I'll have to get back on a possible solution. <p><CENTER><TABLE cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%><TR><TD colspan=2><HR></TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD align=right><FONT Size=5><B><u>Chemistrius Ul'Veldrin   </u></B></FONT><BR><FONT size=-1>55<sup>th</Sup> Season Dark Elf Blackguard<BR>Requiem of Souls</FONT></TD><TD><FONT size=-1>It will be a hard life.<BR>One without remorse, without reward, without regret.<BR>A path will be placed before you, the choice is yours alone.<BR>Do what you think you cannot do.<BR>It will be a hard life, but you will find out who you are.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan=2><HR></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uchemistrius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chemistrius</A> at: 2/7/01 8:45:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 8:39:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The heart of the problem is the &quot;hate increase rate&quot;.

1) Thrown weapon damage should be considered non-melee.  Right now it's possible to throw a throwing boulder at a mob at range 200 and get hit by a damage shield, while someone at range 70 shooting the same mob with an arrow doesn't get hit.  That doesn't make sense to me.<br>
<br>
2) Minimum range should be reduced on throwing weapons; there are enough thrown weapons out there where the difference between min and max range is so small it's nigh on impossible to judge. <p><HR align="CENTER" width="50%"><BR><img  src="http://www.top-hat.demon.co.uk/Images/tibissig42.jpg" usemap="#tibissignew8f631b" border="0" alt="Tibis Heartseeker"><map name="tibissignew8f631b"><area href="http://www.fdsoftware.com/eq" coords="142,154,298,174" shape="rect" alt="The Reapers of Fate"><area href="http://www.wolverineinternet.com/ring/wardens.php3?orderby=server" coords="142,134,298,154" shape="rect" alt="The Safehouse Ring"></map></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umildaene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mildaene</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.multimania.com/mildaene/whiterose2.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 8:41:57 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.multimania.com/mildaene/rose.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> How about the easy way to change evade:<br>

Tadaaa! Fixed :)<br>
on a successful evade, the rogue is now anywhere between the 2nd and last position on hate list (adjust hate level accordingly), as opposed to the current always last or the proposed nearly always first. No fixed hate factor, no % crap, pure roguish randomness ;)<br>

<br>
---<br>
I do want to report one thing that we have already discovered internally about rogues that is broken and will be fixed when we make these changes. Yes, it is a nerf, but not in the true sense of the word.<br>
<br>
In the old days, NPCs had a limited size to their hate-list (basically the way that they track who they are angry at). In those days, evade would just drop you to the bottom of that list. Recently we increased the size of that list dramatically. This allows us to do a lot more with NPCs. But evade was never changed to reflect this, so it still drops you to the bottom of the hate-list. Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity. Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Now if the change is to move the rogue to the 2nd spot, does that mean that mobs bedore SoV have a max hatelist of 2 people?<br>
<br>
I am not here arguing if Evade should be nerfed, but only moving from 1st to 2nd on a succesful evade IS a nerf, and very much in the true sence of the word. <p>Ishwar - level 36 Barbarian Rogue</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukivi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kivi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 8:48:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> Too often in this discussion people assume that evade will work every time it recycles. Well, it can fail five times in a row if you're unlucky and four is not that uncommon. Couple that with the fact that if you have a little lag or if you are in a constant hail of attacks you will get pushed back and "interrupted".<br>
<br>
Not only does ranger Jolt have a higher chance of success (even if it doesn't make you go down in list as much (and the rangers only use it when they are starting to get hit)), they also have channeling which will grant them to land Jolt even under assault.<br>

Basically Evade is being changed for 2 reasons <br>
<br>
One is because of the way the hatelist was changed and the default value of hate we are given is 120 on a successful evade where as just being in agro range is 128 so this creates a problem where after pounding on a mob we're lower on hatelist then a passerby.<br>
<br>
Two is the one Verant isn't really saying in to many words but seems really to be part of it ...Damage accountability,and realing us in a bit. Making us more accountable for the damage we do.<br>
Basically right now we are teatering on the edge of doing to much damage on the edge of being to powerful in melee damage..how do you fix that? <br>
You either nerf the damage output or you make the character more accountable for the damage being delivered.So that if we continue as we were at full out offensiveness we get pounded on more if we backoff a bit and stop attacking inbetween evades to offset this change we as a by product lower our damage output.<br>
<br>
This really seems to be the Why it is being looked at changing in the way that it is.IT makes us like wizards or Necro's ..yes we have the ability to do increadable damage but if we do so recklessly we will be a manasink for heals.<br>
If we holdback some we will do less damage but retain the same control of agro we had before with more accountability for that damage like everyone else has to already.<br>
<br>
Now for the obvious fix that no ones pointed out.(that i've noticed)<br>
The hatelist had 6 spots on it now it has 60 evade was made when there was only 6 and it lowered us to 6th spot and that value was 120hate.<br>
Now with 60 that has the potential of moving us 59 spots down the hatelist..to much.<br>
So why not*drumroll plz* just up the default value that evade lowers us to a set value that will put us above all those that aren't in active combat with said mob?<br>
<br>
Wouldnt' that fix all the publicly stated reasons for this fix?<br>
It wouldn't address what i believe is the Second reason for this fix but then they would just have to come out and say it.<br>
For example Lets say They changed it to 300 if no one else is attacking were still at the top..same as now really(in my experiance)..if the tank is taunting and attacking it will drop us below him..if others in group are attackign or debuffing it will drop us below them but not as far.But in a large raid situation will never drop us below the range of people that haven't agressivly added to their hate of the mob.<br>
It will reduce the amount we lowerourselves on the hatelist substantially in a raid situation but still lower us far enuff back on the 6man group situation that we are not instantly back where we started.<br>
<br>
Another quick little brainstorm idea how to change is this(i should get paid for this hehe)<br>
Why not have it that the bottom value is 130(above passerby's) and the top value is a variable what ever the highest member of the hatelist is now..and make evade ROLL! a random percentage value between the two...ie a good roll your drop to 130..a bad roll you end up in between 2nd and 3rd max...average roll you end up somewhere in the middle..<br>
<br>
Food for thought..i do agree the way it has been suggested so far will not work worth beans all it will do is put the rogues in a situation where they were before having to hold back more then they attack.and that will change them from a desired class in a group to a non desired..we've been their I don't want to go back.<br>

Just incase you guys are wondering<br>
<br>
this is what Verant will do, or is doing..<br>
<br>
<br>
First they suggest a nerf ..<br>
<br>
a really bad one usually.<br>
<br>
Then when people complain, they go are like &quot;Oh ok, we'll look into it more&quot;<br>
<br>
Then they come back with something that is the most completely stupid thing you've ever seen, and probably the worst nerf ever to whatever it is..<br>
<br>
Then everyone complains more..<br>
<br>
So then they go back to what they were orginally going to do and everyone starts yapping about 'Thank you for not nerfing are skill!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
when in reality, they are getting there way ..<br>
<br>
So look for Kendrick to post something like that today. <p>Level 50th Dorf Rogue of Cazic Thule, "for 20 levels all I smelt was goblin ass"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upatofnaud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>patofnaud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 9:23:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> Not being in a long winded mood today,<br>
<br>
1. Dropping us to bottom of a list of 120 was WRONG. Ok fine, I agree with that. Making us number 2 is WRONG unless our DODGE/RIPOSTE skills get greatly enhanced. <br>
<br>
I don't mind being top of the list for a short period of time IF I had a chance in hell of getting a sucessfull evade off. Even today, I can NOT get an evade off if 3 things are hitting me. I either can not &quot;hide while moving&quot; (getting slammed does that), or can't hide while stunned, or FAILED to evade and have to wait on recycle.<br>
<br>
Percent of total hate list is more &quot;fair&quot;.<br>
<br>
2. Greying out Backstab during and ID cycle is good. Except for one thing no one mentioned. Then only way to easily abort a &quot;oops&quot; ID today, IS to hit BS. <br>
<br>
Sounds like this will go away and if you &quot;oops&quot; an ID during battle, you will have to back way out of the fight and wait for the kick to happen. Hitting escape to deselect the target wont work because as soon as you are hit you will auto target. Now you have to move out of range or target self and wait...<br>

Im a 50+ paladin, monk, and mage. I havent had a rogue over 30 yet. I have, however, been listening to this thread and an idea poped into my head (whether my thoughts are correct/already posted earlier im not sure). When a rogue evades hell go down 1-2 spots on hate list. With 5-6 rogues you worried that all will be the top 5-6 on hate list. The way I see large raid (least the way we do them) is 10+ tanks will be taunting (becoming instanly #1 on hate list bumping the 5 rogues down). This will be pumping tanks constantly to the top of the hate list. This should keep rogues being consantly pushed down and up like a ladder.

I know this is obvious, but in regards to rising back to the top of the list under the new Evade equation before the Evade timer resets...one easy way to do this is not to BS until the Evade timer has or is about to recycle. I know that with insane haste and such this would really reduce the amount of dmg we can do, but it might be a way to avoid dying.  <br>
<br>
  Looks like until they iron out this Evade issue after it's gone live, rogues are going to have to deal with the fact that doing the most damage we can will mean death. It effectively reduces the damage that can be done by a rogue safely, especially in high level encounters. THing that gets me is that this means that monks could then be THE dmg dealers, as well as being able to FD their way off the hatelist. In most groups I have been in the monk was outdamaging the warrior. I can't speak for the 50+ area, as I am only 40. I know this approaches class-envy land, but if balance is VI's goal, this is a serious issue to consider. I realize that monks can have much lower AC than a rogue, but if the idea is being responsible for your damage, shouldn't that idea be applied to all classes? Maybe I don't understand the dynamics behind FD. Please correct me if I am wrong.<br>

here.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2054.topic">pub13.ezboard.com/fthesaf...2054.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
heres the quote:<br>
_____________________________________________________<br>
Let me clear this up before speculation gets out of hand.<br>
<br>
Evade as it works now, when successful, reduces your 'hate points' to 120 instantly. A person that just entered into agro range of a mob has 128 points of hate.<br>
<br>
With the old hate list only holding six people, and rolling the lowest off, a high damage rogue had a good chance of promoting himself right back up the hate list in a hurry, requiring multiple evades during a fight. <br>
<br>
Combined with the roughly 30% chance that a rogue would fail to evade, along with timing issues (not moving, not getting hit, etc), and shorter encounter times, Evade was somewhat self balancing.<br>
<br>
With the changes made prior to shipping Velious, the hate list now holds sixty players, so ONE successful evade by a rogue in a large scale encounter was usually enough to keep him from ever being directly attacked. Like I said, a player just walking into awareness range of a mob had more hate than a rogue did right after evading.<br>
<br>
Just to give you some examples of hate generation, any buff/heal cast on a party member in combat generates about 400 hate, a Ykesha proc generates roughly double that, Snares and debuff effects even more, and melee hits can range from 50-500 points per hit. <br>
<br>
This is what is out of whack, the rogue is potentially not responsible for ANY damage or effects he deals out, barring bad timing preventing him from evading. It is not uncommon for a rogue, if he does not Evade, to generate 10, 20, even 50k of hate in an encounter, yet Evade negates ALL of it.<br>
_________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Thats where i got the numbers from..so as to my first point of 300.well thats arbatrary..make it 600 if needed shrug my point was that its obvious since change to hatelist that the problem stated on VI board is we drop to low.<br>
Second reason kendrik points to is the accountability factor.<br>
Reiterating the percent roll idea having it randomly lower a percentage between where you are now and a min determined value of say 130..and never higher on a successful evade of between 2nd and 3rd spot would work..i still think the easiest change is just upping the default number unless the real reason is to make us more accountable.<br>
<br>
And yes MinionX i have noticed the same type of thing suggest a major and let the gamers find the solution that would be where they wanted to be in the firstplace...i still think its a bit paranoid but certainly possible heh&lt;G&gt;<br>

We are all different levels and we all have different agendas.  The evade skill cannot be tailored to accommodate every purpose a rogue will encounter.  Or can it?  For example, I don't xp anymore.  I don't think I have been in an xp group since July of 2000.  My views are very raid oriented as a result.  Another rogue... say in the level 30 to 40 range, is VERY xp group oriented, and most likely has little familiarity with large scale raids.  While we both play the same class, the environment is completely different, and game mechanics which are not present for one, are present for the other.  For rogues at level 60, if you fail to evade or somehow lower your aggro vs. a level 65 mob, you die.  At level 35, if you fail to evade vs. the level 30 mobs you are xping on, you just end up using a lot of the cleric's mana.  The importance of evade is directly proportional to your level.<br>
<br>
That is why I agree a randomness needs to be incorporated into evade.  Like people have mentioned, taking off a fixed % of your total aggro might be too powerful especially near the end of a fight (although I beg to differ with how fast I end up aggro again after a successful evade).  Keeping us #2 or #3 on the list (which moves us up to #1 a second later) is the opposite extreme.  The random placement method provides a chance for the rogue to die the next round because they only dropped down a few slots, or to keep hammering away with backstabs and constant autoattack because they are near the bottom of the list.  Either way, the rogue will NOT know where they are on the list, which can be a good thing.  1st it makes life a little more interesting... requiring us to stay on our toes and watch for that aggro which could be right around the corner.  2nd it provides variability to rogue damage.  Currently, a rogue's level of aggro determines how much damage he/she can do in combat.  If a mob is attacking me, I'm obviously not backstabbing, and almost 100% of the time I have autoattack off until I am dead, or I evade/lower aggro.  Some battles we will need to back off because the random numbers for evade just aren't high enough.  Other battles we might do the same damage we do now.  But every battle would be an adventure...<br>
