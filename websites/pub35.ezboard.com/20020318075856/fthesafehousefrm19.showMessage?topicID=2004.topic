I mean, I know what a 'caster' is and what a 'tank' is, but for indentification specifics like what races they tend to be and what armor/weapons they tend to use, and combat specifics like what their distinct abilities are and how good they are at a particular function, I am slightly above clueless.  On the other hand, I could go into meticulous detail about every Hibernian class.  But enough about that...<br>
<br>
Did you know that during wartime, it is very common for enemy spies to secretly work together and share information?  For one thing, they probably have more in common with their counterparts than their superiors, and a similar objective perspective of politics and war.  For another, working together saves them a lot of work getting information they'd eventually find anyway, and as long as the reports keep coming, both sides' superiors are happy.  I find that supremely interesting, thought you might too. <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~bdemong/valarauco.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A> at: 2/7/02 12:30:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrinkle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grinkle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 5:23:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2004.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sigstuff1.homestead.com/files/Lute_pic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quid Pro Quo</span><hr size=1> Put 12 or so hours played into another char, and you'll know a fair amount about it, probably enough to ask some specific questions that are more likely to be answered than a general request for &quot;the lowdown&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 6:25:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2004.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> not the same</span><hr size=1> What he wants to know is what pieces of armor are particular characters wearing and what weapons they are using at his level.

<br>
<b>Plate</b>: you know it, you love it, and you want more of it.<br>
<br>
Plate is Paladin/Armsman. Nearly everyone 40+ is in black, that's all the good stuff. <br>
Best weapons right now are blue tinted. This may change with the Lyon itemization patch, that's the main grind zone right now so there will be a fast influx of new gear.<br>
<br>
<i>Armsmen</i> are usually with a polearm (easy to spot) or sword and shield. Tactics are very simple; they hit you with weapon of choice until you die. They also have crossbows and every now and then you'll run into one that put some points into it. Fear these people, they hit bloody hard with that toy.<br>
<br>
<i>Paladins</i> look much like Armsmen do, with the exception that many of them have a fondness for two-handed weapons (swords/axes pretty much exclusively. A few hammer, but that's about it). The rest follow the sword/shield path. They have few hp than Armsmen, but they have some nasty chants. You'll see golden spell effects above them.<br>
<i>Cup</i>: Heal chant, it's a tick based that does a group heal for about a normal hit at their level. Combat only.<br>
<i>Sword</i>: Group Damage adds.<br>
<i>Breastplate</i>: Group AF buff.<br>
A somewhat popular trick is to 'twist' these chants, causing the icons to switch rapidly. This will allows them to stack heal and damage add chants leaving you to face both. However, when you see this it also means they are rapidly draining their stamina and won't be able to sprint for long.<br>
The other ability to beware of is that most over 30 will be able to ress, and will have spare mana to do it.<br>
<br>
<b>Chain</b>:<br>
<br>
Black and red for the 40+, blue weapons right now.<br>
<br>
<i>Clerics</i> are almost always Hammer + Shield (Kite, medium). If they have another mace/hammer on their back, it's a cleric. Enhance spec clerics are weak in RvR; they mainly just buff the melees and try not to die. Rejuv clerics are a one trick heal pony, with two pretty amazing instant heal shouts. Smite clerics are the devil. In an RvR environment, you'll mainly see smite clerics. Most RvR clerics, even those of a different prime spec, will invest in smite.<br>
They'll have a self-damage add, at least 1 insta shout heal.<br>
They'll have a point blank AE shout damage spell; this is troublesome but not overly deadly in itself. However, it takes very little mana so many clerics that are standing around will pop it off as an  'assassin check'.<br>
They also have an instant shout point blank AE mez, this is a killer. The higher those clerics specs in smite, the longer the duration on the mez. A full spec smite cleric can do 40+ seconds or so on it. Low spec can do perhaps 10.<br>
They also have a single target stun that doesn't last long at all and has crappy range, and a medium range nuke that does 'good' damage.<br>
Clerics can't quickcast, so if you melee them you only have to worry about the 2 instant cast heals, the instant cast PB AE DD, and the instant cast PB AE Mez.<br>
Fun huh?<br>
<br>
<i>Minstrels</i>? If you see a chain class with a shield (small, round) + sword/rapier and some nice bright green glowing stuff.. it's a minstrel. Like bards, they're forced to have an instrument equipped to do any of the song abilities.<br>
<i>Lute</i> - Heal song. It sucks, rarely used. Most minstrels don't carry one anymore.<br>
<i>Drums</i> - Speedy feets/power regen.<br>
<i>Flute</i> - Mez/Charm. Fear the flute.<br>
Instants:<br>
While they have three total shouts, last I checked 2 shared the same timer. The range is very short so it's pretty much a melee thing. This is good for them, due to the fact most of them melee as well as a slightly damp dishtowel.<br>
<i>DDx1</i><br>
<i>DDx2</i> (or <i>Stun</i>)<br>
Unlike the rest of the singing dancing classes, minstrels get stealth. This can ruin your day. However, much like the infiltrator, if you breathe on them funny they fall over dead. Prior to the mez/stun nerf they were feared with their ability to juggle stun/mez and kick the snot out of you with you unable to do anything but stand around watching.<br>
<br>
Last chain class is the <i>Mercenary</i>. Easy to spot these, they're the only chain class not using a shield. A weapon in both hands, once again sword is the norm. There are a few crush spec mercs that use maces/hammers but most of these give up and go to Midgard, heh. Nothing really amazing here, their short bow does crap damage so just ignore it, they do. They do output a good amount of melee damage, but their main benefit is that everyone ignores them in favor of the melees in plate that they can usually close with the weaker people on your side. Other than they dual wield they're pretty bland. Oh! And every 30 minutes they can make you fumble. Not that it'll happen since pretty much all of them are so irritated with the skill they refuse to hotkey it.<br>
<br>
<b>Studded</b>:<br>
<br>
He's got a bow. He's got stealth. He's a <i>Scout</i>. The weakest of the overpowered archers, they don't get pets, good melee, or speed shouts like the rest of the girls. They do get a bit better range but that's about it. If you want to kill archers, kill scouts. In melee they'll use a sword or thruster with a small shield. Most of them have horrid thrust skills since they quit training it after level 12 when they figure out how much they suck at it, so will attempt to run away anyhow. If you spot them and can close before he gets a crit off, they're meat.<br>
<br>
And like the rest of Albion, they're mostly in black.<br>
<br>
<b>Leather</b>:<br>
<br>
<i>Infiltrators</i> - Nightshades with a crossbow instead of the DD. Crappier non-Crit style overlaps. Lame. They wear black and purple at 40+<br>
<br>
<i>Friars</i> - Heh. Unlikely you'll see one. Easy to spot though, if you see anyone in a robe wearing a visible hat, it's a friar. Their best trick is to sit around pretending to be an int caster. Moderate melee, some heals. Their enhance spells are still bugged so no one trains in them. Weak. I'm not sure what they wear anymore, as I don't see them often.<br>
<br>
<b>Cloth</b>:<br>
They are usually in black with no hat. They have sticks. If it's a Saracen it's a mage type so no damage add, but high chance of mez. Avalonians have 40 base con so are easy targets.<br>
<br>
If you see a Highlander in a robe it's a melee trying to be funny.<br>
If you see anyone in a robe that has a visible hat, it's not a caster.<br>
<br>
If you see a big dopey overweight statue looking thing, you're seeing the only high-level cabalist on the server. Let him kill you so he'll feel better and keep playing. Someone has to be the butt of the jokes.<br>
<br>
If you see any other type of mob/pet following a caster, it's a sorcerer. They have lots of ranged mez but are rare as heck.<br>
<br>
The non-pets are wizards and thurgs. Wizards are lame; they have some DD and some more DD, and some Area DD. All their DDs do less than any of the other casters. Most have quit. Thurgs are pretty brutal, they'll have refreshing party bubble up pretty much at all times, as well as the minor run buff. They are a one-man zergling raid, so pop them before they start chaining pets. They'll have a nasty damage add and melee haste going, so watch out.<br>
<br>

<br>
Hibernians<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>             Scale (easy to tell scale from other armor, it has… um, scales)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Druid: Usually Celt or Firbolg, small (round) shield and a blade or blunt weapon. High level scale armor is black or crimson, medium-high is teal, but of course people can enamel it. If they have a black wolf, a lynx, or a walking tree, it’s a Druid.  Primary healing class of Hibernia, they get all that insta-heal goodness, good buffs, AE root if they speced it, DOT poison if they speced it (stronger/longer than equivalent-level Envenom DOT), and can’t spec weaponskill but have high AF/Abs/HP. Rez.<br>
<br>
Warden: Usually Firbolg but sometimes Celt, with a medium (kite) shield and a blunt (mace or spiked club) weapon.  This description can also fit a Hero but if you see it cast, it’s a Warden. They can heal but most don’t spec very high in it, almost all Wardens spec at least high enough for the first version of group bladeturn chant (pulsing, every 10? seconds for low spec, 6 sec for high spec), and some spec pretty high in weaponskill (which will hurt you, a lot).  Decent buffs, high HP, good armor.  Can also make a party run fast but not as fast as a bard, and not while chanting bladeturn. Rez.<br>
<br>
Hero: Firbolg or Celt with a spear is a Hero, Firbolg or Celt with either a medium (kite) or large (tower) shield and a one-handed sword is probably a Hero, Fir/Celt with shield/mace is 50/50 chance for Hero/Warden, Fir/Celt with two-handed sword or branch-looking club or two-handed mace is 75/25 either Hero or (Celt only) Champion (reason for 75/25 is there are 3x as many Heroes as Champions).  Same as armsman, they hit you til you die.  They can also turn into a deer for +30-50% hit points for 30 seconds.  Spear or Large Weaponry (2-handed non-spear) heroes will hit you really hard (usually max spec in Celtic Spear or LW, and Parry), Shield Heros will hit you kinda hard but are basically turtles (very high Block and Parry spec) and may stun you with shield styles. <br>
<br>
Champion: Celt (every once in a blue moon you'll see a Lurikeen champion -- don't step on them or you'll lose a leg. I have never seen an Elven Champion), usually large weapon (2-handed sword, 2-handed mace, a club that looks like a treebranch, etc).  Similar to Blademaster but get some spells, notably debuff shouts that were just nerfed slightly harder than Enervating poison.  If you have low con or str this can still be dangerous.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>             Reinforced (anything that isn’t obviously wearing Scale or a robe, or is a Nightshade, is wearing Reinforced, though it can be hard to tell reinf just by sight)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Bard: Firbolg or Celt, musical instrument or little note particles is a giveaway, otherwise they use small (round) shields and usually a mace or club.  They can heal but don’t tend to spec very high in it, AE mez, single-target mez (can be very long duration, 51sec+), shout for wimpy damage, can spec in weapons and may have pretty decent skill in it, and like Druid and Warden have pretty good buffs, armor, and HP.  Oh yeah, they can run really fast. Same instrument-for-song as Minstrel above, but also Flute = Endurance Regen; melees in a party with a high-spec End-Bard can spam styles just shy of &quot;forever&quot;. Rez.<br>
<br>
Blademaster: Celt or Firbolg.  Two swords.  A third, floating, green-flaming sword for 50% more damage every 30 mins.  No spells. Tend to have very high weapon/dual/parry spec.<br>
<br>
Ranger: Lurikeen usually, Elf or Celt sometimes.  The two blades or daggers at their belt are just for show (well, not really, but I wouldn’t fear their melee like I fear Hunters).  They shoot you, they stealth, they self-buff, they have a run-fast shout.  Not in that order.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>             Leather (high level leather is purple and black, most shades dye black anyway)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nightshade: Elf or Lurikeen. Just like you except usually dual-wield daggers (or a rapier and a dagger) and can cast an 80-ish damage nuke at high levels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>             Cloth</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
All three casters use a robe (with hat) and a crystal-tipped staff that looks kind of like a spear at a glance. You can't tell the 3 classes apart until they start casting, unless it's an Enchanter with a pet up. All have a personal non-pulsing bladeturn.<br>
<br>
Enchanter: If you see a lurikeen or elf pet (underhill ally, for example) it’s an Enchanter.  They damage buff and nuke mostly, but can also make a party run fast (about the same as Warden).<br>
<br>
Eldritch: The nukers.  Either have AE damage (and nukes) or AE disease (and nukes), usually the former.  The area void bolt thingie is Eldritch, single-target void bolt is probably Eldritch because you're more likely to find the Easter Bunny than a high-level Mentalist.<br>
<br>
Mentalist: Rare. Depending on spec they will be good at two of the following three things: Healing, Nuking, Mez/Stun.  Usually Nuke and Mez/Stun as far as I can tell, but I haven’t met many. Their mez is single-target. I'm not sure if their DOT is baseline or Nuke spec.  Ditto for snare.<br>

Anything to make the game a bit more interesting is good in my book. If people can identify the other players, perhaps we might find some <i>tactics</i>, instead of the 'everyone rush in and whack something'. Or the Midgard version: 'Lemme just AE stun 'em all, har har.'<br>
<br>
One handy thing about mentalists is that if you see a celt caster in a robe, that's a mentalist. Heals but no res, has DD, Dots, AE Dots, AE DD, snare DD. Knife in the neck makes 'em just as dead as any other caster though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/4/02 1:41:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2004.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~bdemong/valaface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not the same</span><hr size=1> Keryath, my biggest problem with Albs is you're all freaking human.

To summarize my own in return: Celt or Firbolg is probably a healer or tank (see above for armor/weapon specifics), Elf is probably a caster (robe) or rogue (armor), Lurikeen is probably rogue (armor) or caster (robe). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A> at: 2/4/02 2:07:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukeryath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keryath</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.twitchmonkey.com/~damnskippy/DAoC/kerface.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/4/02 2:22:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2004.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.twitchmonkey.com/~damnskippy/DAoC/kerface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not the same</span><hr size=1> Heh, alright.<br>
<br>
Briton - Mixed bag. There's no real pull toward any class with this race.<br>
<br>
Robe with a hat - Friar (only Britons can be Friars)<br>
Robe sans hat - Any caster type<br>
Chain - Merc/Cleric/Minstrel. Best bets are on Cleric<br>
Studded - Scout, not too common<br>
Plate - Paladin or Armsman, more often it's an Armsman.<br>
<br>
I've noticed that most of the 'real' melee classes tend to stick with Highlanders.<br>
<br>
Avalonian - Almost all are Int casters, a very few clerics and paladins. These people are trying to be 'different' and more often than not they're off trying to role-play a tea party with a boogey than trying to RvR.<br>
<br>
If it's chain it's a Cleric.<br>
If it's plate it's a Paladin<br>
If it's cloth it's any caster type<br>
<br>
Highlander - The workhorse of Albion. Almost all will be melee, although there are a good number of smite clerics and a few scattered Minstrels and Scouts. The Minstrels and Scouts are pretty rare and don't usually make it to the battlefield, see the above tea parties.<br>
<br>
Plate - pretty fair split on Armsmen/Paladins.<br>
Chain - It's a merc or a cleric, and dollars will get you doughnuts it's a high spec smite cleric. The Minstrels are pretty rare, but with the magic greenie glow, easy to spot.<br>
Studded - Er, scout. Rare.<br>
<br>
Saracen - The de facto 'rogue' class of Albion. They also have great personal magnetism and an innate machismo. All the really powerful and smart people in Albion are Saracens. Fair warning though, since this is the 'uber' class of Albion you'll see a growing number of melees going with this vastly superior race. Pretty much the same deal as what happened with Dark Elves in EQ, heh.<br>
<br>
Plate - Rarely a paladin although it does happen, more often it's a thrust polearm spec Armsmen. Middies say 'ouch'. Also tends to get some of the 'role-play' people. This is a small percentage of Saracens<br>
Chain - I've yet to see a Saracen Merc, but I'm sure there's one out there. Other than those oddballs they're all Minstrels. Most Minstrels are in fact Saracens from my experience.<br>
Studded - It's a scout. Call it a theme. Most scouts are also Saracen.<br>
Leather - They are the incredibly powerful infiltrators. Fear them. Almost all infiltrators are also Saracens.<br>
Cloth - Cabalist or Sorcerer. Once again, overweight statue pet is a Cabalist, please be nice to him. Sorcerer is any other pet or lack of one. Not too common a race pick.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, summary:<br>
Brit - Who the heck knows? Armsman, Cleric, or int Caster.<br>
Avalonian - Int Caster<br>
Highlander - Melee or smite Cleric<br>
Saracen - Rogue, baby.<br>

If its a troll, run, because no matter what its wielding its gonna smack you down in 3 or less hits.  If your lucky its a shaman and will just dot you, before smacking you.<br>
<br>
If its a norseman/woman and has a two handed weapon, well, it can be any class and will most likely smack you down.  Same for dwarves, though they often call big hammer things from the sky, that hurt. <br>
<br>
If they happen to have an instrument its a skald.  Which means they will just catch you really quickly, kill your ear drums, and then smack you down.<br>
<br>
If its a small blue thing, a kobold i think, and its gotta spear or a bow, its a hunter and will likely pickle you with arrows <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Troll with Sword/Axe<br>
Could be any kind of melee, Beserker, Skald, Warrior<br>
Warriors tend to be more rare than the other two.  If the troll has a big shield, figure that it is a warrior.<br>
<br>
Warriors are the main meat, they have all the strong defensive styles and offensive styles of the other classes.  Can spec shield and use that effectively to block attacks on other members of their party.  Have at least 2 different types of defense mechanisms for other members of the party.  Wear Chain<br>
<br>
Beserkers tend to use two weapons.  Skalds tend to use Weapon/small shield.<br>
<br>
Beserkers can turn into a mutant chinchilla much like the guys from Hibernia with the same effect.  Rarely you'll see a Human race Beserker.  Beserkers can defend other members of their party much like warriors, never seen one with a shield.  Wear studded<br>
<br>
Skalds - Wear chain, song type spells.  Usually Troll or Dwarf, can be Norse.  have fast run speed, haven't spent enough time with em.<br>
<br>
Troll with Hammer<br>
More than likely this is the shaman.  DOT, debuffs, buffs, heals, some bolt-DD, AE DOT, Rez.  can't spec weapon.  will have either hammer/small shield or 2h hammer.  Wear Chain.<br>
<br>
Norse - hard to tell.  In a robe its one of the casters.  In armor it could be any melee including assassin.<br>
<br>
Thanes - usually norse, sometimes Dwarf.  These are the AE hammer-time casters.  They have reasonable melee (in comparison to melees in the realm).  Wear Chain.  Usually use hammer/blunt with shield or a 2h hammer as weapon.<br>
<br>
Casters - Midgard has em, 2 of em.  Spiritmasters and Runemasters.  most people that play a caster play a Runemaster.  Can be Norse or Kobold.  Kobold in robes = caster.  Spiritmaster tend to have pets &quot;spirit champions&quot; etc. <br>
<br>
Dwarfs - <br>
<br>
Healers - dunno why, most dwarfs are healers.  They cannot be shaman.  Can also be skalds, warriors, hunters.  Dwarf in chain with hammer is a healer.  Mez, AE MEZ, Heals, instas, stuns, debuffs, no weapon spec.  no DD or AE or DOT damage spells.  Self-damage buff.  Small shields.  rez.<br>
<br>
Kobolds - <br>
<br>
Hunters, Shadowblades, Casters, Shaman.<br>
<br>
Kobold in Chain is a shaman.<br>
Kobold in Studded is a hunter<br>
Kobold in Leather is a Shadowblade  (you'll likely notice the ugly helm look they suffer with if they have a non-hooded robe, think custom Gnome helm from EQ and you get the idea)<br>
Kobold in Robes is a caster (most likely runemaster)<br>
<br>
Norse can also be Shadowblades.  They will be in leather.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Vikings</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Thanes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Tend to be tough in melee, with shields/two handed weapons available to them, as most midgard's classes do.  2 instant cast nukes, one a weak PBAE effect, and the other a ranged.  Their other ranged DD is on a 10 sec timer, and lastly they have a str buff, damage add, and a ranged AE.  The ranged AE is a great tool in the right situation, but I have heard of more than a couple newbie thanes wrecking a organized attack by breaking mez <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  They hit hard, and have a good amount of HP, so it would probibly be best to stay clear of them unless you have nice poisons or level advantage.... I think.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Warriors</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: No real ranged ability to speak of.  They can throw axes and such, but the costs and range are pathetic.  99% of warriors will have both high weapon spec and shield spec, so as to be quite versitile going from defensive to offensive fighting.  A well timed shield bash can ruin your day, and their HP are rather meaty since norsemen, trolls, and especially dwarves have good con.  I never have actually fought one, but by accounts a lucky assassin should be able to put the hurt on one if they need to... Provided poisons and a good first shot are landed... I wouldn't try tho.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Skalds</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: As with all the Song classes, they are quite nasty in RvR.  They have 4 shouts; 2 DDs, a mez, and a snare.  Their songs don't require instrument swapping, but are able to be used while fighting... They have a run speed song, a healing song (pretty weak), and a group damage add.  They have a hard time finding assassins, as they run by the too fast, as it has been stated before, but it is supposedly tough to get away from one that has spotted you.  2 handed/1handed weapon skill in one yet again makes them tough melees.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Berzerkers</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Ouch, they have alot of damage output.  Most of them can be spotted by their 2 axes, or when they berzerk since they turn in the cuddly-wuddly bears.  They hit hard, and as shadowzerkers know, their left axe styles rock.  Armor wise they arn't the best, but they get evade III to help out a bit... Oh, and the berzerk ability makes all strikes have crits attached (Please correct me if I am wrong).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Rogues</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shadowblades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Well I don't really need to say anything here, since we all know alot about them from this board.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hunters</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Kobolts with little bows and big sticks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Their melee can be quite nasty, as can bowshots of course.  They have self buffs as do rangers, and *can* charm pets.  Normally pets arn't used while soloing, but they can be quite nasty.  I don't know if they will run or fight, it really depends on the player I guess.  They generally don't have super high levels of stealth, or so I have read... Spear/bow/beastcraft is too tempting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Seers<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Healers</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Caution is needed here, as like all the main healers they get shout targeted/group heals.  Pacifism spec'ed healers have stuns and mezes up the wazoo, and augmentation healers can be nasty hitters.  Alot of healers are disenchanted with Pacifism after the changes, so have moved towards more augmentation or mending...  Again they have the ability to use big 2handed hammers, so they can be tough.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shaman</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Alot of them are Cave specialized, but I think the class still needs work even with the enhancements.  Their healing aside from the regeneration abilities isn't up to par with the healers.... They lack the heal shouts, and the augmentation abilities of healers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mystics</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Runemasters</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Most of them are either spec'ed in either Supression (Bladeturn, Snare DD) or Runecarving (Bolts, ranged AE)... They are the easiest target for a assassin in the midgard realm it seems... Not much else to say of note, except perhaps that they do get a run speed buff.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Spiritmasters</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: Spiritwhat?  Rare as all get out from what I hear.  They may be gaining in popularity with the changes to their pets, adding a range of nasty procs... but still it is a ranger weak RvR class. Watch for them to be using AE debuffs, and until its fixed the pet seeing stealth bug.  They have a PBAE mez shout, which can be rough, but probibly won't pose too much of a threat if you ever find one.<br>

I hope this information is helpful, but I have no idea what colors, and race is most prevailent for most... Well generally trolls are melee and such, but if others can fill what I have missed/screwed up maybe we can start getting a better idea of their classes. <p>Eldoran Earthsong, Retired Minstrel of E'ci.<BR>

As such, they will usually rush head on into any enemy formation, with little regard for theri own lives, but in an act to get realm points.<br>
<br>
Thanes are sort of the shadowknights of DAOC.  That is they are a good R v R class and good P v E class--but they do less damage than all the other melee classes (except the skald) in melee.  Their AE nukes are effective because of the number of thanes, but they actually dish out less damage than their straight up melee.  But thanes can rack up a lot of points in R v R.<br>
<br>
Two classes have AE damage spells.<br>
Runemasters, who apparently can outdamage the nukers of other realms but are generally rarely played, and thanes, who are probably the most plentiful class in the realm on my server.  Shaman have an AE dot, but cave magic is considered a bad choice, and so you will probably never encounter this.  <br>
<br>
Two classes have AE mez abilities.<br>
Healers and spiritmasters, but spiritmasters are not known to use these spells.  Skalds have a single target mez which I don't recall seeing used in R v R.<br>
<br>
Three classes have movement speed spells.<br>
Healers (slowest, most usually at 25% or so), then runemasters (40% or faster I think), then skalds.  Hunters have an escape shout as well.   <br>
<br>
Healers can be identified by the fact they use hammers, and carry a small shield.  Thanes use med shields, warriors can use the tower ones.  Of course, warriors, thanes, and skalds can all use hammers, and some end up doing so, so it's not always easy to tell which is a healer.<br>
<br>
Shaman have poorer offensive abilities than healers, who can buff themselves up to do 50+ damage a hit with 25%+ haste at 30, so shaman have little purpose besides buffing and healing since the debuff nerf.  To mock shaman, healers receive haste spells, speed buffs, clarity, slows, mezzes and stuns.  Shaman get better root spells which are too slow to cast in battle.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Healers and shaman have the same hp pool as the tanks. <br>
<br>
Skalds have fewer hp, about the same as the rogues.  Dwarves can be runemasters, and may occasionally have more HP than the shadowblade kobolds.  <br>
<br>
I believe the epic weapons are purple in color, not completely sure.  <br>
<br>
Hunters are the only class that can use a spear.  Only hunters can charm, and this is limited to animals.  No class has a spell that replenishes endurance.<br>
<br>
Midgard on my server seems to have two shortcomings.  First, the number of stealth class members seems to be low.  Second, they are short on healer/rezzers.  I attribute this to the Midgard tank mentality.  A lot of people go to midgard to play tanks.<br>
<br>
In order of popularity, it seems to go like this:<br>

Skalds<br>
Runemasters<br>
