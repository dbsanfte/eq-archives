<br>
It is easy to get to the faction for Thurgadin armor quests in one weekend doing nothing but exp mob hunting in Great Divide. The armor you need for Thurgadin has a lousy drop rate in Kael.<br>
<br>
The faction requirements for Kael and Skyshrine are killers. You must get to ALLY. And you start KOS (unless you worship Rallos Zek, then in Kael, you are not KOS), so you need to get about 3000-4000 faction hits. <br>
<br>
It is nice to dream about the armor from Kael, but it takes very high end guilds. Plan on seeing the Kael armor around level 57+. If you are looking for Kael stuff, look for and join a giant aligned guild and tag along on every faction raid they do. Plan on taking a month to get to the faction you need for the Kael armors. A guild capable of doing the Kael armor is also close to NToV capable.<br>
<br>
Realistically, you might get *some* Thurgadin quest armor before you are 50. You are more likely to get your planar armor first.<br>
<br>
Your most likely path:<br>
Planar armor<br>
Thurgadin quest armor<br>
Kael or Skyshrine based on what high end guild you join. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uteramenor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teramenor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/02 12:27:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3809.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Velious Armor Quest(s)</span><hr size=1> My advice.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 46, start going to Hate as much as possible. Woven Shadow is good armor, and various WS pieces you'll STILL use even when you have &quot;better&quot; stuff, because of various resists and stats that they have. Verant was clever in designing the higher-end armor, because the Velious quested armors are NOT straight upgrades from Woven Shadow or Mrylokar.<br>
<br>
Once you're 52 or so, move to Sebilis and stay there till you get your Mrylokar Vambraces, Helm, and at least 1 Bracer (don't really need 2 Bracers unless you're an AC whore, but if you're an AC whore, why are you playing a rogue?). The diner (west wing) is where these three pieces drop. The bracer is immeasurably useful (Effect: Summon Throwing Daggers), the arms are not bad (Effect: Strength of Earth, +15 str, useful when there's no druids or shamen around to buff you), and the helm, well, Ultravision is pretty useless to most rogues (except humans and barbs, but by 52 you will probably already have a vision-enhancing item), but it's still a crap buff you can use on dragon raids.<br>
<br>
Save up your money and buy Mrylokar Greaves (legs), or go on as many Venril Sathir raids as possible and hope they drop. A Mrylo BP is a nice thing to have but don't count on ever getting one; Trakanon is stingy with them and few rogues that have a Mrylo BP are willing to part with it for less than a fortune in plat. Mrylo gauntlets and boots are nice items (effects of Cancel Magic and Fade respectively), but nearly impossible to find, as they drop VERY rarely from what I understand.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile you should be acquiring resist gear, namely, Velium Diamond Rings and Velium Blue Diamond Bracers, and Electrum Blue Diamond Earrings. Get a set of all 6 and you're in good shape for resists.<br>
<br>
Now, as for Velious armor...<br>
<br>
Thurgadin armor basically sucks compared to Kael or Skyshrine. Kael armor (as has been said before) has better AC, but Skyshrine armor has better HP, stats, and resists. As a rogue, AC is less important because, if you're doing your job right, you shouldn't be getting hit very much ANYWAY -- but AEs from dragons will hit you even if you never get meleed, and resists and HP help a lot there. As a result, Skyshrine armor (in my estimation) is &quot;better&quot;, but Kael armor is still nothing to sneeze at. (I'm personally on Kael faction right now, although once I complete my armor set I plan to switch to Skyshrine and get THAT armor.)<br>
<br>
All of the Skyshrine and Kael armor require four items: one piece of raw armor and three quest gems. The Skyshrine and Kael raw armor pieces (unadorned chain and ancient tarnished chain) all drop in Temple of Veeshan; the Skyshrine pieces come from mobs in the east wing (Halls of Testing) and the Kael pieces come from mobs in the west wing. The mobs in the east wing have no faction; the mobs in the west wing are all on Claws of Veeshan (i.e. Skyshrine) faction. The raw armor pieces are all NODROP but can be multiquested.<br>
<br>
The gems all come from various parts of Velious. Velketor's Lab, Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, and Cobalt Scar are the four main sources, but the gems can be found in other places.<br>
<br>
Faction is the third thing you need. In order to get your Kael armor, you need the following factions as a rogue:<br>
- Kromrif (aka Frost Giant): irrelevant (although being non-KOS makes traveling through Kael easier)<br>
- Kromzek (aka Storm Giant): ally (any faction below ally, and you will NOT be able to do the quests)<br>
- King Tormax: non-KOS (dubious or better - Tormax and his cronies guard the room where the questgivers are, and all Tormax faction mobs see through rogue sneakhide - it's POSSIBLE to get past them without Tormax faction but VERY difficult, unless you can find a Kael-factioned magician to use Call of the Hero to summon you to the quest room and back -- but this can still be dangerous).<br>
<br>
Kromzek is the hardest faction, because you have to get it all the way to ally - except it's not really that hard. I killed dwarfs in Thurgadin and GD until I was just barely dubious to Kromzek (this took about 2 hours). Then I went on TWO Temple of Veeshan raids (to the west wing) and my faction swung all the way to warmly to Kromzek (but I was max KOS to CoV as well). I spent 90 minutes in Skyshrine killing mobs in the entry area, and was ally. That was it. No real grinding. (I also got my Kael boots and gauntlets out of the deal, not to mention Ikatiar's Stinger, 12/19 piercer.)<br>
<br>
Getting Tormax faction was easy - I was extremely scowling to Tormax, and participated in killing the Dain ONCE, and went to Apprehensive, which is plenty enough faction to waltz past him safely.<br>
<br>
Skyshrine faction is harder, but not much; a few Kael Arena raids will give you some good CoV faction, although (as I understand) you need to be non-KOS to Lord Yelinak in order to get to the CoV quest mobs (who are WAY the hell up in the top of Skyshrine). But getting non-KOS to Yelinak is also easy: go to a King Tormax raid once or twice and you'll be set. You don't even need to participate in the raid; just make sure you smack Tormax once while the raid is killing him, then go sit in a corner until he dies, and you'll get the faction hit.<br>
<br>
Well, there's my two.. er... twelve bits. I don't expect that everything I've written here is accurate, so I welcome any corrections. Good luck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unortherner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Northerner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/02 5:29:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3809.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Velious Armor Quest(s)</span><hr size=1> I wouldn't overlook Assassin's armor from PoG either.
