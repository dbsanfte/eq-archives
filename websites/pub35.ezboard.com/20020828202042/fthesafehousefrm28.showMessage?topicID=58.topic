<br>
I'm having a very frustrating problem, and once gain I call on the great minds of the Safehouse hoping someone can offer some suggestions.<br>
<br>
A week or 2 ago I got a new motherboard, CPU and memory.  Slapped it in my PC (works great pretty much), and then went about upgrading my wife's PC with my old stuff (yeah, yeah she gets the hand me downs).<br>
<br>
This PC (my wife's) was perfectly fine before I did this.<br>
OS is Win98 SE<br>
This &quot;new&quot; system (my old stuff) is an Abit KT7-RAID w/AMD Duron 600 overclocked to 850, 640mb RAM, Nvidia Quattro w/64 mb agp video card, Sohoware 100mb PCI network card, and original SB 16 (yes, the old ISA card)<br>
<br>
Ever since I switched out the MB/CPU on her pc with my old one, I am getting the following problems:<br>
Can't download anything in Internet Explorer<br>
(same for Netscape)<br>
She goes LD alot while playing DAoC now.  We are both using the same cable Internet connection (going through a Linksys cable router).  I hardly ever go LD.<br>
For some reason I am unable to re-install Directx8.1a.  I get a GPF right when it starts to copy files.<br>
<br>
Ok, so this is what I have done:<br>
Re-installed latest Nvidia driver<br>
Re-installed via-n-1 drivers<br>
Removed all temporary internet files, cookies, and history<br>
Installed IE 6 (thought this might replace any corrupted IE files), had IE 5.5 sp2 before this<br>
<br>
At first I thought it was the network card.  It was sharing an IRQ with the video card.  So I moved it to other slots in the PC, and only 1 other slot (the 3rd slot) would allow me to install it in Windows.  So I moved it there, and configured the BIOS to set the IRQ to 9 (not used by anything else).  Of course I removed the card completely from the system and re-installed it.  This didn't seem to help.<br>
<br>
Copying files across the network (to my PC) would lock either PC that attempted the copy.  This stopped when I installed the IPX protocol on both PC's which I didn't want to do (and I shouldn't have to).  Using her shared printer wouldn't work either, though it would see it and let me install it on my PC, havent tried it again since I installed IPX, but since the file copying works now, I am guessing this will too.<br>
<br>
  Last night I re-installed Win98 SE on top of itself.  I reinstalled the latest video driver.  Used the latest driver from Sohoware for the network card.  I used directxbuster to remove directx, then tried to reinstall DirectX8.1a but got that GPF I mentioned earlier.  Directx8.0 installed fine.  <br>
<br>
  So now I'm stuck.  I don't know what else to do short of a clean re-install of Win98 which will be a huge ordeal cause of all the other software I will have to install.. not to mention updating and patching.. arg!!<br>
<br>
When I try to run &quot;Windows Update&quot;, it gets to the part where it downloads the update, the download window comes up with the status and everything, but just sits there.  Does the same thing when I try to download anything else in IE or Netscape.<br>
<br>
<br>
Any ideas?  I am so frustrated...  normally I'm the one helping people with problems like this.  <br>
<br>
