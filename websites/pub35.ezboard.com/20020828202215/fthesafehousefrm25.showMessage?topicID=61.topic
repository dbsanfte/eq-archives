<br>
I play an evil-as-hell rogue. A rogue with necromantic leanings. Relatively high level, truly insane dexterity, and move silently / stay hidded approaching 100%. Ive got a three foot long pole with a giant spearhead, and a stiletto. My question is:<br>
<br>
Basically, what's to stop me from just slaughtering every single person in the whole town?<br>
<br>
I once tried to do this, collecting &lt;an organ&gt; for the necromancy. I just went into every door, rolled &lt;99 on a bunch of die rolls, and just slit every throat in an entire village in one evening. it was perfectly by the rules - go in, MacBeth em, and get out. <br>
<br>
There must be a rogue based module to mitigate our psychosis.<br>
<br>
Know of one? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uswipey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/12/02 6:23:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> Hm.. Nobody moves around in this town I guess.  Nobody comes across bodies or blood pools or people missing from where they were supposed to be.  Lets assume youre doing this during the night and everyone stays immobile the whole night.<br>
<br>
The problem is time then.  If it takes, say 5 minutes to sneak, pick lock, sneak, kill, Hide the body, sneak on to the next person, that means youre killing 12 people an hour, or about 70 people in the course of an entire night. That may be everyone in a village, but it might not be too.<br>
<br>
Lets be generous and say you can kill people at a rate of 1 per minute all night, 480 people in 8 hours.  That will cover even a large village.  So what next? <br>
<br>
Well, an atrocity of that level WILL draw the attention of everyone in the area, and even beyond it.  Including those with more power and wealth than simple villagers.  Starting with the local lord, who will determine that this was not the work of orcs, or brigands, but of something more singular, and more deadly.  If he cant find you, or doesnt think he can take you if he does, he will get help elsewhere, likely putting a reward up.  This will draw adventurers, and you know what an unpredictable pain they can be.  Then there is the clergy of all the religions to which the villagers belonged to.  Consulting their gods to find out who did it, preaching throughout the country for your head.<br>
<br>
Basically, you'd be tracked, physically and magically, and most likely eventually be found.  Once found,  The finders would try, and probably succeed, in putting you down like a rabid dog. (Six to eight adventurers of similar level to you attacking you by suprise will usually do it)<br>
<br>
I'd say thats what keeps a high level rogue from assassinating mass numbers of villagers.  It draws too much attention.<br>

<br>
1. Even evil rogues aren't lunatic mass-murderers.<br>
<br>
2. I don't think that a massacre of this grade would go unnoticed by the gods. And even a level 20+ rogue won't be more than a minor nuisance to a god.<br>
<br>
3. What's the point anyhow? So even IF your character could do that, why should you? Is it fun for you? I couldn't imagine why ANYONE would want to roleplay murdering a village. *shrug* That's just beyond my understanding - same thing as people &quot;roleplaying&quot; sex with dice-rolls...<br>

<br>
You have to deal with the fact that, big stuff like this causes the people in charge over said village to hire or otherwise send people to find you and get rid of you.<br>
<br>
A group of high level mages can easily do anything that said &quot;god&quot; would.  They could use their magic to find out who did it.  Where they are now.  And then teleport there and blast you into oblivion.<br>
<br>
Then again maybe they can't.  Orcs DO wipe out villiages all the time.  And sometimes, those orcs don't even get brought to justice.<br>
<br>
In fact the more I think about it, theres NOTHING that says you CAN'T do this.  I mean, technically, isn't this what players do in a dungeon anyway?  4 or so people going from room to room slaughtering monsters.  And those monsters are only assumed to not be defenseless because of natural abilities, or because all members of an orc society have combat training due to the violence present in everyday life.<br>
<br>

&quot;Heroes&quot; usually don't slaughter defenseless women, old people and children when they roam through a dungeon and &quot;clear&quot; it. At least I haven't killed a single defenseless person or child (humanoid that is, including orcs etc.., &quot;monsters&quot; like dragons are another case) in over 15 years of RPGing. And yes, I do play evil characters too. But I'd never play (or allow someone to play) a really chaotic evil character.<br>
<br>
<br>
And on the godly interaction topic: I never said that the gods would appear themselves and act... there are dozens of other ways that a god could act in that situation.. the most likely is probably sending some of his high-level followers/priests/agents, a rare might be sending an avatar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/12/02 11:31:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> I usually don't see people slaughtering innocents in dungeons, because almost no GMs bother to but them in.<br>

Gods shouldn't be watching what players do and sending minions after them.<br>

If minions find out about the players actions and decide to go after them out of duty to their gods code, that one thing.  Otherwise, how can players hope to compete with the mechinations of gods.<br>
<br>
Now, if a a minion asked for his gods intervention, say, but getting to the village and praying in the temple for knowledge of the culprit, and the god answers with that knowledge.  Thats okay in my book.

Raven, that depends on the view you have on gods. If you are sticking with the regular (A)D&amp;D gods, they WILL see it - gods are omnipresent.. they can see anything they want at once, provided it happens on a plane they have power on or one of their followers is present.<br>
<br>
Sure, that doesn't mean he will automatically act, but if someone runs around and slaughters a village, town or city where he has got followers or even priest, he WILL act.<br>
<br>
An evil god might help to cover the action, but most likely only if he/she feels that there is something to gain from it, e.g. if followers of an enemy god are killed too.<br>
<br>

I also disagree with your interpretations of gods interference.  You say that in D&amp;D if you destroy a temple or kill a priest a god WILL act.  And I know that is not true of all D&amp;D campaign settings.  That might be true in, say, Forgotten Realms, but in others gods act as little more than powersources for cleric unless your party actually travels to other planes.

Why do we have evil campaigns?  Because people LIKE being evil.  It's why so many people who play EQ play Dark elves(in theory).  Its why World of Darkness is so popular while at the same time having such a @#%$ play system.<br>

I don't know why it always falls to me to run the campaign where everyone plays an orc/hobgoblin/drow/bugbear/half-dragon.

I never said that doesn't happen, did I? <br>
Although one should consider the fact that most evil gods wouldn't act if someone displayed weakness in such a way. It's a common trait of good gods to defend weak and helpless people, while evil gods just laugh at them for their weaknesses.<br>
Gruumsh is just one of those.. he actually weeds out the weak himself...<br>

So what you are saying is that the evil gods are stupid and inherently less powerful than the good gods?<br>
<br>
Frankly, most game masters would be so taken aback at what you are proposing doing that they wouldn't know how to respond. They'd either over-react and sick some inexplicable fury upon you (30th lvl retired warrior turned farmer) or use the &quot;Divine retribution&quot; thing.<br>
<br>
A good game-master would let you get away with it, and have a very good retribution in mind for you somewhere down the road when you aren't expecting it. Perhaps a good adventuring party swears vengeance upon the person(s) that perpetrated the deed.<br>
<br>
Either way, you're asking the gamemaster to completely screw you over if you continue.<br>

As the Evil GM, it's my job to be prepared for stuff like that, and make sure my evil PCs aren't going to get screwed for doing the equal yet opposite actions of any normal PC adventuring party.<br>

I look back at that, and think that, while in this story, a level 20 rogue is murdering the villiage, it actually would take a lot less to tackle said villiage at night like a party of adventurers.  I find most villiages can be cleared by a rounded out party of level 4 players.  Much like you'd expect a party of level 4 players to be able to take out an orc tower.<br>
<br>
The problem with that is, if any god decides to take a hand against a party of level 4 adventurers, they are pretty much boned. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A> at: 5/13/02 1:30:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/13/02 2:23:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> So what you are saying is that the evil gods are stupid and inherently less powerful than the good gods?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Nope, I don't. I just say that evil gods would react different to the slaughter of a whole village or tower or whatever than good gods would do.<br>

As an evil god I might try to convert the assassin into my service, either by true faith or with good contracts and such. As a good god I'd probably find a way to bring down justice on the assassin, most likely through the hands of a highly trusted proxy.<br>

And to adress the issue of why evil doesn't reply on the same scale, most of these games make it a point that evil is, in general, much less organized, and much less prone to care about their fellow man/monsters. To a degree, I think this is sort of exaggerated, because if I was an evil mofo with an int over 5, and heroes were running rampant slaying this and arresting that, I'd start to wonder when I was next.
