<br>
::setting in a corner in the Castle of Karnor’s the rogue leans against the wall and smirks as he watches people run for safety from a pursuing group of dogs.  When Valius’s thoughts enter his head.::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Ten what are you up to?”<br>
“Not much sitting in Karnor’s. What’s up”<br>
“Can you come to Sebilus?  Sinagel and her group have fallen and we are having problems getting their bodies”<br>
“Sure let me find a port and I’ll be there”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::stepping into the Dreadlands the rogue shouts for a port to the Emerald Jungle.  A kindly druid approaches and sends the both of them hurtling to the Jungle.  Bowing swiftly and dropping a few coins in the Halflings hand the rouge sets up at a break neck speed.  The sounds of the Jungle become a blur in his ears as the Spirit of the Wolf speeds him along.  Skidding to a halt as he reaches Trak’s Teeth and surveys the area in hopes the way will be clear.  Deciding the shadows would be his best bet he fades from view and  makes his way to Sebilus.  Reaching the orb he pulls out a small idol and places his hand against the pulsating red sphere.  Instantly he is in the Underground dungeon of Sebilus.  Valius is standing at the top of the ramp down into the rest of the keep.::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”So where’s the bodies?”<br>
“Down by the Dinning Room.  You gonna be able to get them? One rogue already went down trying.”<br>
“I’ll be fine”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::Stepping into the shadows again He slips down past the ever present frogs and picks his way to the dinning room.  Finding the corpse of his fallen friend he grabs the back of her armor and drags the corpse to the waiting Valius.  Praying the creaking of the plate armor doesn’t alert the frogs as he passes them.  Reaching the ramp he drops the corpse and proceeds back to retrieve the next corpse.  After he’s safely gotten all 6 of the party to Valius he takes another chance, this one for his personal gain.  Slipping back down to the jail.  Slidding behind a casting frog he takes a chance.  With great skill he lifts a fire emerald from the frog’s purse and returns to the shadows before they even knew he was there.  Returning to the entrance he plops down next to Valius. <br>
<br>
After a couple hours of resting and regaining mana for the Cleric, Valius looks up and asks::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Wanna go to Hate and kill Inny?”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
:: blinking and grinning from ear to ear::<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Oh yes let’s do it”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::making his way to the exit of Sebilus the rogue lightens the purse of a few more frogs and steps out through the portal back to Traks Teeth.  Valius appears from thin air his gate spell porting him to safety.  Quickly the 2 of them run out of the ruins and meet with Khael.  Forming a group they pick up a couple other people and are sent hurtling through space to the Plane of Hate.::<br>
<br>
::Within an instant Tenlar feels weird as he is summoned by one of the mages, to the point everyone is gathered.  Turning around to see some of his old friends and greets them.  Finding one of his old and dearest friend/mentor he bows swiftly and draws a circle on the ground.  Vestrial bends and draws a circle next to his.  Standing up and grinning.  Within an instant 4 other people draw a circle on the ground and smirk back.  Extending greetings to the 5 Tenlar sets down with Vestrial and gets the instructions on just what he is to do once the battle is started.  The constant chanting of Casters and Clerics around him becomes a dull drone as if he is setting in a swarm of bees.::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Vestrial I’ll never get used to this noise.  The more chanting the more unnerving it is to me.”<br>
“I tune it out old friend, or it will drive you mad.  It’s even worse once battles are engaged.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->::the other rogue returns::<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”oish, then I need to learn fast”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::as the two rogues stand up and move around keeping themselves limber and ready for battle a shout is heard::  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”Incoming A Disciple of Innuurok Look Sharp”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  ::Blinking a couple times as he can never seem to get used to the size of these Dark Elves,  each towering over the tallest barbarians.  With great speed he slips behind the disciple and begins the wirling dance of his blades.  The Jagged Shard doing the best against the plate armor of the Drow, sinking deeply and leaving open holes as blood flows from each one he leaves.   In what seems like an eternity the 2 drow fall slain by the mighty party.  After a couple more battles the orders are issued it’s time to take our place to fight Inny.  <br>
<br>
Following the group into a building and up a ramp into an enormous room they all gather.  More orders are shouted out and all prepare for the conflict.  Finally it’s time Bhrit an old friend and Shadow Knight brings the @#%$ out to us.  Almost running seeing the size of the formidable enemy Tenlar grips his blades and awaits the order from Breus to attack.  What seemed again like an eternity the warrior shouts <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   FIGHT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Within a split second the formidable party surrounded Inny and blow after blow fell.  From the distance the casters where chanting and sending in spells that wounded the @#%$ as well.  A shout from Innuurok and the whole group was sent flying into the air and against the walls.  The sound of breaking bones and shouts from the pain echoed in his ears as those around him fell to the floor.  With his dexterity and agility honed the rogue fell to the floor unharmed and quickly joined into the battle.  The floor was becoming slick with blood from the wounded.  His footing becoming unsteady he forced himself onto his toes and kept his footing as his blades danced and landed blow after blow.  His armor becoming slick, the handles of his dagger and sword slipping from his grasp with sweat and gore, the smell almost sickening, the sight even more horrific.  Again another shout from the @#%$ sent them flying again.  The sounds this time fell on deaf ears, as he hit the ground, his focus back on the fight, as the @#%$’s spell didn’t fling him far this time.   The battle rang across the plane, echoing through the eerie streets and houses of the inhabitants of this wonder of hell.  The battle cries and the ringing of steel was deafening to all those in the fray.  The floor slick and red caused him to slip and lose his balance.  Missing his blow he looked up as he quickly got back to his feet to see the massive hand of his father coming down.  With a groan the rogue slumped to the floor with the force of the blow, his head reeling from the pain.<br>
<br>
  Forced into his head the mighty voice of Innuurok <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”I create you, and you leave my guidance for that you will die”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Now the battle to the rogue is personal.  With renewed spirit he stood and begins his dance again.  Blows landing true, this time the hand coming down didn’t slam him to the floor, but instead picked him up.  With a shout he was thrown across the room, those around the @#%$ were send flying as well, as the power of the @#%$’s wrath was unleashed.  Landing hard and shaking his head to clear it, the rogue stood and reentered the fray.  His eyes were shut tight his face covered in only Bristlebane knew what, and he didn’t want to know.  Finally the killing blow was struck and the mighty @#%$ fell.  Settling to the floor he removed his gauntlets and wiped his face clean.  His friends milled around the body and took care of the wounded.  Closing his eyes again Tenlar removed his helm and ran a bloody hand through his white mane and shook it to let the sweat matted hair free from the confines of his helm.  <br>
<br>
Feeling a hand on his shoulder he looks up and grins at Vestrial.  Extending a hand downwards Vestrial helps Tenlar to his feet. With a hasty goodbye Vestrial is sent from the plane by one of the wizards gathered.  Tenlar looks for his friend, the tell tale purple of Valius armor shows him the way.  Settling down again on the ground.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   ”is it over?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ”it’s over and you did good.  You ready to go?”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->::grins the ghey cleric:: <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “yeah I guess I am.  How do I get down from here?”<br>
“Find Germer he’ll translocate you out of here.”<br>
“okay”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ::embracing his old friend:: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    “aluve abbil”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::tracking down the gnome in red robes proved and easy task.  Asking for a translocate to Neriek the rogue bows to Germer and disappears through time and space back to the forest of his youth.  Settling down on top of the wizzie portal he closes his eyes and drifts to sleep.::<br>
