You say, 'Hail, Delival'<br>
Delival says 'Hello there, Zoralu. I do not suppose you have seen a little girl running around with a box of buttons? I sent [Shainai] over to Master Barkehm's place so I can finish these [uniforms] I am working on. <br>
You say, 'what uniforms' (No response)<br>
You say, 'Who is Shainai'<br>
Delival says 'Shainai is my little girl. While I am [inactive] I would like to see her as much as possible so I brought her with me here. I am starting to worry that she may have gotten lost near the palace. If you see her and have the time to escort her back here I would be indebted to you, friend.<br>
I found Shainai wandering around in the tunnels, near the prison.<br>
You say, 'Hail, Shainai'<br>
Shainai says 'Hi. I was getting some buttons for Daddy and I got a little lost. I know the way, I mean it... but if you wanted to follow me home to make sure I got there safe and all, you could. <br>
You say, 'i will follow you'<br>
Shainai says 'You will?!? Oh good, now I won't be so lonesome. Here hold this if you please, my arms are tired. Ready? Follow me, now, I know the way. Hrmmmm.? <br>
She hands you a &quot;bag of buttons&quot;.<br>
Shainai says 'Yup yup, I definitely know the way from here. <br>
Delival sees you come into the room but looks just past you, 'Shainai is that you?' <br>
Shainai says 'Ahhh, home at last. <br>
Delival says 'Well thank heavens you're finally home, perhaps I should think twice before sending you out alone next time, little one. Thank you so much for bringing her back, my friend. Looks like she managed to talk you into carrying the buttons for her as well. <br>
Hand Delival the bag of buttons.<br>
Delival says 'Well I wish there was more I could do to repay you. Take this old compass and what change I can spare with my most sincere thanks. Now off to bed Shainai, you have had a busy day. <br>
Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better.<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
You receive 1 copper from Delival.<br>
You receive 3 silver from Delival.<br>
You also receive a compass. Very nice at this stage of the game, with no sense heading.<br>
<br>
Shainai yawns deeply, 'Daddy I'm sleepy, could you come tuck me in ?' <br>
Delival sighs and says, 'My hands are full right now hon.' Delival looks your way curiously and asks, 'I don't suppose you would want to tuck her in for me if I give you a blanket?' <br>
You say, 'i will tuck her in'<br>
Delival says 'Thank you again, have been a great help. Here is her favorite blanket, just give it to her and she should be fine. G'night Shainai. <br>
Shainai settles comfortably in for restful afternoon nap, 'Thank you for walking me home, it was ever so nice of you. Goodnight.' <br>

You say, 'Hail, Dharr Nadim'<br>
Dharr Nadim says 'Step up, step up! Please take a moment to purchase some supplies from me. Times are hard and my [luck] has been bad. <br>
You say, 'what luck'<br>
Dharr Nadim says 'I have just come from Hollowshade Moor a few weeks ago. My fishing days have been very unprosperous. The lures that I have now are made of low quality Acrylia and scare the fish away rather than attract them. I want to make a new lure, and on my way in I noticed the dull color of the [scorpions]. I would have moved closer to them but unfortunately I am deathly allergic to the poisons found in scorpion venom. <br>
You say, 'what scorpions'<br>
Dharr Nadim says 'The scorpions are at the bottom of the canyon surrounding the city. If you can bring me four shells to make a few lures, I will give you my old lure. Be careful making your way down the ledges, as there are many steep drops. <br>
Hand him 4 scorpion shells.<br>
Dharr Nadim says 'Please, if you can fetch me four scorpion shells I can make a full set of new lures. <br>
Dharr Nadim says 'Please, if you can fetch me four scorpion shells I can make a full set of new lures. <br>
Dharr Nadim says 'Please, if you can fetch me four scorpion shells I can make a full set of new lures. <br>
Dharr Nadim says 'Excellent, hopefully my fishing business can start to thrive once again! As I said before you can have this old lure. You won't be able to catch anything with it but maybe you can pawn it off to a jewelry merchant. <br>
You gain experience!!<br>
Reward is Dharr's lure ac1 +2chr ear or ranged. lore/nodrop/magic'<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
You say, 'Hail, Taruun Rolom'<br>
Taruun Rolom says 'Hail friend! Are you just out killing time or are you looking to earn a wage? <br>
You say, 'i am looking to earn a wage'<br>
Taruun Rolom says 'Hmm... I see. Well friend, there is plenty for you to do here. There are all sorts of pests in the hollow that lies below the city. It would be nice if we could get rid of all of them. Perhaps then we could concentrate on real soldiering. With that in mind, we are always looking for another brave young citizen to go down there and kill some of the vermin. Tell the other guards that you are being assigned to help. They will tell you what to do. <br>
<br>
Your Location is 1142.46, -151.48, -185.33<br>
You say, 'I am being assigned to help'<br>
Khala Dun Aihjin says 'They are sending me smaller recruits each day. We simply must be running out of real soldiers. Well, maybe you can scare a creature into hurting itself if you wave your arms and yell enough. That or you may get lucky and have a boulder roll over one of them while you're down there. Either way, bring me the tongue of each grimling whelp that you kill. I'll count each tongue as a kill and pay you accordingly. Now, move out. <br>
Hand him a grimling tongue.<br>
Khala Dun Aihjin says 'Perhaps you'll have a place in our ranks after all. Take this and carry on. <br>
You gain experience!! (Not noticable at lvl 5)<br>
You receive 9 copper from Khala Dun Aihjin.<br>
You receive 9 silver from Khala Dun Aihjin.<br>
Also rewarded with a random wooden practice weapon, or tattered hopperhide armor.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Pit Guard Retaj'<br>
Pit Guard Retaj says 'Hail friend, have you been helping to rid this area of those thieving little grunts? <br>
You say, 'yes'<br>
Pit Guard Retaj says 'Good work! We need more people like you down here. Hmm... perhaps I can help you out a little. If you bring me four sets of the filthy beads those little creatures wear, I can try to compensate you in some way. <br>
Give him 4 &quot;Filthy beads&quot; unstacked.<br>
Pit Guard Retaj takes the beads and throws them in his bag. 'Here, perhaps this will aid you in your efforts' He says. <br>
You gain experience!!<br>
You receive 12 copper from Pit Guard Retaj.<br>
You receive 1 silver from Pit Guard Retaj.<br>
Also gave me a pair of cloth sleeves.<br>
