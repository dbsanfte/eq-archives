<br>
Envenom isn't like other skills - its different in 2 important ways.  <br>
<br>
The first is that unlike other skills, if you have env at 39 and add +11 w/ realm ranks/items, you can use the lvl 50 poisons.  Another skill, say pierce for example, wouldn't let you use a lvl 50 style unless you are a &quot;natural&quot; 50 (i.e. trained).  So no need to get natural 50 envenom for the sake of using higher lvl poisons, unlike another skill line where you want a style, spell, ability, etc. by training to X lvl.<br>
<br>
The second is that unlike other skills, envenom doesn't scale w/ spec lvl.  50 natural pierce plus +11 w/ items/rr is a 61 pierce skill.  You will hit harder, have less dmg variance, and lower minimum on PA, etc. w/ 50 +11 than u would w/ just 50.  So there is a reason to train to 50 and then let items/rr take you over 50.  However, if I have 39 +11 (total 50) envenom I can use lifebane (lvl 50 dot) and every other poison that someone with a natural 50 envenom who also has +11 envenom from items (total 61).  And poison damage/snare/debuff/resists, etc. will be the same.  You get NO benefit from env over 50.<br>
<br>
Long story short, no point at all going 50 envenom b/c you will (w/ realm ranks and items) be able to add points to it.  Most people figure that by lvl 50 they will have a 2,3,4,5, etc. points from RR and will have enough items to have +11 to envenom so few people ever consider going over 39 &quot;naturally.&quot;<br>
<br>
What about CS?  I don't know and not everyone agrees, but many people say CS to 50 is a waste.  Every point in CS raises your PA cap by 9pts.  9pts is not alot at lvl 50 and most people say that you rarely come close to your cap if you have 39 CS (plust some points from RR/items).  So no need to go beyond to lvl 50.  Others say different.  But I think that more people think CS beyond lvl 39 is a waste.  At 39 you get the PA/CD/SS chain.  The lvl 44 and 50 styles are the 3rd and 4th styles in a 4 style evade chain that begins w/ hamstring.  Many people say these last 2 are not worth going to 50 cs.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I will go 50 thrust (great lvl 50 style evade style w/ 9 second stun that everyone raves about) and will stop env at 39, stealth at 39 (maybe 40 for safe fall 4) and CS 39.  I will have a few points left over and ill probably dump them into CS to increase my cap a bit or maybe into DW for what its worth.  <br>
<br>
P.S. Until a few days ago, it was widely understood that stealth above 50 was also a waste.  So most people planned on 39 +11 stealth.  Recently the herald said that stealth over 50 increases detect hidden range.  I don't know if this has been confirmed yet or if its BS. <br>

Hell, in all honesty, I would consider taking it to zero if I think I'm gonna be fighting people in epic armor all the time.  In that case, Perf becomes more frustrating than useful, and Garrote probably isn't worth it if all you do is spec CS high enough to get AH.  CS has become a less viable line now IMO.<br>
<br>
The reasons I liked CS aren't as valid anymore: Big Perf damage making oneshot/stay stealthed possible is obviously a dead concept, CD stun is trumped by Dragonfang, esp if you have Dodger.  I don't know what the answer is, other than a massive increase in CS style damage.  And then how do you balance it against non-epic armor wearers?  I think it needs maybe about a 100% increase against epic armor, but only a 20% increase against regular armor.  Maybe making it IGNORE armore completely would work.<br>

As a shadowblade I would stop crit at 34. You can still get good perfs w/ slow weapons, and you have enough points to train your other specializations. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure about nightshades, since nightshades dont neccesarily need celtic dual as much as shadowblades need leftaxe, you can take it to 39.. I haven't really looked at nightshades tho, so if you need points for other skills this may be different.<br>
<br>
<br>
Infiltrators have more than enough points to train crit to 39 without any problems. You can even train it to 44 if you have high realm rank and can work out the items.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
