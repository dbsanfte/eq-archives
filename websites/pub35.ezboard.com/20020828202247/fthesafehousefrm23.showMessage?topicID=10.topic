Thought Id post a definitive list on items with bonusses to SB skills. <br><br><br>+ Stealth Items <br>--------------- <br>Level - Description - (Effects) <br>*Where found* <br>-Note: If it has a Plus by it, that means it is dropped from a certain type of mob. The plus is basically the level you can kill the mob in a group, and be able to wear it as it is Orangish. <br><br>7 Ring of the Stealthy (+1 to Stealth) <br>*Trainer quest* <br>11 Fine Norse Cloak (+1 to stealth) <br>*Trainer Quest* <br>18+ Malphetic Leather Helm (+2 to Stealth) <br>*Drops in Nisse's Lair* <br>22 Kobold Bone Ring (+1 Stealth,+1 CS) <br>*Drops from Vendo Guards in Vendo* <br>30 Moonshadow Cloak (+1 Stealth, +1 Crit) <br>*Trainer Quest* <br>32 Boots Of Loki (+3 to Stealth) <br>*One time drop from Thrasia the Werewolf, LOC is on WWW.Warcry.Com) <br>32+ Silksteel Helm (+1 to stealth) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>34+ Darksteel Helm (+3 to stealth) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>34+ Darksteel Boots (+1 to Stealth) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>36+ Facetted insect eye (+3 to stealth) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>40+ Darksteel Necklace (+2 to Stealth) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>34+ Facetted insect eye (+3 to stealth) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>40+ Webbed Shadow Helm (+4 to Stealth) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>44+ Ghostly Cloak (+4 to Stealth) <br>*One time Drop from a named Mob in Yggdra-Yet to learn his name* <br><br>That is all I have to date on the Bonus to Stealth items. I am fairly certain the Runed Clay Leather armor will have something as well(dropped from Clay Jotuns in Vanern Swamps Lvl 38+). There is undoubtedly more Stealth from the Full webbed Shadow Set, I have a half set now. I will check out what I have today. <br><br>+ Crit Strike Items <br>---------------------- <br><br>20+ Glowing Gloves of Precision (+1 to CS) <br>*Dropped at the WW fort by Gna Faste* <br>22+ Kobold Bone Ring (+1 to CS, +1 to Stealth) <br>*Dropped off Vendo Guards in Vendo* <br>30 Moonshadow Cloak (+1 to Stealth, +1 to CS) <br>*Trainer Quest* <br>28+ Shining Gloves of Precision (+2 to CS) <br>*Dropped from WW guards in Skona Ravine and Mephitic Ghouls in Muspelheim* <br>36+ Darksteel Ring (+2 to CS) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br><br>There is probably more, this is all I know of for sure. <br><br><br>+ Envenom Items <br>--------------- <br><br>24+ Cave Lurkers Gloves (+1 to envenom) <br>*Drops in Spin* <br>32+ Runed Clay Leather armor Piece (+2 to envenom) <br>*Drops from Clay Jotuns in Vanern Swamp* <br><br>All I know of to date. I believe it is a piece of Runed clay armor that gives the + to envenom. <br><br>+ Sword Skill Jewelry <br>--------------------- <br><br>7 Tail of Morra (+1 to Sword) <br>*Quest from Aenlivar in Audliten* <br>22+ Bear Hide Bracer (+1 to Axe, +1 to Sword) <br>*Drops from Vendo Guards in Vendo* <br><br>Have yet to hear of any Spin Drops Jewelry Wise for this. <br><br>+ Axe Skill Jewelry <br>------------------- <br><br>22+ Bear Hide Bracer (+1 to Axe, +1 to Sword) <br>*Drops from Vendo Guards in Vendo* <br><br>+ Sword Skill Swords/Dropped Swords <br>----------------------------------- <br><br>(+1)Sveabone Hilt Sword(1 Handed)=1 <br>*Quest from Gridash in Vasudheim* <br>Bronze Kobold Forged Sword=3 <br>*Dropped in Gotar* <br>(+1)Klippor(One Handed)=10 <br>*Quest from Alumadi in Vasudheim* <br>Tomte Long Sword(One Handed)=10+ -80QL- <br>*Dropped in Nisse's Lair* <br>Brittle Bone Great Sword(2 handed)=10+ <br>*Dropped in Nisse's Lair- Skirmishers and up type mobs* <br>(+1)Traitors Bane(Two handed)=14+ <br>*Dropped from a Blodfelag henchman in Myrkwood Forest-Rare-* <br>FireSteel(1 Handed)=14+ <br>*Dropped From Blodfelag Henchman in Myrkwood Forest-Rare-Orange in Color-) <br>(+2)NightSworn(1 handed)=17+ <br>*Quest from some gal in Hugginfell* <br>(+4)Njessi Fang(Both)=22+ <br>*Quest from Bork in Hugginfell* <br>(+1)Svartalff forged sword(1 handed)=23+ <br>*drops off Mephitic Ghouls-pretty rare* <br>(+5)Flame Forged Sword(1 Handed)=23 <br>*Quest from <br>(+1)Sword of the Indomitable(1 handed)= 22+ <br>*Dropped off Vebdo Guards* <br>Vendo Flesh Reaver(2 handed)=27 + <br>*Dropped off Svendos* <br>(+1)Dull Asterite Sword/Great Sword(Both)=34+ -80QL- <br>(+1)Keen asterite Sword/Great Sword(Both)=34+ <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>(+2)Pitted Long Gnarled Tooth(One Handed)=38+ <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>(+2)Twilight Soul Searer(2 handed)=38+ <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>Shadow Razor(One Handed)=38+ <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>(+3)Forest Viper Fang(One Handed)=38+ <br>*Dropped in Vanern Swamps* <br>(+2)Fell Cats Razor Tooth(One Handed)=38+ <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>Dark Frozen Eviscerator(One Handed)=38+ <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>(+4)Epic Sword(both)=40+ <br>*Trainer Quest* <br><br>That is All I could find on Sword Drops. I apologize for the Spin drops and me not knowing who drops them, but there is alot of them. Also, I have yet to visit that dungeon. Also, some of these I have never seen, and maybe never will. This is all from experience and Research Mainly. <br><br>+ Axe Skill Axes/Dropped Axes <br>----------------------------- <br><br>I dont Have the time right now to do this. Hopefully someone else will post what they have seen, or will look at the Allakhazam Site and post the items there. If not I will do that later on in This Thread. <br><br>Leather Armor Mob Drops. <br>----------------------- <br><br>Tomte Leather Armor AF 12=9+ -80QL- <br>*Dropped off low level Mobs in Spin* <br>Malphetic Leather Armor AF 26=14+ <br>*Dropped from Higher level mobs in Nisse's Lair* <br>Muddied Hide Leather AF 44=21+ -80QL- <br>*Dropped From Vendo Guards in Vendo* <br>Cave Lurkers Armor AF 56=25+ <br>*Dropped From Svendos in Vendo* <br>Faded/Braided Silksteel AF 72=30+ -Faded is 80QL- <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>Faded/Braided Darksteel AF 82=34+ -Faded is 80QL- <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br>Runed Clay Leather Armor AF 88=36+ <br>*Dropped off Clay Jotuns in Vanern Swamps* <br>Webbed Shadow Armor AF 92=40+ <br>*Dropped in Spin* <br><br>That is all the full suit drops I have seen and or heard about. I reccomend www..warcry.com for quested Leather or one time drops. Most of the 80 QL items you get will not have any magical benefits at all, until you get into the Faded Pieces of Silksteel/Darksteel. Also the Bonus enchantment on those items are only 1%. Not the best. <br><br>A good site to visit is <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://Camelot.Allakhazam.com">Camelot.Allakhazam.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> for a very full listing of most the known items in game. <br>Also <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://Camelot.Warcry.Com">Camelot.Warcry.Com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> The best Quest Guide I have seen yet. <br><br>If I missed anything, or am wrong anywhere, please feel free to add what you know. Thanks alot to everyone that helped me to write this. It has been a long time in coming. <br><br>*Good Luck to all of my Fellow Blades. Hopefully this will help you alot. <br><br>For the younger Blades, Something that helped me alot is to make two Shades to 7 for the +2 to Stealth, +2 to Sword for my main at level 7. I had 2 Tails of Morra(Bracer), and 2 Rings of the stealthy. You can wear all 4 of those items simaltaneously and the bonusses stack.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthrugai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thrugai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/24/02 5:19:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here is a great SB item list.</span><hr size=1> Another envenom on is the Jewel of Venom (+3envenom, and other stats), drops in the swamps from Spiders... <p>---DAOC---<br>Thrugai - 40th ShadowBlade<br> Knights of NI - Midgard - Kay<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubraincandy999.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Braincandy999</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.austin.rr.com/pagedir/tinyeye.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/25/02 6:40:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here is a great SB item list.</span><hr size=1> Cave lurker gloves drop in Vendo not Spind.<br><br>Torch <p><a href="http://www.shadowalliance.com" ><img src="http://home.austin.rr.com/pagedir/images/daoc_sig.jpg" border=0> </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udarkspyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>darkspyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/6/02 2:17:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here is a great SB item list.</span><hr size=1> Gloves of precision are +2 cs <p>Darkspyre Level 41 Shadowblade Bors serverlevel 810 tailor</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucyrionamon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyrion Amon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 3:41:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here is a great SB item list.</span><hr size=1> Also among the Swords are the Engraved WOlf Blade, and the WOlf Bone Blade.  Both drop off WW's in the Ravine and around the bridge.  THe Engraved is 2-handed, the Wolf-bone is 1-handed.  Both have several bonuses which I forget at the moment, but there are plusses to sword skill, 3 or 4 I believe, as well as other plusses.  Both yellow at 30-31, both somewhat rare drops, at least for me.  I've gotten 2 of each to drop while hunting WW's to build up faction for Spind, and in that time I've seen 12-14 Garou Axes drop for each of the sword drops.<br><br>Gliling Ghostwalker<br>Guinevere <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uacobar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acobar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/13/02 7:32:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> axes</span><hr size=1> Noble Wanderer's Axe +2 Axe (left hand useable) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upootch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pootch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/21/02 11:00:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: axes</span><hr size=1> anyone got info on items that adds to left axe? <p>----------DuDe!...

I stick to and exclusivly use high qua player crafted Leather and Weaponry.  This ensures My Critblade can survive easily against yellows with a 2 or 3 shot Kill technique.  With enchanted player crafted armor I survive longer than my tanks in groups when the tanks are wearing dropped armor.  Norlally im out dammaging them and draw aggro.  I was getting hit more than my tank last night in DF but for less damage and he died before I did and he was higher level than I.  I will never use any armor or weapons that are dropped as they have a much lower AF than whats really led to belive like the silksteel stuff dropped in spin AF 82 at 85% only provides and effective af of 72.  My Eldritch leather at 98% qua AF 80 is far better than Anything stats ould provide as i feel that they are Crappy minimal incrases and I hit my AF/stats cap with Healer buffs anyway so why wear Substandard items?  <p><font size=4 color=Green><b>Ansuz Odhinnson</font></b><br><font size=4 color=red>Da Jack of all Trades<br><font color=Red size=3><i><p align=center>"Don't let the bastards grind you down... ...kill them before they get the chance"<br></p><p align=left><img src="http://www.fatescalling.com/images/screenshots/648.thumb.jpg" width="125"></p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uansuz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ansuz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/2/02 7:52:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/2/02 10:27:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jewel of Venom</span><hr size=1> Spind drops are 89%.  <br>I solo yellows consistantly too wearing Braided Darksteel, what's your point?
