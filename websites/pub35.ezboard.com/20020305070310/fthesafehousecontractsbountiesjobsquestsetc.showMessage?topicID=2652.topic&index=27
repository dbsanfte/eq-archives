<br>
Talnari: People using my software could be detected at any time should Verant/SOE have the desire to do so.  I mentioned before, they might already know thousands.  I would bet that they cannot and will not ban users for using a real-time log parser.  Glimwin may be trying to be responsible, but you are most certainly wrong where you say &quot;Who cares what the EULA says&quot;.  That is just plain ignorant.  &quot;Who cares what the US Constitution says&quot;  They're both legal agreements.  If you don't care about the agreements you make, that is your choice.<br>
<br>
Being responsible should not involve spamming message boards and news sites with mindless drivel.  If he was as intelligent or wise as he claims to be, he would have challenged the Legal Director's stance as I did several months ago:<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for contacting Sony Online Entertainment with respect to EverQuest<br>
and your log parsing application.<br>
<br>
Applications like the one you mention are not allowed to be used under the<br>
EverQuest User Agreement and Software License (&quot;User Agreement&quot;), which<br>
states,<br>
<br>
&quot;9. You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to<br>
change Game play. You may not use our intellectual property rights contained<br>
in the Game or the Software to create or provide any other means through<br>
which the Game may be played by others, as through server emulators.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neither Sony Online nor Sony Computer Entertainment America provides<br>
permission for these types of applications as they are in direct violation<br>
of the User Agreement.  The use of this application by an EverQuest player<br>
may result in the termination of their EverQuest account.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments you may have.<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
<br>
Steve Weiss<br>
Director, Legal and Business Affairs<br>
Sony Online Entertainment Inc.&quot;<br>
<br>
I lost the exact emails I SENT but basically I said something to the effect of &quot;With all due respect, have you even read what you copied and pasted to me?  It obviously says 'to modify' which is the active phrase in that sentence.  Anyone who passed high school English should be able to recognize this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he replied with this, which in laymens terms is called &quot;backing down&quot; and using the &quot;easy way out&quot;:<br>
--------------------------<br>
Section 14 of the Rules of Conduct states:<br>
<br>
&quot;You will not create, use or provide any server emulator or other site where<br>
EverQuest may be played, and you will not post or distribute any utilities,<br>
emulators or other software tools related to EverQuest without the express<br>
written permission of Sony Computer Entertainment America.&quot;<br>
<br>
That means that any distribution of the log parser or any other utilities<br>
relating to EverQuest without the express written permission of Sony<br>
Computer Entertainment America is a violation of the Rules of Conduct and<br>
the EverQuest User Agreement and Software License.   Finally, Sony Computer<br>
Entertainment America will not be granting any such permission.<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
<br>
Steve.<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
So I ask why permission would not be granted:<br>
<br>
-----------------------------<br>
Sony does not grant permission because it feels all utilities<br>
affect gameplay, which violates the rules of conduct/user agreement. In<br>
addition, there are people who place trojan horse viruses into utilities and<br>
distribute them to gain access to other EverQuest players accounts and then<br>
loot/delete them.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Steve.<br>

I personally don't think he's had much law experience, or even qualified for his position.  Regardless, this took place in August, 2001.  I have been &quot;on their radar&quot; for the duration.  My web site and message boards are quite public.  No users have been banned, nor have I received an email asking me to cease distribution (which as I mentioned previously, they can't come after me with knives, all they can do is say my EverQuest account can be banned because I'm distributing software).  EQWatcher's users are informed (or should be) of what the EULA states and they have made their own decision on whether or not they want to think that &quot;all third party software is prohibited&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is currently January, 2002.  EQWatcher has been available for over 4 months, and thousands of EQ players have downloaded it.  There have been no complaints.  EQHotkeys (for offline editing of hotkeys/socials) has been available on my website for a comparable amount of time.<br>
<br>
Editing eqclient.ini with notepad fits Steve Weiss' description of what they &quot;feel changes gameplay&quot;, and may result in termination of your account.<br>
<br>
If you think they're going to ban people for parsing log files and playing sounds, that's up to you.  I really dont think going on a crusade trying to tell people not to use third-party software just because of someone stupidity is really necessary.  I don't make a penny off EQWatcher and I don't intend to.  All I can say is that it's pretty popular and it makes me happy to be developing it.<br>
<br>
Edit: By the way, whoever was arguing about detecting programs.  Open up the Windows Task Manager (run TASKMAN or TASKMGR or hit CTRL+ALT+DEL depending on your windows version).  Microsoft is detecting all of the programs on your system when you do this!  Obviously, this information is not sent to Microsoft, and is used on your computer internally.  If they wanted to detect third party software they would simply disallow it using a similar method of detection, and not letting the game run if it is detected.  Sending the information back to the servers is what invades privacy.  If they wanted to detect notes.txt parsers, they would simply watch when you use /note, which the information from could be sent to the server (obviously increasing the load on the servers slightly).<br>
