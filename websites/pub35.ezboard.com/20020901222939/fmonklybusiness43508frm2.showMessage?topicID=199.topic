Don't send a tell to the first name on a /who druid list and expect them to find you or wait for you to find them.<br><br>2) Use their name.  If I'm sitting somewhere resting, chances are I'm busy in /tells or /gu, and if there are several people around it's really easy to ignore the /says.  Using a name is also just the polite thing to do.<br><br>3) Don't abbreviate.  The quickest way to get ignored is to utter the infamous "sow plz".  If you can't be bothered to spend the extra 5 seconds it takes to type out complete words, I can't be bothered to cast a spell.  <br><br>4) There is no step 4.  If you do the above 3 things you will be guaranteed a buff 99% of the time.  <br><br>I have *never* refused to buff someone that asked politely.  Conversely, my monk and paladin have never been turned down when I asked in a polite manner.  Chances are the druid will be so shocked to see a well-formed, polite request that you'll get a full buff package.   <p>--<BR><a href=http://www.alltel.net/~mr81645/Gold_Image/goldmundmap.htm>Goldmund Targa`Ri</a> ~ Wanderer of the 53rd Season<BR>Moro - 33rd Iksar Monk<BR>Jorah Mormont - 24th Human Paladin<BR>Ascension of the Damned ~ Quellious</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uxodai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xodai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/16/01 7:28:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> freeport faction</span><hr size=1> First of all.. great guide Anezka!!<br><br>Just wanted to add my 2cp on getting freeport faction.  I'm an Iksar Monk and I did this at about level 33.  Here's how I did it:<br><br>First I tried doing the Janum and Rebby quest with my 17 ranger, but I got bored really fast with all that running back and forth so I quit after getting about 40 whiskers.. I didn't bother with the note because I don't have 2 computers and accounts.  Doing this didn't seem to get me anywhere.  So then I killed Orcs at orc 1 in EC, where the most orcs pop.. lost of people tried to tell me WC was better, but it's not.  As I killed orcs I made sure to gather up as many deathfist slashed belts and orc pawn scalps as I could.  Then I got wolf form and turned in about 6 bags of belts to the militia captain... this hurt my north freeport faction but that's easy to get back...  and it got me dubious to the guards in West and East freeport.  I was still scowled at by the ashen order, so I killed more orcs until wolf form got me to high amiable.  Then I did the white headband quest about 60-80 times.  Pretty easy considering all the items for it can be bought of vendors or newbies in west freeport.  After that boom I'm looked upon warmly by the ashen order and the guards in North freeport are dubious so I can bank.  <br><br>Good luck fellow monkeys.<br><br>Xodai<br>Swiftail Monk of the 40th Kata<br>Sacred Legends - E'ci<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.sacredlegends.com">www.sacredlegends.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=anezka>Anezka</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www3.sympatico.ca/pratte1/Icone.bmp BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/29/01 9:40:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: freeport faction</span><hr size=1> I upgraded the guide...<br><br>I had made a mistake about the Currupted Qeynos Guards faction that the whisker quest gives.<br><br>The faction hit isn't important enough to be worth the effort, they are still scowling after over 200 turn ins. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubodikibadachi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BodiKibadachi</A> at: 2/19/02 6:55:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugrazzttakishhiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grazzt Takish Hiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/30/01 4:20:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Factions...</span><hr size=1> First off, great guide.

Enough plat<br>                      and you don't even have worry about bards anymore ( one of the few monks that<br>                      can rest in a Bard's guild with no trouble ).<br>                      Once done, don't leave freeport just yet.<br><br>                      There are a couple quests that you can do to get nonKoS to the Steel Warriors. One<br>                      is the DF Belt quest in the Warriors guild, and the other is the milk quest in WC.<br>                      Becafeful doing either of these, they will make you KoS to the Militia if done to<br>                      often.<br><br>                      The DF Belts will require that you have an invis ( I have a lvl23 bard on a second<br>                      account that assited with that ). Had the guild master two dfb's at a time to get<br>                      faction and small coin.<br><br>                      Milk quest will require Wolf form. you are naturally apprehensive to the guy ( sits<br>                      next to inn two but the lake next to the fisher man ). Wolkf form will shoot you to<br>                      warmly with him. Give him one milk at a time for faction  <br><br>                      Now, after either 95 or so milks or about 40 DF belts you will no longer be KoS to the<br>                      Steel Warriors. Warning: Make sure you turn in a few belts to the Militia too while<br>                      are you doing this to prevent yourself from being KoS to them ( note: this is only if<br>                      you are still dubious to the Militia ).<br><br>                      Once you get nonKoS to the Steel Warriors, you can run the gnoll fang quest with<br>                      no trouble ( besides the wandering CircleofThree NPCs in SQ ). Turning in the<br>                      Moonstones is a bit more complicated. There is a lvl 50+ druid that likes to hang out<br>                      on the docs and in the tavern you have to turn in stones into.<br>                      Make sure you have a friend ( or alt char ) that can invis your through the run from<br>                      the arena to the one tavern ( I forget the name of it .. sorry ).<br>                      This quest will start raising your Pally and Cleric faction. So far, I have gotten myself<br>                      to threatening with them ( turned in 82 teeth and the 82 moonstones - get one<br>                      stone per tooth turned in ).<br>                      Another way to raise your faction is to use sneak and a friend to hail on the loud<br>                      mouth lvl5 cleric guy that leaves Qeynos at night. He wonders into the newbie area<br>                      and giving him 2 bone chips or 2 gold will result in a faction adjustment and a free<br>                      heal. Note: cause he gives you a heal, he *will* turn to you ( if you are high enoug,<br>                      he won't agro ). When he turns, he will see you, and you can't complete the quest<br>                      unless you use sneak. This where a friend to hail him comes into play. Hailing him will<br>                      cause him to turn towards the one that'd hailing.<br><br>                      Anyway, this is so far all that I've figured out about Qeynos. I still hadn't figured out<br>                      a way to raise my CircleofThree faction, atleast a way for an Iksar to do it. I'm still<br>                      playing with that. The druid iin SQ, I have NO clue what faction he's on sadly. Not<br>                      on JaggedPineTreefolk like the other karana druids. Still investigating him.<br><br>                      Oh, enough gnolls, and you will be able to safely gate to the karana's w/out the<br>                      need for invis  <br><br>                      Thats is all for now.

(My big secret)<br><br>I would sugest keeping all the teeth when gnoll killing, then when you reach 303 zip on over to halas.<br><br>This next step is not for the weak willed monk.<br><br>Use a invis potion, run into halas, swim across, take right way at gate, keep going around till you see a opening that goes to the arena. Looking down at the arena you will see a female in silver armor. Jump down and stand behind her. Hit sneak.<br><br>Turn in 3 gnoll teeth per pile, 4 piles at a time. HURRY! when invis starts to wear off back up to the wall. Drink new potion. Turn in all 303 teeth.<br><br>303 teeth = 100 'quests' you are now non kos to the majority of halas, congrats, feel free to shout thank you karsh! Then take a screen shot and send it to me making my day  (seriously) <br><br>You are now in the .02% of people who became mostly non kos in halas.<br><br>This also has a side bonus of raising steel warriors!<br><br>The shaman wont like you, nor will the rogues. The rogues are in the bank.. no worries this can be fixed.<br><br>You can kill polar bears and turn in the white pelts to cindl in the fur shop, or do more teeth, goblin necklases or various other quests that the normal barbies do to raise shaman and merchant.<br><br>This part (when turning them in) is even harder then the last part.<br><br>For rogues, kill mammoths and buy mammoth hides from vendors. Get a lot. Do the old invis potion thing and run to the top of the bank, sneak, posistion self to be indiferent to the second rogue that is a bit ahead of you. This one is tricky. Turn in 4 mammoth hides at a time. <br><br>Make sure to turn sneak off and back on for it will not be actully on (even though its greyed out) after turning in all the hides and moving. You cant carry enough hides in one shot to become non kos. You will get a lot of black wolf armor, feel free to sell it, or twink a barb rogue with a sleek black look. (Be warned every looser in the world will think your twinked out in this stuff called raven scale and feel the need to call you names.. the armor is kinda crappy in reality) After a while you will be non kos to the bank rogues.<br><br>The first part should take care of the guys in FV as well, thats the only town I havent done so personally I do not know.<br><br>-<br><br>I noticed you mentioned your only interested in doing the good aligned towns. Its mostly easy to get into Erudin by killing Elial Broks at the dock in Toxx. If you kill him 60 times, then take his 60 drops of 'bones' to Markus Jaevins by useing a invis potion and sneak you will end up being non kos to everybody in the place except the Qellous clerics. (You will be threatening)<br><br>You can then do the 'inert potion quest' which raises Coalition of Trade Folk Ill, Coalition of Tradefolk, Carson McCabe, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and The Freeport Militia.. if done the right way..(hits dont seem like much) make sure you do it with Slansin, not the original guy that is rarely there is a server is reset. If you can use the dude as a merchant, you do not want to do it (It will lower faction in Eurdin) If this happens make a mule enchanter (I think thats the same class as the guy who gives the quest) turn in your newbie note to get amible faction (so you can do the quest) and do it. This will make the merchant faction lowering guy poof and next time will be the guy you want to raise the non Erudin related factions.<br><br>Two things to note.. Paineel will REALLY hate you after killing Elial Brooks.. we start off kos anyway.. and our monk epic deals with Erudin.. and paineel is evil.. There is a possiblty of killing XXX? kolbolds or something in the warrens to get non kos to the guards of both citys, but you wont be able to go far at all. (Prob like 6000 to get non kos to paineel after killing brooks) The second thing.. Brooks is on a 6 min timer, it takes a long time for 60 kills. AND a guard patrolls along there, you gota kill brooks fast and get out of the way! You can stand on the very end of the dock to avoid the guard. <br><br>-<br><br>For the quests I mentioned zip over to allakhazam's for all you need (you prob already know that) everquest.allakhazam.com/<br><br>Okay one last thing.. the clerics in qeynos, its always a accomplisment to get non kos to the clerics in any city. You can feed Lashum Novine 2 gold, like the bards for faction hits. You will lower the blood sabers, so you cant go down under the city after this. Takes 1200 gold AKA 600 turn in.. yeah takes freeking forever! You will need to sneak and move each time to his side so your indiferent. (He will attack if your lower level, but at our level he will not - green)<br><br>Um.. that lil turd trumpy.. he likes honey mead.. if you give him 4 (I think) he will raise a number of factions, one is corupt.. however it will lower merchants and good guards. But! look at what they are already.. ally? amnible? Who cares if they balance out to indiferent as long as you get non kos to thoes mean evil guards.<br><br>If you are able to do monk quests, doing the lowest level one, from store bought material, is a super quick way to get faction up. You can get the wolf form so your able to do the quest, then do it like 50-80 times.. when you loose the wolf you will still be at amnible or so. Also raises guard faction which you might of lowered on getting up their oposing faction through faster then normal means. <br><br>Nice guide I refer people to it all the time, even got a social so I dont mispell it.  <br><br>I probably missed a lot.. if you have any questions or comments by all means let me know, you were always one of my heros along my faction adventures =)<br><br>Here is a pic of my in halas, on the way out after the first teeth part.

(Also have the guards that want to kill you in the begining)  <br><br>I found killing bandits was way more boring then gnolls in bb, because in bb I could derail trains, pass out items to lowbies (from splitpaws) and get the gnoll skin and pelts.. on bandits its you... on a hill.. alone.. for 3-4 days... watching: my comrads will avenge my death.. and Its time to die Karsh!.. blech  <br><br>Good Luck! <p>Karsh, Keidric, Solex - Tarew Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uzilarik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zilarik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(6/17/01 12:31:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Factions...</span><hr size=1> Just thought you'd like to know, there is also an erudite necromancer at one of the goblin camps in Lavastorm.

Had to feign with less two bubbles left at level 20 when I first discovered them, but shouldn't be a problem at higher levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/umsike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Msike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/29/01 9:44:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://Lizardmonkid.tripod.com/msike2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Factions...</span><hr size=1> Hi Anezka,<br>Got a question for ya.
