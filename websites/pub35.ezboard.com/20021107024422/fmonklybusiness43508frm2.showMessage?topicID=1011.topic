Initially discovered the benefits of Paludal on a different toon - a rogue, started hunting there alternating between killing the single mushroom spawn near the SH zone line ( although at 17 with moderately poor equipment, if a shroom elder pops, it can pose problems ) and the single mushroom spawn at the base of the ramp that leads up into the caverns from the bandit camp. between waiting for these spawns to pop, even with the rogue it was possible to bw ( if below 1/2 health after fighting both ) and heal almost to full by sitting around. near the end of 17 when skills where getting maxed for that current cap, and damage was being dealt quicker, I decided to find a better place to solo inside the zone.<br>
<br>
<br>
After a bit of exploring, and a couple deaths, I found a prime spot to solo and gain exp fairly quickly with relatively small down time.<br>
<br>
There is a spot in the mines, where a group of short and stout miners are stationed, in this spot there are 3 muck digger / sedement delver type spawns, two static,one behind a wall of rock at the end of the tunnel, and the other positioned in front of a outcropping of stalagmites ( or was it stalagtites? ) one wandering ( the wandering one is easy to time however )<br>
And a shroom, usually spawning as either a normal Sensate Reshi, or as a mature sensate reshi. The diggers / delvers are social, but the two static spawns are far enough apart to fight w/o worrying about adds, the wanderer seems to come through about once every minute and a half, and stops for a few seconds at the end of the tunnel to the side of the rock wall mentioned above before leaving again. Its pretty much no challenge to clear the diggers / delvers, I usually cleared the one behind the wall, then waited for the wander to show up, dragged him behind the wall, then got the one near the stalagtites / stalagmites, if mend was up i'd use it primarily just for skill ups, seeing as I only remember one time being bellow 50% health ( and that was due to also having a pain in the tail disease based dot that I neglected and let eat away at me while i practiced skills ) I solo'd easy here from 17 - 20, but at 20 the normal sensate's go green and you'll get maybe 1 out of every 5 of the diggers / delvers coming up green as well. ( although I did have a run of 18 of them that where dblue back to back )<br>

The only real problem with this location is getting there, and getting back. I HIGHLY suggest that if you have the money to do so, buy a cloudy potion (invis) or 2 ( for the trip back ) they run about 11pp a piece, at 55cha and kindly faction w/ the sh merchants, until about 19 or so when you can start facing down the occasional mob you didnt mean to get the attention of, and or be able to rely more on FD to get out of the more difficult situations. <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Getting there - (this doesnt look like kansas anymore Mr. Miagi)</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
To get to the miners, you'll need to get to the land bridge that spans the chasm at the top of the ramp that leads up from the bandit camp outside of sh. Coming from sh, run out till you can see the bandit camp ( odd lookin tent structures if you've never been here ) and take a right and run along the wall of the cave as high up as possible. the wall will eventually start turning left, this is where it meets the ramp. Now you can either run up the ramp itself, which may lead to an encounter w/ a patog that wanders up and down the ramp, OR you can continue along the wall, still as high as you can go until it takes an abrupt right, this is where the chasm starts, and falling off the ledge leads to a fairly large drop into water, which takes a while to get out of if you don't know the area. Take the right, still following the zone wall as high as you can and keep an eye to your left, you'll see a narrow bridge crossing the gap, there will be some stalagmites ( or.. was it stalagtites? ) sticking up from the ground near the base of the bridge,take a look up and down the walkway quick and look for a wandering patog, it sometimes passes through here and will agro you if your at ground level.drop down the wall until your to the left of the spikes, facing the bridge, there will be a patog a little ways further to your right but from here you should not agro it. check quick again for the wanderer then run the short distance to the base of the bridge, sticking to the left side of it till about half way, then switch so that your on the right of the bridge as far as you can go, on the other side there will be a patog facing the bridge that will agro if you stay to the left side. once your across the bridge hug the edge of the chasm until your out of view of the patog, then move to the inside of the path and up the wall, you can cut behind another static patog from here as long as you stay as high as you can get. keep following the zone wall until you see an opening, there will be a set of spikes coming out of the ground with a patog standing in front of them but facing away from you. you can creep behind this patog w/o using sneak, but I suggest using sneak cause murpheys law of eq dictates that once someone says it can be done, it will be impossible for anyone else to do it :P<br>

<br>
here's where the first problem arises - there will be a patog facing the other side of the passageway your on, and no way to get behind it, this is where the invis potion comes in VERY handy if you can buy one. From here till the cross section that leads you to the miners the area will be VERY patog heavy, with 8 or 9 with almost no way of getting around them, not counting wanderers. Anyways, this tunnel will eventually lead to a split, one going left, one going right. Go LEFT, you should see the miners in a matter of seconds, and your home! if you where not able to pick up a invis potion and have picked up a couple patogs on your way through FD, if it doesnt work, FD again, and again as needed,( and hope you don't get hit with spreading crud :/ ) cause even if you end up with only thirteen hp  before they decide your through you will not have to worry about any more kos mobs, and once they walk off, you can bind wound at will, mend, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   The Good </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
The exp, good exp, really quite good exp, worth 'The Bad' in my opinion, especially in peak hours in the cavern where getting a group is impossible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   The Bad </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
No money from these mobs, the trip is hectic, the only thing really worthwhile that drops is either the sensate reshi lenses, which can be sold to tinkerers, ( used for the geerlok jewel craft thingy ) and the occassional piece of relitively light weight armor equipable my monks that the shrooms can drop ( but if your hurting that bad for gear I don't suggest making this trip )<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> The Ugly </u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Patog Phlarg Fiends - an issue if caught unprepaired, and as has been previously stated in other threads, the spreading crud disease based dot they can hit you with is exceptionally annoying, lasting about 4 hours, and if FD'd for an extended period of time, like waiting on mend to pop, it WILL out-damage an iksars natural regen. they don't run when low on hp.<br>
<br>
Shrooms - pretty whimpy, elders can double for about 48 damage or so, but hit fairly slow and shouldnt be too much of a problem once you hit 18. I kill em even now for the hell of it, they sound cool when your owning them :P these dont run either<br>
<br>
Delvers / Diggers - Also fairly whimpy, max hit 36 or so? can take a conciderable ammount of beating but should not be an issue. Also do not run when low on hp.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>The Merchant list -</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You can buy the potions from a vendor by the entrance to the bazaar in shadow haven, if your coming from the bazaar head up the flight of stairs at the end of the little courtyard, once at the top of the first flight take an immediate left, then follow the ledge and take a right till you see the door to your right, there will be two merchants here, one selling potions etc, the other selling pottery sketches. Bandages, water and food can be purchased from a halfling female vendor next to the bank at the nexus zone in. I suggest taking quite a few band aids with you , as it will prevent you from having to make the trip back for as long as possible.<br>
If your faction is low, and now that sateal is MIA ( the inbetween npc for the Trade Commissioner quest that gets ya those big hits w/ the sh merchs. ) Check Allakhazam for a relitively painless faction quest that can be done between sh and the bazaar ( hits for both turn ins i might add! )<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>The Bandits - ( Infiltrating the Rebel Bases, Han 'Solo' style )</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
General note : from what i've been able to work out its almost impossible to split the recondites, and getting agro usually means between 2 and 6 or more mobs at a time, however, you can work around this if your careful.<br>
<br>
Camp 1, Shadowhaven side -<br>
<br>
Hard camp to work with soloing, during peak hours? forget it, I've seen THREE groups trying to split this camp, it just doesnt work.<br>
<br>
Yelloweyes - Probably the easiest mob to get ahold of solo to own, can be a difficult fight if it gets its screech off enough times, can drop a collar w/ 3str 2wis,(worthless) Can also drop perfect owl bear pelts, needed for the rallic pack. when fighting it would probably be a good idea to pull back a ways into the tunnel from Sh, it runs at about a quarter life left and heads for the middle of the camp. usually even con at 20, blue at 25.<br>
<br>
Spawn near camp fire at the two tents to the left side of the camp - A single recondite pops here, if your standing in the middle of the camp, facing the two tents you can see a indentation in the ground, if you creep up this indentation torwards the fire, stopping about every 5 feet for a couple seconds you can solo pull this mob, just take it back to the middle and stomp away.<br>
<br>
Spawn near the other camp fire ( between the two tents to the right of the sh tunnel ) So far working with this pull i've always ended up getting two mobs at once, but depending on how you approach the camp you can usually decide which two. ( i usually work with one db one lb if i can, or if all three mobs are dblue, i go for the one not wielding a 2hs, or not dual wielding daggers ) if you approach the camp fire from closer to the tent near the sh tunnel, you will agro the recondite at the fire, and the one mob standing at the base of the stairs that go into the tent closest to the tunnel. if you approach from the side closer to the tent near the ramp, you'll get the one recondite at the base of those stairs, and the camp fire spawn. once again pull to the middle of the camp and stomp at will.<br>
<br>
Single spawn, wanderer - along the waters edge near the two tents to the left of the SH tunnel.<br>
<br>
this ones easy, stand near the waters edge, wait for it to come near enough to you to agro.<br>
<br>
Single spawn, small peninsula - <br>
<br>
also very easy, run out, stomp. all done.<br>
<br>
Single spawn, near the water, along the left cave wall kind of far away from the camp. <br>
<br>
if your standing in the opening to the sh tunnel, facing the camp, follow the left zone wall back behind the two tents, and keep heading out that way, eventually you'll run across a single spawn a ways in, This spawn however CAN be a named, lvl 24,Human Female in Chainmail, who can triple for high 40's if equiped with a dagger ( drops Ancient Combine dagger, pos stabber for a now pos quest, the nerfed SoEE, once the LSoEE quest ) so you may want to creep until you can identify the mob.<br>
<br>
Camp 2, Deep caves.<br>
<br>
to get here, follow the directions above to get to the Single spawn. but keep going, if you follow the zone wall it will eventually lead you to a ramp that leads up to the second camp  ( note : you will have to do a couple seconds of non-dangerous swimming )<br>
<br>
Ramp spawn - A recondite will spawn at the top of the ramp, walk down the ramp, and then walk back up, easy meat. wait a bit of a ways down the ramp, let it come to you. stomp. engaging combat down further on the ramp will help prevent getting multiple adds from the tent closest to the ramp.<br>
<br>
Ledge spawn 1 -<br>
<br>
This one is a bit tricky. if you follow the cave wall behind the tents straight ahead from the ramps, you'll come to a ledge w/ 4 recondites on it. One of the recondites will be standing directly below you and will agro as you get close, pull it back a ways and beat it down, when it starts to run FD immediately. as it will walk through one of the tents and could cause you serious problems. this doesnt always work however and sometimes you will still gain agro, and will have to FD again. The nice thing is that the mob will magicly reapear at its spawn point, almost dead, waiting for you to drop down out of the sky and finish off its pathetic back stabbing life. usually once you get close to its spawn point it will start to try to walk away again, but its got a good 5 seconds before it re-draws the attention of its friends, more then enough time to finish it and FD to make sure the coast is clear.<br>
<br>
Ledge spawn 2 -<br>
<br>
Across from the first ledge spawn, you should see another recondite standing near the cave wall near the front of the ledge, this one can be taken down using pretty much the same tactics as listed above, run past it up onto the zone wall that leads behind the tent, beat it down, when it runs, FD, if its friends agro anyways, FD again, mob repops at it spawn point, still weakened, drop out of the sky, firey vengance, boom, exp.<br>
<br>
Wanderer 2 - Two ways to get to this spawn, by either cutting around behind the tents until you get back to the edge of the chasm, or by walking along the edge of the chasm ( keeping it to your right ) till you get to where the cave narrows down, there should be one spawn here that wanders from near the tent closest to the narrow part, out along the path away from the camp, I suggest jumping it as far from the camp as possible so when it tries to run you can have it down before it gets back to camp.<br>
<br>
My cycle at the 2nd camp was as follows -<br>
<br>
kill the one on the ramp leading up from the water, cut behind the tent, kill the first ledge spawn, I would usually have to bw after this since there would be a period of about 2 seconds where i'd be getting beat on by 4+ mobs, use mend if it was up, if not, move on to the second spawn, bw again after it was dead, kill the last wanderer, walk back to the camp a ways, jump off the chasm into the water below, swim across headed right slightly, sit at the base of the ramp, heal up until the cycle respawned and go back through again.<br>
<br>
I don't suggest doing this portion until 23 - 24 unless you've got good gear, I myself am equiped formans skullcap (2.9pnds! holy crap! ) fighting baton, CoT, Robe of living fungus, wu's pants, sleeves, 1 bracer, mantle. bracer of erlossi, vah sihr claw earring, orc fang earring, wolf fur slippers ( don't ask :/ ) 7agi/dex neck, 3agi/dex rings, curscale gloves ( heh ) and a FBSS, ( borrowed from my rogue until much.. much.. further notice ) my FD skill isnt maxed, neither is my mend unfortunately. bw is at 122 tho heh( working on em tho, always... working.. on em. ) and I didnt really have an issue soloing the Recondites. <br>
<br>
one tip of advice - even if they're using a 2h weapon ( which rogues shouldnt be able to do anyways :/ ) or a slashing weapon, or a blunt weapon, these mobs can and will backstab you as soon as you turn around! even if they don't have a weapon! gawddamn thats a sharp finger! If your in a dire predicament, and it seems like your gonna die, i.e. FD failed and you've only got 10% hp left, back against a wall and try to FD again, cause if you turn your back, i guarantee your toast. I hope this helps anyone who's been in paludal tryin to figure out what to do when there's 48 people in zone and 12 of em are yellin &quot;LFG!&quot; even though everything down to the large wetfangs are camped. ( which i might add, at 16 - 17, can be decient exp for a strong swimmer :P )<br>

The one that sits at the fire can be split by aggroing (you will get 2) then fd and aggro range reaggro exactly when the far bandit resets. It takes some timing but the sitting bandit will sit again when you fd, spreading em out just far enough for you to peal it off.<br>
The far bandit cannot reaggro if you time the tag just as it resets.<br>
<br>
You can also use the tents flaps to slow down the closest bandit using a fd split similar to above. Use ranged pulling if you can afford the stars. While most groups can handle 2 or even 3 bandits easily, its mana inefficient. If you can split them and spred them out for single pulls, your group can work all the bandits and maybe some shrooms too = more xp.<br>
<br>
Also, some peeps respect this dedication to our trade at this level. You may find yourself recruiting other classes to reroll as monks =) <br>
