(a guide in the making)</span><hr size=1> Which hand for which weapon?<br><br>I enjoy reading the Monkly-Business forums. People often come and inquire which weapons they should use for which hand. I thought I'd get some feedback on this post and perhaps we can make it into a guild for the main page. Please write responses if anything seems off, confusing, or just plain wrong on my part. My goal is to make a method for people to look at two weapons and quickly pick where to place them (even for people just twinking who aren't about to download anything).<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>This guide has nothing to do with 2h weapons, or even 1h + shield. It is simply all about dual wielding.<br><br>There are many factors that help you settle on a weapon choice, we're going to have to omit a couple of them for simplicity's sake but I'll try and list them all briefly.<br><br> - RATIO<br>This is the most important factor of any particular weapon. The ratio is figured by dividing the weapon's damage by the weapon's delay (DMG/DLY). The primary reason people ask questions about what to wield is that as you level up, you get bonuses which will cause any weapon you wield to have a stronger ratio.<br><br> - BONUSES<br>Melee classes start to deal more damage with their primary weapon at level 28 according to this formula (LVL-25)/3. Values are truncated. There are other guides to describe how much you get, and when. It is VERY important to note that this does not just 'add on' to your weapon's ATK. The bonus works like this: When you hit something, you deal (your bonus) more damage on every hit you make. So if you have a bonus of 4, your primary hand is not capable of dealing less than 5 damage per hit.<br><br> - WEIGHT<br>If your stamina isn't 100+, you might care more about your weapon's weight. If you're a monk, you might really care about weight as well. I'm not going to cover this and break it down at this time.<br><br> - COST/PRICE<br>Some weapons are exceedingly rare. Some are almost a rite of passage. In everything I post, while I will use examples with names, everything applies to the stats of a weapon. A 9/18 weapon could drop from a dragon or be made by a blacksmith, it's origin isn't that important for this guide.<br><br> - LOOKS<br>Your mileage is going to vary. Everything is subject to your opinion and what makes you have fun; that's all I have to say about that.<br><br> - DELAY<br>Low delays help create taunt. Low delays make you be shredded on damage shields. Low delays make you get riposted more often. I'm writing this from an offense only point of view, so those are seperate considerations for you to think about situationally.<br><br> - PROCS<br>Special abilities of weapons happen. They can't be relied on. They will go off sometimes, and dex helps them go off. If you can accurately gauge how often they go off for you, you can figure out how this modifies your DAM.<br><br> - SKILLS<br>Some skill levels cap higher than others at various levels. For example, at level 55, a monk's HTH skill caps lower than his 1h blunt skill. I do not know the affect this has on his chance to score a hit, or damage table difference. It should also be noted that your dual wield will not always happen. A percentage will be removed from the offhand's damage because of having to make this skillcheck. Since it's just a percentage of any off hand's damage, your dual wield skill will not slant the damage based on delay.<br><br><br>In an effort to make evaluating your weapons simple, we're going to need a quick way to figure out the functional DAM/DLY of your weapon.<br><br><br>The most common hit you score on a mob (modal) is figured like this: (2 X DAM)+1<br><br>If you are swinging a Jade Mace (9/18) , for example, your modal starts at 19.<br>If you are swinging a Knuckle Duster (14/28) , for example, your modal starts at 29.<br><br>If you were level 28, you would deal +1 damage every time you whacked something with your main hand. Suddenly, your modal has gone up just because you hit level 28.<br><br>Now you could also find a weapon with a slightly better ratio that would simulate you being level 28 already. What would this weapon's ratio be? Let's do some basic math:<br><br>(2 X DAM)+1 = 20<br><br>DAM must be equal to 9.5<br><br>So achieving level 28 has done the same thing as add 0.5 DAM to anything you wield in the primary hand. <br><br>You can quickly see by applying this to all of the levels with a bonus that when your primary damage bonus increases, you basically are tacking another 0.5 DAM to your main weapons!<br><br><br>So, if you are wondering which weapon to wield, just do this:<br>Look at the DAM/DLY of the weapons you're wondering about. Add 0.5 to the DAM rating of each weapon for each 3 levels above level 25 you are. Pick the one with the best ratio.<br><br>If you want to add in a weapon's proc, figure out how many hits, on average, it takes for you to proc. Then take the proc's damage and divide it by the number of hits it took. Then add half off that to your weapon's DAM rating.<br><br>Example:<br><br>I am level 37. My Wu Stick (8/17) procs for 83 damage. It takes me about 12 hits to get a proc on average. That means the damage does about 7 extra damage per hit. That means that the proc is adding about 3.5 to the damage so this is functioning like a 11.5/17 weapon. Plus my primary damage bonus is 4. So this weapon is basically working like a 13.5/17 weapon.<br><br><br>Example:<br><br>I'm level 40 and have a fighting baton (8/20) and a cane of the tranquil (11/25). Which goes in which hand for maximum damage?<br><br>Well, my primary hand damage bonus is 5. So the baton is really 10.5/20 and the cane is really 13.5/25 while in the primary hand. The baton's ratio is .525 and the cane's ratio is .540<br><br>The cane deals more damage in the primary hand.<br><br><br>Example:<br><br>I'm level 55 and have my epic (9/16), a Staff of Shielding (17/28)  and a Sceptre of Mastery (13/21). Which goes in which hand for maximum damage?<br><br>Primary hand bonus is 10.<br><br>Epic is 14/16 = 0.875 in main hand<br>Staff of Shielding is 22/28 = 0.786 in main hand<br>Sceptre of Mastery is 18/21 = 0.857 in main hand<br><br>Epic is 9/16 = 0.5625 in the off hand<br>Staff of Shielding is  17/28 = 0.607 in the off hand<br>Sceptre of Mastery is 13/21 = 0.619 in the off hand<br><br>So strictly in terms of damage dealing, CF/SoM is the choice to make.<br><br>Although the SoS has a nice HP/AC/MR proc so some views might not be limited to strictly damage dealing.<br><br>And maybe you want slightly less delay in the main hand so you don't out-taunt a warrior or get riposted on or damage shielded so often so you'd change to the Sceptre? The choice is yours to make.<br><br>Maybe since you're at 55, and your 1h blunt skill is higher than your hand to hand, you are scoring more hits without your fist being used? ATK's relation to DAM is a study for another day.<br><br>- Saalron<br><br>Thanks for insightful replies.<br><br>edit: must kill emote-icons <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A> at: 8/19/01 9:29:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uzass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/20/01 9:01:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Which weapon where? (a guide in the making)</span><hr size=1> one thing to note is that hth and 1hb skill do have the same max at lvl 60 (252), but do NOT have the same max at 50 (h2h maxes at 200 and 1hb maxes at 225).  So in the 50 to 60 range one must balance the extra atk from higher skill in 1hb vs the lower skill in h2h.  Against mobs who con even or higher lvl, I find the extra atk (at lvl 54 it is 30 atk difference) from 1hb makes me do more damage but against blue conning mobs my epic fists do more damage.  As I approach lvl 60, the difference between the two will diminish and I will be able to stick with one weapon set up. <p>Zass Afrass<br>54th lvl Lizzzzzzzzzzzard  Monkey</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ustogz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stogz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/23/01 10:47:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Which weapon where? (a guide in the making)</span><hr size=1> Well, as a monk who just passed lvl 50 and made lvl 51 I can tell you that you are slightly off on skill caps.  Before lvl 50 the HtH skill caps at 225 and the 1HB and 2HB skills cap at 240.  At some point between lvl 51 and 60 those caps on all 3 skills are raised to 252. <p><img SRC="http://polar.icestorm.com/forcecom/salamander.JPG" height=150 width=300 align=CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=483.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=483.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.threadControl?topicID=483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=483.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=483.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2>Guides and Tactics</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
