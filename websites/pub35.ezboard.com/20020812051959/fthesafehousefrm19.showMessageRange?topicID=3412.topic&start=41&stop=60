<br>
Do you not ignore the logic I present?<br>
<br>
Say for example if you have an Infiltrator that deals 25% more overall melee damage than a Shadowblade. Through the Left Axe improved Scaling, it now scales appropriately like that of an Infiltrator using a slash style.<br>
<br>
In this snapshot of combat without styles:<br>
<br>
Infiltrator deals 125 damage<br>
Shadowblade deals 100 damage<br>
<br>
<b>In this example, Infiltrators are 25% more damaging.</b><br>
<br>
In this snapshot of combat with styles:<br>
<br>
Infiltrator deals 125 + 75 damage (1 weapon's slash style)<br>
Shadowblade deals 100 + 75 damage (1 weapon's LA style)<br>
<br>
<b>In this example, Infiltrators are 14.3% more damaging.</b><br>
<br>
When it comes time for game balance, it is INCORRECT to correct the Shadowblade Left Axe deficiency in terms of what is calculated after styles are accounted for. If that were the case, then 14.3% would be added to the Shadowblade base damage, and in the patched scenario, Infiltrators will still deal 125 base damage, with Shadowblades 114.3 damage.<br>
<br>
It IS correct to analyze the base damage BEFORE styles are applied. The same holds true for Poisons. If you add another +80 damage to both scenarios:<br>
<br>
Infiltrator: 125 base + 75 style + 80 poison = 280<br>
Shadowblade: 100 base + 75 style + 80 poison = 255<br>
<br>
That would mean Infiltrators are only 10% more damaging. If that 10% were added to the base damage of the Shadowblade, it would only yield a 110 damage for the base.<br>
<br>
This is the entire point of keeping styles and poison damage away from balancing the base damage. If you don't break combat down to it's component parts, you are going to get a lot of incorrect numbers that will not balance things out for the better of Shadowblades. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 6/1/02 4:08:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 5:01:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> woot,never thought id see elaa arguing for shadowblades. but in all reality its pointless,appreciate it though.<br>

as you can see people base there perceptions on the entire class on the fact that we can use 2h weapons,and gasp 1 style out of ohhh 3 seperate spec lines,that requires us to invest an absurd ammount of skill points into it just to be effective.<br>

<br>
On average most 50 infiltrators have between +20-30 from items. While SBs have between +35-45.<br>
<br>
Just doing some rough estimation, SBs have more spec points with items that infiltrators get. I came up with around 2.8X for SBs vs 2.675 for infs.<br>
<br>
At 50 we have a total of 1 +CS item and that is +3. <br>
<br>
For envenom we have only 2 items up to 50 that is +envenom and both overlap each other considering the fact they both fit in the jewel slot.<br>
<br>
For stealth at 50, if we wear our epic armor we take a substantial hit in the +stealth items as none of our armor has +stealth to it. <br>
<br>
So what does this mean about 2.5X spec points we may get the higher styles in melee skills, but they are all horrible in pulling off (with the exception of dragonfang). <br>
<br>
We can spec higher in stealth, but there is no point because when it comes to math and Mythic 36=50.<br>

<br>
We'll just have to disagree.  I feel it would be incorrect to attempt to &quot;balance&quot; small facets of individual game mechanics, and not focus on the overall picture.  When you claim that one class does X% more damage, but you are only referring to a small subset of the sources of damage, you are doing a disservice to the players, the developers, and to mathmeticians everwhere.  You are effectively manipulating statistics in order to overstate your case.  And the folks who aren't aware of the subtlety will end up coming away from ther thread thinking &quot;Ella said Infiltrators do 15% more damage than SBs&quot; when you are really talking about what is, for all intents and puposes, a meaningless stastic: &quot;base damage&quot;.<br>

I see the problem here Elaa.<br>
<br>
#1 Your talking non style attack. When talking about BALANCING of 2 classes compared to each other you need to take into accound styled dmg which throws your numbers way off. After all we do actually use styles vs each other. Here is why it distorts your numbers:<br>
<br>
With CD/DW attackers style attacks are  ALWAYS performed with the mainhand weapon and the lefthand weapon is ALWAYS the offhand. Most lefthand weapons have less dmg per hit, unless you use the same weapon. Even still offhand weapon dmg doesnt compare to style attacks of the mainhand in either accuracy or dmg. Also the speed at which you attack will ALWAYS be that of the mainhand weapon. The 17% is from actual tests as I said in my post above. Your numbers are based on calculations which unfortunately have no bearing on real gameplay cause they dont use styles, as we all do in combat. Sbs do not stand up to infs atm and this needs to be fixed. However, balancing a class based on these numbers is a mistake.   <br>
<br>
If you want to balance a class vs another your have to balance them based on performance and tests, not by calculations. <br>

<br>
IF you do that, you get the results that I responded with earlier, scroll up (I'm getting tired of explaining things again). Take a look at the combat snapshots above. You can't change base damage based on the overall, because base damage only accounts for a certain percentage of combat. Thus when you compare how much it actually needs to increase with respect to itself, it is greater than the after style comparisonl.<br>
<br>
Maybe getting back to the topic is more important, is there anything inherently wrong with giving Shadowblades (or any Left Axe users) an increase in base damage to match the benefit of DW/CD? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 6/1/02 11:48:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrendelblackhammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brendel Blackhammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 11:53:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re.</span><hr size=1> ddbubois are you suggesting that Elaa is lying with your add in of &quot;How to lie with statistics&quot;?<br>

<br>
Base damage is hardly meaning less, it is the point where you should begin to try to asses the differnces in the workings of LA &amp; CD/CW. Base damage is at the core of differences between the these two spec lines, not envenom, nor style damage. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Infiltrator deals 125 damage<br>
Shadowblade deals 100 damage<br>
In this example, Infiltrators are 25% more damaging.<br>
<br>
Infiltrator deals 125 + 75 damage (1 weapon's slash style)<br>
Shadowblade deals 100 + 75 damage (1 weapon's LA style)<br>
In this example, Infiltrators are 14.3% more damaging.<br>
<br>
Infiltrator: 125 base + 75 style + 80 poison = 280<br>
Shadowblade: 100 base + 75 style + 80 poison = 255<br>
That would mean Infiltrators are only 10% more damaging. <br>
&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
This is a good example of why you want to use base damage. As you include varibles that in the equation that are independent of base damage, your end result is a trend that begins to narrow the differnece between the two values. So if we look at the end result with base+style+poison we end up with a value that does not correctly demonstrate the mathmatical difference between the two spec lines. If we would present this we would think the delta between the two styles is 10% which be a gross error from the actual difference.<br>
<br>
I say again style damage, and poison damage are completely independent of fundamental differences of LA &amp; CD/DW, therefore you must address style and poison damage seperately.<br>

Ok, lets just go by your logic.<br>
<br>
Ok, we'll add style damage to the mix.<br>
<br>
<br>
Assume base damage of 15% difference.<br>
Inf base damage 115<br>
SB base damage 100<br>
<br>
Add styles.  For standard sake, we'll say a non-reactionary style, so (according to mythic), the same adjustment is given.<br>
<br>
This comment....<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;end result is a trend that begins to narrow the differnece between the two values<br>
<br>
Exactly.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Implies that you seem to think that enhancing base damage by the percentage found AFTER style damage is included in the percent difference would fix the disparity.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's untrue.<br>
<br>
<br>
If that's not what you are saying, SAY what you are saying.<br>
<br>
These little &quot;i know better then you&quot; cryptic blurbs aren't helping anyone.<br>
<br>
SoD<br>
<br>
For arguments sake, we'll say +100.<br>
Inf damage 215<br>
SB damage 200<br>
<br>
This is now a 7.5% damage reduction.<br>
<br>
Now.  Fix it to make it even!<br>
<br>
Do you<br>
a) increase sb style damage by 7.5%?<br>
or <br>
b) increase sb base damage by 15%?<br>
<br>
If you increase style damage by 7.5%, you are not really fixing the problem.  Toe to toe.  No styles.  Fighting each other, an infiltrator and a shadowblade should be about even.  Then, when you add style damage, which is (again, according to mythic) a broad-over-all-realms adjustment based on...<br>
<br>
a) if the style is reactionary or not<br>
b) the level of the style<br>
c) the level of the player using the style<br>
d) whether it is at the end of a chain or not<br>
<br>
The damage will then be equal, both in BASE AND STYLE damage.<br>

<br>
The answer to both would be &quot;YES&quot; because the to two classes are near identical. We can reach that conclusion by way of reduction.<br>
<br>
If we run down the list of things that compose the differences between the two classes we see that they can be identical in terms of starting stats, race, slashing damage, armor type, &amp; critical strike line.<br>
<br>
Therefore the differences is in following<br>
1) Thrust/Slash damage vs Slash/Slash damage<br>
2) 2.2 spec points vs 2.5 spec points<br>
3) The mechanics of LA vs CD/DW<br>
4) The use of 2handed weapons <br>
5) 5% increase in hitpoints<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> So if you want to balance the two classes obviously you have to balance #3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Now to take a tangent here we still have 4 other items to address if we want to &quot;fully balance&quot;. Starting with the bottom.<br>
5) The 5% increase in hitpoints really serves no purpose. Melee combat is dealth out in the hundreds of points of damage over a 10 to 20 second period of time. 50 hitpoints is therefore a negligble factor of the class. It is also an area that cannot really be increased without upsetting other classes.<br>
4) 2hand weapons is a realm specific trait, but their use is more of a liablity with the exeption of a few situations due to high delay (and also count the loss one-shotting these weapons factor in even less)<br>
2) 2.2 spec vs 2.5 or the lack of 453 extra spec points to help round out your character. <br>
1) The choice between slash and thrust damage vs the slash only damage the is forced upon midgard<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> My suggestion based on all the above would be to<br>
1a) Add the hammer spec line to shadowblades<br>
1b) Add an additional respec line to accomidate the hammer spec<br>
2) Bring Left Axe on par in terms of damage with CD/DW<br>
3) Give shadowblades an addtional 0.2 to 0.3 spec points depending on how we weight the addtion of the 5% hitpoints and the limited use of 2-handed weapons.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
I don't think I implied that at all.  What I am saying, and have said, that comparing some small facet of the classes is less worthwhile than comparing their overall damage output, and the other factors of the class.  I also feel pretty strongly people shouldn't refer to base damage as &quot;Overall damage output&quot;, because that's just flat-out misleading.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  So if you want to balance the two classes obviously you have to balance #3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That's not obvious to me.  You could easily balance the classes by adding some other difference #6, or improving the margin of favor for SBs in 1, 2, 4 or 5.  Which you amusingly continue on to suggest later in your post.<br>
<br>
I don't want to get dragged in over my head.  To be honest, I haven't the slightest idea how balanced infiltrators are versus SBs or NSs.  The reason I jumped into this thread was the references to increases in offhand swings have a linear correlation to &quot;Overall damage output&quot;, and the anal-retentive side of me couldn't let it slide.  Sorry to have stirred up such a frenzy on this issue, it's really not worth it.<br>

<br>
What ddubois said about 37.5% chance offhand weapon used does not equal 37.5% *overall* added damage is a valid point.<br>
<br>
Suppose in an extreme case, some stupid nightshade was holding a piece of paper in his offhand which does 0 (zero) damage... It's easy to see that 1 weapon equals 2 weapons here and therefore the effective damage output is not increased by 37.5%<br>
<br>
The point is: there is a spectrum of combinations of main-hand weapon used and offhand weapon used and you have to find out the distribution of players out there for each specific combination in order to find out the real expected added damage given that a generic player has 37.5% chance to swing his offhand weapon.<br>
<br>
Suppose it is the case that all rogues use 2 identical weapons (and I believe that is the majority class), then your conclusion would hold for exactly 37.5% overall damaged added. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/u13thmonkey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>13thMonkey</A> at: 6/2/02 12:27:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwoopya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woopya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/2/02 4:54:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /r</span><hr size=1> /reply Elaa<br>

Sorry it took me long to reply, I was away for a couple days.<br>
<br>
Actually I am very glad I delved into your numbers and calculations because the more I see your numbers the more problems arise. <br>
<br>
For the LAST time, TEST TEST TEST! PLZ DO NOT CALCULATE. You so called &quot;snapshots&quot; are not actual snapshots they are calculations. Here is yet another reason your calculator lies:<br>
<br>
You assume base dmg + style bonus = total damage. This is what you claim in your snapshots. This is ONLY true for 1 attack and not at all true for the entire fight. Base dmg for cd/dw users IS greatly effected by the haste cap at high levels. On the other hand, dw/cd users style attacks ALWAYS attack at the speed of the mainhand weapon. So there is a potential HUGE variation in the speed between style attacks and non style attacks(base dmg).   So your calculations hold true for 1 attack, but do NOT include any effects of the speed of attacks, and are therefor way off when forcasted out over time.   <br>
<br>
BTW why would this be off topic? The fixes to sbs in your original post are based on your numbers if im not mistaken. I am pointing out mistakes you have made, like assuming 37.5% offhand swing rate = 37.5% more dmg, like assuming base dmg +style bonus dmg = total dmg for an entire fight, like the complete ommision of the effects of the haste cap(only greatly effects cd/dw users) etc, etc, etc...How is challenging the numbers you draw your conclusions from off topic? <br>
<br>
YES inf's do more dmg than SBs. YES SBs (and NS) need to be braught in line. However, your numbers are wrong and balancing them according to calculations that are a)not tested and b)not correct will only lead to another type of imbalance. <br>
