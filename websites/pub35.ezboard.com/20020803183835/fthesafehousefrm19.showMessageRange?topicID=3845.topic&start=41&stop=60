I see a few posters about he seem to think that this is a wonderful change and who gives a damn if it hurts someone else. Thats pretty damn self centered &amp; shallow if you ask me. <br>
<br>
I have been in full agreement that nightshades need something else to help them, other then the tools Mythic has given them. I also think that the past couple of nerfs to the shadowblade class was a bit overboard and we are needing some help to. So are we going to help one class by stabbing another in the back?<br>
<br>
So the result is we now get to target Hero's &amp; champions? Last time I recalled warriors and thanes have troubles with these two classes, so I am expect to deal with them with less hitpoints, less armor, and less defensive capacity. That is clearly not a logical conclusion.<br>
<br>
And lets look at what it costs shadowblades for these new targets. We will now see the weakest race from the magical realm now meleeing down one of the strongest races from the melee realm. That in it self should point out something is wrong with this concept.<br>
<br>
To put a little humorous spin on the concept, I was not aware that armor made from a cows butt could be so different. But according to mythic we have three different kinds of leather. We have leather from a Nordic Cows Ass, leather from a Albion Cows Ass, and leather from a Magical Cows Ass....and it makes chocolate milk too! <br>
<br>
Who would have known? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrendelblackhammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brendel Blackhammer</A> at: 7/31/02 8:56:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uphisig67.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PhiSig67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 10:27:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.52F Pendragon Patch, Armor Changes Included:</span><hr size=1> I have but 1 thing to say.<br>
<br>
<br>
If this patch hits in current form and the Mid SBs can no longer protect our healers and chain wearers from Infs and NS<br>
and our chain wearing tanks start screaming their heads off after getting ganked by stealthers left and right...who do you all think is getting slugged with the nerf bat next?<br>
<br>
If we were smart about this we would work out something a little more balanced.<br>
<br>
Infs need no bonuses of anykind...most consider them overpowered as is...just leave em alone.<br>
<br>
SBs...well I'd like a little of the bite put back into LA but I'll settle for not getting nerfed into oblivion.<br>
<br>
NS do need a boost and I believe they should be granted one.  But the recent armor tables are worse than before.<br>
<br>
Midguard is supposedly the big melee realm but we seem to have taken it on the chin this patch....funny how this was supposed to be the patch to fix melee. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uphisig67.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PhiSig67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 10:33:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.52F Pendragon Patch, Armor Changes Included:</span><hr size=1> One other little note...someone please explain to me while in addition to camoflauge with are giving rangers and scounts (other 2 SB targets) slash resistance and netruality.

Regardless of the Assassin vs Assassin changes please try to use some common sense.  Yes, you're not going to be able to protect your &quot;healers and chain wearers&quot; from infs and NS's quite as well but you'll probably be busy killing scale wearers now anyway.  Either assassins can kill healers and tanks or they can't.  Which one is it?  You can't complain about not being able to take on heros and bards even with bonuses and then talk about infs and NS owning your &quot;healers and chain wearers&quot; in the same paragraph.

<br>
Are you honestly asking us to stand by you so that we can continue to be slaughtered in ass vs ass?? <br>
<br>
This IS a good change. You have MORE targets.<br>
<br>
Assassin vs Assassin field is much more EQUAL now.<br>
<br>
I doubt Mythics vision when creating a shadowblade was "the assassin who rapes all the others".<br>
<br>
I cant find anywhere in my manual or on the internet that says "Nightshade-a fun class but you will get raped by Sbs and Infs".<br>
<br>
I am for ANYTHING that helps the shade community-yep call it what you will. I am a first day dedicated 50 nightshade. I (and every other old timer shade) have been through more BS than you can fathom.

<br>
Please understand things a little better.  PRE PATCH Infils tear apart our chain wearers (warriors/healers).  FYI healers are a specific class.  The composer was not referring to cross-realm healers.  Dragon fang is lethal against tanks.<br>
<br>
4 Classes are vulnerable to SB's.  Heros- yeah right- bullwinkle form PLUS they 2 hit me.  Champions, tanks with debufs and more HPs?, Druids- probably take em (do they have insta mez?), and Wardens (PBT makes them hard).<br>
Something got left out here.... WAIT, there is another realm... Albion.  Musta left them out....<br>
<br>
As for POST PATCH look at nightshade (pierce) vs Mid Tank (slash)<br>
<br>
Nightshade leather is resistant to slash.  Mid Tank is vulnerable to pierce.  Add the small evade stun from the Hib Pierce line, and they will be doing very well against tanks- both Alb and Mid. <br>
<br>
In summary YES you are the only one who thinks this is silly because assassins was refering to pre patch Infils (not Cross realm assasins) with thrust and D'Fang against MIDGARD HEALERS (not cross realm healers) and Midgard tanks (not cross realm tanks).  <br>
<br>
ON TOP OF THAT  the Hib classes we go against will be able to spec slash (for the most part) and heavy tank with heavy hitpoints against light assassin with light hitpoints will both be vulnerable to each other. The best we could hope for is that a HIB tank specs pierce.  With them going crush we are just neutral.   <p>Pitz

<br>
Nightshades are not half as bad as some people try to make them out to be.  They do quite well, at least the ones on my server did.<br>
<br>
I really don't think some of you people are getting it.  What is bad about this change is that it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  forces</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a change in gamestyle upon the SB.<br>
<br>
When a person makes a class and puts time in to levelling it up, it because that class offers a playstyle that they enjoy.  For Mythic to come around 6 months later and make some heavy-handed or short-sighted change that completely changes that playstyle is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  bad</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
It was wrong what they did to archers.  It was disgraceful and dishonest.  This armor change is no less so in what it does to the SB.  I'm pretty sure that many people chose SBs because they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  wanted</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to engage in stealth war battles with other assassins.<br>
<br>
Now, instead of approaching a MG hunting for other assassins to fight.. they should approach with an overwhelming sense of fear and hope they don't get spotted?<br>

They should have a choice whether to be good against tanks rather than assassins through weapon and spec choices.  But, that is not the case here.  This is a case of a certain playstyle being forced upon them, and one which many of them didn't sign up for.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uraggoktp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaggokTP</A> at: 8/1/02 8:23:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uraggoktp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaggokTP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 8:21:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~pmhigg/DAoC/tree.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.52F Pendragon Patch, Armor Changes Included:</span><hr size=1> Druids get instacast root. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 9:01:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> the hubbub</span><hr size=1> lot of good points in here. but everytime i read the ns`s are underpowered i sit back a bit and wonder. playing on Igrain the top end assassins are um...

4 Classes are vulnerable to SB's. Heros- yeah right- bullwinkle form PLUS they 2 hit me. Champions, tanks with debufs and more HPs?, Druids- probably take em (do they have insta mez?), and Wardens (PBT makes them hard).<br>
Something got left out here.... WAIT, there is another realm... Albion. Musta left them out....<br>
<br>
As for POST PATCH look at nightshade (pierce) vs Mid Tank (slash)<br>
<br>
Nightshade leather is resistant to slash. Mid Tank is vulnerable to pierce. Add the small evade stun from the Hib Pierce line, and they will be doing very well against tanks- both Alb and Mid. <br>
<br>
In summary YES you are the only one who thinks this is silly because assassins was refering to pre patch Infils (not Cross realm assasins) with thrust and D'Fang against MIDGARD HEALERS (not cross realm healers) and Midgard tanks (not cross realm tanks). <br>
<br>
ON TOP OF THAT the Hib classes we go against will be able to spec slash (for the most part) and heavy tank with heavy hitpoints against light assassin with light hitpoints will both be vulnerable to each other. The best we could hope for is that a HIB tank specs pierce. With them going crush we are just neutral.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Knock, knock.  Anybody home in there?  PRE PATCH infs could kill healers (the class) and tanks because of the 15% BONUS TO CHAIN.  If the tank was slash he had his own 15% bonus vs us.  Now you guys get a 30% bonus to the Hib version of chain.  And lots of classes have abilities or spells that make them a pain in the ass, not just your new targets.  You seem to forget that your poor little defenseless healers have INSTA stun and INSTA mez.  That combined with a whistle makes them a royal pain in the ass unless done right.  Now i'm not talking about any other class balance issues, i'm talking about the resistances and target choices.  Yes there are only 4 classes you get a bonus too now and they're all hib.  Thats compared to the whopping 5 midgard classes i have a choice from 2 of which have insta stun/mez and the others will likely be swinging a hammer at me (30% bonus now).  Yell about them changing your class role, about not getting what your paid for.  But don't say that inf have it so easy against your tanks and healing classes and you have it so hard against the hib tanks and healing classes.<br>

Don't they have epic armor in Midgard? This is only a valid point if epic armor doesn't exist in Midgard. *Everyone* has to face epic armor.<br>

You mean, can attack Mid tanks with impunity, right up until the time said tank shield stuns you or whallops you so hard your teeth come out the back of your head. Or until the rest of his *group* comes and kills you. Tanks can't be attacked with impunity unless they're alone.<br>

1-I'm a Nightshade and I don't get Dragonfang.<br>
2-I'm a 2-3 hit death to your tank classes too. (I'm in epic armor, I've gotten hit by a blue con with a 2h slasher for 350+ points of damage so the arguments quoted above just aren't holding ANY water at all. I was fully buffed by a living, breathing person who I was also grouped with at the time, thanks.)<br>
<br>
In any case, I think the drastic change in playstyle that's pretty much being forced on you guys was incredibly ill-thought out (assuming Mythic thinks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and I hope something is done to fix the situation. <br>

As far as being nerfed vs your nemesis, I am willing to wager that SB vs NS fights are going to be much closer now-with the scales leaning towards the bladeshades. Infs are another matter, but I am happy with the SB vs NS scenario being worked out. <p><center><br>"I am still learning" <br>

Its not like healers have multiple insta's at their disposal. Wait for em to pop of the instas and then get em.  I will admit though, getting around stuns/mezzes suck.  But its not like the healer has the offensive power to melee anything down.  Healer mezzes, run buff, runs away usually.<br>

Sigh, i don't know how many times i can keep trying to beat this into your heads.  SB's have MORE of a bonus to scale now than thrust infs and NS had to chain before.  And if for some reason you can't kill scale wearers with a 30% bonus when we were appearantly slaughtering your chain wearers with a 15% bonus then i don't know what to tell you.  All the same difficulties of you killing a scale tank/healer can be just as easily applied to an inf killing a chain tank/healer.  Thats my point, plain and simple.

<br>
Pre patch theory.<br>
thrust infs -&gt; trade their advantage for attacking other stealthers for an advantage to attacking healers/shaman/tanks<br>
<br>
slash infs -&gt; advantage to attacking stealthers<br>
<br>
perce NS -&gt;  trade their advantage for attacking other stealthers for an advantage to attacking healers/shaman/tanks<br>
<br>
slash infs -&gt; advantage to attacking stealthers<br>
<br>
SB's (only spec slash) -&gt; advantage to attacking stealthers.<br>
<br>
This is the reason most SB's feel that the fights SB vs thrust/pierce assassin should be slanted toward the SB, because thrust/pierce trade their advantage to attacking SB's when they choose to spec thrust/pierce.  However, the SB vs Slash assassin should be 50-50. (I am not debating if this was actually working correctly in game, but in theory should be correct)<br>
<br>
After the patch.  It seems to SB's like thrust/pierce users pretty much get their cake and eat it too.  They have advantages to attacking Mid chain wearers and SB's, while SB's are now forced into taking advantages against other tanks, while losing our advantage over pierce/thrust assassins.<br>
<br>
Since SB's have always only been able to spec Slash, this is pretty much the role we all have taken from Day 1.  Personally, I have a Soulblade (I guess that is what it is dubbed now), that I use specifically to play bodyguard to our healing classes, archers, etc, against other assassins.  This is also why I chose Slash for my Inf, because I wanted to fill a similar role for Scouts/Casters.  With the new resists, I can respec my Inf to thrust, fill the same role without too much trouble and get advantages to chain wearers, while I have no idea what to do with my SB.<br>
