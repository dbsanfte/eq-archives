My Breakdown. Your Comments?</span><hr size=1> Seriously.  I mean, lets look at it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Good</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It has about... 20?  ubermobs that drop uberloot.  True, that many of these items arent on par with NTOV or even... oh.... Veeshan's peak.... but many of the items are godly at the same time... and some encounters drop 2-3 bad items, 1-2 good ones.<br>
<br>
The spells.... are pretty damn awesome, really.  Just remember back before you had Group Aego.<br>
<br>
The AAXP:  yeah a lot of people are bitching, but there are monks out there regen'ing 16 a tick standing, and Aego takes 1 spell and 30 seconds to put on EVERYONE on the raid with MGB.  Crit hits for all, even casters... While most of the class ones are lame, many many many of the archetype ones are incredible for all classes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Bad</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Storyline:  Ok, lets admit that we were SPOILED by Velious.  The storyline, the NPC interaction... everything... was absolutely splendid... Luclin had a lot to live up to... and the lore isnt as present.  It IS there, and while there are huge empty gaps, at least there is a lot of content.  However, no Dwarf/Giant wars here... just... some snakes... some Ahkevans... some combine empire folks.  The only 2 factions that really interact are the Seru/Katta deal... while pretty damned intersting and well written, it stands alone in a rather empty expansion... =/<br>
<br>
The Camping:  The intent was good.  Give people something to do while grinding AAXP.  Give people a reason to see ALL of the content.  Give people a timesink so instead of farming UBER items from day 1, they start farming UBER items on month 6.  That's great for verant, sucks ass for the player.  If the camps were intersting, that'd be different.. but its just pulling green/blue mobs and making them bleed to death from AoE spells.<br>
<br>
The Loot 2: Loot is amazingly out of balance.  Some items are incredible, others are so sub par they rot every time for the encounters that get them.  I understand that the creativity is limited by the database item system, but what can i say?  They coded in +% to skills, and barely used it.  They coded in +Fire/Cold/Etc and its hardly seen the late of day.  They made +Bane weapons and besides the REQUIRED ones, no weapons Have much +bane on them at all.  Hello? There are about 900 paladins swords that drop in the expansion, put some +bane undead on them, willya?<br>
<br>
So, honestly, what do you TRUELY thinK?<br>
<br>
Agree or disagree I look forward to your opinions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How It Compares</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
How it compares to the other expansions.<br>
<br>
Kunark: Kunark had about 10 ubermobs.  They werent very fun.  They required no camps, but had a fair story behind them.  Their drops were VERY good at the time... some still are pretty decent to 55+ players.  <br>
<br>
Velious: Rich storyline.  Lots of items.  About 30 Ubermobs to kill.  The best storyline so far.  Amazing interactive quests, including sleepers, dain wars, and the like.<br>

My Breakdown. Your Comments?</span><hr size=1> As much as I want to love Luclin, I really don't play it as much as the other expansions.  Parts of Luclin are great.  The lower level zones are killer for PL (recondite camps in paludal are the best anywhere for 15-25), but after lv30 the luclin zones get kinda boring -- nobody hunts in Mons Letalis, Scarlet, Twilight, Tenebrous, Hollowshade unless trying to get TS quest armor items or some random loot-dropping mob if up.  It'd be nice if zones like Griegs and Mons (and the other 1/2 unused luclin zones) were changed a little to make them more desirable to xp in,thus bringing players to the zone.<br>
<br>
The high level timesinks arent very interesting to me and I'll probably never get caught up in doing them (spending 5 nights a week in ssra so i can kill a few more mobs in there doesnt appeal to me) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170032">Bauben</a> and <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170035">Pauden</a>  Peachins of E'ci

My Breakdown. Your Comments?</span><hr size=1> I haven't had a chance to really explore the high level Luclin content yet, as my guild is still working on wrapping up Velious. However, from what I've seen, Velious &gt;&gt;&gt; Luclin. My two principal complaints are:<br>
<br>
- Faction system and storyline<br>
Velious's 3-way faction system is great. Not too simple, not too complex. Luclin, on the other hand, has too many factions. The interaction between them is not clear, and, in addition, their names are very difficult to remember. I don't want to kill something and see:<br>
<br>
Your faction with Wixo Tixo Mixo got better.<br>
Your faction with Katta Watta Patta got worse.<br>
Your faction with Hand of Seru got better.<br>
Your faction with Heart of Seru got worse.<br>
Your faction with Left Nut of Seru could not get any worse.<br>
<br>
This leads to a really awkward storyline where you don't quite know who is what, or how they are related.<br>
<br>
- Loot balance<br>
Way off. Velious at least kept some measure of balance with Kunark. A good example is of this is that a mid-quality velium warsword (slightly better than 1 to 2 ratio) is slightly harder to get than a CSS. It takes a slightly more competant group to farm DN than to farm Guard in Seb. With Luclin you have:<br>
<br>
Shadow Heart<br>
Dmg 11, Dly 17. +8 Str +8 Sta +8 Agi +8 Dex +25 vsMg +50 HP<br>
<br>
Farmable with 1 good group in Velious level gear. Now compare that to:<br>
<br>
Swiftblade of Zek<br>
Dmg 11, Dly 18. +10 AC +10 Str +100 HP +25 Mana<br>
<br>
Drops off the Statue of Rallos Zek - not the hardest mob, but certainly not a 1 grouper. Yah, swiftblade gives more hitpoints, but not that much more if you take into account the stamina on the shadowheart.<br>
<br>
I believe mudflation is inevitable, and not necessarily a bad thing. It keeps people involved in the game, looking for ever greater challenges. But mudflation should involve better rewards for equal or more effort, not better reward for a lot less effort.<br>
<br>
Also, the introduction of situational loot (bane weapons, or weapons with +magic/fire/etc damage) was poorly executed. Every big uber mob is still resisty as hell, and lets not get started on bane weapons and timesinks.<br>
<br>
Last of all, I think Luclin really makes a conceit to the idea of farming experience. Patches in Fungus Grove are an example of this. I would really liked to have seen another crawlable dungeon like Howling Stones.<br>
<br>
Anyway, those are just my impressions. I haven't explored Luclin extremely extensively, so maybe my opinion will change later on. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7496 target=_blank><img src=http://www.silentresurgence.org/members/itsara/sig3.jpg border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubaldieankulstabber.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baldie Ankulstabber</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/5/02 7:35:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is luclin really THAT bad? My Breakdown. Your Comments?</span><hr size=1> I still have friends that cant play the Luclin expansion due to lack of computer requirements, thus I rarely ever go there at all.  That fact coupled with the terrible access to the moon means i've been there less than 10 times for exp groups..thats pretty sad since i actually play for a lot of hours each week.  The loot(and exp) isnt that great and the time needed for all the key farming is horrid, thus my guild so far has expressed little interest in going to Luclin.<br>
<br>
Ways to fix Luclin:<br>
<br>
1.  okay Verant your plan succeeded, you kept the uber guilds from farming the highest creatures in Luclin for 6 months with your key scheme...now either make the key quests easier(less time consuming) or take them out all together.<br>
<br>
2.  *****FIX THE LOOT*****, it sounds like they are fixing it as per a post on castersrealm from the leading design guy.  I guess we'll see how that turns out.<br>
<br>
3.  For gods sakes, i get it...its the moon and we needed a special way to get there.  but now that we've been there a while, let that good old-fashioned norrathian genius that lives in every druid and wizard come out...let them discover ways to create druid rings and wizard spires powerful enough to allow magic travel between the moon and Norrath.  This would go farther than any other measure to populate the land of Luclin.  It is the biggest turn off for making an excursion to the moon. <br>

My Breakdown. Your Comments?</span><hr size=1> The biggest problem with luclin for the average player is.....<br>
XP zones suck. They suck to no end, the xp is terrible and the rish vs. reward is Unbalanced.<br>
<br>
Besides the AE groups that inhabit AC Grey and a couple of other places, Any other normal xp group can go into any luclin dungeon and come out with crap. Verant promised us it would give us new xp zones to spread people out away from velks seb KC etc....But Luclin has been out what..5 months already? And Seb still has 80 people a Night, Karnors 40 and Velks 40. And now chardok is getting pretty crowded every night too, which is too bad cuz that place owns. Grey used to be a great place for exp until verant nerfed AE groups there (and every other group too). Greigs is a wierd place but theres no loot and the xp sucks. AC is good xp for AE groups or if you have 4 assassinate rogues in a group. the deep is good for AE groups. Alkeva sucks. UP is loot only, Ditto for ME. Thats about 7 high level zones that suck for exp. Id rather sit in Seb KC velk looking for pickup groups becuase the exp is better than go to any of these sorry ass Luclin zones and get crap. Verant needs to look at every Luclin zone and start bumping up the ZEM and then maybe the high level population will spread out a little bit <p><p>~Genado Ginsinger</p>

I think a lot of the founders of the game left sometime before or around the release of Luclin, leaving it to be designed by people who didn't have their discipline.  Luclin had a lot of good ideas that fell short due to getting the expansion out in time for the holiday season.  I can't say I'm too thrilled about the PoP expansion either.<br>
<br>
I'm only level 43 and Velious is my favorite and will probably stay that way, no matter what ridiculous loot you might be able to get a hold of in PoP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utalasdruzzilro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talas DruzzilRo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/5/02 4:04:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/pmkelly/talas_mug.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is luclin really THAT bad?

I can understand if they did that to reward the ubers for their hark work but this is a game we shouldnt have to do a lot of hard work. If they wanna fix Luclin they need to fix the Exp and the transportation a lot. For crying out loud the place is pretty big but only has 1 point of access and then that is not in the middle of Luclin either.I personally would not mind redownloading some of the maps to get some ports added to them. For me there are no fun zones between lvl 30-45, no real dungeons or anything. Most of the time when I am on Luclin i have to 1) bring a guild or 2) solo for really sucky exp. They have a lot to prove in PoP, least in my mind. <p><div align=center> <a target="new" href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=114219">Deaddragoxo Spiritbound</a> <BR> <div align=center>  <a target="new" href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=196493">Scaleyfists Witfungfufists</a><BR> <div align=center> <a target="new" href="http://www.clanphoenix.org">Clan Phoenix of Xegony- Event Coordinator</a><BR> <div align=center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugnomzard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gnomzard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/5/02 4:32:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is luclin really THAT bad?

Not true at all.  There were 11 &quot;ubermobs&quot;:<br>
<br>
Gore<br>
Sev<br>
Tal<br>
Trak<br>
VS<br>
Hoshkar<br>
Silverwing<br>
Druushk<br>
Nexona <br>
Xygoz<br>
Phara Dar<br>
<br>
One of them required a 15-20 minute camp.  6 of them required a quest that probably took 24 hours of play time total to complete.  Personally, I found most kunark encounters to be quite enjoyable.  The mobs were varied and tactics were very important because of the nature of the sort of spells they casted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DyrX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/5/02 10:35:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is luclin really THAT bad?

  VP key quest was ok at least, kill this, get this, find this, hand this to this guy etc. It was an actual QUEST.<br>
<br>
  Sleepers was easier (timewise) it was just kill x and hand to y and get key<br>
<br>
  But luclin....just to get to vex thal.<br>
1)camp 2 rare spawns, taskmaster bag, and insignia to get emperor key<br>
2) (if melee) camp shissar elite for a shissar weapon and camp basement skeletons for ore to make corrupted shissar weapon.<br>
3)kill emperor ssra for his scepter (which could give the key by itself)<br>
4)camp 10 lucid shards ranging from semi-common to extremelly rare (ie, maidens eye)<br>
5)kill semi-easy mobs for orb of luclinite<br>
6)get scepter and combine all the stuff for key to vex thal<br>
<br>
That is just for ONE key. Imagine how long it would take for a full force of 60ish people.<br>
<br>
Not to mention seru key and weapons (altho at present weapons are kind of useless) acrylia key which requires getting items and doing a war that makes the 10th ring war look like a joke FOR EACH PERSON<br>
<br>
Not to mention the tedious task of getting experience for AA points. Mindless repetitive killing of blue mobs for small gains to your character.<br>
<br>
oh yea and who could forget the massive amount of rings of fire, which put you through hours of gimp mobs to get to the boss(es)<br>
<br>
There is 3 rings <br>
1)incredibly boring (ie. high priest in acrylia for cat shackle)<br>
2)incredibly hard (ie current ring of fire)<br>
3)ideal (burrower in deep)<br>
<br>
The whole focus of luclin high end game is to make you work your ass off on it for months. <br>

My Breakdown. Your Comments?</span><hr size=1> Well there's the rub to a degree isn't it?  On the one hand keys are a timesink and probably way over the top.  On the other, if they didn't do it, the uber guilds would have rushed the uber mobs in a period of weeks and that's all she wrote as far as challenge goes.<br>
<br>
The ability of a guild to come up with solutions to any particular problem is pretty extensive.  When you have 40 or more minds focusing on a problem, someone is bound to come up with something the developers didn't consider.  Slowing guilds down gives Verant a chance to breath.  Get a feel for how the mobs that are easily accessable do against the guilds.  Perhaps they tweak the inaccessable ones accordingly (giving them the benefit of the doubt here).<br>
<br>
I see that people say that DTs are lame (and I can see the point, a dead character guaranteed once a round is a pretty large stack of bodies if it takes 30 minutes to take a mob down, seems a bit excessive).  So what are the other options?<br>
<br>
Take a look at Legends for an example.  From Verant's perspective keeping the sleeper sleeping attracted players.  People went to Legends specifically because there was a chance to farm the warders and because there was a chance to be involved with waking the sleeper, eventually.  One guild takes down the warders, wakes the sleeper, and poof there goes Verant's big carrot to get people to go there.  I'm not debating the good or the bad of the situation, just looking at it from Verant's perspective for a minute.<br>
<br>
The keys are probably keeping players playing who wouldn't have continued once all the big new Luclin uber mobs got to be old hat, about 3 weeks after Luclin was released.  To Verant, this equals income.  This is a good thing.  Now if you think keys are a PITA (and I can't blame you if you do, cause I know I would if I was farming them), come up with some suggestions on how challenge can be added to the game in a way that keeps people interested and playing.<br>
<br>
Because lets be honest, Verant is going to do whatever it can think of to keep you paying your $12.95 a month for as long as they possibly can.  If you were calling the shots, how would you do it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urenc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Renc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/5/02 11:44:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is luclin really THAT bad?

I agree with the previous poster about the faction thing. Sure it's neat to have a few cities and a few different factions (like an average Antonica/Faydwer city), but I don't want to see 15 messages for every level 3 animal I kill as I pass by.<br>
<br>
Also, key quests are neat and all, but I have to agree that Vex Thal just looks like a huge timesink. I mean, we casual players want to have fun, too. I got my VP key. I sat through a 35+ hour camp for Stormfeather and Lodizal. Is it really necessary for me to put even more time in for this new zone? Why not just have like a few uber mobs somewhere that have a chance to drop a key ala Sleeper's Tomb? I always thought that was a cool idea. <br>
<br>
Maybe the idea is to keep the zone a mystery instead of just having a super guild enter the place 3 weeks after realease. *shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelodoron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elodoron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/6/02 2:30:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There is 3 rings <br>

The Ring of Fire is not incredible hard, it just sucks that the bosses spawn randomly and so you can waste hours without seeing any nice loot. But that's what Luclin is about after all.<br>

<br>
This is a place that Luclin does pretty well in.  Va'dyn, Servitor, the Umbral mobs, and a few other mobs like them provide some raid content accessible by most any guild.  However, the loot on these encounters varies quite a bit.  Some of it is junk, others of it is too good for what they are dropping off.<br>
<br>
Spell drops needs some adjusting.  Mainly, the level 60 int caster spells need to be made more accessible outside of Srae.<br>
<br>
Waiting for ports up sucks.  Not as bad as the 30 minutes for boats, but come on, could have done 5-7 minutes easy.  Let druids port people up and give wizards ports to Seru and Katta.  After all, it's the combine empire, don't you think they'd have a port spell to get home?  Also, who cares about the bloody spires... give us a way to NRO/Nektulos and back.  EC is the hub on buying and selling for most servers.  Let us get there.<br>
<br>
AA I like.  But it does create problems.  Basically, even though they aren't levels, you now need AA to be all that you can be.  So everyone is levelling their mains again.  That's a lot of 60s gathering xp and not many places to go.<br>
<br>
A few zones need adjusting.  Griegs would benefit nicely from a few named camps and a few more mini-bosses of about the level of the Servitor.  Right now, this zone is empty most of the time.  Akheva needs to be seriously looked at, both at the rate at which it's nameds spawn and the fact that they rarely drop anything.  It also needs some nice nameds/loot placed in deep, to encourage good single groups to go in and get xp/loot from there.  As is, it supports 1-2 groups xp'ing unless someone is feeling frisky enough to risk the traps.  The Deep needs to have it's mobs drop some cash.  It needs to be slightly tweaked as well to make it more desirable to standard xp groups.  Also, how xp works needs to be revamped.  A mob's max hp should impact how much xp you get for it.  This will make level 60 mobs like the Shiknar Royalty worth killing for xp reasons.<br>
<br>
Some ideas are cool.  I like the caller encounter, for instance.  An autopulling camp, if you can keep up, with a chance of some nice loot.  Great idea, well done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utenoroallegro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tenoro Allegro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/6/02 1:18:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23612.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What...</span><hr size=1> Content-wise Luclin has failed where Kunark and Velious succeeded.<br>

Some huge bonuses with this expansion were with the new spells.<br>
<br>
Moonfire, Group Aego, Group Focus, KEI, AE mana song, AE resists songs, group haste over cap songs.  MGB on the big buffs helps a lot too.<br>

AA skills may be unbalanced for some classes (dire charm vs. mage pet), but for other classes they did a lot.  <br>
