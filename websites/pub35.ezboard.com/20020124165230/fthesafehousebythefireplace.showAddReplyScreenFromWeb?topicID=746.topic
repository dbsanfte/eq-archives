This particular day they had a mission, nothing they havent done before, infact they have done this many times without and any flaws at all. This day was no exception, so far it was perfect. They had made it all the way to Freeport got what was needed and back out with out any problems. Seeing as everthing was going so well they decided to have some fun and &quot;play&quot; with the bears, it may not of been the smartest thing to do in such a well populated place, but they felt that nothing could go wrong. Technine had just pulled his dagger out of a kodiak when he turned around to see Duelin getting mauled by bears that he did not even think where native to this part of Norrath. Duelin looked hurt and could only kill one of the bears, Technine jumped forward pierceing his dagger into a second bear and killing it, but before he get to the other bear Duelin was already dead and the bear was running off saving itself from the same fate that Duelin got. There wasn't much Technine could do, infact he had absolutly no idea what to do, he had a very expensive item that needed to be returned to Rivervale or his life would be in danger, but on the other hand his best friend was dead. finaly coming to his senses and realizing that Duelin wouldn't want him risking his own life, Technine quickly dug a whole in a nearby hill and tossed Duelin's corpse into it and ran off to Rivervale. When he arrived he told the whole story to his &quot;Boss&quot; and said that he wanted to give up the life of a thief. He understood that stealing and killing was the only thing he has ever known but he had no choice. <br>
<br>
     Technine had allways wanted to explore more of the world and throughout his carear he had earned alot of money so he decided to leave Rivervale, not forever, but just long enough that he could be alone and think. He dicided his first stop would be Freeport he new the place pretty well and figured he would get and ealy start in the morning and be there by nightfall. That night he packed everythin he needed and dozed off to bed. The next morning Technine got up put on this backpack and headed out, before he reached the door he saw his daggers laying on his nightstand, he thought about it for a moment and decided he should take them along just incase something went wrong. upon reaching the Commonlands Technine looked on the hill where Duelin's body laid, marked only with a large rock, it may of not been the best bureal but it was better than throwing him in the nearbye pond. Technine knew Duelin's death was not his fault but could not live down the fact that he watched his best friend die, not missing one step Technine walked past the grave and onto Freeport if he was going to make it there before dusk he would have to hurry.<br>
<br>
     Technine walked up to the hotel clerk &quot;I need a room, how much?&quot; &quot;well all our rooms are filled for the night, but you look tired so ill let you use the stable outback.&quot; with no other options Technine decided to take it, it was a nice night out anyway, and a little fresh air never hurt anyone anyway he thought to himself trying to be as optomistic as possible. With nothing to wake him up, Technine arose later than expected, he quickly cleaned himself up and got ready for a good breakfast. The food was not as good and the food the served back home but it was food none the less and thats all he realy cared about. Running out of ideas Technine decided to take a chance and take a long boat ride to Faydwer, he had never been there and it could be interesting so he finished his meal and headed for the docks. Right as Technine was reaching the dock the boat arrived, he could have not been luckier, he jumped on the boat and as quickly as it was there it was off across the ocean. The whole ride to Faydwer, Technine only shared the vessel with one other person, a young Druid Woodelf. Technine was used to the cocky Halfling Druids running around Rivervale, bragging about all there spells, infact he had actualy taken the lifes of a couple Druids back home, they claimed that more was needed than just a knife to get the job done, needless to say Technine proved them wrong. Not much was said on the Voyage, Technine was not very talkitive, but on the other hand the anxouis Druidwas allover the ship and Technine had to tell him to sit down on more than one occassion, Technine did not care for the young Druid one bit, infact he didnt like him at all. when the boat finaly arrived in butcherblock the Druid jumped off happy to finaly get to him homeland. Technine on the otherhand had no idea where he was and asked the Druid if he could point him the way to Greater Faydark. Since the Druid was going there anyway he thought they should go together, the Druid was still young and had alot to learn and Butcherblock is not a safe place anyway. Technine didn't like the idea, but had no choice but to take the Druid up on his offer. Along the way the Druid told Technine his name was Bravofox, after much hesitation he gave in and told him his name was Technine. somewhere along the way the druid got turned around and led both of them into a goblin camp. After killing all the goblins and Bravofox no lifting a finger to help Technine decided he would be better off alone and left the druid behind.<br>
<br>
     When Technine arrived at Greater Faydark he dicided his first stop would be Kelethin. Soon enough he was at the lift waiting to be taken up to the tree city, and to his suprise there stood the young Druid at the top.<br>
