=============================================<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 - You can now set the &quot;You've been hit&quot; message to a different color (red is now the default).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - Some pet health bars were still showing up in the pet health window after the pet was released. This has been fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 - When sending to a &quot;best fit&quot; name, if there is more than one fit, the server will tell you that the name is not unique (it will no longer send to the first best-fit match).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - The chatgroup and friends commands now require that you type in an exact match for the user's name. Previously it worked on &quot;best fit&quot;.<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Stores now show correct Platinum and Mithril (x1000 instead of x100)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>

<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Buffs that are refreshed no longer inherit blinking from previous buffs.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Off-hand usable and two-handed is now shown when right-clicking on an item in a store.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Bard-type classes can now drop instruments in their ranged weapons slot to more easily switch between them.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Bard-type instruments with stat buffs now correctly add in to a player's stats when the instrument is held.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Bard-type instruments should now &quot;con&quot; correctly.  They also show correct condition, durability, etc.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - You cannot FOLLOW or STICK to an opponent unless you are relatively close to them.  A STICK now breaks if the target gets outside of a certain range.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - A new command has been added, /FACE, that allows to you auto-face a target (for mages and archers).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - DPS instead of Damage is now shown when right clicking on weapons.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - You can now click on other monsters and players while you are /FOLLOWing a target without breaking the follow.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>

<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - The /MACRO command has been changed to be /MACRO &lt;name&gt; &lt;text&gt; to allow you to better name your macros.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Magical item levels now show properly in the quickview window.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - When you hand in a shield to be repaired or enchanted, the shield is now re-readied properly in your left hand.<br>

<br>
 <br>

 - The &quot;open door&quot; key selects a monster as the target when he is in front of you (if there is no door).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Repair cost of fast weapons has been reduced since they lose condition more quickly.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - In a city, the /STUCK command takes you to a safe spot in the middle of the city when you are stuck.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Consignments no longer count towards the max number of tasks you can do for a level.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - You now get a dialog confirmation when choosing your trade skill profession.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Archer classes now have a chance of becomming visible when they nock their arrow. The way it worked up until now is that archers would always be invisible if they were using stealth until they fired their bow. Now, a skill check is performed when they &quot;nock&quot; their arrow. If they fail the check, they become visible. The chance to become visible is based on their specialization in Stealth. On normal (i.e. NOT critical shots), if they are 50% specc'ed in stealth, they will have a 50% chance of becomming visible; if they are 100% specc'ed, they will have a 100% chance of remaining hidden. On Critical Shots, the chance is the same as a normal shot, minus 20% - so an archer max specced in stealth will have an 80% of remaining hidden after nocking his bow. Please note that in all cases, an archer will become visible once the shot is actually fired.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - You can no longer hide when your arrow is in-flight (before it hits your opponent).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - You now will correctly block/evade/parry when not in combat mode. A bug was preventing you from using these abilities when not in combat mode.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Cloth armor factors fixed - they were printing as too high for your level and were degrading too quickly as a result. They should now &quot;con&quot; and degrade correctly.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Better /WHO filter - you can now type /WHO &lt;TEXT&gt; &lt;LEVEL&gt; to see people who match a certain text and level range.  The Level range can be &lt;1-5&gt; or &lt;10&gt; or any combo.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - /FRIENDS command has been changed to work like the /IGNORE command.  You now type /FRIEND &lt;name&gt; to add or remove a friend or just /FRIENDS to see you current friends list.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - When you are aiming a bow, you don't regenerate endurance.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - When attacking a keep door with a normal hand-held weapon (i.e. NOT a siege weapon), now the correct damage is printed - it was printing your damagex20 previously.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - As one Realm controls more and more keeps in an enemy frontier, those keeps will spawn fewer and fewer guards.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Material text now prints correctly for Bardic-Class type instruments in stores.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Enchanters were charging a bit too much for their services. This has been fixed - you'll note that enchanting armor/weapons is now cheaper.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Enemy Realm guards should no longer follow you into a Realm's home area.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - Many new weapon models have been added. These are special weapons that cannot be purchased in stores. You can craft them or receive them as quest bounty. Please note that it will be a week or so before you'll start seeing them pop up in game; however, you are downloading them now.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - The Kobold Ring in Midgard is now configured correctly. It was inadvertantly set to require 3000 trains in a random skill to now use.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - The Pitted Drake Talon in Albion should now look like a dagger.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - The Carved Sphene Ring in Hibernia now adds to the Piercing skill.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - The level epic Friar staff now adds to the Staff skill.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - The rest of the epic cloaks in Albion can now take emblems.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - The rats in Skona should now drop a tails that can be sold.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - The Flame Helm in Midgard can now be dyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - There were some items in the Spraggon Den and Ursine Lair that had resistances set too high. These items have been replaced with duplicates that have slightly lower resistances on them to bring them in line with all other resistance items. If you already have any of the original items the resistances on them will not be affected in any way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
 There existed a problem with certain players who were on step two of the Grenlock Clan's epic and who needed to kill Ulga to complete the Reach of the shadow quest. Players can now complete Siv's Spirit quest (the bulk of Grenlock Clan's step 2), and return to kill Ulga to finish off the Reach of the shadow quest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - QUEST: Shadowblade level 11 Quest: Jewel Hunt<br>
<br>
 Some players were not able to get their level 11 quest. If you are a Shadowblade above level 11 and did not receive the Jewel Hunt quest at level 11 from your trainer, you can now go back to your class trainer and right-click on him.

<br>
<br>

<br>
 <br>
<br>
 - Players on the Balance of Nature quest were supposed to remove the creature Sabha by offering it fish. The trainer wasn't giving them fish, so they were just killing Sabha rather than talking. Players that are on that step but don't have fish to give Sabha can see Caoimhe, in Ardee, for some fish.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-Some adjustments are being made to the parthanan fields.  Currently, only one (Lough Gur) of the four parthanan fields has been adjusted.  More adjustments to that field and the other fields will make their way into the zone in the near future.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

All I have to say is... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> YES!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Easily the best part of the patch for rvr.  Fair, not a nerf, quite nice.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> - As one Realm controls more and more keeps in an enemy frontier, those keeps will spawn fewer and fewer guards.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Too cool, even more reason to defend the keeps and keep them more secure.<br>

Not sure whether I like this or not, it's kind of odd.  I mean, eq'ism states that anything that is not objectionable is NEVER stated in a patch, and the fact they said you can KEEP your old ones... *shudders* Market prices have inflated on some items already....<br>

Hopefully if you get hit by an arrow you can clcik the button and automatically be pointing towards the archer. That and the no stealth for 20 seconds should make things a bit more interesting for the archer types.<br>
<br>
Another thing is the blocking and evading while not in combat mode. Does this apply to arrows? If it does I'm getting a sheild to carry for when I run around on the frontier. Any chance to avoid an arrow is nice. Now they just need to fix the bug that doesn't let us equip a shield after we become a Friar. <p><center><img src=http://crystalsky.net/images/mair_signature.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/um4dm0nk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>M4dM0nk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/8/01 1:24:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Todays Patch (11/08/01)</span><hr size=1> Errr... I don't get it.

<br>
I really don't understand the logic in that one.<br>

<br>
As for the archer fix I find it interesting and very understandable...does this mean that there will be more points put into stealth for archers and less in archery... just a thought<br>
<br>
Gah I starting to turn into Q i dont play daoc and i doing theories and such!!!! <p><center<Br>

<br>
I don't mind the chance, would just like to see it lower though.<br>
<br>
What I would really like to see implemented is the arrow tracers.  I think that would go a long way to help people feel better about archers in RvR.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, it sure does make skill point decisions much tougher.. hehe<br>
