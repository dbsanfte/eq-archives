Chapter One - The day was done

        He landed on the cold hard ground with a thump.
  His breath knocked out of him, his eyes rolled up into their 
sockets.  Ivan struggled to right himself, but was barely able
 to draw one leg under him, let alone to begin pushing himself 
upright.  The screams of men, beasts, and the clanging of 
weapons around terrified him.  Blinking, Ivan grunted and 
slowly began to get his bearings.  They were fighting an 
invading army; the king’s men are fighting valiantly.  From his 
vantage now however Ivan thought they may indeed be 
doomed.  He looked for his mount Percival, his proud stallion 
was nowhere to seen.
        Suddenly a crazed howl from Ivan’s right brought 
him from his pondering.  A goblin came running full force his 
way.  It’s battle enraged and lust filled eyes bulged.  Its 
weapon held high, a club to bash Ivan’s head in came eerily 
slow for a moment.  Then the furtive moment happened as it 
always does.  That fast movement wherein Ivan reached and 
grabbed the extended elbow and twisted it, his back now to 
the goblin.  Despite having no weapon, his sword thrown from 
him when Percival was hit.  Oh yes he thought, Percival had 
been hit.  He heard the goblins arm snap, a loud crack that 
shattered the silence that was between the two.  Rolling the 
goblin over his shoulder, he pulled it over him and slammed it 
onto the ground where he had not been less than a few 
moments ago.  It’s club slipped free, and now Ivan bashed 
the tusker into deaths embrace as it had intended for him.
        It was at that moment that he saw Percival.  
Muddied, and slumped to the ground.  He no longer moved, no 
more so than the rest of the corpses of men and beasts that 
lay with him.  A pole shaft stuck out from his chest.  Having 
impaled him, Percival had felt nothing; but the force of the 
blow had lifted and strewn him back into Toril’s arms in one 
fell swoop.  Ivan had careened some feet away.  He noticed 
his sword in-between him and Percivals carcass.  A goblin 
held it deep in its chest, its hands wrapped about it; with 
several fingers missing still cling to the hilt.  It’s silent scream 
never to be heard on the mortal planes.
        Ivan retrieved his sword, just as he saw a large 
wedge of goblins flanking several of his companions.  They 
were currently occupied with a contingent of Ogres, and if 
the goblins got into position before they could react, they 
would be pinned between the two forces.  A furry mounted in 
Ivan, curses flew from him as fast as he ran towards the 
tuskers.  The right side of the regiment, about a score of 
goblins, cried an alarm as he came down the hill to assail 
them.
        Before they could turn, he slammed into their side, 
like a pebble into a pond.  He first stroke was a high sweep, it 
lopped the head of one goblin and halfway through his 
neighbor.  The third goblin having time to prepare had raised 
his club in preparation for his attack, while Ivan followed 
through with his swing, he stopped the arc short, The 
unsuspecting Goblin was wide open, his arms raised above his 
head.  A short thrust forward introduced him to his error.  
Blood bubbled from his mouth, and he unerringly slumped to 
the ground, his gaze falling on his cohorts whose bodies 
waited his eventual descent.
        The regiments next line of troops, turned about, 
looking in palling gall at their fallen troops.  One screamed out 
orders, Ivan answered with a howl of rage; they paused.  It 
was their doom.  A hail of arrows showered them lacerating 
them horribly.  The middle of the troops screamed in fright 
and agony as there score of hard core battle tested goblins 
was reduced to only a few.  Ivan stepped forward, knowing 
that no more arrows would come, in fact the front line of 
goblins was intact.  He impaled the third one, while elbowing 
the fourth, cutting the line in half.  Turning to the left he 
faced the other two, and away from the previously attacked 
tusker.  He raised his sword two fisted above his head, letting 
the length of it fall behind him.  It scared the goblins in front 
of him, thinking that he might quickly eviscerate there 
defenses, when in fact the attack was for the goblin behind 
him.  Having gruffly thrown the dying goblin to the side it had 
moved up behind him thinking to attack him unawares.  Ivan’s 
sword careened down on top of his skull, splitting it nearly in 
two.  He brought his sword back over his head, turned around 
as if he was being attacked from behind.  The two goblins 
now behind him stepped forward thinking him preoccupied.  
The first ones momentum alone impaled him on Ivan’s sword 
which he had slid between his arm to poke back out behind 
him.  It didn’t prevent Ivan from taking a hard club to the 
head from the second. But it did leave him with only one 
adversary.
        Shelly watched from the high ground.  She saw 
even from this distance the furry in Ivan’s stance and eyes.  
Her gray eyes surveyed the battle, as commander of the 5th 
Regiment of archers her duty was to her king, but that didn’t 
prevent her from keeping a watchful eye on her love.  
Granted she mused, it was an unrequited love, but none the 
less she felt it in her bosom, and that was enough for her.  
She raised her bow for another shot, using her other hand to 
signal for no one else to shoot.  At the last moment though 
she did not let fly, some things were better handled 
personally, and Ivan had taken a terrible loss.  Her heart flew 
out to him, and she kept warm thoughts in her mind.
        She turned left from Ivan and saw that what was 
left of Ruslan’s 2nd Calvary regiment, less than a score of 
riders had emerged victorious from the onslaught on the 
ogres.  A dozen men on foot now stood beside them as they 
evaluated the battle in from on them.  Through the smoke 
they could not see a mass of goblins descending upon them.  
Ruslan looked to the sky, always the consummate leader, but 
taking directions when needed.
        “Signal about face charge, 2nd Calvary”, barked 
Crown Prince Pystil.  His stern face sizing up the threat 
obviously deciding their force was enough to handle the 
threat.
        Shelly smiled grimly, from this vantage the battle 
looked well in hand.
        Ivan saw Ruslan signaling his men to turn about, and 
he hurried along to join back with their force.  He growled 
heavily as he mustered the strength to get there in time.  
He’d just arrived as the horses charged forward into an 
unseen enemy.  Running beside the troops who had also been 
dismounted, Ivan heard the clash as the mounts preceding 
him slammed into some force ahead of him.  Within seconds 
they reached the battle.  Goblins lay on the ground trampled 
by the passing of the horses.  They joined in the conflict as 
the remaining goblins regrouped.  In the back of his mind Ivan 
knew that Ruslan had his troop circling for another rake 
across this force.  The men on foot stayed in close quarters, 
a neat square to prevent from being inadvertently trampled 
beneath the feet of the oppressive mounts.  Like thunder he 
heard them coming.  Now he knew why the lines of goblins 
wavered at their approach.
        They joined the battle against the Goblins, hacking, 
slashing, and bludgeoning them to death.  They fell before 
there wake, and as they turned to flee the galloping riders 
came in for a final swoop decimating their ranks.  The men 
stood victorious on the battlefield, Ruslan looked again for a 
signal from on high.  But the only signal that came was battle 
over.
        The remaining forces of the invaders fled through 
the forest, they would be surprised indeed when they 
encountered the reserves that lay in wait for them there.  
The fleeing army would be annihilated.  Ensuring the 
continued stability of the region.  Ivan sighed aloud, and 
Ruslan looked down to him momentarily and surveyed the 
remnants of his force.  Triumphantly Ruslan raised his sword 
into the air, and his men cheered with all their might.
        King Harold stood stoically on the north bank, his 
two sons on either side on him on the east and west banks.  
For all their rivalry, indeed they were a goodly force to be 
reckoned with.  Pystil was the oldest by mere couple 
seconds, his brother Banner had followed shortly after.  It had 
been hard for them, their mother had died at childbirth, and 
he had not been terribly affectionate.  Deep down he 
resented that his love had died giving birth.  They had been 
robbed of their life of joy he and Ivanna had planned.  The 
death of their mother had also been a source of contention, 
Banner often receiving the brunt of it.  He was the smaller of 
the two, but the priests had said complications from having 
twins had lead to her demise.
        Prince Banner ordered a signal be sent to his 
father.  All that he surveyed was quiet, well except for the 
dying.  Their moans and infrequent screams could still be 
heard over din of the returning soldiers.  Prince Banner made 
arrangements for the injured men to be moved and treated by 
the priests.  Standing orders for any invader left alive was to 
summarily terminate them.
        The day was done.

Chapter Two:  The Long Trail

    The King’s keep stood just inside the northern wall of the 
city.  The outlying areas surrounding it, filled with shops and 
stores of various kinds, and several roads leading down to the 
docks.  As the men road and marched back into town, the 
townspeople cheered.  It had been a two-day march to get 
back to their homes, and the men and women that awaited 
them were loved ones, and friends.  Unable to break ranks 
until they were dismissed, they quietly accepted the blown 
kisses, friendly waves, and the flowers thrown their way.  
Nearly a quarter of the armed force did not return, and many 
wailed, and cast their eyes down.
    This had not been the first major movement of some 
unseen enemy machinations.  They had had two smaller 
battles this past year.  Some feared they were slowly being 
whittled down, to a point where an invading force would be 
able to march right into the commons and seize ownership of 
the small city.  Requests for reinforcements had been sent to 
local allies, the closest of which was a little over 2000 miles 
away.  A long time to request and a longer time in arriving.  
All feared that those reinforcements would not arrive in time, 
if indeed these attacks continued.
    The King’s voice bellowed and reverberated off the 
hallways.  His military advisors cringed, and his son’s 
grimaced.  He was not happy at all.  Before him laid out on 
the table was a map, a map that detailed the movements the 
invading forces planned on using all the way up to his front 
door.  What was of concern and had brought forth his 
exclamation were two rather large forces seen on the edge of 
the map.  One’s marching directly towards his city, and a 
second one to seal off any possibility for support from the 
west.  They had lost two days, since the return march had 
gotten them home, which would put the invading force less 
than 2 weeks away.
    “This is catastrophic” bellowed the King again.  But this 
time Banner responded as no others dared to interrupt the 
King.
    “M’Lord, we can send a small contingent to circumvent the 
second force and get word to Talin about it’s location and 
size, thereby making them forewarned and forearmed about 
it.  And with that achieved the invading force will be 
decimated between our combined forces.  The King eyed his 
son suspiciously, evaluating the plan for what it was worth, 
coming to same conclusion as his son did.  It was indeed their 
only solution.
    “He is right sire, if a small band can get through and 
around that sequestering force, Talin’s force should be able to 
circumvent the invaders forces without their knowledge and 
come to our aid in time.”  Raylei one of his chief advisors said 
to him.
    Crown Prince Pystil saw his moment to strike.  Standing 
from the table he proclaimed, as if it was his idea, that Prince 
Banner should lead that team to head to Talin’s force.  He 
smiled contently knowing he had just maneuvered his brother 
from the war ensuring the victories on the field would be 
attributed to him, and not his brother.
    Prince Banner flinched as if he had been hit as he realized 
what his brother’s plan was, but the King and the advisors all 
nodded to agree. And so it was that he would be the 
emissary to Talin.  With that settled the rest of the meeting 
involved the movement of troops in getting ready for the 
latest force coming from the north.  The King and his advisors 
laid out plans for their surprise attack, which should position 
the invaders a weeks march from the city.  Prince Banner 
listened, but his heart was not interested, he had been 
removed from the battle.  Summarily dismissed from his 
homeland and his only chance to attain his father’s 
appreciation, Banner resolved that he would simply do his 
best at the task assigned to him.
    The next morning the Banner rose early, and busied himself 
preparing for his journey long before the sun ever peaked over 
the ridges of the horizon.  When he was almost done, a 
courier entered carrying orders from his father to get 
prepared, and be at the staging ground by the horse stalls 
before the break of dawn. Banner silently rolled the orders 
backup, momentarily inspecting the seal he had broken.  It 
was of a dragon with his claw wrapped around a knight who 
was impaling it with his short lance.  The seal had broken 
right at the dragon’s hand, and Banner mused about how he 
felt as useless as this knight now bereft of his enemy.  The 
wax was still warm and the heat from his finger made the 
edge bevel. Tearing the seal off the parchment Prince Banner 
stowed the remnants in a pocket and grabbed his packed 
belongings heading to the door without another look or 
thought behind.
    The horses whinnied, and blustered as they were brought 
from their stalls.  Ivan saw Prince Banner as he approached.  
There were only six companions assigned to this perilous 
journey, and he was wondering why the Prince Banners 
presence was necessary at all.  He continued to quietly fit his 
saddle onto Moonies back, the mare had recently lost its 
rider.  Ivan patted her gently, and rubbed her mane to calm 
her down.
    “We are both nervous my dear, but together we shall make 
it through”, Ivan spoke softly into her ear.  Moonie turned her 
head and leveled her eye with Ivan’s face not blinking.  
Suddenly then as if acknowledging what he had said, she 
nuzzled him, and stepped forward getting closer.  Ivan 
chuckled softly, and finished suiting her up for the journey.
    Two soldiers came around the corner heading directly for 
the staging area, obviously intent on getting ready.  Ivan did 
not know them so he turned and faced then as they 
approached.  When they came to a stop they saluted, first 
Fradu then Brasna introduced themselves.  Stating their 
names and ranks they stood impassively. Having reported for 
duty Ivan dismissed them, allowing each to prepare for their 
journey.  Their mounts awaited them just on the inside of the 
elaborate barn. Both began to fit their mounts when the 
priest arrived.
    Brandigad was no normal priest. His attire would not have 
normally marked him as such except that on his shoulder 
embossed on the finely crafted leather you could see the 
mark of Denier.  The candle and glowing eye of knowledge 
stood out, but the rest of his attire made him look like any 
other foot soldier.  His appearance told Ivan that the King 
was taking no chances with the Princes welfare.
    “What’s next a wizard?” Fradu said under his breath.
    Brandigad greeted Ivan with a nod and walked to the stalls 
to obtain his mount.  All were about ready, merely double-
checking their rations, and provisions.  Ivan silently wondered 
where the sixth member was, just then the King entered with 
his entourage following.  They all bowed as he came closer, 
until they heard him command them to rise.
    The King looked about him, glad to see that all were 
prepared and ready to leave.  He motioned and a young 
female came from behind the entourage carrying a parcel.  
Banner’s temper flared, as he realized her role.  Her role was 
meant to be his role.  Not only would he not participate in the 
battle, he would not be the emissary of his Lord, his father.  
He turned around and faced his mount again covering his face 
before his father could see the outrage clearly marked on his 
features.
    Kila approached the group of men, Ivan could tell by the 
way she walked that she was unsure of her role, her 
confidence or rather lack thereof was evident in her 
staggered gate as she approached them.  He smiled warmly 
and greeted her with a handshake.  He instructed her to wait 
there, and that he would saddle her mount for her.  She 
smiled warmly and graciously thanked him.
    The King noticed his son’s intent look on his horse as he 
purposely ignored him.  He calmly turned to Ivan and nodded 
firmly, secure that Ivan would ensure all of their safety as 
they carried out this critical mission.  He looked back around 
at the gathered group, wished them well.  He then turned and 
left, never having met eyes with Banner that morning.
    Banner continued to fidget with his horse’s stirrups, after 
he heard his father turn the corner he turned around and 
climbed atop his steed.  Brandigan followed suit, as Ivan 
brought forth Kila’s mount, he held the reigns as Brasna 
helped her on top of the proud mare.  When Brasna was done 
Fradu handed back him his mounts reigns and mounted his 
horse.  Ivan looked around from the top of his mount as 
Brandigan settled in, holding his hand up to get their 
attention.  Making a quick motion forward the companions set 
out of their way.  There was no farewell parade for them, 
they quietly left the city walls, galloping away from the rising 
sun.
    By midday they had made a good pace, steadily galloping 
along, heading west with the rising sun gathering momentum 
behind them.  It shined brightly on the tops of their heads as 
they went along.  The forest loomed ahead of them, it’s 
ominous presence noticeable.  It was an old wood, the trees 
large and forbidding, like a last bastion against the wave of 
humanity expanding in this region.  They all felt uneasy 
entering but it seemed Kila felt the most disturbed of them all.
    She kept fidgeting, tugging at her hair, and looking about 
worriedly.  Ivan noticed and spurred his mount forward till he 
had Moonie trotting abreast with her.  He looked at her 
calmly, and nodded as her eyes met his.  She seemed to calm 
from then on, and the prince mused about Ivan’s ability to 
calm her.  How easily it had been for him to get her to settle 
down with only a look.  The prince acknowledged to himself 
that it was a sign of leadership to have that quality.
    The sun became blocked out as they entered the forest 
completely.  The canopy of leaves stealing the rays of sun 
from the companions.  The horses snorted and snickered as it 
darkness descended.  When Brasna looked at Ivan, Ivan 
realized they had all slowed down unconsciously.  He 
straightened his shoulders, and looked about before saying 
anything.
    “Alright let’s keep up the pace”, he said and prodded his 
mount into a gallop.   The others followed suit, and they soon 
took off letting their fear propel them forward not slowing 
them down.  They rode on into the afternoon well into the 
night.  The sun had set a couple hours ago, but the twilight 
had been powerful enough for them to keep going.  Ivan 
called for a stop, and they all slowed down into a walk and 
then a full stop.
    As they made camp, Banners anger came back to him.  He 
fumed and muttered to himself about Kila and refused to even 
make eye contact with her.  From the side of their makeshift 
camp, Brasna called to Ivan and volunteered to take first 
watch.  Ivan declined and stated that the Prince would take 
the first round.  The prince upon hearing this development 
stopped.  His mouth dropped as his stunned expression moved 
across his face.  Ivan leaned in speaking only to him.
    “The first watch is the easiest since you are already 
awake m’lord.” Ivan stated in a warm camaraderie way.  
    It made sense to Banner although he had never had to 
stand guard before.  He nodded in ascent and made his way 
to the edge of the camp, and stood watching them as they 
all prepared for the night of rest.  Shortly after they had all 
settled down though, the prince saw Brandigad coming into 
camp.  The prince pondered what he could have been doing 
outside the camp, realizing he had assumed the lump of 
blankets he had seen was the priest already in bed.  He 
silently inspected from this distance the rest of the bundles 
to ensure that each member was indeed there.  About two 
hours later Brasna rose from his light slumber and stretched.  
The prince eyed him, but continued to look out and around 
the camp.  When Brasna was completely awake he came to 
the prince.
    “I think I will continue watch tonight from up on that knoll, 
it may give me a better view of the camp and the surrounding 
area.” Brasna stated evenly with no sarcasm in his voice.  
Banner suddenly realized that from his vantage point an entire 
company could surprise them simply by coming on the north 
side hidden by the small hill and trees.   They both walked to 
the new point, and talked for a bit before he retired.  He was 
humbled but that did not mean he should be indignant about 
it.  As he thought that he suddenly realized that was exactly 
what he was doing with Kila.  She had had nothing to do with 
the inner politics of his family, and yet he was taking it out on 
her.  He had always promised himself that he would not be 
this way, since he would never be king.  Brasna continued to 
talk for a moment longer until he realized the prince had 
stopped listening.
    “You are tired m’lord, perhaps rest is best instead of my 
meandering thoughts”, he grinned as he said it.  The prince 
returning from his reverie, looked and looked at Brasna.  He 
shook his hand, looked him the eyes and said, “perhaps you 
are right Brasna, I am tired, good night”.  And with that he 
walked on down to the encampment, wrapping the blankets 
tight against him and fell quickly asleep.
    A few hours later an explosion jerked Brasna to complete 
alertness.  He stared dumbfounded at the crimson pulp that 
remained of one goblin scout.  It’s companion following fast 
behind it.  Brasna’s companions were leaping from their once 
prone positions to fighting stances.  None of them seem to 
see the second goblin leaping over it’s fallen comrades corpse 
as it ran towards the camp. It did not look behind him, or 
make any motions for others to follow which told Brasna this 
was alone now.  Slowly he positioned his crossbow, bracing 
his shoulder against the tree so that his shot would be true.  
All his movements were slow and sure, preventing himself 
consciously of rushing and loosing the target.  The goblin got 
closer to the camp and was almost upon Kila.  The goblin 
raised a wickedly curved blade, no doubt poison etched.
    Brasna pulled the trigger, and in the blink of an eye, the 
bolt had flown across the way in between the prince and Kila 
and embedded itself through the goblins eye and into its 
brain.  It didn’t even manage a yelp, falling backwards it’s 
weapon being flung through the air harmlessly.  Ivan ran to 
the fallen monster, quickly inspected the now dead goblin, 
and signaled Brasna that it was dead.  A moment later after 
having searched the corpse to find nothing Ivan crossed the 
way to Brasna.  A few moments later after no more came to 
attack Ivan stated they were moving.
    “No doubt we are only a mile or so on the flank of the 
army”, Ivan said.  Brasna nodded and with All urgency began 
mobilizing the camp.  Ivan held Brandigans arm at the elbow, 
nodded in appreciation.  His warding glyphs had no doubt 
saved at least some of their lives Ivan thought, not least of 
which was the Prince Banners who was in direct line of attack.
    They broke camp within 5 minutes and moved silently 
through the forest for the rest of the night.  They proceeded 
along the general direction of the road, but remained off it 
since there was no telling who else might be about.  Two 
days later without further incident they emerged from the 
forest and all breathed a sigh of relief.  They paused a 
moment to survey the land.
    “How much farther do you think before we will meet up 
with the force from Talin”, Banner turned and asked Ivan.
    “I believe once through the Cairn’s Pass, we will encounter 
them”, Ivan said after he had stood for a moment paused in 
thought, looking upon the distant mountain range.  The white 
capped mountains revealed a thin whispering spray that 
painted the sky in small brush strokes.
    “Let’s move then for we have brethren that will die before 
we even make it back” said Fradu as he looked nervously 
back at the forest.  They all nodded their heads in agreement 
and made out at a full gallop.
    The sun drooped down lazily, and the moon spied them as 
they began their ascent into Cairn’s Pass.  They rode on 
under the moonlight for a few more hours until Ivan raised his 
hand signaling for a halt.  All seemed normal as they made 
camp.  Banner was just settling into his blankets when he 
caught the signal from the corner of his eye from Frandu to 
Brasna, and from Brasna to Ivan.  Each went in a different 
direction suddenly, racing back down the pass they had just 
come up.  Just around the bend the stunned companions 
heard shouts and a burst of metal on metal as swords joined.  
A moment later They returned with someone in tow.  Slender 
in build with a short bow on her back.  Ivan wore a sincere 
frown as he came back into camp.  Banner was stunned when 
he identified the interloper.  Shelly had a grim frown on her 
face as she entered the camp.
    “How did you know I was”, Shelly began to ask when Ivan 
interrupted her.
    “Your echoes gave you away when we had stopped 
moving”, he stated bluntly.  From the look on Shelly’s face 
the prince knew she had thought as much.
    Ivan turned and faced her completely, “You should not 
have come, we have enough to accomplish our mission.”
    Shelly winced at the remark, but retorted none the 
less, “Should not, or you would prefer not?”
    Ivan looked at Shelly for a long moment, the companions 
around the camp shuffled trying vainly not to hear or notice 
the tension between the two.  Finally when he spoke, his 
voice was like gravel being grounded out, crumbling into dust.
    “This is neither the time nor the place for this discussion.”  
He said flatly.
    Shelly’s face marked obviously the hurt the remark had 
made, she turned about and grabbed the reins of her horse 
gruffly from Brasna.  Turning about and walking to the edge of 
their camp, she removed her mounts saddle and began to 
settle down.  Suddenly she turned her voice barely audible to 
any but Ivan.
    “If you think I will let go of the only thing that makes 
sense to me my love, then you are dead wrong.” And with 
that said she wrapped up tightly in her blankets and sulked.
    Ivan grimaced as he turned back to face the others, who 
quickly began busing themselves as if nothing had happened 
or been heard.
    Frandu took the first watch that night. He climbed up the 
side of the pass, and silently watched his sleeping 
companions.

The Crown Prince: Chapter Three – Only the silent hear

    Shelly watched idly as Frandu whittled a small statue.  She
 marveled at his concentration level.  The camp was breaking 
up as his carved, his pack at his feet.  He waited patiently, 
their routine set in stone.

  It had been two weeks since they had left their home, and 
three days since they had met with the contingent from 
Talin.  The elves had silently crept upon them in the night.  If 
they had not been allies, they would all have been dead in 
seconds.  It was a chilling fact that hardened Shelly’s resolve.
    As Shelly jammed the remaining contents of her bedroll into 
her backpack and slung it over her shoulder, Banner noticed 
her level of irritation.  He wondered if she was still upset over 
her and Ivan’s confrontation when she joined the 
companions.  He had not noticed any other instances, or 
outbreaks since then.  However, they had both disappeared a 
couple times, only to return silently at the edge of the camp.
    Banner had never witnessed a man and woman exchanging 
concerns for each other before now.  His mother having died 
while giving birth to him had robbed him of the only chance. 
Glumly he folded the blanket in his hand into a neat square.  
The royal emblem frayed on the edges after the hardships out 
in the wilderness.
    Granted he had seen his father make arrangements for 
companionship in court.  Banner frowned at that thought, his 
father thought himself so subtle.  But banner knew the truth, 
his father was glad to be free of his mothers yoke.  He had 
never remarried, and Banner knew it was because his father’s 
appetite was insatiable, and so base he had no use for 
women beyond a physical object.
    Ivan paused briefly as he surveyed the packing status of 
the companions.  He shook his ever so ruefully as he 
pondered the look of discord on banner’s face.  The emotions 
rolled over the young ones face, like waves upon a beach.  
Ivan wondered if even Banner could keep up with that tumult. 
Or better yet, under that constant erosion if truth was ever 
apparent to the boy.  Ivan doubted if Banner’s concept of 
reality matched anyone here with him.  It was a wonder to 
Ivan that banner was able to even speak conversationally 
since his upbringing in the court had tainted his concept of 
reality.
    Ivan glanced briefly again as the rest of the companions 
finished their packing, and mounted their rides.  Horses 
snorted in the brisk morning air.  The horse’s breath plumed 
out into the world as white smoke.  Frandu’s sculpture of the 
@#%$ of luck cast a small shadow, as they road into the early 
morning sunrise.  A small figure leaping from the edge of a 
cliff, the other side unseen; was all that remained of the army 
that passed through the glade.  The figure and the trampled 
grass marked their silent passage.
    Ilmoreth road a large wolf, his mail would normally shine in 
the sun’s glare was subdued by a tint.  Ivan wondered if it 
was achieved by a spell or by some other means.  He 
cataloged the question for some other time.  More important 
issues were at hand, as the small vanguard company raced to 
the battlefield.  The corpses stood deep on the battlefield 
between the invaders and the defenders.  Days of battle had 
decimated them both, leaving the invaders with more 
smoldering campfires than the defenders.
    “We are arrived in time to aid the king”, Ilmoreth shouted 
over the din of the trampling feet of their mounts.  His words 
mixed with the musical overtones that all elven speech 
entailed.
    Cries from the right side of the vanguard alerted Ivan of 
the trouble the King faced.  A large army was flanking the 
remainder of the king’s forces.  Soon they would be engulfed 
in a tide and wash them away completely.  The moment Ivan 
had dreaded had come upon him.  Duty and honor compelled 
him to race to his king’s side, yet prudence stipulated he stay 
and await the reinforcements. If he charged into battle now, 
his death would mean nothing, nothing more than a small ant 
squashed in the wake of wagon’s wheel.  He gnashed his 
teeth, hours lay be between them and the Talin force.
    The orcs cried out a roar that echoed for miles upon miles 
and accelerated their decent onto the King.  Like two 
opposing waves that became one writhing upheaval they 
collided.  The clash of armor was like a clap of lightning, 
followed by rolling thunder.  The scene was gruesome Ivan 
averted his gaze.  The people dying down there were his 
countrymen, friends, and family. 
    Twenty minutes later another small company arrived.  
Comprised of warriors and the rest of Ivan’s company.  
Ilmoreth noticed the look of horror on Prince banner’s face.  
That chagrinned outrage that spoke more words that the 
prince would utter in a lifetime.  Ilmoreth barked orders, and 
both companies solidified into one, and began it’s descent into 
battle.
    At first they started at a slow trot, each person gauging 
their speed from the person next to them.  Their heartbeats 
beating faster, and their pace naturally picking up as the got 
closer.  Into a full run they ran headlong into the flank of the 
reinforcements.  The howl of surprise from the orcs, mixed in 
with the battle cry of the elves and humans.  Not only did it 
serve to alert the King of their arrival, it served doubly as a 
warning to all tuskers between them and their intended 
destination.
    The King stood silently among his remaining warriors.  So 
few now were they that he could see the orcs in detail.  Their 
raging faces frothing trying to get at him and decimate his 
meager army.  His son stood by him, proud and sure of their 
victory.  When the King heard the roar over the din of swords 
and the screams of the dying he knew instantly what it 
signaled.  Hope had entered the arena of war.  He lifted his 
arm, his sword held high signaling a charge to their rear.  
Veteran soldiers understood immediately.  His order was 
conveyed through their ranks, and they mustered for a final 
charge.  Crown Prince Pystil stayed close to his father’s side, 
trying to catch his father’s attention desperately.  But he 
could tell but the look that he saw.  His father had hope he 
didn’t understand where that hope had come from.  But after 
a week of battle frenzy, and despair the change was not only 
wanted it was heralded.  The Prince stood taller on his horse, 
shouting orders for cleaner ranks.
  They charged into the foray.  The orc count of dead was 
unfathomable, as knights hacked and slashed their indomitable 
way to the rear.  When it happened, it was sudden and 
brutal, like nothing the prince had ever felt before.  Granted 
he had heard tell that if you listen you would always here it 
coming.  But he had been busy slashing the throat of a tusker.
    He first heard the sound of his armor being pierced.  That 
awkward sound as metal split, the screeching sound as it 
gaped and the shaft penetrated.  He envisioned the chain 
mail links spreading, followed by the biting tip of the shaft as 
it entered his soft flesh.  The flame was instant, and the 
burning furious.  He heard himself scream.  So familiar it 
sounded, the scream of the dying.  Weightlessly he fell from 
his steed.  He saw the ground racing towards him like an 
anxiously awaiting mother with open arms.  Ruefully he 
chuckled as he rolled to his side, the fever already engulfing 
him.  He had been too busy to listen, far from silent he had 
been.  His life had been full of sound and fury, and in the end 
it had signified absolutely nothing.
    He looked to the sky and mouthed, “I’m sorry father”, and 
slumped to his death.  Only the silent hear in the end though 
is anyone ever really paying attention.

By the way... when I say it needs editing, I don't necessarily mean that you need to lower the word count, unless you feel that it needs it. In my opinion it just needs some minor grammatical corrections, but otherwise its got a good plot and good layout. Myself, I just read mine over until it flows and makes good sense, but whatever works for you.
