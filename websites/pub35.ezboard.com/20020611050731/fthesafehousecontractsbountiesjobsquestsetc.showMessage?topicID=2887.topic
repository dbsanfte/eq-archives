Wow...</span><hr size=1> Copied from <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">eq.castersrealm.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>What is the EverQuest Legends Target Reservation System? <br><br>It's a service provided with your Legends subscription to allow fair play and planning for higher end content of EverQuest. <br><br>What does a guild need to do to be part of the reservation system? <br><br>The ability to be part of the reservation system will involve passing the appropriate Trial of Heroes for the Tier your guild wishes to be part of and sending in the required reservations requests and weekly reports. <br><br>What days can you reserve a target on the system? <br><br>The reservation system will begin on Wednesday when the server comes live (or 12 Noon Pacific, whichever is applicable) and will end on Saturday evening at 11 PM Pacific. <br><br>What happens on days not recognized by the reservation system? <br><br>From Saturday after 11 PM Pacific until Wednesday at 12 Noon Pacific, all listed targets will be viewed as &quot;free for all&quot;. Any spawn disputes during these times will be handled in accordance with the Play Nice Policies as normal. <br><br>What will happen if a guild ignores the reservation and kills something my guild has reserved? <br><br>The Legends staff will strictly enforce violations of the reservation system. In the unfortunate event someone chooses to ignore the system it will be treated like any other breech of Terms of Service.. <br><br>What happens if we reserve a target and it does not spawn during the allotted time? <br><br>A reservation of an encounter does not guarantee it will be up for engagement. However the target is yours until your guild has slain said target during the reservation days or the reservation time is over. Scheduled maintenance and emergency downtime will advance the rotation should the target come up, be slain and come back up again in the days of enforcement. <br><br>Once my guild has been accepted to the reservation system how do we make a reservation for the four-day block? <br><br>All reservations will be made via email to LegendsRS@soe.sony.com beginning Saturday at 2 PM Pacific Time and closing Monday at 10 PM Pacific Time. Only the guild leader or a designated officer may submit the guild's requests. Each guild will be restricted to having one person in charge of sending this email. <br><br>How many encounters can be reserved? <br><br>A guild can request reservation of any of the Targets from the Tier they are registered for and down. A guild that is registered for Tier 8 may request reservation for any of the targets in the system. <br><br>What is to keep a guild from recruiting and making it to a high tier standing and then falling apart but still taking spawns in the rotation? <br><br>Any guild that fails to slay any of their reserved targets in two consecutive weeks, for whatever reason, will be moved down a Tier. <br><br>What is to keep a guild from &quot;temp&quot; guilding members in order to pass a Trial in order to be able to reserve additional targets? <br><br>EverQuest servers log guild movement activities. Any significant guild movement can lead to an investigation into whether a guild is engaging in such activity. Based on the results of our investigation and our sole discretion to uphold the intent and spirit of the Target Reservation System, such activity could lead to disciplinary action on the involved accounts. <br><br>What will happen if two guilds request the same target during a week? <br><br>Rotation of targets over as many weeks as there are applicants will be set in the Bazaar via /random by a GM. Once the first guild has been set randomly, it will proceed through the other guilds that requested the target in alphabetical order until all guilds have had one reservation for the target. Then, the target will come open again for reservation. <br><br>What about encounters not listed on the target list? <br><br>Any target not listed is deemed &quot;free for all&quot; and can be engaged by any group during the calendar week, as things were prior to this system. Please be advised that the list of targets for the Reservation System is subject to change. <br><br>What if a guild asks to reserve a target they cannot kill? <br><br>Target reservation will be done through a tier system. Guilds can only reserve targets that are in their tier or below. Guilds must pass a Trial of Heroes to be admitted into a tier. <br><br>Can you still do joint raids? <br><br>Guilds can join to take down larger opponents. However, parties wishing to run a joint raid on a target above their own tier level must pass a trial for the tier with the guild or guilds who will be assisting them. Trials may be restricted in the number of people who may participate. <br><br>For example: Guild A and Guild B cannot take down Tunare by themselves. Guild A and Guild B schedule a trial and together pass the trial for the tier Tunare is on. Now Guild A and B can ask for reservation of Tunare but the two guilds would share one slot on that tier's rotation. <br><br>What about the Planes, Lord Nagafen or Lady Vox? Why are they not on the rotation list? <br><br>The planes of Hate, Fear, Air and Growth are not on enforced rotation. We will list them as well as the old world dragons for informational purposes only. Any group who wishes to list their intent to adventure in these areas or go after Lord Nagafen or Lady Vox may make their intention known on the weekly Reservation System Post. However, this will not insure that the group making the listing will have exclusive rights to these areas or targets. The listing is to help facilitate others in planning their activities and foster communication between groups who wish to do the same thing at the same time. <br><br>You can keep abreast of any further changes to this FAQ at the official website located here.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujolla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jolla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/20/02 12:37:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2887.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant enforced spawn rotation on Legends!
