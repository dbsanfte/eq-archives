My building has t1 access that it buys from VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University), and VCU has several ports blocked to maximize available bandwidth, i.e. no online gaming.<br>  I guess that means that ol' iniigo is getting shelfed... again.  He'll probably make a comeback down the road someday though; kick a little ass, take a few names, and then I can make my fourth and final retirement hall thread.  Anyway goodbye everyone then I've crossed paths with on the Cazic Thule Server.<br><br>   It really annoys me that I have to quit though; I dont want to get off on a rant here, but....<br>DAMN VCU, DAMN THEM STRAIGHT TO @#%$ HELL.(note: I didnt reread this, or check grammar or spelling; you can die if you dont like it,)<br>Sure, I go there, and they're giving me an education.. err I'm paying them for an education, but this is the second time they have @#%$ me.  The first thing they did was buy my lease on my old apartment and effectively kick my ass out of the building because they pretty much @#%$ buy every @#%$ building within their radius of evil for no reall good reason.  I can't imagine they need any more dorms, they built 2 and bought 2 more dorm buildings last year.  I don't know why in the bloody hell they bought my building.<br>  It probably wouldn't be too terrible if they had given us more notice that they were throwing us out on our asses, but the heads of evil at the university seem to find it amusing when people get @#%$ over. <br>  OK, sure I laugh at other peoples misfortunes, but we're not talking about other people.  We're talking about me here, and when I have to deal with @#%$ like this, it's not funny.. because it's me and not you.  Besides,  this is my goddamned retirement thread so I'll say whatever I @#%$ want.<br>  They only gave us 3 months to move out, but they also made it so we cant cancel our lease early.  I.E.,  we have to move out before june 31, but if we move out before june we still have to pay for june's rent.  It's nearly impossible to find a place to live near campus (which is in the capital city of Richmond), but even more impossible to find one with only 3 months before the fall semester.  DAMN VCU, DAMN THEM RIGHT IN THE EYE!<br>  So, after lots of looking , I find a place.  But I had to move in on may 1st, so that means I'm paying 2 rents for 2 months.  It's also a bit further away then the old building; it's fringe to far to walk now.  The two rents mean I need to work a lot more, which means I can't take summer classes like I planned, which means @#%$ YOU VCU.  If VCU was a person, I would pray that an anvil would EXPLODE his stupid head. DIE VCU!<br>  Now I live in the new building, where all utilites are included, and that includes T1.  The T1 was the main choosing point in moving to this building which is further out then some other places that also had openings in may.  VCU owns the T1 and loans it to our apartment.  VCU hoards bandwidth like how rosie o'donnel hoards cupcakes; you're lucky to get crumbs.  I can't play online games or use many many internet downloading tools.  Without the gaming or downloading, I'm not really sure what the point of having a T1 is.  It really doesnt make much sense and for that I hope the personification of VCU gets stabbed in the face with a sharpened broom covered in genital herpes discharge.  DIE VCU!<br>   <p><Center><img src=http://injijo.homestead.com/files/meowMFer.jpg><br><font color=white>¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤      <font color=black>mojo <font color=white>inji<font color=black>Jo-Jojojo <font color=white>    ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤<BR><font color=red><I>        The <b>Lord</b> of <B>Scary!<br>I make </i>Grown Up <i>Jebus cry!!<b/></I></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uinjijo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>injijo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://injijo.homestead.com/files/10x10.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/23/02 1:03:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/02 12:40:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=633.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: forced retirement.. stealth rant: &quot;DIE VCU&quot;</span><hr size=1> /sniff<br><br>Bye Injijo.
