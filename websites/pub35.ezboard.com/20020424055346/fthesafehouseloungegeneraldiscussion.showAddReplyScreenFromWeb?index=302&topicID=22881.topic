<br>
would have the same thing, but it doesnt.(but we already know that)<br>
so, i looked at the way sony does their urls, and linking off their previous expansion main pages, to &quot;about&quot; pages about expansions .and tried<br>
things like:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/screenshots.jsp">everquest.station.sony.co...nshots.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<br>
in anticipation that they had a whole PoP site up, with a false front page.<br>
<br>
also tried doing the same things with www.planesofpower.com<br>
all i can get is the index.<br>
but there HAS to be a site somewhere! that guy's desktop show's it plain and clear! i just cant find it =/<br>
anyone have any suggestions? either he hasnt uploaded it yet, or he's hiding it in a false directory somewhere on the sites.<br>
<br>
also,<br>
planesofpower.net<br>
and planesofpower.org both feature the same thing as planesofpower.com...<br>
the thing im curious about, is everquest.net, and everquest.org were registered far after everquest was released. and everquest2.net, and .org have yet to be taken. so why would sony register 3 domains, for the sole purpose of a single expansion? when they wouldnt even take the time to register more than a single domain for the whole game, or it's predacessor. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=letifer>Letifer</A> at: 3/21/02 6:30:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujarnin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/21/02 7:11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22881.topic&index=304>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interofficenetworks.com/demo/doh/jarninface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wraa</span><hr size=1> My take on the storyline for EQ: PoP.<br>
<br>
A long time ago, Rallos Zek created the Giants, Ogres, Ankexfen, and Orcs. They were all very powerful warriors and magic users, so powerful that they eventually learned of alternate planes.<br>
They learned how to enter these planes, and the first they ventured into was the Plane of Earth. They attacked the Council of Rathe, and fought long and hard, but each time they thought they had defeated the Lord of Earth, another would pop in his place. Confused and losing fast, the raiding force retreated back to Norrath.<br>
<br>
Rallos Zek looked down at his broken minions in disgust. They were indeed powerful, but they lacked a strong general to lead them on the battlefield. Rallos left his Plane of War, and teleported himself to his defeated army.<br>
He convinced them to follow him into battle, and he would lead them to victory. So again, the force had their Ankexfen and Ogre mages create portals to the Plane of Earth, this time with Rallos Zek, God of War leading them.<br>
<br>
Again they confronted The Rathe, Lords of Earth, and once again, when they thought they had defeated him, another would show up in it's stead. Rallos' army was again being beaten back, and retreat looked like it was inevitable. And that's when Rallos Zek dove into battle with his minions.<br>
They defeated another of the Rathe Council, and then another. And when it looked like they would actually defeat the 13 member of Rathe, the Gods of Power appeared.<br>
<br>
The Gods of Power; Fennin Ro, Tarew Marr, Povar, E`Ci and Xegony, with but a few gestures ended the battle. <br>
Rallos Zek was banished from the Plane of Earth, and a barrier was errected around the Planes of Power, locking them off from all other planes of existance. No lesser god would ever challenge a God of Power again. <br>
The remaining Army of Zek were sent back to Norrath to await judgement from the Rathe Council.<br>
<br>
The first judgement was passed on the Giants. Their cities in the northlands were buried in snow, and a powerful storm of ice and wind swept over their lands. The Giants deserted their homelands, and set sail to find a new land they could call home.<br>
When their armada was nearing the shores of Kunark, Xegony conjured a storm, and Tarew Marr assaulted the ships with massive waves. The Giant armada was split; half of the ships crashing on the shores of Kunark, and the other half caught in a storm which was taking them south. When the storm ended, the Giants found themselves stranded on the coast of Velious. <br>
After leaving their homeland, which had been tranformed into an arctic wasteland, they found themselves stranded on the frozen wastelands of Velious.<br>
<br>
The second judgement passed would be that the Ankexfen; Rallos Zek's powerful magic users, would be split into their elements and reformed into a less powerful race. <br>
Each of the Gods of Power came forward and created a species of what are know known as Goblins.<br>
E`Ci's goblin clan would take over the former Giant cities in the northlands. <br>
The Rathe created the slime goblins. He planted them deep in the mountains of Norrath, that they would keep guard over. Brell Serilis was placed in charge of watching over these goblins of Earth.<br>
Tarew Marr's goblin clan would be cast to the oceans of Norrath, and watch over the seas.<br>
The last of Rathes judgement on what was the Ankexfen, was that the Goblin clans have no memory of their crimes or punishments, and more importantly, they lost their ability to keep a written history.<br>
<br>
The third judgement of the Gods of Power were against the Ogre race. Many were slain instantly, and those that survived gave up their powerful magics in fear that they to would be slain. The Rathe Council placed a curse on the Ogres, damning them into stupidity and ignorance. They would never again travel to alternate planes.<br>
<br>
Watching from his Plane of Sun, Solusek Ro was angry that the Rathe council was being so harsh with his son, Rallos Zek. In a spite of rage, Solusek raised the serpant's spine mountains, and the entire area grew drier each year.<br>
The Elven city of Takish`Hiz was in dire trouble. With their lush farmlands becoming desert, they would no longer be able to provide food for their people.<br>
The Elves called apon their greatest druids, to use their magics to fight back the heat and sand, but it only delayed the inevitable. They would have to leave their capital city, and found a new one. They crossed the the ocean to the east, and landed on the shores of Faydwer.<br>
Tunare, Mother of Growth was angered by Solusek Ro's actions towards her children, and has a serious resentment towards him and his followers since.<br>
To stop his sons rebelion against the Gods of Power, Fennin Ro's clan of Fire Goblins would passed down to his son Solusek, and they would reside in a city near his temple as guardians.<br>
<br>
The Final judgement was on the Orc clans. They were cursed to be lost without leadership, and were subsequently forced into slavery by the Ogres.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thus endeth the history lesson. Or at least what I've read and pasted together from memory.<br>
It would seem that the Curse of Gods of Power is ending. The Ogres have gotten some of their former glory back, and the Giants have gained back their tactical skills.<br>
I don't think it's possible for the goblins to mutate, or evolve back into their former forms; Ankexfen. More likely they're stuck being goblins. Now, they might get their abilities to remember what they once were, and that could be interesting.<br>
<br>
The Planes of Power will be a great addition to the game. It will make up for the lack of high level content in comparison to the midlevel and low level content.<br>
It will also open up many of the current raid zones that are always packed to the brim.<br>
I can't wait to hear the announcement.<br>
<br>
Oh, and for all you posters talking about bugs in Luclin, and unfinished zones, look at it like this:<br>
<br>
VI has 2-3 teams of programmers working on different aspects of the game. <br>
The &quot;Live Team&quot; works on fixing bugs in the &quot;Live Game&quot;. That, and possibly retrofit the old world zones with updated content.<br>
The &quot;Dev Team&quot; developes new content for Everquest, including expansions, new free zones and retrofitting and updating old zone content.<br>
Then there is the team I like to refer to as the &quot;X-Team&quot;. They're the ones working on EQ2 and adapting new software to the current game and to EQ2.<br>
<br>
So don't get your panties in a bunch. They have plenty of people working on bugs and new content and old content. Stuff will get fixed, added, and expanded. They just have a list they have to work with.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 Planes of Power as a new expansion seems logical.<br>
<br>
 EverQuest without character transfers does not, hear me out.<br>
<br>
Think about Luclin and how they upgraded the Engine and Graphics, they can keep the same character base and such and change stuff on a big level... There will come a time where they will do a massive AI update that will fix the pathing bugs and maybe the 1k heal Gate mobs =p<br>
<br>
If people want to experience a &quot;fresh&quot; new game of EQ2, I believe that Verant would applease both sides of the people population and have some NEW servers for those who want to start fresh.   <p>--Gennai Obitchy

<br>
I'm also guessing they lost many a subscriber due to the enormous upgrades required to play the new expansion. Some kiddies out there just couldnt play any more and daddy wasnt gonna spend his money on the upgrades.<br>
<br>
I dont think Verant has an issue with losing customers. As a matter of fact if they didnt have someone working on the hypothetical-loss-of-customers-should-we-do-X then i'd be surprised. Of course its not thier intention to lose customers but all this talk of &quot;they would lose so many customers&quot; is, Im sure, something they have considered. It's what they call &quot;acceptable casualties&quot;, heheh!<br>
<br>
But it's just an expansion i'm sure.<br>
