I started a few weeks after Ruins of Kunark came out, saw the pretty package on the shelf of Electronics Boutique and decided to try it out. After killing 2 bats in Qhills and dying to a skeleton at the 'uber' ruins, I was hooked.<br><br>My first character was a half elf druid. Got up to level 11 and restarted as a Wood elf. I started a wood elf ranger here, Pyrocat Moonstalker, and leveled him up to 20. First character with a last name :)  Ahhh, we had some good times on Wisp isle pyro..<br><br>Well by now my ELF druid was 16 but I decided to reroll AGAIN and started as a Halfling :)  That was Traverse Moonstalker and he's 51 now. I've had some good times with him.<br><br>When Trav was about level 30, hunting in CT and whatnot, I started up a rogue. I've always played a rogue at some point in the MUDs and other RPGs I had played, so I figured I'd give it a try here. I started a Gnome rogue and got him to 17, but I had started him on another server and eventually gave him up to go back to Prexus. There I started Blackitty, a half elven rogue, who actually was a partial mule for some loot I had obtained in ToFS<br><br>Well, Blackitty was a lot more fun then my short spellcasting druid (Who I still continued to play, just less often) and I worked hard on getting him some gnome skin and loot from Tower of Frozen Shadows. After he had a full suit of Gnome Skin and a few lowbie daggers, I decided that I didn't want to waste my time getting him loot with my druid and just play him myself. <br><br>He started his half-elven life in Freeport, exploring the sewers and avoiding the shadowknights, trying out the crappy newbies quests in Freeport. Velious was just recently released at this time so I was eager to level him up to 35, the 'min level' for velious. I spent the first few levels in the Commonlands, listening to the auctions of all the wonderful items I would never have (or so I thought) and killing orcs with abandon. In fact my first real quest<br><br>When I had reached the 14th level I went to Highpass and thus began my time in the best area in Norrath. Traverse had spent a few levels here and had won a Shralok Pack (this started his collection of WT reducing bags, he still had 6 wt reduce bags). I had lots of fun killing the gnolls that had defiled my first druids corpse in Blackburrow many times. Different clans, but the same blue bodies :) <br><br>After obtaining the level of 16 I got invited into the highly praised Orc Group and lots of experiance was had for all. Not to mention the orcs pockets were slightly lighter by the time their bodies hit the floor ;evil;<br><br>I met the first rogue twink in orc group, an actually really nice person who had a level 55 necro main. Full rygorr, at level 15! Spine Chill Spear, OMG! Well, by this time I had been collecting lots of cashf rom the orcs/gnolls/whatever monster I came across and had spent some time in EC buying and selling (I had become an amazingly good salesmen by the time I was lvl 17). So I ended up blowing all my money on a full set of ravenscale, which turned into Rygorr, which turned into various mid level items, which turned into Dragonhide armor, which turned into what I have now :)  But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's go back to highpass.<br><br>I had some great times in highpass and was soon level 20. I had been considering a last name since level 10 and quickly /surname Pantheramoon ed myself. Cheering with glee I sped off towards highkeep, where I would spend the next 11 levels.<br><br>I had never been in a goblin group before, or even seen goblins like this. Happily I wet my Jade Chokadi Prod with goblin blood and started some friendly coversations in OOC. I kept killing goblins and goblins and more goblins till they learned to fear the very mention of my name. I had lots of friendly conversations in OOC but even more unfriendly coversations, contesting spawns, camps, and whatnot. I had more GM interaction in that zone then I've had in the rest of my life. Well, I learned something about controlling my anger and learning the rules of the law in that zone. I can still get angry, but I fight back by making the person look bad or enraging them to the point that <i>they</i> start acting stupidly and outside the 'law'.<br><br>Whew, that was a long paragraph. Anyways, I had become a famed goblin killer by the time I left highkeep and moved on to not so greener pastures. When I started my factioning in Nurga they too learned to fear my name. But again I am getting ahead of myself.<br><br>I spent some time in Unrest, Runnyeye, Befallen (that sucked), ToFS, CC, and many other dungeons in my career, but never stayed in them as long as the zones like Highpass. Lack of people and hard CRs made me avoid dungeons when I was looking for EXP, but love them for crawling.<br><br>On guilds, I seemed to run through them like the ever dwindling supply of pepsi in my fridge. I've been in Lords of Honor (disband), Dark Divinity (most everyone left) Flamboyant Swashbucklers (Too few people, but good RPers), Stasis, and many others. They were (mostly) all nice people but I kept moving on for some reason. The last guild I was in was Birds of Prey, they're the greatest group of people I've had the pleasure of knowing. There was a mutual sense of 'helping to better the guild' that I didn't feel anywhere else. <br><br>I could go through a play-by-play of my life up to level 50 but I won't, because, that would be more boring to read then this already is but also I'd run out of time writing this. So I'll just try to wrap it up here.<br><br>Well, I'll write a little more later, but my period just ended :)  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upyrocatmoonstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyrocat Moonstalker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/18/02 2:00:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upyrocatmoonstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyrocat Moonstalker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/02 8:55:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=630.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> More</span><hr size=1> Arg, the only time I have to write nowadays is first period.
