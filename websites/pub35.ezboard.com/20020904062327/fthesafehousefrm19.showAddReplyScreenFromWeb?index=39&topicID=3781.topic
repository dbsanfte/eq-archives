<br>
I like to solo<br>
buffed oponants kill me when I'm solo<br>
some of them appear to be solo because their buffer is afk or a bot<br>
I don't like buffed oponants<br>
so:<br>
I'll call for nerfing buff classes<br>
<br>
Dull in the extreem.  And if you think its odd that people here are defending buff classes then remember that the ones who have buff bots also *play* a buff class.  Its bad enough all that rebuffing after Link death but it can't realy be avoided.  <br>
<br>
The way to fix buffing classes is to give them some of the RP for anyone they buff - if that person is out of the 8,000 RP range then buffer don't get the points but the buffed player still looses a portion of the RP they would have gained.<br>
<br>
You'll probably still loose if your solo and unbuffed but the buffed player will get less RP for fighting with an advantage - that seems fair to me.  Of course they are just as vulnerable as any soloist to a modest sized group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 2:55:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1</span><hr size=1> heh,amusing topic. <br>
<br>
simple fact is infiltrators are going to get nerfed,part of the reason is the players who use buffbots. as uber has stated,most people who rvr at all ,know who uses bots,and who doesnt.<br>
<br>
buffbots are unbalancing,just like any other class/style that was unbalancing. when you get a 75% improvement for using these types of charecters,your just creating more game balance issues that will eventually be addressed.<br>
<br>
i wouldnt have a problem if the people who used buffbots had to share the risk on there bots themselves. however they dont have it,its a win/win situation for them. however theres a real difference between a buffbot and a normal cleric,healer,druid etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulandril77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Landril77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 5:28:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1</span><hr size=1> Buff bots make a huge difference in assassin combat.<br>
<br>
I got perfed by 2 level 50 shadowblades on Friday.  From later discussion in forums I determined that they are both spec'd almost identical and using identical weapons.  The first perfed me for 999 and followed up with a 597 cd.  The second perfed me for 437 then evaded his cd attempt and beat him down thanks do dragonfang/ham/leaper chain.<br>
<br>
The first assassin was fully buffed by a high augment shaman.  The second was unbuffed as I discovered when he died.<br>
<br>
I average around 120 damage unbuffed with Garrote against level 50 assassins with 63 thrust spec and 57CS.  There are a few piercing nightshades on my server who use buffbots who regularily garrote me for between 200-250 per attack.  The odds of them being fully spec'd in pierce and CS are pretty low when you consider the spec point difference, meaning that assassins with lower spec and the same armor penalty are doing double my damage from buffs alone.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with buffs making that much difference for assassins when they are running with a group and are working as a team.  What bothers me is how many run around solo fully buffed with a buff-bot tucked safely away in a BK/PK.  In a group fight you can target the buffer and take them out to even the playing field and everyone involved has that opportunity.  With a solo assassin they become a killing machine that must be dealt with directly because the support character is sitting unplayed and untouchable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaxus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caxus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 11:22:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> i wouldnt have a problem if the people who used buffbots had to share the risk on there bots themselves. however they dont have it,its a win/win situation for them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ok, these kinds of arguments make no sense at all.  When i hear stuff like this it starts to sound more like jealousy than anything else.  Think about what you're saying.  Are you suggesting that your chances would be better if instead of dealing with a fully buffed assassin you had to deal with a fully buffed assassin AND the buffer who buffed him?  How does the fact that the buffer isn't in sight make the encounter less fair?  You think that if he was there &quot;working as a team&quot; with the assassin that the assassin would let you just take out the buffer as you please?  You should be glad that you only have to worry about the buffs rather than the buffs and the mezzes and the stuns and the heals when you're fighting the assassin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaxus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caxus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/02 11:27:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1</span><hr size=1> Also, consider this.

<br>
It's a hell of a difference tho. Having a full set of buffs available to you every single time you go out RvRing versus having to rely on another player whose buffs could go down anytime without a warning because he died - thats a world of difference, i'm sure you agree. <br>
<br>
Not to mention a buffbot is usually full spec enhance - something a real player would never have done because of the consequences for his char, but a buffbot does not  feel those consequences.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; Are you suggesting that your chances would be better if instead of dealing with a fully buffed assassin you had to deal with a fully buffed assassin AND the buffer who buffed him?&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you suggesting there would be no difference between you having a buffbot safely parked in the portal keep, and having your buffbot on autofollow behind your(stealthed!) ass?<br>
<br>
If there indeed is no difference for you, then i don't see how making buffs have limited range would possibly hurt you.<br>

<br>
There's a big difference between being buffed because you are working with people, or buffing up with an invulnerable character who will be left sitting in the PK unplayed then going out stealthed solo.<br>
<br>
Being fully buffed is not normally an option for people without buff bots.  the reason being that those who actually play the buff classes are almost always running with a full group, and their buffs are dedicated to their groupmates.  If you are lucky you may get a buff or 2 off them, or maybe 4 if you are in the group yourself.  They simply do not have the buffs to go around that you can get off of a personal buff bot.<br>
<br>
I have a second computer as well as a second account.  I could easily run a buff bot, but I refuse to do so.<br>

<br>
Sharee, thats not at all what i'm suggesting.  What i'm suggesting is that the excuses for getting buffs nerfed make no sense.<br>
<br>
The logic is &quot;Its not fair that i have to fight the buffed assassin while the buffer stays safe at the pk.  I want to be able to fight the buffed assassin AND the buffer at the same time.&quot;<br>
<br>
The suggestions for ways to &quot;fix&quot; buffs are really just ways to change the nature of the situation so that its better for us as assassins and thats just silly and selfish.  You have to admit theres a bit of a conflict of intrest when assassins want to change the way buffs work on their own terms.  On a cleric board, the notion that buffs should have ranges on them would get laughed into oblivion coming from an assassin with his acme-inviso button.  For every post about buffbots there must be 100 others about how ridculously unfair stealth is.  They have a thousand different suggestions about how to &quot;fix&quot; stealth and they dont think any of them are nerfs either.<br>
<br>
Anyone playing on two accounts is going to have an unfair advantage over someone playing on one.  Which classes they play doesn't matter.  A buff class as a second account might be the easiest way to play two accounts for most people but they could have just made 2 assassins and been even more deadly.  People playing on 2 accounts is not something that can be stopped and it really shouldn't be a factor at all when considering changes to be made to classes.<br>
<br>
The real issue is people playing on two accounts, not buffs.  You people want to cut off the head to cure the headache. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushareefromtristan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShareeFromTristan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/02 7:52:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> &quot;For every post about buffbots there must be 100 others about how ridculously unfair stealth is.&quot;<br>

Irrelevant. We are discussing buffbots here, not stealth.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;A buff class as a second account might be the easiest way to play two accounts for most people...&quot;<br>

It is the ONLY way to play two accounts simultaneously<br>

Are you serious? Did you ever try to play with two characters at once? Do you have four arms, or do you simply believe the readers on this forum are fools?<br>
<br>
&quot;People playing on 2 accounts is not something that can be stopped and it really shouldn't be a factor at all when considering changes to be made to classes.&quot;<br>
<br>
I disagree. While making buffs have range IS a class change per se, it wouldn't hurt the players actually PLAYING that class at all. It would only prevent buffbot assassins from speccing in the enhance spell line with their 1.0x extra spec points.<br>

Umm,  I disagree.  I PLAY a bard...ie: I'm not an AFK bard.<br>
I have essentially no offense to speak of, and precious little defense (the instamez was a help).  The only real contribution I can make to RvR is my &quot;one shot&quot; chance at AE mez (once mez lands, I can't remez, and have no secondary form of CC to fall back on),  and my buffs/regens.<br>
<br>
I only have baseline buffs.  As a rezzer, I'm often seperated from my group because they rush to the battle while I tend to the fallen.  It's bad enough that they lose my buffs when I die (which is easily, and often), but now you suggest reducing my buff effectiveness even more by limiting it's range?  And claim it doesn't hurt me?  &lt;cough&gt;BS&lt;cough&gt;<br>
<br>
I understand your complaint of buffbots, but reducing buff effectiveness across the board is not the solution.<br>

<br>
to answer your questions/complaints its like this<br>
<br>
a person who uses a buffbot has no risk invested in his buffbot,because said bot will never die.<br>
<br>
a person who uses a buffbot improves his charecter by 75% or more,for no risk because his bot will never die,thus he wont lose buffs in the middle of a fight.<br>
<br>
so in reality,all buffbots do,is improve your charecter,without any potential downside. they reduce the potential of death on one charecter,while they dont add any potential of death to themselves. thus you have your win/win situation.<br>
<br>
by comparision if your buffbot had to tag along,you increase the risk by 200%,because you now have to not only protect yourself,you have to protect a 2nd charecter. also considering stleath charecters,buffbots are ideal,because you have stealth,a buffbot is alot less use,if you dont have stealth.<br>
<br>
by comparision to normal charecters,like tambori,he shares the risk of dying,the risk of not ressing people,the risk of not being around his party everytime he goes out to rvr. note,he also has a normal template,99% of what i would call buffbots,dont. no charecter who actually plays fulltime goes for a full spec aug/enhance path,because it has no value except as a buffbot.<br>
<br>
i dont really care if they nerf buffs or not,its just another issue in game full of them.<br>

<br>
Yup, and assuming theres someone playing the buffer whats wrong with it?  Why shouldn't he be 75% improved?  We're talking about a class that specializes in improving other characters instead of doing the damage themselves and some people see the very nature of this class as an open invitation to provide support without being on the front lines.<br>

You think changing their buffs won't hurt them.  They think changing your stealth won't hurt you.  Everyone's got an idea about changing a class they don't play or understand.  Totally relevant.<br>

No Sharee, just you.  Ok, just kidding. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm not saying it would be easy but its entirely possible assuming the second character was on AF and just did a /stick auto-attack after the main char did his PA.  And this part really comes down to the philosophy of it all.  Is it unfair because its one human being or is it fair because its two characters? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubrendelblackhammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brendel Blackhammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/02 4:48:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Caxus,<br>
<br>
I think alot of this has to do with the game intent. I dont think Mythic was expecting people to buy two accounts, just so the buffer could enhance the main character. What I do think is the intent is for teh buffing class to work as a team by enhancing, healing, fighting or what ever is needed. <br>
<br>
The main concept here is the team play, not the usage of 2 accounts to make one stronger. Another way to look at this is does the buffer get any RP's from eack kill that is made? I would be willing to bet the buffer shares none of the reward, therefore its hard to press that him sitting at the PK with his buffs on someone else is team play.<br>
<br>
On a side note I will share a experince I had on the Kay server. There is a lvl 50 nightshade by the name of Deathdragon, that routinely kills me and a number of other shadowblades. During a keep siege a fellow shadowblade killed off his buffbot by the name of Purpledragon, and in the mean time I run into Deathdragon. Now most times I run into him I get my butt handed to me by him with him hitting for 200 some odd damage a pop. I was expecting the usually ass-kicking. Here is were things get interesting, because he is now only hitting me for 130ish or so, and I am chewing through him at the tune of 220 240 so a swing. <br>
<br>
Before hand I though he was simply a very skilled opponet. Now I find out he is just an average player, with two characters powering one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/02 11:25:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3781.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
<br>
Caxus to your questions,the answer is no to both.<br>
<br>
what we disagree on is the semantics of the issue,to you a buffbot is no different then bob the healer,who fights alongside you,or buffs you and goes off with his group.<br>
<br>
to me the difference is the fact that bob the healer does fight with his group,or at the very least is an actual player behind the charecter. <br>
<br>
i have no problem with full spec enhance/aug charecters  who play there charecters at all,i have problems when they are used as nothing more then tools to enhance another charecter,when there is no downside,or risk involved. <br>
<br>
from my point of view,a true buffbot,is nothing more then a tool,similar to achieving the best weapons/armor in the game. the issue is that everyone can potentially get the armor/weapons. not everyone can or will get the buffbot.<br>

<br>
The range limit might be made pretty big, so that you falling behind a group wouldnt immediately make your buffs useless. It might be a half zone or so. If your group leaves you behind more than that, you will get killed by an assassin and the buffs will drop anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Besides, your run buff already has range, and it's the most useful one too, so i dont see how anyone would want to leave the chant radius... but what do i know, maybe hibs don't like speeding around on bard speed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
