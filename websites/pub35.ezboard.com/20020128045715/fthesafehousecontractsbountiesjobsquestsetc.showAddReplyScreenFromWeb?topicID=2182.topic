We've made some changes to the message boards, as you can see. The letter below is from the team.<br>
<br>
Ester<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
Hello all,<br>
<br>
Upon EverQuest’s release, Sony Online Entertainment, then a separate company, came to Verant Interactive and proposed that they set up and host community message boards on the EverQuest site. The purpose of these boards was to provide a place for EverQuest players to hang out, get to know each other, and basically do what EverQuest players do in any of dozens of message forums hosted by EverQuest fan sites. <br>
<br>
As they grew more popular, a culture of dedicated and knowledgeable players formed, and the forums quickly evolved into a place where game design concepts were discussed freely by a relatively small group of people. As a developer always open to new ideas, the boards did not go unnoticed by the EverQuest design team, and we began commenting on issues there regularly. <br>
<br>
As the weeks went on, some EverQuest players heard that the “Official” EverQuest forums were the place to go if you wanted to speak with the EverQuest Development Team. As issues were addressed, it was apparent that the boards were a phenomenal tool for collecting player feedback, listening to issues, and occasionally to release information. <br>
<br>
In late 1999, we decided to even further our commitment to communicate with players about development issues – a philosophy that remains true to this day. And it seemed the boards were the best place to do this. To that end, a full-time Community Relations Manager was hired to not only disseminate information to the public via the boards, but also to bring the public’s issues to the development team such that valid player issues would be addressed and not overlooked – the latter part being key. <br>
<br>
Fast-forward to today: Unfortunately, the EverQuest message boards are often a hotbed of exaggerated negativity where only through one-upmanship, melodramatics, and dauntless persistence can one hope to create a big enough thread surrounding an issue as to have it addressed. Posters with the opportunity and time to engage in these tactics at least get to see an Official tell them “Yes” or “No”, while others with equally valid stated concerns and the same desire to make the game better for everyone see their posts fall off within minutes, only to be overlooked or missed in the end. That, or they simply don’t post at all, avoiding the boards and the negativity found therein (we’ve received a lot of player feedback via email and at Fan Faires attesting to this phenomenon).<br>
<br>
Well, this is simply not acceptable. Our original goal for the boards was to have them serve as a place where valid player issues would be addressed and not overlooked. We need and want to hear the feedback of anyone willing to send it. You deserve to know that your feedback is being read, that your issues are being considered by the design team, and that the chance of having your thoughts heard is not tied to your ability to be outspoken and persistent in a public forum. That is one thing all of our goals have in common, and one thing that we need to improve such that we are able to give players the input and feedback they deserve – the current “public” process.<br>
<br>
To that end, we’re making a number of changes, both to the message boards and the procedures for sending feedback. First, you’ll notice that the Harpy’s Head and the Official Message Boards have been shut down. This is a temporary measure to allow people to time to read up on the new processes and rules in place prior to posting on official EverQuest forums. Some boards will be reopened in one-to-two weeks time under the new rules. <br>
<br>
The Harpy’s Head boards will reopen under their existing rules (in-character), but will require an active EverQuest account to post. The Wishlist, the Newbie Zone, and the Customer Service/Technical Help forums will also reopen at the same time, but will have very strict guidelines concerning the type of content that is allowed in those forums. Other former forums, including the server and class forums, will not reopen.<br>
<br>
Two new forums, “Developer’s Corner” and “Quality Assurance”, have been added. These forums will take the place of the former “General Discussion” and “Testing” forums. The difference here is that attempting to post a message or reply will take you to a special form where you can “Submit Comments” to the Development and Quality Assurance teams. Representatives from each team will read all of the comments submitted and choose several daily to which to reply publicly. Those representatives will then quote your comments if chosen in individual posts under the appropriate read-only forum. These forums will also be used for special announcements, inquiries, and the release of important information as it is appropriate. And we also hope it will be much easier for players to keep track of what is going on in EverQuest. <br>
<br>
It is very important to us that we are able to address the needs of our customers. It’s not only important from the perspective of our goal of providing good service, but also for our primary goal: To be the number one online gaming company in the industry. Player feedback is so important to this process that we are taking these steps in order to gather feedback from more people more effectively. We are committed to responding not only to more issues, but also to more issues of concern and interest to a broader range of players. Finally, we are committed to giving our playerbase more input into what we do, and more insight into how and why we are doing it. <br>
<br>
These changes are a sincere attempt to make all of that more possible. Please join us in ushering in a new age of communication and collaboration and visit the EverQuest Message Boards to submit your comments today.<br>

<br>
Please, then why has their customer base continue to grow?  They stick to their own &quot;Vision&quot; and they don't let a few whiners ruin the game - I guess that makes them &quot;anti-customer&quot;.<br>
<br>
Sadly, many players are shortsighted, and feel their own problems are paramount to the game's integrity.<br>
<br>
Does this mean they're always right, or always perfect?  No, but I think they're doing a fine job.  Of course you come off as the type to label me a &quot;VAK&quot; since I support VI, but that's ok. <p><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=20675><b>Bronus Blackblade</a></b><br>

What I did see though was a lot of whines and flames there (this was quite a while ago, mind you) that seemed to be posted by arrogant, self-centered kids that couldn't or wouldn't understand the issues outside of the scope of what affected them personally or the 1 character that they played.  Granted I did come across quite a few valid and well reasoned complaints, but most of those seemed to always be explained reasonably by the BLU names and/or handled in a satisfactory manner by the dev team and/or CS (Kendrick come to mind?).<br>
<br>
I took a break from EQ because I thought the whines reflected more on the player base and less on the game itself. I'm not in a guild and I mainly only read the news sites that only quoted the &quot;whineplay forums&quot;. After reading more of the Safehouse and becoming more involed with more players in EQ, I see now that I was getting a pretty narrow view of the playerbase... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwemic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wemic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/01 9:21:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2182.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Their boards, deal with it so stfu</span><hr size=1> Hi Rook,<br>
<br>
We seem to be bumping into each other's posts recently, nice to meet you again.<br>
<br>
Closing the forum is a good thing, it is filled with people who have neither been there or done that (EQCS / RL CS) or who have no sense of patience.<br>
<br>
I would much rather read a nice post about why So and So lost their Epic because they did x, y, z and EXPLAINED it fully, rather than a flamefest from some thirteen year old breaking the EULA to play.<br>
<br>
Face it folks, for the most part the posts on the boards were akin to soccar hooligans rioting at a game just to cause trouble. You have it spelled out clearly what the rules are and people ignored them (for the most part). The vast majority of the negativity, from reading the letter above, was what shut down Verant's PRIVATE messageboard rather than the fact that Joe, Jill and Jane posted a detailed series of questions about X or Y.<br>
<br>
We would see posts locked, but you never saw in bold letters the named of the people who were banned for breaking their rules on their boards. At least here if you get a lock or a move or a ban the admins tell you and everyone else.<br>
<br>
If you recall there was recently a in-game poll asking what you got out of the boards. My answer was that I go elsewhere just to read the highlighted messages from Absor or whoever later on in the day. Easier to read and dealt with less crap, especially since Absor RL is actually really nice and has a clue unlike the utter dork people make him out to be on the boards. /shrug<br>
<br>
Spookk, who are you and why have your post so far been on the trollish side? I don't blow my stack in the subject line that often.<br>

<br>
I have played D&amp;D and other RPG's for DECADES; this means I have dealt extensively with all sorts of players, and with game mechanics, balance issues, and so on.  I have also seen GMs who have lost perspective and identified too strongly with thier monsters and dungeons. I am sorry if you find it offensive, but the term &quot;sucks&quot; conveys an accurate evaluation of much related to EQ, its implementation and mechanics, and VI in general.  If you are happy with an inferior product and little support, that is your perogative, and I wish you the best of it.<br>
<br>
It is based on this past experience, and my own personal interaction with EQ and people who play it(along with posts straight from the corporate horse's mouth about &quot;customer retention time&quot; and the deliberate time sinks of the game) that lead me to conclude that VI has profit first, and fun a *distant* priority.<br>
<br>
Customer service is MUCH more than just guides, or getting robo email.  In fact, guides often would like to help MORE and are prevented by limited tools, and VI's own policies.  I know this from personal experience.  Take that or leave it as you will.<br>
<br>
As to how people are in RL who work for VI, I am sorry, but I don't care.  What I want is good service for what I buy.  I want a company and the persons who work for it to maintain a certain level of responsibility and concern, and I just dont see VI as doing that.<br>
<br>
I personally don't find a 65% retention rate for customers very impressive, and I question where you are getting your figures to support your conclusion that they are still expanding in a healthy manner.  Still, as a famous con man once said; &quot;There's a sucker born every minute&quot;.  Certainly the last expansion is almost completely worthless, and there are still massive problems (and blatant, unfixed bugs) with Kunark.<br>
<br>
Notice how we never saw any of the poll results that VI did on the login??  Ever wonder why?  I think if a comprehensive poll of core issues was really made, it would be much more negative than your assertion.<br>
<br>
Anyone who is really familiar with this game knows all of the long-standing player complaints, and I see no reason to reiterate them here.  I provided a simple and glaring example in my original post.<br>
<br>
And yes, I do expect VI and their PR guys, friends and family, etc, to pop onto these boards and try to put positive spin on the entire thing.  The fact is they were tired of getting slammed for bad moves, and getting caught being poor in the testing and CS areas in a public forum.  The posts by Absor a week or two ago lashing out at players and nitpicking even calm, intelligent posts was a classic.  He made like a dozen posts in one thread.<br>
<br>
The great thing about non-VI boards is that they will not be able to find the accounts of the posters and use it to harass them, so people are more likely to tell the truth.  Of course the admin of VI will also be able to hide in anonymity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unasbin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nasbin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/01 10:52:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2182.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://nasbin.homestead.com/files/nasbinholehead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Their boards, deal with it so stfu</span><hr size=1> Please don't think of Whineplay as a purely negative board, I got a lot of good information there, and some good entertainment. Learned more about the troubles of high level wizards than I ever wanted to, and learned how to play many classes well before even trying them.<br>
<br>
I used to post on Whineplay a lot. Met some cool people, and had some fun conversations. I used to think of it as more of a really really big chatroom, and it was one of the few boards I checked regularly.<br>
<br>
True, there were MANY posts that were just pure whining, much of it uninformed, or just plain trolls, but you learn to avoid those. There were also a good deal of humor type threads that I could read and/or participate in for fun.<br>
<br>
Reading the posts, I could see how many players felt about the game, whether good or bad. I could read about the latest &quot;huge&quot; catastrophe, maybe the Mystere banning, or the Managirl Beachbum name change. I could read something written by someone who took the game way too seriously, and get a laugh out of that.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it's because of the fun posts that the board was closed. Maybe Verant wanted us to take the board more seriously. But, hey, whether it's Dazzler_Twodirks being a hypocrite, Thogg laernign how to tyep, JooJooFlop's favorite food, GrollerDaBard retiring, Bloodsage using his scary debating skills, HappyDaGnollmonkey and his l33t ogre mamas, or Snoota reminding me that I have a hole in my head, I had fun.<br>
<br>
It was the atmosphere of the boards that kept me coming back. Sure, at times it felt like some elite club, where people who were annoying were laughed at, and there was a great deal of flaming, but overall, I think the board was great. I DID contribute my feedback to Verant, and I would never have done so if it wasn't for the great environment of the boards. Now, the only thing I can do is submit feedback to Verant in an email-like fashion. I don't plan on doing that too often.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I'm rambling, I don't even know if what I said made sense. I hope they open the boards again...<br>

Spookk: I have personally concluded that VI doesn't put profit ahead of fun when it comes to a game that, as they have stated over and over (McQuiad mostly), they love.  As for anything else, I'll take your advise and leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Nasbin: GrollerDaBard and Snoota did make many a hilarious post on those boards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And I didn't view the boards as entirely negative, especially not in the past month or so; but before I took my EQ break, I didn't have the time nor the inclination to sort through the negative ones to find the worthwhile ones.  I relyed almost exclusively on the &quot;outtakes&quot; (BLU name responses) posted on the EQ news sites, which happened to be mostly in response to negative posts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufreonsmurf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FreonSmurf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/29/01 3:36:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2182.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hoels76.tripod.com/wee.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Their boards, deal with it so stfu</span><hr size=1> /shrug<br>

<br>
I tell you though, I dont understand why it would take someone more than 20 minutes to scan 2 pages of posts.<br>
<br>
Even reading several all the way through(and this usually happened for a day or two after patch)only took an hour or so.<br>
<br>
Maybe they just needed to hire someone with college-level reading skills.<br>
<br>
I did see a post by Absor this morning saying that a whopping 25% of the people he talked to at the fan faire (which, like all his other figures is probably inflated, and who would go to the fan faire in the majority but VAKs?) complained about the board's negativity and that this was a strong influence on his decision to change it.<br>
<br>
I believe it when all the people at VI say they &quot;love&quot; the game...it has made them filthy rich!  I would &quot;love&quot; something that did that for me too! =)<br>
Unfortunately, action(s) speak louder than words, and the constant nerfs, unfixed bugs/quests, game imbalances (PC v NPC), etc, are stong proof that they dont love the PLAYERS (aka CUSTOMERS).  And I mean that in general...I advocate for no particular class, and have played 7 different ones to level 30 up to 45 over two years.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as was pointed out, we have many other good resources for the same info, it will just take a while for people to settle out and accustom themselves to going to each of several boards =(<br>
<br>
Could you all post lists and links of the good boards you personally visit?  I posted the one about the safehouse above.  Hackersquest is another good forum, but the haven't been accessible last day or so<br>

A couple reasons.  One, they are understaffed and always will be.  Two, players screw themselves over.  <br>
<br>
What's that you say?  How do players screw themselves over?  Well, that's easy.  Everytime some unscrupulous little dirtbag tries to cheat the system, lie to a GM, get a free rez or an item they did not actually earn the GMs get more and more cynical.  They institute policies whereby if it is not 100% certain that the game engine was at fault for something negative (ie falling through the world) then the GMs will not help you.  Customer service then gets WORSE, because people still petition things that they know the GM won't or can't help them with and try to argue the GM into doing it.  This wastes the time of the GM/Guide and makes other customers with legitimate issues have to wait even LONGER for the understaffed GMs to get to them.<br>
<br>
As far as Whineplay being closed down, I think it is an unfortunate thing.  Yes, the signal to noise ratio was horrendous, but there were occasionally good posts to be found there.  I cannot blame Verant for taking them down, though.  The fault lies with the players and posters who created a situation in which Verant had no recouse except to shut down the board.  Perhaps if VI had a staff of people whose only job was to monitor and moderate the boards full time the boards could have remained open, but I am skeptical of that.  If only 2% of EQ players post to the board and only 10% of them are troublemakers on the board that still leaves a huge ratio of posters to moderators...and I think those numbers are very low. <p><SELECT NAME="D1">
