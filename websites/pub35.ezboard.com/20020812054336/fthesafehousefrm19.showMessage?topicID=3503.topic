The style bonus on a perf does not depend on the delay of your weapons, so it is advantageous to use very fast weapons to increase your damage over time, by being able to swing quickly after a perf.  Since sb's have no acess to fast thrusting weapons with 2.5 delay and under, but instead have access to slower slashing weapons with 2.5 delay and up they are not able to take advantage of perf's independence of delay as are infiltrators and nightstalkers.  <br><br>2.  Critical strike grants ns's and inf's better styles than DW/CD/thrust spec, whereas sb's get better styles from sword/axe/L axe spec.<br><br>3.  The damage bonus from perf is not really that much better than L axe styles.  I have hit someone for a style bonus of +170 from perf then followed up with a style bonus of +100 from doublefrost.  Perf is usually 2-2.5 times higher, but for all of the spec points I have put into cs, I could have made the difference in damage up with enveom/weapon spec.  Its just too many spec points for an incrediablly hard to use style that doesn't really do that much more damage.<br><br>This was different before 1.5 when there was a large advantage from being able to use a 2h and stay hidden, but that is not gone.  I guess there is some advantage to being able to front load your damage, and kill in one hit so that your enemy has no chance to fight back.  ALthough if a crit blade could one-hit them, I can take the extra 3 seconds to swing a second time to finish them off, and we will still both be visible.<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gerbrandt>Gerbrandt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 2:59:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3503.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gul.50g.com/images/Horusthumb.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Critical strike sucks for sb's</span><hr size=1> Ohhh you can add more arguments:<br><br>- to use the benefit of perforate artery as a sb, you must use slow, high dp two-hander, thus increasing your time to hit for CD, while adding only one poison.

Furthermore the exchange of readied weapons with prepoisoned weapons from inventory is more reliable too. Therefore the use of 2h as a left axe sb is obsolete. As the system automatically readies left axe and a mainhand weapon for 1h's, it is reasonable to simply use la styles only, even for backstab <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br><br>Ohhh there are advantages to 2h's for crit strikes too:<br>1) Perf and backstab ignore bladeturn<br>2) 2h with perf allows for more effective hits in keep battles (where you mostly have one hit only).<br><br>I can live with 1), as I hit with two weapons, so bladeturn stops me only once.

Why not change weapons right after the PA ? And get another poison in?<br><br>Here is my reasoning:<br>Assume you do a PA with a 3.7 delay 2handed weapon.<br>(this is the slowest delay I get with a Gladius in the 2h slot, actual 2h slash weapon for a SB may get even bigger delays)<br>You now have to wait at least 3.7 seconds before you can swing your CD. In those 3.7 seconds you can also switch to a fast mainhand weapon with a 2.5 delay and hit the CD key. <br>If you set up hotkeys 1-2-3 for PA-wepswitch-CD and hit these in succession, then lets say the change takes 0.2 seconds. The timer on the CD (2.5) starts counting when you hit the CD key. The end effect is that you get in the CD a full second earlier *and* still benefit from the higher dmg PA caused by the slow 2h weapon.<br><br>I intend to test this soon (when I get CD)...do you see a hole in my reasoning ?<br><br>Sombracid<br>31 Infiltrator<br> <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uhelathien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Helathien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 6:45:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3503.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> perf and delay</span><hr size=1> Phelmich:  What I am saying is that the style bonus on perf does not depend on delay.  The totaly damage you do in a round will still be greater with a slow weapon.  Try this your self.  Get the slowest weapon and the fastest weapon you can find and perf some mobs (1 handed).   The style bonus on perf will be very similar.  Then use garrote with each of the weapons and you will see that the +style bonus is different because it does depend on delay.<br><br>Gerbrant:  Spend 2 points in cs and you get an attack that takes down bladeturn.  In a keep raid you can make up the lost difference to a slow perf through poison easy.  With no cs it is easy to get lifebane, which does 480 damage overall, even to plate wearers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukooch2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kooch2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/02 7:11:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3503.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: perf and delay</span><hr size=1> Just pasting this from another board as there was a similar discussion there<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>Logs from testing weapon speed vs damage on perf art. <br><br>First weapon tested was a Arcanium dagger <br><br>dps:15.0 spd: 2.4 effective dps: 14.1 <br>qual: 99% <br><br>[14:06:56] You enter combat mode and target the [lilispawn] <br>[14:06:56] You prepare to perform a Perforate Artery! <br>[14:06:56] You perform your Perforate Artery perfectly.
