(Long)</span><hr size=1> Basically heres what happened, and doesnt seem rite at all for either side of the base. (Players and Npc's).<br>
<br>
Before you read this, Please, I would like to let you know as from a point of view of my own class, Everthing was going fine for me, and my friends in terms of class balance. Now I am hurt along with alot of you, and there is nothing we can do about it unless we get some support.<br>
<br>
Resist Changes: *NEED TO BE LOOKED AT*<br>
<br>
With good intentions, we got the options to now resist everything including lure at 250! Wow, Yeah, ill just go rite now and lose 1000hp in gear for a check to resist most spells 80% of the time. GG guys, great great thinking.<br>
<br>
Now, if the majority of the player base had the options to go that high resist wise, I wouldnt be complaining. I guess this is more oriented to the High-End game.<br>
<br>
I also think this change goes in line with the lower mob experiance penalty, as a universal effort to get rid of all easy and low risk ways for most classes to solo. Which also goes in hand with player dependability, Verant wants us to group, which makes players /LFG for hours depending on others. Which it turn causes groups of people to continue to play at all times and totally rely on others for a decent chance at experiance. Which, finnally in turn causes more players to remain active making verant more money on peoples addicition. If theres a monk who solo'd his way to 60 and solo'd his way to 40 aa points in fungus grove (Like me) He can decide to quit at anytime because he has reached there himself, and does not need to rely on others to build up. Then those others have less people to group with, and less ability to solo, and may in turn quit the game as well.<br>
<br>
Like serious, How does a mob land ensnare and root on 100+ in all resists, and How are the small mushrooms of fungus grove now, suddenly able to slow people with 150+ in disease resistance. I think verant should re look this decision, and make it viable on mobs only over the level of 50. And only on players over the level of 50, should you switch over to these new, flawed resistance tables.<br>
<br>
I feel its for the worst and VERY deeply affects players like me, that enjoy to log on for one-hour and solo yourself about a yellow of Alternate Experiance, then log off and pursue something else. Instead they want us to devote 6+hours at a time per login. Thats my interpretation of it anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the experiance changes:<br>
<br>
I figure this also works around with the resistance changes, Verant wants people to group to progress, they dont want players to solo their way there, then quit when they reach the top. Verant wants player dependability which is stupid, but makes sense. I think they should Leave all of the mobs that are under the level of 50 as they were, giving the same amount of experiance regurdless of light blue or blue. I was Fine soloing my shrooms for an hour, and then doing something else, thank you very much. This option should remain viable for any level 60, We are level 60 we spent months of time getting threw trivial levels of trivial experiance, we should now be somewhat powerful gods and able to retain and maintain solobility of a rather simple zone.<br>
<br>
New Cleric Things:<br>
<br>
From experiance, I have seen the great damage from these new fun tools, and I am not asking for a change, since I know that this requires alot of the attention of a cleric. But yet I would consider you, Verant, to relook at how many times it is procing per 10 seconds, and see what you think.<br>
<br>
<br>
DoT stacking:<br>
<br>
I havnt experianced the end game with a DoT class, as my necromancer alt is only of the 41st level. But I do feel they are to the best, even as they have bugs (Which will no doubt be fixed in the upcoming future.) They are still what alot of Druids/Shamans/Necromancers have been awaiting.<br>
<br>
Druid Epic Snare:<br>
<br>
Druid epic scimitar has had its snare component removed and resistance check changed. It is now somewhat a 1600 dmg 1min 30sec Mana-Free DoT. (Not entirely sure on the actual stats, I do have a druid with the epic although). This is an awesome change, not only does it make the druid epic more useable, it also allows multiple druids to stack this mana free dot on a raid-type encounter. As for the snare component, it only hindered the epic anyway, and ensnare lasts longer and casts quicker for minimal mana usage.<br>
<br>
LoS change:<br>
<br>
I feel it was best the way it was before, as you had to time your casting, and can use AoE spells more accuratly. I think this change should be history personally.<br>
<br>
Item-Linking:<br>
<br>
Great Great change! /bow. Only 1 flaw in this system would be the font color of linked Items, Sure blue is the universal linked color, but at least give us the option to change it to something a little lighter in appearance. As I have to squint or strech my eyes to read a majority of the item auctions.<br>
<br>
Pet Haste Cap:<br>
<br>
Great change, pets always need upgrades. Except I feel mage pets are a little godly rite now, The epic mage pet with the mages stackable pet buffs on it is hitting for what appears to be almost identically to what damage I do, not weilding any weapons using my epic fists. Its a little insane for an epic to give an entire classes main role to another class, and I feel most of you would understand this.<br>
<br>
<br>
I feel the top few paragraphs I have created should be CAREFULLY looked at, and decided with the majority in mind. Rite now they are just not viable, and will cause a massive loss in the player base over time. over 40% of the player base gets their kicks from everquest by Soloing and obtaining gear independantly. And eventually this number will lower down and down, and verant will gain nothing from these changes.<br>
<br>
If you wish to correct me in anything, Please do so in an orderly manner. I have tried my best to make this post as resonable as possible. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
<br>
Nigel.<br>

(Long)</span><hr size=1> This is the worst patch in the history of Everquest. The low  blue\light blue exp nerf was totally uncalled for and unjustifiable. <br>
<br>
There are many many very valid reasons from game design, class balance, to individual player playing time restrictions which come to play on my opinion in this regard. <br>
<br>
Game design and lack of groupability forces many classes towards the solo line of playstyle. Now, exp allocation kicks all those people right square in the nuts....and will have the effect of making them play and level twice as long as they did before to make the same gains. Monks are caught up in this as well although we do not suffer from the lack of group friendliness that some classes do. <br>
<br>
And if that weren't enough, what about the player with restrictions on their playing time, they cannot with very good reason spend inordinate amounts of time looking for groups. This group has had sand kicked in it's face today. <br>
<br>
Verant took a laudable goal of giving people more exp for more risks taken and then proceeded to abort the whole fucking mess by introducing the low blue\light blue nerf. This is a classic case of knowing how to &quot;fuck up a wet dream.&quot; <br>

(Long)</span><hr size=1> I want to point out that things here will probably not be "fixed".  There was a lot of talk even by VI when they made the caster changes that there was going to be further changes to casters to tone down their hitpoints and their melee damage to bring them more in line with PC casters.  Where are those changes?  When I am a level 54 monk and can't get through Frontier Mountains without being attacked by a goblin that is 20 levels below me and I don't stand a chance of winning if I time FD wrong, something is completely f#$#$#ed up with the game engine.<br>
<br>
I am a casual player.  It has taken me over a year and a half to get to level 54 and 2 AAXP points with absolutely crappy gear and no money (because I scrimped and saved to legitimately buy even half way decent stuff), and guess what?  Most of it was soloing.  Lately I have been working on AAXP because light blues in DL were still giving good "level 51" experience.  I guess that is shot now.  Guess what VI, no matter how you try to prevent and discourage people from soloing, we soloers still pay our $12.95 a month.  Is it really worth pissing off that many of your players to force your vision of grouping down our throats?  As it is I can't even solo most of the Velious and Luclin zones because the MOBs that are "close to my level" (hell even ones that are "low" dark blue to me) hit way too hard and I don't even have a chance in a straight up fight against them.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I haven't logged on with this patch yet, but it certainly sounds like VI gave solo players the big middle finger again.  When does World of Warcraft come out again?<br>
