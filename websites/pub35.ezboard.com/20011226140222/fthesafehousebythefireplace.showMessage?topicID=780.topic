It will have many characters that are rogues but I am posting it here because there are many great writers here and I would like to try and get a few tips.  Now the first chapter of Curoks' life, The Brood of Korinz.<br>
<br>
Curok strode steadily along the old, paved streets of Cabilis.  He walked thinking about<br>
his life ahead of him and why the brood mother decided he should be a warrior.  “A<br>
warrior?  I am too scrawny!” he thought.  He strode these roads many times; all for the<br>
same reason.  To think.  He would think of things such as his future, his past, his<br>
civilizations past, and why he couldn’t be a necromancer.  A warrior was to rough for his<br>
liking and monk was just out of his league.  Shadow Knights were to under powered and<br>
Shamans just seemed stale.  The life of a necromancer was what he wanted.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Curok walked along the road and stopped near The Court Of Pain.  He glanced at<br>
the courtyard where he heard screaming from within the darkness of the night, and then<br>
strode into Klok Mugruk’s place across the street.  “Hail Klok Mugruk!”  “Hail Curok,<br>
coming in for the night son?”  “Yes sir.”  Curok strode up to his apartment and stretched<br>
himself out over the bed.  He was twenty now and knew a note would come soon<br>
accepting him to the Legion of Cabilis, his nightmare.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day the note came and he sulked to the waters edge where he was now<br>
permitted to swim to his new guild.  He swam slowly remembering his past freedom and<br>
accepting his doom.  When he got there he found no one.  He turned around looking then<br>
found a small hatchling.  He looked calmly on it then felt a piercing in his back.  A blade<br>
came through his chest.  Another through his tail, and a third through his skull.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was a nightmare.  Curok sprang from his bed and found a note.  He read it<br>
carefully and was alarmed to see that it had nothing to do with the Legion of Cabilis.  It<br>
was from Raska - an old friend - telling him to sneak into the court of pain the next night<br>
and begin his training as a monk.  Curok pondered this and gave off a radiant and scaly<br>
smile.  If the Legion could not catch him this sun-down, then he could avoid loosing all he<br>
held dear and live it up in the life of a monk.  No chores, no work, just sit back and relax! <br>
Oh, this would be great; or so he thought.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That sun down he went to his room and squeezed himself through a window. <br>
From the window-ledge he made his way to the roof of the building and edged forward. <br>
by the time he was in sight of the court of pain, night patrol was up.  As a guard past he<br>
leapt down behind a beer keg and waited for the next to past.  After the second guard past<br>
he ran to the court and met Raska.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This will be no life of Leisure Curok!”  Raska said. “But I thought all monks did<br>
was sit around meditating all day! That is leisure is it not?  Curok inquired.  “Would you<br>
like to see what we do as monks?”  Raska grabbed Curok’s skull, lunged off the ground,<br>
kicked him in the face, and landed on her feet looking at Curok; now 10 feet away.  “Holy<br>
cazic....” Curok replied as he got up.  “Monks... d.. d... do that?”  The whole night  and<br>
the next two days Raska and Curok trained, Curok learning to kick and punch as a monk<br>
should.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now, Curok; use what I have taught you to defeat those who plague our lands! <br>
Take this bag and fill it with the beads of the scouting goblins near the lake, The stone of a<br>
froglok Skipper, a Large scorpion pincer, and a Sabertooth Cub canine.  Give me the bad<br>
when your done and I will give you a second shackle!” Raska said once she had taught<br>
him what he needed to know.  Curok gave a firm yes and went out to fight real prey.  He<br>
first went to the lake.  As he strolled out into the wild he found the Sabertooth cub he was<br>
looking for.  He kicked the cub as hard as he could and then dodged the saber-tooth’s first<br>
attack.  Curok dove under the cub, flipping it and giving him a 1-hit-kill.  He quickly<br>
sprang into the air and stabbed his tail through the cats chest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After skinning the cat he found a Goblin scout; or rather, the goblin found him. <br>
The scout slammed Curok in the back before Curok slapped the goblin into a tree with his<br>
tail.  Curok then lunged at the goblin, still up against the tree, thereby breaking the tree in<br>
half along with the goblins’ spine.  After taking the beaded choker he went and killed<br>
many Large Scorpion for his  pincer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally he found his last component.  The Froglok Skipper.  He charged the Frog<br>
but the frog threw a stone at Curok, nearly killing him.  As Curok got up he had to dodge<br>
a plethora of rocks before going in for the kill.<br>
<br>
