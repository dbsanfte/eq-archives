<br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer says 'A pleasure to speak with you Venture! You appear to be a foreigner to Katta Castellum as well. I hope your reasons for visiting this noble city are more leisurely than my own. In addition to my normal duties as a Shar Vahl Emissary to Katta Castellum there is the issue of the [tormented vah shir] in Tenebrous Mountains that must be dealt with. <br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer says 'Recently the skeletons of Vah Shir have been spotted wandering the Tenebrous Mountains ferociously and blindly attacking the living. There are legends among my people that speak of Vah Shir warriors that were murdered dishonorably in their sleep by a traitor allied with [dark spirits]. The spirits of these murdered warriors become trapped in their decaying mortal shells for often many years before they are driven mad by the despair, rage, and torturous experience. When this negative spirit energy becomes strong enough the corpses rise and attempt to slaughter all that crosses their path in their state of eternal rage. Spirits tormented in such a manner must be assisted so that they may finally find peace in death. Will you [help the souls] find peace? <br>
<br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer says 'Not all spirits that can be called upon by those who are in touch with the spirit realms are of good intentions. There are spirits who seek to destroy and corrupt. These dark spirits are best avoided and kept from manifesting their influence on the mortal realms. Unfortunately the foolish or the weak willed are tempted by their promises of power. Most who deal with the dark spirits are shortly driven mad by the spirits influence or destroyed by the very powers they were promised. There are tales however of powerful shaman capable of harnessing and controlling the dark spirits and their evil powers of corruption. These wicked traitors to the Vah Shir teachings are called [Rakshasa]. <br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer says 'Like I said the Rakshasa are spoken of only in old tales. Whether they truly existed or not can not be proven for sure and the elder spiritist insist they are nothing more than creatures of fiction. If there truly is a Rakshasa alive today it would be a powerful creature indeed. They are said to no longer have a physical body of their own, having traded it to a powerful evil spirit so that it may enter the mortal realm in exchange for dark gifts. Because the Rakshasa no longer has a physical body of its own it must take the forms of other creatures and can not be destroyed with conventional weapons. <br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer says 'The only way for a tormented undead vah shir to be put to rest is to destroy its body and take its skull to Shar Vahl where our spiritualists can perform a ritual to cleanse and free the imprisoned spirit. Fill this chest with skulls and return it to me and I will make the preparations for it to be sent to Shar Vahl. The spiritualists there have just recently received word of the situation and will be prepared to perform the proper rituals when the time comes. <br>
<br>
<br>
The box she hands you has eight slots; kill tormented vah shir in tenebrious mountains to get their skulls. the skulls are no drop. the spawn time seems to be 2-3 hours and random. combine the skulls inside the box and turn it into roshawna.<br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer purrs an incantation and waves her claws back and forth over the chest. The runes inscribed on the chest and iron bands begin to softly glow with a golden light. 'You have done a great service for these poor souls. I have sent for a courier to come for the chest of skulls but he is quite late in his arrival. I will keep it safe until the courier arrives. <br>
<br>
a vah shir courier says 'Sorry for the delay mistress, I ran into a spot of trouble on the way here. I am prepared to deliver your crate to the spiritists back home. <br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer says 'I hope your journey back to Shar Vahl is less eventful. Please make haste, the spiritists must receive this crate as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
a vah shir courier tucks the crate of skulls under his arm and nods to Roshawna. Suddenly the courier begins to shake, his fur stands on end, and his eyes glaze over expressionlessly. The courier runs for the gates of Katta Castellum with an otherworldly howl echoing in his wake. <br>
<br>
Roshawna Rhorer says 'Stop him! Stop the courier! An evil spirit has possessed him! He must not escape with those skulls! Catch him and bring back that crate of skulls! <br>
<br>
kill the vah shir courier and 8 skeletons spawn:<br>
<br>
a vah shir cou's corpse slams the crate of skulls against the ground with unnatural force as he falls jarring it open. With his dying breath the possessed courier mutters a dark incantation and the skulls burst from the chest sprouting new skeletal forms. <br>
<br>
loot the crate from the courier and combine the skulls of the 8 skeletons that spawn in it.<br>
<br>
turn in the box with the combined reanimated tormented vah shir skulls to Roshawna and get the box back with a note.<br>
<br>
u take this to spiritist roleko.<br>
<br>
Spiritist Roleko says 'I require both the crate of tortured vah shir skulls and the report from Roshawna. <br>
Spiritist Roleko says 'It was wise of Roshawna to send you to me instead of risk bringing something so tainted by the dark spirits within the walls of Shar Vahl. I shall begin the ritual immediately. What is that?! Look! There is a grimling heading this way followed by what appear to be grimling undead. Defend me while I perform the ritual. Give me the head of that grimling and the skulls of those undead! <br>
<br>
this was a very hard fight, i died in it; turning in it spawns 1 grimling and 3 skeletons; they hit around 130 or so each and i could not root the grimling (which is why i died)<br>
<br>
Spiritist Roleko says 'I require the head of the possessed grimling and the skulls of the reanimated grimlings. <br>
Spiritist Roleko says 'I require the head of the possessed grimling and the skulls of the reanimated grimlings. <br>
Spiritist Roleko says 'I require the head of the possessed grimling and the skulls of the reanimated grimlings. <br>
Spiritist Roleko says 'I am grateful for your assistance. I will be able to complete the rest of the ritual without danger, the spirits in the skulls have been calmed. Please take this report of occurrences to Spiritist Cholsa in Shar Vahl. <br>
<br>
Ok, there is a typo here, it is Scribe cholsa not spiritist cholsa as written, had to take a leap of faith on that.<br>
<br>
Scribe Cholsa says 'So it seems there is more truth to the legends of the Rakshasa than is commonly believed. I recall much of the tales of the wicked shaman who sold their souls and bodies to the dark spirits. There is a ritual that must be performed to force the Rakshasa to fully materialize in our realm so that it may be slain. I will write down the instructions for the ritual but the [components] I'm afraid may be difficult to obtain. <br>
<br>
Scribe Cholsa says 'The legends instruct that the ritual requires an Amulet of Golden Rays crafted by a worshiper of the sun, Charcoal that burns with a Black Flame, and the Brain of a creature that can Leech the Thoughts of others. If you manage to procure these items please take them with the instructions I have provided to Spiritist Roleko at the Grimling Forest Outpost. The Rakshasa shall be summoned and slain there away from the citizens of Shar Vahl. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, turn in the note, the ash, the amulet, and the brain to spiritis roleko and it spawns a mob that hits ~145 he wasnt too hard. no other mobs assist him. he drops a his head<br>
<br>
turn that head into spiritist roleko and u get the shield thats posted below (25 ac 20 wis 8 cha 12 sv magic)<br>
p.s. it looks like a shield u might see in cat city--lion on silver<br>
<br>
<br>
Ingrediants to get that u need to farm (theyre all No drop btw)<br>
skulls from tormented vah shir in tenebrious mountains<br>
thought leech brain from thought leaches in mons lestalis<br>
black flame charcoal from umbrous toilers in maidens eye<br>
amulet of golden rays from the burning priest in scarlet desert<br>

Spawns that I am sure are on the cyce:  any named DW bat (pale, grey, true, tenacious, and Skyshadow), coterie scout.   Scout is a pain to track... you have to keep up invis, because he sneaks around.  I'm also convinced that the various named vampires in the random camps are placeholders for certain cycles in tenebrous... i'm fairly certain there is a meeda hune/crag li cycle as well.  Maybe more than one.  I am 100% certain that the coterie scout is on a named cycle similar to trak teeth... kill one, and a new named pops somewhere, good luck finding him.  After a while I lost the cycle... probably darkwing bat placeholders.  I spent about 8 hours looking for Hoober (yes, i'm very far through the Hoober quest, and don't want to spoil it yet)  <br>
So to get the tormented vashiir to spawn, you gotta have a tracker.  Fun, eh?  Thank @#%$ I play a bard.<br>
<br>
Edit addition:<br>
<br>
I was wrong.  Skeleton is just a spawn with placeholders.  Spawns in at least two spots; not sure if the spawns are linked or not.<br>
