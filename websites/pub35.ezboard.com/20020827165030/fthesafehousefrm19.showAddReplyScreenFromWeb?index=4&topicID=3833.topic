<br>
My worry is this...a LOT of archers simply stopped playing when see hidden went in.  That sucks and I respect their point of  view.  I don't even have see hidden atm and I don't know that I will get it.  <br>
<br>
However, TS will be a much much bigger pain if all the archers come back for camo.  I think that's going to suck for us.  <br>
<br>
I want the arches to come back, but I also don't want to get destroyed in the process.<br>
<br>
I personally think if they are going to keep them they should reduce the sh range to .75 bowshot and ts to just past bow shot.  If they add camo then camo should make the range .10 bow shot.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.<br>

In other words, they can't attack from cammo and must drop cammo and wait between 15-30 before they can attack.  This will expose them to see hidden for a short period of time before they can snipe.<br>
<br>
I still don't like how cammo balances things.  It's not cammo that bothers me, it's TS + cammo.  Assassins have no control over anything, it's now completely in the archers control.  If an archer doesn't want us to see him, he cammos and doesn't attack.  If an archer wants to see us, he fires up TS.  An assassin has no control.  Combine cammo and TS and you're going to have a lot of dead assassins.<br>
<br>
Another issue is that see hidden becomes pretty useless for us.  If I know an archer is sniping I will go find the archer with or without see hidden (assuming he doesn't TS me of course).  I am seriously thinking about respecing w/o it.  So are a lot of other assassins.  If a lot of assassins drop see hidden, won't we be back to where we were before see hidden?  And it'll be WORSE, b/c all the archers now have TS!<br>
<br>
I think the way it's currently implemented will cause the archers to go back to top of the food chain.  The only good thing about this is the &quot;nerf assassins&quot; will be replaced by &quot;nerf archers&quot; again.  I'm not sure Mythic has thought this through very well.  I know Oak and Taco had the best intentions when they proposed camo, and something had to be done to bring back the archers, but I feel the way things are in the latest patch brings back the problem Mythic tried to fix with SH. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujassyofpovar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jassy of Povar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://aodoctors.homestead.com/files/cross.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 9:27:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3833.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Idea for Camo that I think is fair.</span><hr size=1> If I understand the whole Stealth/Camo mechanics process, doesn't it just bring back the level dependant seeing a stealth player?<br>

Hmm... that sounded awkward.... let me try this again..<br>
<br>
Won't say, a level 42 Ranger with 42 Stealth, be able to be seen fairly easily by level 43's and above Assassins who have the same or Higher Stealth skill?<br>
<br>
If my understanding is correct, and I realize it may not be, but going on that premise:<br>
<br>
If your level 50 Assassin spots me in Stealth/Camo mode and proceeds to jump my Gimpy 42 Ranger Rear (trademark term there!), wouldn't that leave me defenseless for what would really amount to the whole fight?  15-30 seconds is a long time, considering poison and attack damages....<br>

If you are hit then you would immediately be able to hit back.  The timer would be for initiating combat only.  The whole purpose of camo was to allow archers to scout again, so if you are legitimately scouting then I wouldn't think this would be an issue.<br>
<br>
Also, detect hidden is not based off of stealth level of char 1 compared to stealth level of char 2.  It's based off of stealth level of char 1 compared to character level of char 2. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujassyofpovar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jassy of Povar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://aodoctors.homestead.com/files/cross.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 10:36:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3833.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Idea for Camo that I think is fair.</span><hr size=1> As long as you give me and immediate method to attack back, if I didn't initiate combat, then I am happy to having a timer implemented to keep me from attacking first.<br>

That still sucks majorly, but at least archers have a chance now... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
