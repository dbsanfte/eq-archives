<br>
LAke of ill omen had a flood of bloodgil goblins escape it's confines and run havoc over the zone, they were then followed by faydeder (the dragon normally in timourous deep) who looks like an orange lobster and was level 55 (I heard, at 35 myself I'm not the one to con him)<br>
<br>
Faydeder breathed lava for up to 600pts damage and had a Aoe fear spell which actually prolly saved a bunch of newbies lives.<br>
<br>
LAke of ill omen is a 1-25level zone and was horrible under prepared for the attack, on top of that it was not a GM pretending to be the dragon - it was just the dragon mob unleashed. Exp loss was Rampant.<br>
<br>
On Bertox he was finished by a 39th level mage who looted:<br>
Crytaline spear, orb of tishin (spelling?), 4 spells and maybe two other things I never heard what they were. His name was Shrazkil and basically he just got lucky as hell when his pet survived long enough to get the finishing hit. <br>
<br>
Personal favorite moment of the night was when the dragon was led over to the professor in the windmill and the whole zone heard repeatedly &quot;Professor says &quot;You will not escape me Faydeder&quot;... &quot;Faydeder says &quot;You will not escape me Professor&quot; ... I'm paraphrasing since I don't remember the professor's name but I thought that was funny as heck. <br>
<br>
I'd personally like to thank the 5 or 6 clerics who came to zone (and a few necros too) who summoned and rezzed everybody's body for free afterward to help cut down on the exp loss. Fare, Salina, and many others were just being saintly as far as I'm concerned. <br>
<br>
Then The sky over Western Karana's turned blood red and a horde of scarecrows (18-19th level fighters basically) ran rampant over the zone... much less over al death as they were more appropriate level and well... a hundred creatures spread over all of western karana isn't that many per square foot. The scarecrow king appear (39th level) in the scarecrow fields and a reasonably large group of mid levels swarmed him and he died *very* quickly. I arrived just in time to see his body and I actually even looted it after the rubicite breast plate had been taken off it. Had a skin of milk, no drop (And un lootable) too =)<br>
<br>
A rubi BP from a 39 mob with 20 people attacking it - risk verse reward indeed =)<br>
<br>
I heard that there was a skeleton lord (GM) in qeynos hills and undead invading qeynos itself at some point but could never get that confirmed. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary when I visited. <br>
<br>
I can confirm that the sky over west commons also turned blood red and hordes of werewolves appeared to attack everyone (I almost didn't believe it when it was said as I vaugely remember that happening before and well... I was expecting new stuff =)) there was a werewolf chief (GM) as well and the amount of people porting in was impressive - everybody just brought werewolves on them to druid ring and they got swarmed. The chief wreaked havoc for a while - summoning werewolves and moving until he was cornered and attacked by a large group of players... this is all what I heard at this point as I never saw him (or even a body) even though I was in zone. I also heard he had moved through a few different zones doing this but I don't know for sure. <br>
<br>
No information on what, if anything, the chief dropped. <br>
<br>
I went over to east commons after that which was a big mistake, shortly afterward the zone overloaded (was very interesting to watch as the zone froze, shouts and ooc continued, the data in was around 5000 and everyone's images was replaced by undead - ghouls, zombies, etc - I thought at first this was the beginning of a really cool event but then the whole thing stopped, &quot;you have been disconnected&quot; and I couldn't get back on...<br>
<br>
so end of night =(<br>
<br>
I Started that night in city of mist and did *a lot* of running that night to see everything, some wondrous porting too thanks to a group of like minded individuals who wanted to see what was going on as much as I did =) <br>
<br>
Hope everyone had a happy holloween, and now next year we'll know where to look for goodies (I'm camping the scarecrow king personally...)<br>

Of course this was not late enough (was only 7pm PST).<br>
<br>
But when one hears what 'quality' the happenings had, I don't feel I miss a thing (xcept sleep).<br>

I was killing undead in Kith halloween night. Heard tell there were werewolves in WC. So a couple of us zone over...<br>
Nothing. Didn't see a thing. Spent the day killing Gix to get Zytl to spawn for fun, he didnt spawn. <br>
At nightfall went back to Kith for more undead.<br>

<br>
Essentially what happened was this...<br>
<br>
A vampire appeared at the entrance to Mistmoore in Lesser Faydark and started to tell PCs of his tale of woe about how him and his 4 companions were set upon in the woods a long time ago by a creature of enormous power who transformed them into vampires.<br>
<br>
About 50 years after their enslavement, their master(who's name remained unknown to them) disappeared, leaveing them as free vampires.<br>
<br>
Of the 4, one went mad, 2 decided to persue Innoruuk as a source of more evil power, and one sought out all the evil knowledge he could find.<br>
<br>
But the vampire we met at MM, Eragru was his name I believe, sought to end his curse.  And Tunare told him that if he put his brethren down he would be free.<br>
<br>
So that was the PCs jobs, to go to 4 different places accross the world and slay these four vampires and return with their heads.  These tasks were completed by 4 different groups of people(as I'm sure was the intent).<br>
<br>
I happened to be in Kithicore when Borshan spawned.  He was a vampire of course, but also a Shadow Knight of Innoruuk.  I sought to join him in his unholy crusade, but Prunezilla(a PC) got a group together and killed him before I could do so.  And that is how I got into this.  After hearing the story, I went to Mistmoore to try and exact revenge for the death of my master's servent on the creature that ordered him slain.<br>
<br>
After a little roleplaying I was disapointed to find I could not attack Eragru.  He was only yellow to me.<br>
<br>
As for the rewards, everyone who brought back a head got an item and money.  Specifically, I know Prunezilla got a Jade Green Broadsword and 10k platinum.<br>
<br>
After he recieved all the heads and gave out all the rewards, Eragru simply vanished.<br>
<br>
However, the question of who made him into a vampire remains unknown.  Mayong was suggested to Eragru, but he seemed to think that was not the case.<br>
<br>
All in all, a rather entertaining event. <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/dboulais_1999/Thief03.jpg">
