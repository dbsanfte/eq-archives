<br>
&quot;With all attention focused on the cap in recent days, the dev team looked it over and we agree-there's no reason to place an artifical cap on mana enhancing items.<br>
On test server now, we've changed the rule so that players get full value from all mana increasing worn items. We expect this will go live with the next patch.&quot;<br>
<br>
What are they thinking?!<br>
Have they even bothered to give a seconds thought to the effect this will have on the pvp servers, which aare currently dominated by manaburn wizards, who's manaburn skill does its damage based on how much mana they have in their pool? Melee classes like monks have been asking that MB be removed from pvp due to its unbalancing &quot;One cheap shot-loot cloak of flames/fungi tunic-insta gate click to Nexxus&quot; demoralizing effect on the player versus player dynamic in EQ. <br>
<br>
Instead of listening to this they have potentially hyper-increased the power of manaburn (and don't forget lifeburn) as both are based on the amt of mana the caster has in their mana pool.<br>
<br>
Also, say hello to the twinks with infinite mana. Believe it or not, Rallos can be a great place to be, and is not only about the quake type doods who run around ganking people. That element does exist though, and changes like this only support that type of player. I expect we will be seeing lvl 20-60 ganks with enough mana to kill 3-5 people without medding with a change like this. <br>
<br>
VI, I know you read this board religiously. Please reconsider this change and it's effect on pvp, especially on RZ. As a 60 monk there and officer of one of the biggest guilds on the server, I can tell you from firsthand experience that what we need is to have MB fixed/removed from the pvp environment, not super enhanced by giving caster ganks godlike manapools. <br>

Reasonably, manaburn will do at least 6k damage when used at full mana.  You think you're gonna survive that?<br>
Yay, now they can do 7k damage with more mana, either way you're dead.<br>

<br>
It does not sound like manaburn in general is going to get changed anytime soon. I would work on having them either change the way it is implemented on the Zeks or remove it all together. There is a precident for this. IIRC, Harm Touch does not refresh on the Zeks with death. It always uses the timer for refreshing.<br>
<br>
Use this as your basis for changing/removing manaburn. It might help. <p>Kurrlee<br>

(its 4000+ cannot remember exact number), and manaburn does damage equal to your current mana pool time a random modifier (1.5 to what 2 or 4?) with a chance to crit. now seeing as these numbers aren't exact (more sure about the cap then the modifiers) chances are even a fully buffed NToV/Ssra/VT warrior will have trouble surviving this, much less if it was one of those more powerful hits, and pretty much impossible if it critted.<br>
<br>
so removing he cap on mana won't really effect manaburing in PvP so much as it will effect the other methods a caster can use to wipe the floor with you (a la more spells able to cast now that then can get more total mana, and manaburn is only every two hours RL anyways), the only effect this will have with manaburn is now it can do even more damage to a mob. <br>
<br>
cause a player won't survive it anyways, much less a player on a PvP server.<br>
<br>

Putting single-shot kills like that into any PvP environment (especially one that's already balanced like shit and bricks on opposite sides of the development scale) is asking for trouble. <p><I>"Ohhh give me a home, where the Drolvarg don't roam... where the Tsu and the Urd Shamen play...

<br>
I take offense sir!<br>
<br>
Manaburn is what wizards should have had for a long time in my book(and no, I don't have it yet, still a bit short).<br>
<br>
Manaburn is THE big nuke.  Single Target, BOOM.  Now, it's usefulness can be argued, and clearly it's unbalanced in PVP which is why VI has said their looking into it.  However, it represents the ability to lay the smack down like no other class can, or should be able to.  Wizards are touted as the masters of direct dmg, however, Druids and Mages get some spells that are "ALMOST" as good mana/dmg ratios, and get other advantages as well(summoned pets, SoW/Regen, etc) and Wizards were looked down upon as one of the more worthless groupmates for a long time.  If the near uselessness of MB in xp groups gets wizards more xp groups, goodie.<br>
<br>
Mainly I want Manaburn to help my guild.....and to have fun(this is a game afterall)  Emporer Crush better watch his ass once I get MB ;) <p><table>

<br>
As for the non PvP servers the concept is totally different since it is not able to be used against another player, its not like you can rip something apart loot and gate with a 70-80k item like the cloak of flames or the fungi tunic.<br>
<br>
I don't think the mana cap will effect it too much, but of course I don't play on a PvP server also, just going on what I see around me. Yes the casters will have a tad bit more mana, but two casters going at it don't have that many hps anyhow. While a melee (mainly warrior rogue monk) have to bet on the fact that they can interupted the casters to survive.<br>
<br>
You honestly have 6k+ buffed hps Lenardo? If that wizard gets any kind of multiplier over the minimal I would think you would be toast. (unless maybe manaburn only deals half dmg in PvP but i dont think this either) <p><img src="http://zonne.freewebspace.com/tangi_deaded.txt.jpg">

I played PvP a bit, kinda liked it, but just too many d00ds, it got stupid. Eq is not tailored for PvP, and probably never will be. This does not, however, change the fact that there are any number of increbidly simple things they could do to balance PvP AA more. They could simply not make this change go to PvP servers, although that might be harder, and would hurt the casters fighting against mobs. They could change MB to not crit against players and not go above a certain damage amount, or simply make the corpse unlootable if the player was MB'd. It is possible a fully badass buffed tank could survive a current manaburn, hard though, and this change would negate that chance on probably most MB enabled wizards. <br>
<br>
On a side note, Lifeburn is completely unaffected by this change, as far as I know, it's based on the Necro's hps, not mana. I'm also betting that the level based manacap will remain intact, my friends recently twinked level 1 druid with over +700 mana in gear could cast minor healing about 5 times at level 1, which proves its existance. The cap probably would completely go away at like level 50 or 55 or even 60. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugeistschattenfaust.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geist Schattenfaust</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 636<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/11/02 5:07:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=197.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.manuelc.com/smileys/payne.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MB and PVP</span><hr size=1> Actually, I think Manaburn is bloody lame shit in PvM too.<br>

The Wiz was like Fuck and runs but not before the monk jumped him.<br>
<br>
I also believe Molten telling us he survived a mana burn aswell. Just had to hit mend as the HP was going down, and it left him with a small amt of life.<br>
<br>
But now with the change I doubt these miracles are probly not going to happen anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufosterskegmeister.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fosters Kegmeister</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 438<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/11/02 10:47:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=197.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MB and PVP</span><hr size=1> the manaburns that are survivable usually come from not so well equipped wizards.  I've gotten manaburns for 5600 dmg, and if I was buffed, I woulda lived... woulda sucked for the wizard too...<br>
<br>
But i've also got manaburned for 14.6k in which case, if it was 14.6 or 16.6 I dont think it really fuqin mattered.  IMO manaburn in pvp should either be removed or made on a more friendly scale basis... aka, wiz with full mana has 4250 mana now? most warriors at 60 with nd maxed and stuff are above 4k hps... 1:1 ratio seems about right... some warriors would live, most monks/rangers/rogues etc would die unless they're over 4250 hps. etc.  at the current stage though, only a fully buffed warrior in good equip stands a somewhat good chance to survive a manaburn from a mediocre equipped wizard.<br>
<br>
top warriors in my guild have 5300ish hps unbuffed, buffed to just over 7k... if one of those warriors has to be fully buffed to survive a non crit, mediocre, and low score manaburn, there's something wrong.  unbuffed warriors (the top of the melee chain hps wise) should stand a good chance at surviving manaburns.<br>
<br>
another idea for it would be to take the player/mob down to 1 hp maximum.  sure, that'd mean no wiz would ever drop a monk again, but other classes would be a bit more balanced, and would have *some* defense...  Or could make it so that they drop the player/mob to say 1% or 3% or whatever... <br>
<br>
many things could be done, but verant refuses to look at pvp for some reason.  I'm one of those bazaar arena addicts, and one on one, I dont think an average joe blow wizard would last if they didnt have manaburn... (Unless there's 50 ppl in arena and i am not sure who's nuking me)<br>
<br>
pvp part of eq should involve some skill, not just a one button god mode ability.<br>
