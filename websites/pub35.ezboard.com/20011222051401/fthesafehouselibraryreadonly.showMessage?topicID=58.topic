More oft then not a man or woman may be wronged by another and left with few methods of recourse. Such is the demand that our skills fill. Revenge for hire, peace of mind for profit. With that in mind a true assassin only wishes to master his trade by maximizing the bottom line. His or her best advertisement is the quality of the work and the mumbled mentioning of their name in the dark alleys of Norrath. I charge 10 plat coins per season of my victim. If an item that was stolen is to be recovered, I expect triple pay. If I must contract the aid of a specialist in the arts of magic to complete the contract it is the contractor that absorbs the cost.  <BR>  <BR> <B>Tools of the trade</B> <BR> Like any tradesmen, an assassin requires his tools. I prefer the sinister jagged edges of a pair of <I>serrated bone dirks</I>. The foul magic bound to these blades immobilizes a victim to prevent escape. Mine of course are not for sale, but I heard the vile Ghoul Assassin of Lower Guk has been seen with one. In order to increase the lethality of my initial strike I envenom my blade with specially concocted toxins best suited for the work. In the case of a weaker victim laden with loot I will always open with the venom of a giant spider (Weakening poison). Should he become encumbered with that first blow he will be all the easier to guide my shanks into. In the case of a monk or clearly lightly encumbered victim, I will open with the lethal <I>crystal eritus</I>, <I>venom of the giant wasp</I>, or <I>venom of the cistern asp</I>, which delivers instantaneous damage.  <BR>  <BR> It is the nature of my profession that the foulest powers of magic may directed at me at any given time. With this in mind, I make it a point to don myself with trinkets and tokens that might ward off these mystical powers. The <I>wolves eye agate</I> jewelry items made by a skilled enchanter offer some of the best protection. Necklaces come in platinum (+9 save vs. magic) and bracelets (+7 save vs. magic) come in gold. <I>Earrings of magic reflection</I> (+5 save vs. magic) can be bought from gypsies for coin and are most effective. Other artifacts can be found to prevent these magic's from having full effect. <I>The most vile of magic's one may fall victim too are those that prevent you from engaging the caster.</I> Wear items with this in mind. With casters of a particular season you may wear items with his most powerful attack in mind. This type of intelligence on ones victim is imperative to achieve a quick and clean kill. The <I>egg-shaped pumice</I> is simply a must have item; every assassin needs to practice quickly conjuring its effect so he or she is ready in case of an emergency. They can be bought at any alchemy shop in the towns of Norrath. <BR>  <BR> There is an item known as the <I>shiny brass idol</I>, which can be found on the Orcs of Highpass. When triggered it provides a limited period of invulnerability. Each idol only has one charge but that single charge if used properly can trick almost any magic caster into wasting all his energy. One cannot attack under the effect of this limited invulnerability, but if a caster believes he or she has immobilized you they will still waste all their energy trying to finish you quick. Then they are meat for the dogs. Other single shot items such as the <I>inferno shield potion</I>, <I>wolly spider silk net</I>, <I>vial of vampire blood</I>, and <I>golem wand</I> are superb additions to the assassins arsenal.  <BR>  <BR> A last most crucial item that should have a place in any assassin's bag of tricks is the <I>guise of the deceptor</I>. Being a no-drop mask with decent ac and magic save bonus makes this item all the more critical. I often find myself on the trail of a member of one of the dark races, as they are generally the less desirables of Norrath. In such circumstances, the ability to blend in with the locals is essential. The mask does the trick. Activation of the mask changes the bearer into dark elf form, allowing him to move with relative ease through evil held territories.  Keep in mind you might still be attacked by evil races depending on your diety. <BR>  <BR> <B>Intelligence</B> <BR> Once a contract has been established, the most critical initial step is the gathering of intelligence on the victim. The best source of such data is the contractor himself, who more oft then not knows all too well the combat habits of his enemy. Aside from the name, season, and class of the target his typical traveling partners and hunting habits round out the essential need to know data. It is important that the contractor does all the talking. The when, were and how of an assassins work is for the assassin and nobody else to know. Of pinnacle importance is the blind state of the victim. Never in any circumstance should the hunted know anything about the hunter. Even the fact that the hunter exists is too much for a victim to know. I make it clear to every contractor that if a tip-off of any sort is given to the victim the contract is invalid and the next visit between the contractor and myself will be short and unpleasant. It is crucial to know the magic capabilities of a target, and more specifically the particular type of magic his most powerful attack uses. Items that offer unbelievable protection versus many types of attack are available on the black-market and a seasoned assassin makes it a point to have quite a variety at his disposal. <BR>  <BR> <B>The element of surprise</B> <BR> Once you are equipped for the operation, the next stage is stalking the victim. The key is to take the victim at the best possible moment. Assassination is not an honorable means to make a living, and hence it does not lend itself to the typical rules of engagement. The strongest advantage that an assassin can give himself is the ability to pick the when and where of a killing. Even the most powerful mage or strongest warrior can be severely crippled with a well-planned surprise attack. Always take the victim when he is sitting whenever possible. Always deliver a dose of poison and a backstab on your opening round. The variety of poison to use depends on one simple observation, will a weakness poison encumber the victim. The activity of the victim at the time of the attack, the location of the attack, the class of the victim and the amount of visible equipment that they wearing must all weigh into this decision. If a victim can be encumbered in the first round with the use of weakness poison that will always be the best choice. Melee types are often laden in very heavy armor and if they are looting will usually be encumbered by weakness poison. Healers in full equipment will usually be susceptible to such an attack. Pure casters normally have minimal strength and are typically susceptible to being encumbered in this fashion. Monks are the exception, by the nature of their class they are almost never loaded down with equipment or loot. If the victim does not look vulnerable to becoming encumbered by spider venom, always opt for the damage. Any of the three varieties of instantaneous damage toxins are adequate to open with. Often asp venom will do the most damage for the least effort to prepare, but crystal eritus and wasp venom offer suitable alternatives.  <BR>  <BR> <B>Combat mastery</B> <BR> Let us now look at the situation frozen in time. The prey should be completely surprised and either encumbered (ala weakness poison) or have eaten considerable damage (ala DD poison) in the first series of strikes. The next step is a matter of technique. More than likely the victim is still in a state of shock. One way to capitalize on this is to take a few steps back and fade into the shadows. Then immediately sit and reapply your most lethal concoction to your blade (ala DD poison). An experienced assassin will be able to dose his blade quicker then most casters can complete their damage spell of preference. If the caster opens with an immobilizing spell all the better, the pumice will enable the assassin to be right back on them. At this point on a frail opponent, the battle is all but won. On a more durable melee type they are right where you want them usually encumbered and injured to the point that a toe to toe battle is feasible. This sums up the importance of a surprise attack, such an ambush is the great equalizer an assassin has. <BR>  <BR> Now it is time to consider the heart of the conflict, the combat that follows the initial rounds. Clear and simple, combat is won by inflicting the most pain on a target in the shortest amount of time. Defense in these situations should always be only an instinctive thought; offense must be the primary concern. The use of the pumice, hide, and slam (for barbarians) must come naturally if an assassin is to be effective.  The assassin must hinder the mobility of his victim while maintaining his own. Whenever a victim has been successfully immobilized by becoming encumbered or magically engulfed with darkness the assassin must capitalize with more doses of poison. A targets ability to detect a hidden assassin must be tested early in any combat. Every time a melee type without a missile weapon loses facing with an assassin he is in danger of another surprise attack. In the same fashion, any caster who casts on themself mid-combat (i.e. targets himself) is also at risk. The ability to revenom a blade without becoming a target makes an assassins work all that much easier.  <BR>  <BR> Each particular class of opponent will naturally respond differently to an attack. Circling any opponent is an automatic decision and should be done at all times to look for a backstab opening.  Melee types will struggle to stay on the assassin. Gaining the mobility advantage versus melee opponents is critical. An encumbered or magically slowed melee opponent cannot easily prevent an assassin from repetitively poisoning them. If a melee opponent favors a large slow weapon, try timing his or her blows and stepping out of range from them. An experienced wielder of these weapons can counter this tactic with careful timing of their swings (i.e. no auto-attack), but this is still an advantage to test. Disarm is an essential skill against a skilled melee opponent. Master it and make every attempt you possibly can. Casters may use multiple techniques to gain the mobility advantage. Many will use immobilizing spells, which can be countered with items that offer protection from magic and the use of the egg-shaped pumice. Spells that inflict damage over time must be pumiced away immediately. While the initial damage is negligible, the chance that circumstances might force a long battle makes ignoring them too risky. Pets must be ignored. Even if a pet is slowed with a bone dirk effect, the controller can force the battle near to take place near it. Some casters will shadow step. It is essential to keep the best possible field of vision against these dangerous opponents (i.e. camera angle). A shadow-stepping opponent will eventually stop to cast offensive spells, take advantage of these moments and do whatever is in your power to apply as much damage (via poison) to them when they do. Healers will often try to unload with damage spells. This is a critical mistake. Healers damage spells are all based off the magic save and very slow as well as inefficient. There is more risk that a healer will manage to escape then there is that he will defeat his attacker. It is essential to stay on a healing class at all times. Damage shields force the assassin's hand. When an opponent applies a damage shield from that moment forth, every hit must be optimized; therefore, weapon effects, missile attacks and poison must be overused. <BR>  <BR> <B>Summary</B> <BR> The primary advantage an assassin has over his victim is surprise. Most adventurers are completely unprepared at any given time for such an attack. The assassin lacks the durability of a seasoned warrior or the big damage of a wizard, but has at their disposal a lethal mixture of both. Poison and weapon effects are the assassin's bread and butter. The use of both must be optimized. When going after a high-octane caster raising the appropriate saves is essential. Know the type of attack your victim favors and use that knowledge against them. Always build the magic save above all others, your mobility is far more important then any other factor. Master the pumice. Every assassin should burn multiple pumices just for practice. The act must become as instinctive as applying venom to a blade. Fear must be your weapon and not your weakness. Often a situation will look grim just before it turns to your favor. A caster may take you to a sliver of life force before he lacks the energy to continue the onslaught. <B><I>Never stop applying the pressure.
