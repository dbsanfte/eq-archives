What we need to keep in mind is that even tho some of them had the cap, people where using the spoilers to complete parts of their epic quests at lower level. Even tho they where not of a level to get the right answers, turning in the right pieces yeilded the right effect.<br>
<br>
Of course not all epics where so, since different teams of develloppers where used to make the different epic quests. That's why you see that some epics where much much harder than some others.<br>
<br>
Untill we find the NPC that starts it all i don't think we'll be able to make any sense of the epic. Best we can do is take the leads that we have so far and build on it till we see a final result and then we'll maybe be able to make any sense of it all.<br>
<br>
So far that i know only 3-4 leads offer themselves that i know and i've yet to be able to see them myself to confirm or deny if they are part of our Epic.<br>
<br>
so far that i've read : <br>
<br>
=Untamed Ape in Emerald Jungle, was encountered by a fellow bst close to the FoB zoneline, since he was 21 at the time he could not take the mob down and see what happened next. ( don't have a loc for the mob nor do we know if it's a static spawn or a roaming mob ).<br>
<br>
=A lost Vah Shir NPC in the South of Karana, again i went over there with a few guildmates to look for him/her have'nt found him/her. A name would've been nice to have as well as a location of her appearance when seen.<br>
<br>
=Another Vah Shir Mob this time in East Karana. Again i've yet to see this NPC.<br>
<br>
= This just posted, new NPC named Scout Sihmoj ( Vah Shir) in Timorous Deep, asking for a Seal from Elder Dumul. <br>
<br>
These are the leads that i know about, If people can confirm these and add the relevent information about them it would be most usefull, please include the following with your sightings : <br>
--- Zone <br>
---Name of the mob, race, sex<br>
---Location you've seen them<br>
---Time of day ( game time )<br>
---Any possible interaction that you've had with them, what they said when hailed ect ect.<br>
<br>
That way we'll make it that much easier on other beastlords to verify and try different approaches, and further our efforts that much faster.Include as much information as you can, if you are not sure about some of the information say so, as not to confuse what we do know about what we find. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uunnone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unnone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/02 4:15:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3584.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Npc's and level requirements.</span><hr size=1> Khati Sha's warder is in sshareza temple as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvegaslife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VegasLife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/28/02 8:43:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3584.topic&index=125>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dumul</span><hr size=1> Spotted in Shar Val on Test. <br>

Scout Janomin says, 'It is a pleasure to meet you, but I do not have time to speak. I am waiting on official word from Shar Vahl.

I was talking to him with an Iksar monk. Scout Janomin conned indifferent and green at level 60, and I attacked him to see what would happen; he aggroed but missed me several times before I feigned him off. No idea if he spawns on server up or not, but Permafrost had likely been up for over 2 days when we found him.

That being said, Dumul is only showing up on the Test Server, but he is there in Shar Vah.  So as soon as he gets patched to the live servers, the quest is afoot!<br>

Since everyone is chomping at the bits to get all the info on this quest I will give you what I have so far.<br>
<br>
Hail historian Sharar and she gives you some long text about taking a book to Elder Animist Dumul. Just answer [yes] to this and she hands you the book. Now the key here is to notice the last line of text. She states that the Khati Sha are disturbed as of late. If you ask what they are disturbed about she doesn't have a complete answer but knows it has to do with the spiritual realm. This is VERY important. Head to the Beastlord guild and Elder Animist Dumul is standing behind a counter next to the guildmaster. Hand him the book and he says something to the effect of not trusting you or something. He asks how much you know. This is where you use the text from Sharar. You state you know the Khati Sha are disturbed about the spiritual realm. I believe the trigger here is the word spirit/spiritual. He then states basically you are a nosy little punk but he likes that and you might be the person they are looking for. He asks you to bring him back the Copper Medal of War. He says it can be retrieved by helping the scouts in the Grimling Forest.<br>
Head over to the Grimling Forest and purchase a polished Acrylia Sphere. (For this part you need either 1 level 55+ enchanter or a few people 50+... or a full balanced group of 40+). Hand the Polished Acrylia Sphere to Scout Husam (sp?)... he stands at the doorway to the first building inside the Kitty encampment. This quest is documented on Allakhazam's under grimling forest/quests/scout husam (sp?). You can get a better detailed discription there. Once you have the Copper Medal of War in hand, run back to Elder Animist Dumul. When you hand it in, he hands you an Official Seal of the Khati Sha and a Carved Wooden Crate. The crate is a 6 slot container that has a combine button and the Seal (haven't id'ed it yet) seems to look like those ancient coins you get. He states that if you lose the seal at any point to return to him and state that you have lost the seal and would please like another and he gives you another. He also says to stash those two items and return to him in a bit when you are ready to be briefed. I stashed the two items in my bank, ran back over there and stated [I was ready to be briefed]. He speaks of a magic-user that is using wooden totems to siphon the power of elder spirits using [new magic]. He is using this power to summon entities of malign intent. He then states that through further research, they (the Khati Sha) have discovered the name of the magic-user.<br>
<br>
Ok... that is the good news. Here is the bad news. Once I have gotten to this point I have been unable to do ANYTHING. I don't know what the combinable container is suppose to hold and I don't know what the seal is for. I have tried turning the seal into Scout Sihmoj in Timorous Deep and all she does it eat it and not say a word (had to return and get another seal from Dumul). Seems the rest isn't implemented or is not available as of yet.<br>
<br>
Ok... Back to the good news. You don't seem to have to talk to the historian to get the epic started. IF Dumul is implemented on the live servers, you can start the conversation by saying [spirits] and he will spill the part about heading to grimling wood. You will still end up at the point I am at, but that seems to mean that you don't need to be 51 to start the quest. Or so it would seem. Can't say much else at this point but if anyone has any information to get me moving again, it would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Almost forgot.... Need to see if as we find the scouts in the middle of nowhere we can write the locs down on here. If I had to speculate I would say that from the 6 slot container perhaps we are to head to different scouts and retrieve things for them. When finished perhaps we get a seal from each one and after collecting 6 seals we are to take the combined crate to someone and turn that in for the epic. Just a thought here. Let me know if you can remember any locations of other scouts. I have heard of ones in Perma and Swamp of no hope but have yet to see any on track.<br>
<br>
Went to Perma tonight to see if Scout Janomin was up and he was not.  I play on test and he wasn't up so not sure if he only pops on server up or what.  Any information would be appreciated there.  I know he asks for the Official Seal of the Khati Sha and as you can see earlier in my post I have that seal.  Would be nice to see where this progresses to next.  I will keep everyone posted as I move along.  Also seems that Schezar has the right idea.  6 slot container and 6 scouts including Dumul might fill the crate.  Guess we will see what happens.<br>

Was there all weekend. Then when I returned the next day, he was gone. Not sure if he despawned, or was GM-removed or what.<br>

But that's one location.<br>

The others we are still looking for. Not everything has made it to the live servers yet. Most of this information is coming from players on the Test server.<br>

appearantly, the Beastlord classes have different race related epic starter people, and each epic(like the different Warders) looks different for each race<br>

However, nothing definitive can be said until the epic goes to the live servers in its entirety.<br>

<br>
Because the Vah Shir 'created' the Beastlord class.  Only once the portal between Norrath and Luclin was opened did the knowledge of the beastlord class spread to Norrath.<br>
<br>
A justification for the Vah Shir handling the Epic quest would be that since the Vah Shir are the original Sect they are closer to the spirits and require help from both the Vah Shir bls and the other race bls.<br>
