Trying to hold onto that &quot;If you don't have anything nice to say..&quot; sentiment. In that spirit, most of what I'm feeling regarding recent goings on will remain off-board. However..<br>
<br>
  I'm restless, I'm agitated. I feel compelled to make it painfully clear why I cannot bring myself to share in the goings on here. It has very little to do directly with the recent posting shenanagins.. but I saw something come out of that, that shocked and disgusted me. <br>
<br>
  Every time someone had anything to say on the matter, a dozen or two people jumped up and posted elsewhere, a vaguely shaded synopsis, which had so little acuracy as to make me suspect the posters to be illiterate. Eventually the original poster would see the portrayal, post a rebuttle, and another dozen people would jump all over them for being argumentative. Long story short, there doesn't seem to be any aceptable way to stand up for yourself on the board anymore. As it stands right now, a bunch of people are probably forever slandered with comments and points of view attributed to them that they never said, and none of them (yes, including myself) have any way to hope to mend the rediculously inacurate portrayals.<br>
Anyone who dares speak up for themselves right now is accused of trying to &quot;ruin the Safehouse&quot;. I can't bring myself to bow to such a slanted mockery of &quot;community&quot;, where the least common denominator is king, and the people with half a brain (and a sense of pride) are reviled for not turning the other cheek again, and again, and again...<br>

Exactly why I took a hiatus.  Stupid people who can't read but yet feel the need to argue against a person who's position they don't even begin to understand.  Now I'm wondering why I came back.  If it weren't for the few people that put some real thought into thier arguments I can guarantee I wouldn't be back.<br>

I hate this line.  I hate this sentiment.  I hate it when people act this way to me.  I hate acting this way to other people.  Yet so many people here hold to it as a gospel.  They hold it so dear that they're willing to say alot of unnice things to people who break it.  Which is ok, I don't mind unnice things, but the incredible stupidity of &quot;don't read posts you don't like, that way you won't say anything mean to anyone.&quot;, and then someone spending an entire thread built around that premise saying &quot;I don't like your posts, so therefore you're a bad, evil person&quot;, makes me so incredibly angry I want to kick a puppy.<br>
<br>
Almost as bad as someone starting a thread bashing people who want to be popular and make cutsy posts then spending the bottom half of the thread talking about stalking all the females...<br>
