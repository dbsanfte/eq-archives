Another skill, say pierce for example, wouldn't let you use a lvl 50 style unless you are a &quot;natural&quot; 50 (i.e. trained).  So no need to get natural 50 envenom for the sake of using higher lvl poisons, unlike another skill line where you want a style, spell, ability, etc. by training to X lvl.<br><br>The second is that unlike other skills, envenom doesn't scale w/ spec lvl.  50 natural pierce plus +11 w/ items/rr is a 61 pierce skill.  You will hit harder, have less dmg variance, and lower minimum on PA, etc. w/ 50 +11 than u would w/ just 50.  So there is a reason to train to 50 and then let items/rr take you over 50.  However, if I have 39 +11 (total 50) envenom I can use lifebane (lvl 50 dot) and every other poison that someone with a natural 50 envenom who also has +11 envenom from items (total 61).  And poison damage/snare/debuff/resists, etc. will be the same.  You get NO benefit from env over 50.<br><br>Long story short, no point at all going 50 envenom b/c you will (w/ realm ranks and items) be able to add points to it.  Most people figure that by lvl 50 they will have a 2,3,4,5, etc. points from RR and will have enough items to have +11 to envenom so few people ever consider going over 39 &quot;naturally.&quot;<br><br>What about CS?  I don't know and not everyone agrees, but many people say CS to 50 is a waste.  Every point in CS raises your PA cap by 9pts.  9pts is not alot at lvl 50 and most people say that you rarely come close to your cap if you have 39 CS (plust some points from RR/items).  So no need to go beyond to lvl 50.  Others say different.  But I think that more people think CS beyond lvl 39 is a waste.  At 39 you get the PA/CD/SS chain.  The lvl 44 and 50 styles are the 3rd and 4th styles in a 4 style evade chain that begins w/ hamstring.  Many people say these last 2 are not worth going to 50 cs.  <br><br>Personally, I will go 50 thrust (great lvl 50 style evade style w/ 9 second stun that everyone raves about) and will stop env at 39, stealth at 39 (maybe 40 for safe fall 4) and CS 39.  I will have a few points left over and ill probably dump them into CS to increase my cap a bit or maybe into DW for what its worth.  <br><br>P.S. Until a few days ago, it was widely understood that stealth above 50 was also a waste.  So most people planned on 39 +11 stealth.  Recently the herald said that stealth over 50 increases detect hidden range.  I don't know if this has been confirmed yet or if its BS. <br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uubergnome563.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ubergnome563</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/02 10:42:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3633.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's the acceptable stop for CS.</span><hr size=1> 39 is what i believe is the normal number.<br><br>50, unless they remove epic armor, is quite useless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/02 11:52:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3633.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's the acceptable stop for CS.</span><hr size=1> I'm at 44 CS now and if all stays as is, I will seriously consider taking it down to 39...mabye as far as 34.  Hell, in all honesty, I would consider taking it to zero if I think I'm gonna be fighting people in epic armor all the time.  In that case, Perf becomes more frustrating than useful, and Garrote probably isn't worth it if all you do is spec CS high enough to get AH.  CS has become a less viable line now IMO.<br><br>The reasons I liked CS aren't as valid anymore: Big Perf damage making oneshot/stay stealthed possible is obviously a dead concept, CD stun is trumped by Dragonfang, esp if you have Dodger.  I don't know what the answer is, other than a massive increase in CS style damage.  And then how do you balance it against non-epic armor wearers?  I think it needs maybe about a 100% increase against epic armor, but only a 20% increase against regular armor.

Is this true?  Next time I ding, I will have enough skill pts to get leaper.  I was gonna up my weapon skill a bit, but if Leaper is so great, Ill do that instead.  Is it that great?  <br><br>Second- The Herald recently said that styles that require openers get a higher damage bonus, and styles that chain off of openers get a style bonus damage that increases with each step in the chain.  The CS Evade Chain is the only 4 style chain in the game. This should mean that if someone with 50 CS lands the whole 4 style chain, he should do an insane amount of damage.  <br><br>What do those of you with lvl 50 CS think?  And also, is it hard to land all 4 styles succesfully?<br><br><br>Third - Other then the 9pt per lvl increase in dmg cap on PA/BSII, how do CS styles (including Garrote, AH, Hamstring, etc.) benefit from more points in CS?  <br><br>On gray con mobs my PA cap goes up 9pts per CS skill lvl.  However, my garrotte only went up 1 point per CS lvl on grays.  <br><br>Is that all that more CS skill does for you?  Or, in addition to raising your dmg cap, does more CS also increase the average damage you will do within that cap (on all your CS styles, not just PA/BSII)?  If so, then maybe CS to lvl 50 is not such a bad idea.  <br><br>Does anyone know?<br><br>Thanks!<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 7:13:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3633.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theblackwatch.biz/Balor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's the acceptable stop for CS.</span><hr size=1> &lt;-- 39 CS and it's staying there.<br><br>The End. <p><p><p style="text-align: left; font-size: 80%; font-family: Verdana">Balor Gafdan Nightshade of Guinivere<br><i>What life brings, is it ours to take?.<br>Your pain feeds my soul, feeds my hunger<br>Shadows dance about my tortured being.
