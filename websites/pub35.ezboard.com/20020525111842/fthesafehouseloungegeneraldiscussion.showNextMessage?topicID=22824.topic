I agree with the whole non training thing but I doubt that would ever happen. Only because of the fact that EQ was based on risk vs reward, taking away trains would sorta be against VI's scheme of things. They would rather we had trains because it causes us to think if its worth it or not. Personally I agree though. <p><div align=center> Deaddragoxo Spiritbound 43 necro <BR> <div align=center> Scaleyfists Witfungfugrip 24 monk <BR> <div align=center> Guild Event Coordinator of Clan Phoenix-Everquest-Xegony <BR> <div align=center> www.clanphoenix.org <BR> <div align=center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueuripedmoped.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euriped Moped</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 11:41:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23334.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/zdance.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would anyone really object a DAoC skill system as AAXP?</span><hr size=1> DAoC system doesn't work well.  I have a level 45 enchanter on the Merlin server. They messed with my class long, long after I had gone through specializing (which means putting almost all my points) into Enchantment Mastery.  I had worked it so that I would get every spell except those in the very last circle. <br>
<br>
Anyway.  Then they altered the way my class works, making it so that Enchant spec'ed enchanters were truly not as good as those spec'd in mana or light.  Net effect? I quit the game.  I had put time and effort into this character, and I was happy with the results (and I do mean happy as a damned clam), and people complained that some of us were, god forbid, having fun.  They didn't roll back my spec points so that I could spend them in one of the other lines.  It pissed me off.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, I don't think you should be skill limited. Everything should be automatic. Improvement should come from items and spells, not skill ups.. unless you can skill up in everything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufeochadan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feochadan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 11:47:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23334.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would anyone really object a DAoC skill system as AAXP?</span><hr size=1> DAoC has fully integrated trivial loot code (you never get loot from &quot;gray&quot; mobs and only 1 exp).

<br>
DAoC's loot and death penalty was designed with the TLC in mind.  You never lost your items unless you deliberately gave them away.  You could still get quest items from grey mobs.  Greens (light blues in EQ) were easy enough to beat so that you didn't really feel irritated about the TLC except in the few cases of too-rare items that only dropped off monsters in a certain level range and for which there were no upgrades (aka bowmaster bracers).  EQ has similar problems.  Every item would have to be reworked as far as price and drop rate go if EQ were to have TLC on every item.  I will never play on Firiona Vie. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usilaena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silaena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 9:11:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23334.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would anyone really object a DAoC skill system as AAXP?</span><hr size=1> TLC on FV work pretty fine and is good for server economy, except for Quest item, they really should do something about it.<br>

Working out the 'best case' was pretty simple for many classes but you never knew what was going to happen in the future and you couldn't respec if things changed.<br>
<br>
I am not 100% happy with AA as it stands though.  Some classes get brand-new class-defining skills (Dire Charm, Endless Quiver and even Natural Durability for Warriors spring to mind, among many) while many classes are left after run3 wondering if they should even bother with many of their AA abilities. <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Blackguard of The Nameless<br>

But with things like the epics, you've got level 10 items needed by level 60 characters, which is why TLC would never work in EQ.. Think of all the non-freeport paladins who never did the testimony of truth quest becasue they stayed at home till level 20 - no epic for you!<br>
<br>
For DAoC epic style quests you can't help see them becasue the trainers give you the quests as you level, and all trainers everywhere give them.. Theres no finding out at level 40 that there was some vital level 20 quest you missed becasue you never talked to the right NPC. And for non-epic quests theres no point anyway, because if you were level 40 the level 20 quest reward would be useless to ya..<br>
<br>
As people have mentioned TLC works if its done from day 1, with the system designed for it, but doesn't work when slapped on later.<br>

Just look at my example ^_^<br>
<br>
I went the normal route. I was in DAoC since day 1. 90% of enchanters on all servers planned on going to level 44 with enchant mastery, and keeping both other skills in the 20's. <br>
<br>
This plan backfired when they completely and utterly @#%$ over the solo enchanter artist (which is why the VERY VERY FEW of us who picked the class picked it in the first place), and made moon and light the only viable options if you wanted to advance at all.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=23334.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=23334.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23334.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=23334.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=23334.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23334.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23334.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
