Cheney's been having health problems, and won't see another term. Which is fine, because they never intended for him to stay two terms.<br>
<br>
Powell has been 100% disinterested in a VP position, but he may be interested in doing it for only 4 years and then running for President on his own. They've been going out of their way to show Bush and Powell handling things, with Cheney staying in the background or out of the public eye the entire time.<br>

AFAIK, Condi Rice hasn't done much to piss off moderates or conservatives (or most mainstream liberals). Plus, she is very qualified, and It would take some of the most well funded special interest groups that the Dems have and throw them for a loop. Hard to see NOW and NAACP campaigning against her, at least with a straight face.<br>

Hillary is a very polarizing figure. Yeah, the far left loves her, but everyone on the right hates her. I don't mean that they would just not vote for her, but they would be in the streets campaigning day and night against her, donating money to her opponent they wouldn't normally donate, etc. etc. It would be the same as if the Republicans put Jesse Helms up for president. Just because someone is loved by one extreme, that doesn't make them a good canidate. It has to be someone who is at least acceptable to moderates, and the middle-right and middle-left. Hillary wouldn't be, where Condi would.<br>
<br>
BTW, I wouldn't want Condi for Race or Gender, I'd want her because she is eminently qualified, and would be a politically acceptable choice with a chance of winning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unyssarainwhisper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyssa Rainwhisper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bluepawbullet.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/18/02 4:01:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4788.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bubblegum.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Oh please, Hillary couldn't even put on a poker face.

By far the worst thing the Bush presidency has done is put Ashcroft as Attourney General.  What an arsehole.  Has no respect for state rights, uses Federal officials to go against state rulings (see california medical marijuana raids), and basically wants to go against the supreme court (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.newsbytes.com/news/02/175921.html).">www.newsbytes.com/news/02/175921.html).</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  And I'm not going to bother delving into his past. <p><b>Brelkor the Blackhammer</b> The Masta Back Stabba, retired rogue<br>

<br>
Meddik, I respect you inasmuch as you have always put forth an intelligently argued opinion (even though I mostly disagree with you!), but Jeb Bush is about as good a choice for president as janet reno would be.  <br>
<br>
Condaleezza Rice though, I could definitely see her in that type of seat. She has done a fabulous job of cleaning up dubyas flubbery over the last couple of years, and she has a great head on her shoulders.  <br>
<br>
After the election was over, I was absolutely certain that Bush would not win the next election. Now, with his non-idiotic handling of 911, I am not so sure.  I hope he is voted out, as he is seriously a bad president. He supports stupid causes, he lacks compassion (compassionate conservative my eye), and is too religious.   He is making decisions based not on the best interests of the US, but on behalf of his own sect of society.  <br>
<br>
<br>
As for people criticizing the US, they really need to look at the entire situation.  I grew up outside US borders, in Ireland. I was inundated with anti-american images from day one. The US is the butt of jokes constantly. However, Americans are some of the most hardworking, and selfless people I have ever met.  In fact, only one country on earth gives more to charity per capita.  The US is always the first to set up aid to countries that have just been through a major earthquake, or hurricane, or war. The US is of course going to promote it's own ideals when and where it can, because they work better (undeniably) then most every other system on the planet.  Americans have created a nation that, despite all it's problems, persists as one of the most advanced civilizations on earth.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unimmbull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimmbull</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/18/02 7:32:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4788.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> A seriously bad president?

<br>
He has been extremely active pushing trying to push through good legislation, and has actually tried to get both houses to work together (all this before 9/11.. I mean he had one of the most active first 100 days in presidential history).  Not to mention he actually got me some goddamned money back from the absurd amounts of overtaxing that happens in this country.  We hit a recession as the war loomed, and we've already turned it around.  In my opinion, you can't do much better.  I'd rather have a President who knows right from wrong and isn't afraid to talk straight than one who is a pure politician playing to the polls....<br>
<br>
I'm just wondering if all the liberals sent their tax refund checks to their favorite charities or back to the gov't.  Otherwise, they have nothing to say about it.<br>
