Thoughts?<br>
----------------------<br>
Basicly, Rogue throwing weapons below level 60 is a joke. Come on, guys. I'm all for things coming into their own at a later time, but level 60? The very last level? That's obsene. What I'm refering to, of course, is the chance to Assassinate at 60 with throwing weaponry. However, from 1-59, we're stuck with, generally, 4 and 5 damage weaponry that has horrid range that stacks and doesn't calculate damage as normal ( IE: a 5 damage sword usually hits max at about 10 damage, where as a 5 damage Throwing Dagger does a max of 5 damage ), decent damage/range weaponry that doesn't stack ( that still has this problem with damage ), or tracking down a smith to make loads upon loads of stackable worthwhile throwing weapons ( yet again, no damage doubling ). Oh, or we can track down some Paladin and give him five gold for the chance to have a chance to get a Halfling Knife. Which doesn't double up.<br>
<br>
Okay. I know range weaponry isn't supposed to be a end all like in, say, Camelot, but our throwing weaponry makes Archery seem like a level 60 Wizard nuke. Either make Throwing viable compared to Archery, or just take the whole kit and kaboodle out. I do have some ideas for making Throwing viable, however, and shall list them.<br>
<br>
1. Make Throwing Weaponry's damage calculate like normal weaponry.<br>
<br>
2. Increase the amount of stackable, viable, purchasable Throwing Weaponry. Currently, you can shell out money at a merchant and get a desent set of arrows to use with a good bow. Which leads to 3.<br>
<br>
3. Create Throwing Weaponry launchers. Slings, Catapults, Crossbows, Gloves designed to augment the throwing motion. I see much potential for Gnomes here to tinker.<br>
<br>
4. Increase the modifer for Throwing Weapon Critical and Deadly Strikes, and possably increase the chance for Deadly Strikes.<br>
<br>
5. Remove the inability to use Throwing Weapons at close range. While this makes sense with bows, I would think you only need arms length to huck a dagger into someone's chin.<br>
<br>
6. Make use of Wrist Pouches and Belt Pouches as quivers for Throwing Weapons as Quivers are, well, quivers for bows and arrows, and allow them to grant haste for Throwing weaponry. Currently, there's no real use for them. If you want to hold something, you get a backpack, unless you're a nutcase like me who holds all his Shurikens in Belt Pouches.<br>
<br>
7. Create Throwing weapons that do not deplete after being thrown, but return to their wielder, such as Boomerangs and Dwarven Throwers. Give them decent damage and long delay, their main attraction would be the undepletable nature, not ungodly performance.<br>
<br>

<br>
Exactly how does that make sense with bows?  If I shoot someone in RL with a bow at point blank range, they are likely dead.  The velocity of the arrow isn't any less.<br>
<br>
If you want a fantasy context, Legolas uses a bow in close quarters to good effect in LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugilwentalisan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilwen Talisan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/8/02 11:39:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23226.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Throwing Weapons - Just submitted it to Dev Corner.</span><hr size=1> Well, I always picture bows going in arcs.

I agree the throwing range is pretty silly though.  My rogue friend was trying to pull shrooms in FG with his summoned daggers so I could med, he had to get inside the shroom's aggro range before he throw a dagger.  Kinda defeats the purpose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ureztarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reztarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/02 12:38:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23226.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Throwing Weapons - Just submitted it to Dev Corner.</span><hr size=1> There is no way a thrown weapon should compete with a box. <br>

Real long bows can put a arrow through 2 inches of oak.  Let me see anyone put a dagger more  than a half inch if you are lucky.<br>

Even with aids....which in my opinion is differnt then throwing.  A sling is as much of a different skill to throwing as Bows are.<br>

Create Throwing weapons that do not deplete after being thrown, but return to their wielder, such as Boomerangs and Dwarven Throwers. Give them decent damage and long delay, their main attraction would be the undepletable nature, not ungodly performance.&quot;<br>
<br>
But why would a Dwarf return after you had thrown him?  <br>
<br>
Although you are right, with his short legs there probably would be a long delay while he walks back.<br>

<br>
I tried to toss out the idea for them to have a primal velium (forgot the name, but like a glove that goes in range slot and launches daggers) with the same stats as a primal bow, might be useful. I always thought that it was really stupid for barbs to be the only ones to be able to get a throwing weapon over 11 dmg...which just happens to be like 36 dmg. <br>
<br>
I give up though, it's archery for me. <p><TABLE

That does the same thing endless quiver does for arrows.  Other then that I don't care about throwing.  It's not a main tactic, mine is maxed and I love to use it but part of the fun is being at close range to use it.  If I want to pull from 200 I whip out my Shaped Compound Shadewood Bow and smack the mob 8 or 9 times as it comes in.  If I am just bored I start chucking, I do agree that there should be less of a &quot;You are too close&quot; but that goes for bows as well.  The thing that always bothered me about EQ is there is no &quot;Min Range&quot; for missile type weapons.  I.E.- Summoned Dagger 6/35 or whatever 50max range 5 min range<br>

Bow of Ubernation 33/1(Just kidding) range 150max 10min.<br>

So, do what I did and get a friggen bow for pulling <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  does way more damage, skill is same as Warrior and a tad less than Rangers. You can use quivers to increase haste on them too. Just to bad we can't get criticals on bows like we do throwing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And as a Rogue, bows make more sense for us. Bow damage bonus'es are based on the DEX skill, which all of us have pretty high I would guess.<br>
<br>
And at 55 when u get CF3 AA skill we can do crits then too.<br>
