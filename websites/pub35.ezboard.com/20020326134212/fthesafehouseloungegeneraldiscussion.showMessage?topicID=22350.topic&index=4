<br>
nae, that is not true. You will not need a new database entry for each possible combination. You work your way around it user better parsing and storing some of that data in the character_profile table they would have for each character. <br>
<br>
Sim they screwed us on the not being able to dye armor...there are a few ways I can think of getting around it. Apart from that I know all the different breatplate look the same....(just a different color)...is there any graphic difference between an indo | vindicaiton | eradication | dyed crafted bp ? nope..not really...what is stopping them from allowing you to dye the bp of erradicaion? Only their coding. BUT assuming that you different bps DID have different graphics...then you could just force standard type of graphic for the colors...<br>
<br>
but off topic....short answer is...there is no need for a database entry for every possible combination of such a system. However if they designed their Database poorly then it would require work to get it to work efficiently.<br>

<br>
It's not that their DB was designed poorly - it was designed just fine *for the task it was meant to implement*.  You can always design something more generically, true, but you sacrifice performance to do so.  I'd rather have EQ running smoothly than give people a random chance at getting +36hp instead of +35.<br>

This game has code that scares me from miles away. No I haven't seen any of it, but the things that we know are hardcoded in are scary. (Like the explanation of why bards can right click while running even if it has a cast time...)<br>
<br>
Random stats on items are easy to do, and not a huge drain on a computer by any means. It's not like looking up a byte in the RAM memory costs as much as say, pathfinding. (Bad pathfinding is costly, good pathfinding can grind even a powerful computer to a total halt.)<br>

I think we will see random items lightyears before we see good pathing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufoolsfizzelmore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fools Fizzelmore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/02 1:41:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22350.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://freepages.ugo.com/oooglie/files/Ani.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: randomise the stats on items?</span><hr size=1> Shariin, not sure where you gor your degree in database design....but you should get your money back.<br>
<br>
The overhead on such a design is not massive by any means. But it requires some work to adjust current tables.<br>
<br>
Also, why draw connections to other games? who care if they do it elsewhere...we are here talking about eq. It would be an interesting asset I think. It would not need to be every item everywhere....but some could be done nicely.<br>

wrt the upgrade thing...personally I wish they got rid of the no drop stuff...that is silly..and would help a lot with upgradefor me = hand me downs.<br>

<br>
Instead of camping till the sword drops once, they'll sit there and camp, throwing away the lower versions of the sword, until the best version drops.  Perhaps they'll camp until they get &quot;any&quot; of the versions then leave, but rest ashured they're not done with that camp yet, and will return again and again until they get the one they really wanted.<br>
<br>
If anything, the way that mobs and spawn times are setup in this game has tought me, is that people will sit there and camp &quot;whatever&quot; for as long as it takes no matter what.  There will &quot;always&quot; be &quot;someone&quot; who will do this, blocking out spawns from the majority, in what ever game you play.<br>
<br>
A change like this would keep areas perma camped.  Or, we could just leave it alone and let the already working system work...  where they have to travel about Norrath to find the weapons they want off varied level of difficulty mobs.<br>
<br>
What you suggest is already in place (sort of)...  only instead of the same name with different stats, we have a different name for each item (which all have different stats).  Why have a sword that could be 9-12 damage 19-24 delay, when we have a 9/19 lammy dropping over there and a 12/24 CSS dropping over there, and all of the many items with stats in between dropping all over other places? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utenaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tenaman</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/19/02 11:28:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22350.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: randomise the stats on items?</span><hr size=1> this would be utterly impossible to have as far as EQ goes.<br>

As it stands, EQ obviously uses a static list of gear and just references to it are stored in your character.

<br>
<br>
<br>
In medievia, a Popular MUD, I will try and Cite a good example.<br>
<br>
Gryphon claws were like ~6+Hit Roll, +30 to mana on average.(Im guessing, its been a WHILE)<br>
<br>
One time i got a No/Low Hitroll one with +48 mana.. It was nifty. It was a totally different version than say +12 hitroll +20 mana. and then you might get the ultra rare +12 +40, or even max stats combo, but this was very rare.<br>
<br>
Low end tweaks of items served as good noobie gifts, and high end versions served as higher-end gear. <br>
<br>
<br>
The stats dont just get 'better' or 'worse', they Get Different! What if you had a piece of &lt;insert clicky armor here&gt; that cast at a better resist rate but had less ac? Would you possibly find different uses for each? Sure!<br>
<br>
People camping 'midrange' items might get a shot at a really nice thing that could be traded off to someone a bit higher, or kept as a nice item for quite some time.<br>
<br>
With item tweaking you could have items drop more freely because not everything would be 'uber'<br>
<br>
In fact, weapons also were tweaked. A REALLY GOOD say, Short sword of flame, or 14d4 sword with say an extra d4 or 14d5 on it was something that was extremely rare and prized.<br>
<br>
<br>
Granted, full item looting helped keep stuff flowing<br>
<br>
As for the genious who posted earlier...<br>
&quot;So instead of asking Verant to create thousands of new items, you're asking them to add several fields of at least 1 byte apiece to each of *millions* of pieces of equipment in players' inventories? Yeah, that's likely&quot;<br>
<br>
No, the Item DB would contain baseline stats. You would put a value in the same place that the instance of the item is stored, probably only needing a byte or so.<br>
