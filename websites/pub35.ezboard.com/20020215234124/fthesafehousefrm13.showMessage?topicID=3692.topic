That is the basic conversation between a friend and I concerning a book I got from WK bandits, I kid you not, while we waited for a ENC epic fight to begin.<br>
I thought it was a high elf paladin toy, but I failed to notice it was a staff. High elf cleric staff? Elven druid staff? Certainly the fact that the high elves had it suggests the former, but it doesn't exclude the latter.<br>
I just put this up to help anyone who actually finds an odd staff in the tower, but I don't know who might drop it, what it is, et cetera. Perhaps if the 8th floor is implemented? /shrug<br>
Thanks for the info and resources; was quite nice to find out a bit more about Izera N'Kar and the Primordial Malice people.<br>

Official Word on the Whereabouts of the Lifeguide<br>
------------------C------------------<br>
Missing for some time now, the King has released an official statement confirming that our spies have kept track of this precious artifact of Tunare. At this time, officials would only confirm that the staff was last seen in Velious near the Tower of Frozen Shadow, though it was unclear whether the actual lifeguide was seen or only those believed to be in possession of it. Palace staff wouldn't comment on neither why i twas believed the staff was taken to that location, nor whether Firiona herself, chosen of Tunare, had returned to Velious in pursuit of the thieves.<br>
Meanwhile, rumors imply something that resides deep in the Tower of Frozen Shadow may have the power to strip Tunare's influence from the staff. Such a notion is obviously ridiculous, but there remains the possibility that the scoundrels in possession of the artifact might have been attempting something toward that end.<br>
Palace staff assures us that the Lifeguide's return to the sanctity of Felwithe is imminent.<br>
Strange Reports from Antonica<br>
------------------C------------------<br>
All over Antonica, phenomena as yet without explanation has been reported. That in and of itself is nothing new, but the alarming degree to which they occurred in such a short span of time is noteworthy. Indeed, it would seem that on the very same night, no less than six major stories of monster attacks, cultist uprisings, undead invasions and more were coming in from all over. Even the newly formed Primordial Malice, a gathering of disillusioned Teir'Dal that preach the return of Lanys T'Vyl, had something of an active night. We urge all citizens to remain alert while it is determined if this is an alarming new trend, or if there was just something in the air that night. <br>
