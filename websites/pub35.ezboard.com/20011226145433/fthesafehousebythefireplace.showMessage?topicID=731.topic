For Tincan, this was not so.  Tincan saw only one part of his life.  It was his first theft/rape.  After the robery of a few diamonds from an old sappy bastard, Tincan made off with his young wife as well.<br>
<br>
After this, everything went black and he stood alone in front of a large door.  A booming voice that could only be that of a @#%$ then sounded.  &quot;Before this door, ye shalt be judged!  Where you go from here is determined by your actions in life.&quot;  He was sent to the king of disease and pain.<br>
<br>
The large doors opened and a shrill voice began calling him.  Tincan calmly walked into the black, rather than through the great door.  He walked for what seemed to be days, but it was not in vein.  In the black he saw a light.  He ran to it and heard voices.  As the gnome squeezed through he found a bunch of bards and rogues getting drunk in these bar-like surroundings.  He had been sent to the plain of Mischeif.<br>
<br>
He walked up to a short figure drinking from a large keg twice his size, and a tall man playing a twisted and bent out of shape 34-stringed lute.  &quot;Hello my friends, how are ye this fine...... is it day or night?&quot;  The short one replied, &quot;There is no night er day 'ere!  You be in the bar o' thousand million drin-&quot; &quot;Where am I?&quot; Tincan replied.  The short one passed out and tincan suddenly became dreary.  He ordered an ale and he suddenly heard a voice in his mind.  A small and ancient, yet elequent and distinct young woman's voice.  &quot;Come to the corner to your left!&quot; it said. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wisepapasmurf>Wise Papa Smurf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/18/01 6:34:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The first of several twists</span><hr size=1> Tincan looked to his left and spotted a young woman.  She was a bard and the most beautiful he had ever seen.  Tincan pased over.  &quot;How did you do that Maiden?&quot; Tincan asked suspiciously.  &quot;Urgh!&quot; she cried. &quot;The incolence, maybe you wont do.&quot;  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  Tincan asked, now calm. &quot;My name is not important at the moment, but what I have to offer is.  I can give breath to your dead body, I can bring you back!  I, Erolisi Marr can save you!&quot;  Everyone looked to the corner in fear and lust.  &quot;Save me?  Ma'am, may I inquire, what did I do to deserve a life again?&quot;  &quot;You are the best theif here, and a fine assasin as well.  The man that killed you plans to bring down my temples, thus killing me.  He has stolen a device from you.  Twinkle.  He is using your small hoverbot as the weapon of my demise.  I need you to stop him, in turn, I promise great rewards.&quot;  &quot;Well,&quot; Tincan said thinking. &quot;I have never turned down a beautiful woman.  A life sounds good, and knowing your identity shows that you will hold up your part of the deal.  Yes. I will do it... on one condition.  I wish to meet someone on this journey so that I may have someone to retire with.&quot;  &quot;So be it gnome.  This will not be any easy challenge, I give you luck, and this.&quot;  The godess held out a small dagger and an Eppe' both made of a black stone and cut in the way only a @#%$ could.  &quot;I will help you along the way, now go!&quot;  Tincan awoke in a room amoung a few theives dead bodies. &quot;Hrm, hows this for remembering the best theif to cross the lust godesses path?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wisepapasmurf>Wise Papa Smurf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/20/01 7:37:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back to life *The Saga Issue 1*</span><hr size=1> Tincan stood up and dusted himself off.  His wounds had strangely disapeared and the parts of his small robot, &quot;Twinkle,&quot; lay before him.  He heard the door open and colapsed into the bodies.  &quot;Hrm, which one is it now?&quot; &quot;The small one and his parts, it is only right that the blasphomy of his companion shall also be tried.&quot;  Tincan lay limply as he was picked up.  One of the guards began rushing out the door with him and hit Tincan's head on the door.  When he awoke he was in the Hall of Truth.  A cleric held a dagger above the gnome and was about to pierce it into him.  Tincan tried to draw his dagger but found he didn't have one.  The dagger struck through Tincan and he let out a yelp then looked down.  He wasnt dead or harmed.  The cleric took the dagger from Tincan's heart and began gasping as he realised Tincan was alive and unharmed.  Tincan watched as his wound healed and then grined.  He jumped up and scailed the wall.  He was in the shadow-bound celing before they realised he was gone.  The mob of peasnts ran out of the great hall looking for Tincan.  As he looked around, he found the room quite beautiful.  It was decked in red, tappered draperies with a white, marble, tiled floor.  Chairs stratched from the back of the hall to the altar where they had planned to sacrifice his soul.  Golden goblets lay all around the altar, which he quickly swiped before looking for an exit.  He noticed a pannel under one of the titanium red chairs and opened it.  The damp passage underneath it led to the dreary sewers of Freeport.<br>

AUTHOR'S NOTE<br>
I know it is a bit slow right now, but young Tincan has a lot in store.  Once i write the final chapter, I will probably make a flash game of the final battle, you wont want to miss this. (I am not good at flash, but thats why I am giving myself time to develop Tincan, so I can learn flash <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=741.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=737.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=731.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=731.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=731.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=731.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
