What the anti-buff bot people are calling for is a similar nerfing of twice as many classes.  Believe me when I tell you that this nerf won't hurt people who use buff bots as badly as it hurts people who don't use buff bots.<br>
<br>
The best argument I have seen against the nerfs comes from a Druid, by the way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 11:20:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> I do think that buff bots will get assassins nerfed.

i am for some changes.  I am not against support players (my second character is one and I never duo with myself;P).  <br>
<br>
What I am against is buffbots impacting play so much they get a class nerfed (see sbs)<br>
<br>
Sunraven if you dont like the proposed changes why don't you find a different solution to the problem?  It' snot like people want to go out and NERF buffing classes.  It's that people want to be able to go out and fight on equal terms.  If the buff bot has to be with the team itmeans we can /attack and kill them too.  I think that's fair.<br>
<br>
One idea is to add a pumice style item from eq and spells that remove buffs.<br>

Just because a few certain players on your server use them allowing you not to be able to solo them doesn't mean that there's an &quot;issue&quot; there.  Annoying as hell?  Yes.  But not at all an exploit or a cheat.<br>
<br>
  To put it in perspective lets say that two roommates each have their own account.  One has a level 50 SB and the other has a level 50 shaman aug specced.  One of their favorite things to do is to go to emain where the shaman buffs the the SB at the portal keep and then the SB goes out and kills people.<br>
<br>
  No matter how you feel about it theres absolutely nothing wrong with this play strategy.  The game is set up this way.  Nobody's cheating.  Whether or not its actually one person playing both roles on two accounts is beside the point because its nobody's business what goes on on the other side of people's computers.<br>
<br>
Also, could someone explain to me how buffbots are going to get assassins nerfed?  I assume people think its because some assassins use buffbots to make themselves more powerful thereby giving people an inaccurate impression of their effectiveness when they get killed by them.  Why do you think assassins are the only classes that use buffbots so that we would be singled out as overpowered?  Almost any class at all benefits from them with the exception of maybe non pet casters.  Do you really think that the devs will just go on peoples word that &quot;this assassin owned me really bad the other day&quot; instead of testing things out for themselves?  And if so i'm sure the devs would consider the possibilities that said assassin was buffed like crazy or that said whiner was just a liar.<br>
<br>
DEV: &quot;Hmmm, lots of people complaining about super strong assassins with 1500 hps.  Thats strange, i could have sworn we set them up to have about 1000 hps at level 50.  Oh well, better nerf those assassins.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utaimisbeatz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taim is Beatz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/17/02 12:10:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Buff bots arent the problems.<br>
<br>
The most complaining i hear about the rogue classes generate from Infiltraitor meetings.  They have two stun styles(thrust) evade 7 + dodger and a crap load of rps to get the best RA's<br>
<br>
I think maybe if mythic were to take away those extra .3 spec points, inf's would prob become less of a headache for everyone else.  <br>
<br>
LA has been nerfed directly affecting Shadowblades-50 extra hps at lvl 50 doesnt really do anything for them.<br>
<br>
Insta DD for nightshades is absolutly useless except to interupt that first cast, then gotta wait for the 20 sec timer. <br>
<br>
take away those extra spec points and we might stop seeing these types of posts. &quot;OMG, some inf killed me in 4 shots.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usunraven01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SunRaven01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/17/02 2:03:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3766.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> I don't think my shout is useless.

<br>
Even if most were to stop using them (&quot;cause everyone else is using them&quot;), there'd still be a few l337 gamer d00dz who would keep using them, hence back to square one.<br>
<br>
So if people arn't gonna self-regulate, then some official regulation would negate the need to nerf assassins -- which I'm pretty sure everyone knows is in the works.<br>
<br>
So ya, it's an emotionally charged issue because I don't use buffbots and I'm gonna get nerfed because of a few people who don't understand sportsmanship.<br>
<br>
In a group I'll be buffed by someone and that's great (they get a share of the RPs for being in the group like everyone else), solo people arn't gonna attack us cause we're grouped, no problem.  If some solo lurk wants to attack a solo wandering tank, then unbuffed they could have a fair fight on their hands.  Get rid of IP and FA2 for Lurks and it might even be a realistic fight... especially now that block/parry is starting to work on CD.<br>

<br>
Mythic doesn't nerf classes based on buffbots, they do it based on the class itself. They may nerf the bots or put in remedies for them to make it more difficult - but I think it's going out on a limb to get this frustrated, upset- whatever because of an assumption. <br>
<br>
I just don't buy it.<br>

Fact is, You don't have to search hard to determine the classes who use BBs. But if your wondering, 99% of BBs are used by stealthers and 90% of those stealthers are assassins. I still have yet to see one BBed non-stealther last 2 or 3 hours in RvR w/o ever dying. You know why? They can't stealth. I've heard the same whine saying, &quot;Well anyone can use a BB that's why they shouldn't be nerfed.&quot; I've also put the challenge out to stealthers to run around fully BB'ed and unstealthed and tell me how long they would last, but as of yet none have the cajones to do it. They know they would die too quickly to a group. <p>Ravn Nevermoor<Br>50 infiltrator<Br>Aeonian Prophecy<BR>NERF PBAE AND BUFFBOTS!!!</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravnnevermoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravn Nevermoor</A> at: 8/27/02 10:28:37 am<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
