On Mordred I have a lvl 20 shadowzerker and I can kill oranges till my ears bleeed with no setup moves... it rocks, I can also kill reds and purples (if theyre a cloth caster) This would make RvR more fun overall for assasins and other classes as it would mean that those in their 30's and 40's would be able to do more than just provide a meatshield for the lvl 50's running around, this will not effect your ability to kill lower lvl cons.. at least it hadnt from what I have seen, it merely makes it easier to survive in RvR as a lower lvl... anyways that sjust my 2 cents on the matter, it's a good thing.<br>

<br>
If I understand Sanya correctly, she is suggesting that the attacker's skill level will be checked against the target's armor type.  This could boil down to your 30th level Armsman, who is fully specced in Slash and has +4 from items, realm rank, etc., fighting a Studded Leather wearing tank.  <br>
<br>
34th vs. 17% Absorption.  A level 5 will probably only be something like a 5th or 6th vs. 17% absorption.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I am an optimist, but this change may encourage those under 45th to engage in more open RvR.  While I found the 30—35th Battle Grounds to have been an absolute blast, I was discouraged to learn that there was precious little RvR that I could take part in from the 36th through about the 45th level.  Grinding about 10 or so levels just to be able do engage in more RvR was discouraging, to say the least, the framerate loss of Emain Macha notwithstanding.  <br>
<br>
I feel that Mythic is taking some very positive steps to help smooth out the wrinkles in RvR.  While I feel that they are doing their best to improve the game, I do think that many of these &quot;changes&quot; should have been anticipated during Beta.  I know that on-line games need to be able to change with the ebb and flow of the game; yet many feel that DAoC was released about six months too early.  <br>
<br>
Be that as it may, I am looking forward to 1.52.  <br>

It means that 40s doing RvR will be viable. That's the way it is on Mordred. A group of 20s can take out a couple 30 or 40. Can that happen now? No. Is that a good thing? Yes. To me it is. <p><TABLE>

I am concerned that the removal of the lvl based to hit modifier may give players with buff bots or friends who buff them through the roof an unfair advantage.     <br>
<br>
When I get full base and spec line buffs from a good enhance cleric my stats go through the roof.  My weapon skill goes up over 100 points and my AF and HP skyrocket as well.  I would probably need to ding 5 or more lvls to get that kind of a stat improvement without buffs.  <br>
<br>
However, as it stands now, even though my buffed stats make me &quot;look&quot; 5 lvls higher, I dont fight like I am 5 lvls higher.  I can't go running around killing enemies or mobs that are 5 lvls higher than me as if they were yellow cons.  <br>
<br>
Similarly, even though buffs make a fight with an even con easier, its no where near as easy as fighting that same enemy or mob will be 5 lvls from now.  <br>
<br>
My guess is that the lvl based modifiers limit how much of an improvement over the &quot;norm&quot; for your lvl buffs will allow you to go.  At best, buffs make me &quot;feel&quot; one or two lvls higher.<br>
<br>
However, if you remove these modifiers then pretty much the only advantage an unbuffed lvl 45 has against an uber buffed lvl 40 is that his dps cap is 1.5 dps higher (.3 per lvl).  In fact if the lvl 40 has a 100% quest or player made and the lvl 45 has an 89% dropped weapon, their effective dps should be about the same.<br>
<br>
Right now if I spot an even con enemy the chance that he has full buffs is a concern, but a limited one.  If I spot a blue or green enemy, buffs are no concern at all.  <br>
<br>
I am worried that with this change, I may get creamed by a yellow if he's buffed and maybe even lose badly to a blue.  <br>
<br>
I dont like the idea that buffs will determine the outcome of a fight between 2 evenly matched enemies.  Skill should be the main factor.  <br>
<br>
