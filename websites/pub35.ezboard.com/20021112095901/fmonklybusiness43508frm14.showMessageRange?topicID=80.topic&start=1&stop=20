Spread it around, and slam it in the face of those who just can't learn to sue the interface, and use that as a reason to keep playing EQ. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is a little weapon to use on the whiners. The least I can do for Mythic for giving me such an awesome game is give them a little free pr.<br>
<br>
1. There are no corpses when you die. You simply lose some con, xp and return to your bind point.<br>
2. You can avoid all of the death penalty completely (except a miniscule xp hit) by being rezzed.<br>
3. There is no time limit on the rezzes.<br>
4. You can chat with people while waiting, and see what's happening in the area around where you die, so you no longer miss half the battle.<br>
5. Everyone can /bind now, albeit at select locations near cities where bind stones are found.<br>
6. Gear for all levels up to 30th is sold in shops. This is gear you actually WANT to wear.<br>
7. Vendors don't cheat you. Everything sells for half of what you buy it for.<br>
8. Tradeskills can make armor that is phenomenal, and better than purchased armor.<br>
9. Tradeskills also make armor that is usable at any level, even past 30th.<br>
10. Camping for spawns has been reduced to a short wait (up to a day game time) in the WORST case scenario, in most cases it's a few short minutes.<br>
11. When doing quests, everyone in the group gets the quest reward at the same time.<br>
12. Sitting and camping single camps does not give you as much experience as clearing multiple camps.<br>
13. The longer a monster has been around, the more experience it gives for a kill.<br>
14. Pulling and killing multiple monsters at a time rewards huge experience bonuses, sometimes as great as the base xp for the creatures.<br>
15. Due to the last rule, it is beneficial to group as you will gain far MORE experience in a group played well than soloing.<br>
16. Every class can viably solo all the way to 50 from the start. Some have it harder than others, but none have it as hard as any in EQ.<br>
17. Every class has a LARGE number of abilities that allow them to be fre more versatile than any class in EQ.<br>
18. The large number of class abilities and overlap lends to a better groundwork for designing real strategy and tactics to combat foes than EQ.<br>
19. The classes are at LEAST as balanced as EQ, and the vast majority of players agree they are balanced far better.<br>
20. The CON rating in DAoC is ALWAYS accurate as to if you can fight a mob. If it's blue, it's soloable.<br>
21. Trivial mobs (greys) (greens in EQ) will not interfere with you (attack you) since they know they will lose.<br>
22. Mobs respawn at a rate between 30 seconds and five minutes, so there is no downtime waiting for things to kill.<br>
23. You can regen from zero health, stamina and mana in DAoC in less than a minute at any level of the game. EQ takes forever just to Med.<br>
24. Buffs are permanent until the death of the buffer or the buffee, no need to refresh them.<br>
25. Epic quests are availiable for all classes, run from 15th to 50th level, and are very eventful and detailed, far more so than EQ.<br>
26. Quests in DAoC revolve around doing a large number of things to complete the quests, whereas in EQ they usually revolve around camping a few rare spawns and wasting hours in boredom. At least in DAoC you are always doing something instead of camping.<br>
27. Player tradeskills produce items superior to what you can buy at vendors.<br>
28. You can finance yourself very, very well using tradeskills by doing consignments.<br>
29. If you make an item to improve skill, you can reclaim most of the cost of the item by destroying it with the /salvage command.<br>
30. Weapons and armor share superiority over and weaknesses against other types of weapons and armor. Mobs are the same way.<br>
31. There is no need for food or drink.<br>
32. Everyone always has a lightsource, you don't need items for it.<br>
33. There is a builtin, onscreen compass, so you always know what direction you are facing.<br>
34. If you become stuck in an object (as can happen in EQ, albeit rarely) the /stuck command will log you out and back in at a safe point.<br>
35. There is NO MOB PATHING in DAoC. The AI knows where it can and can't be, and does not have to follow a poorly defined path like mobs in EQ do (2nd floor of Hate for example).<br>
36. Items will be given back to you if you hand things in wrong (or to the wrong person) for a quest.<br>
37. Money is weightless in DAoC.<br>
38. You can make change anywhere in DAoC, no need to visit the vault.<br>
39. All weapons, armor, items, and mobs have a rating equivalent to the /consider command in EQ. This locks all of the above into a set level range.<br>
40. Using items outside your level range is impractical, and will destroy the items. This prevents twinking and powerlevelling.<br>
41. You do not have to be in a group to get experience from a kill you assist with. You get xp accodring to the amount of help you give out. This prevents kill stealing.<br>
42. You will NOT lose the components you use to make an item if your tradeskill combine attempt fails.<br>
43. No clicking to drag things around with a tradeskill, the necessary items are automatically taken out of your inventory on success.<br>
44. More tha one person can use a given forge, loom, smithy etc at a time. No more waiting in line.<br>
45. While there are issues with lag and linkdeath, by and large they are FAR less frequent than everquest's problems.<br>
46. There are NO ZONES, in the EQ sense, in this game. The only time you &quot;zone&quot; is when entering a city or dungeon. The rest of the gameworld is perfectly seamless.<br>
47. There are horses in DAoC, anyone can use them, they are fun to ride, and therefore you don't need to beg the services of a porting class to get somewhere.<br>
48. Any attempts to heal or buff lower level players will deny them xp. This prevents powerlevelling.<br>
49. There are no hacks (ala SHowEQ) as of yet that allow players to take unfair advantage of others in the game.<br>
50. All gear can be customised by changing the colors with dyes, giving a single piece of gear dozens of possible looks.<br>
51. All gear can also be customized with patterns, giving a single piece of gear hundreds of possible looks when combined with the different colors.<br>
52. All gear has graphics that are unique to its type, and often, unique to the item itself. EQ has countless problems with items that have no graphics with them, or share the same graphics with other items.<br>
53. You cannot lose a level due to death, you can only bottom out at 0xp in your current level. This means once you make 50 it's yours forever, the level grind comes to a permanent end.<br>
54. The chat system in DAoC, while a bit buggy at the moment, has far more capability that EQ's chat system, even considering the promised changes with SoL.<br>
55. Guilds have nine levels of member rankings now, from trial member to full guildmaster.<br>
56. You can define what capability you wish to give to your guild officers on a power by power basis.<br>
57. Guild alliances are a &quot;guild of guilds&quot; with thier own separate chat channels. Everyone in all guilds in the alliance can see the alliance chat channel.<br>
58. Due to the skill system in DAoC, characters of the same race and class can be radically different from eachother with regards to the magic they use and the skills they possess. This is a diversity that EQ isn't capable of.<br>
59. DAoC has far more races and character classes than EQ does, and all classes have unique abilities that no other class has, even if they do share some abilities among all classes.<br>
60. Groups may go as high as 8 players, whereas EQ can only handle 6.<br>
61. The grouping system provides a publishing and search feature that allows you to quickly and easily find classes and levels you need for your group, or to publish your own talents so those looking can find you. This is ten times the grouping system that everquest has.<br>
62. DAoC has a unique RvR combat system that pits the three realms on a given server against eachother. Their system on PvP could easily have a top 100 list created on why it's the best PvP system out there. As it is, this means that DAoC will have a unique form of gameplay that cannot be found on any other MMORPG on the market today.<br>
63. DAoC has quests, and &quot;uber&quot; monsters, giving it all of the endgame features of games like everquest in ADDITION to the RvR system.<br>
64. One does not have to participate in RvR, although by its design it's appealing even to those who do not like PvP environments.<br>
65. Guild chat has a private, officer-only channel. Only a player who has been a guild officer can truly understand what a huge boon this is.<br>
66. Your friends list can hold more people than EQ's, and in addition you will be notified with a message the instant a friend of yours logs into or out of the game.<br>
67. DAoC high level gear LOOKS like high level gear. You won't be stuck with newbie graphics that make you look like a beggar at 50. You could MAKE yourself look like a beggar if you really wanted to.<br>
68. DAoC has an item decay system that is well thought out and will give it a much more stable economy than everquest.<br>
69. Combat in DAoC is vastly superior to any existing MMORPG. Each class gains new styles and moves that stack with previous versions, and build off them so that you can make chain attacks. Combat is not just clicking a button anymore like in EQ.<br>
70. The graphics in DAoC are so superior to EQ that they easily deserve their own top 100 reasons list. ANyone who has seen the sunsets, varying levels of mists, fog and rain, and any part of the countryside will understand.<br>
71. You can add the emblem of your guild to your gear. Place it on your cloaks and shields to make your guild more well known.<br>
72. Mythic provides phenomenal customer support. Verant should hang thier heads in shame, it's like comparing grains of dust to diamonds.<br>
73. Mythic, as a company, is at the whim of the playerbase. Any changes that players express a desire for will make it into the game.<br>
74. Mythic is not afraid to answer posts directly, and to apologise for their mistakes. VI is famous for their holier than thou attitude and refusal to admit they have done anything wrong.<br>
75. Mythic always sides with the customer on any issue by default, they give the benefit of the doubt.<br>
76. Patches in DAoC take a matter of minutes. Mythic has yet to release a patch that did not add at least three new and excellent features to the game.<br>
77. The roleplaying servers in DAoC are actually real roleplaying servers. RP is enforced there, and violators will be banned from RP, with their characters moved to a standard server.<br>
78. DAoC's interface supports scripting and macros, so there is no end to what you can code into their game on your end. Expect to see player-created packages that add content in the near future.<br>
79. DAoC has phenomenal sound effects. While hunting in the avalon marshes, this player stopped to listen for a while. Between the peepers, crickets, buzzing insects, occasional bullfrog, splash of a fish on the water, and wolf howl, it is totally indestinguishable from a real marsh. The sounds create the most immersive environment imaginable.<br>
80. The emotes in DAoC (/wave, /bow and /dance for example) have far better and more lifelike effects than everquest is capable of producing with their modeling system.<br>
81. DAoC has a far, far higher content to space ratio than everquest. EQ is replete with vast stretches of open, underused space. (Karanas, certain dungeons, etc)<br>
82. DAoC has set the standard for stability and starting content with this launch, and Mythic was disappointed because they had to &quot;rush it&quot; and leave things out. If thier second best attempt is this good, imagine what this game will look like in a year's time.<br>
83. DAoC provides far, far more customiseability to thier user interface than EQ does. You can clone EQ's interface down to the smallest detail, or completely create your own. Having real control over the camera is excellent.<br>
84. Public channels are only availiable in cities. This greatly reduces the amount of off topic garbage one is exposed to in DAoC. It also has the added effect of concentrating player-related economic business in the city zones.<br>
85. Mythic provides prompt service in game when they are made aware of both bugs and issues with unruly players.<br>
86. Mythic is not afraid to take harsh disciplinary action against players that violate their gaming policy. This has the effect of chilling bad behavior and promoting a community roleplaying environment.<br>
87. Mythic provides PUBLIC forums for discussion of their issues with their own staff. Vi once did this, but couldn't handle the criticism and shut their boards down, turning them into a moderated forum that is useless for communicating with their developers.<br>
88. All GMs and customer service agents in DAoC are paid employees of Mythic, rather than players voulnteering their time.<br>
89. The /advice system allows you to both get answers and give advice to those new to the game without bothering CS with trivial issues.<br>
90. Due to the game's inherent design, &quot;lootwhores&quot; simply do not exist. Just think for one second about the problems and anxiety that this simple change puts an end to. No greed in camps, no arguments among guildmates about who gtes their epic next... it's a great paradigm shift.<br>
91. There are no LORE or NODROP items in DAoC. You may do with your gear as you please, be it selling it or giving it away.<br>
92. The /quest feature lists all the quests you have ever completed. The quest journal nicely lists all the quests you are currently running, as well as what the next step is. It's an ingenious system for keeping track of what you are doing.<br>
93. DAoC allows you to earn rank, title, and, promised in the future, the ability to own land and buildings, and even horses.<br>
94. DAoC's quests have some amount of dynamic ability, meaning that though the reward is the same, two different people may experience different paths to complete the quests.<br>
95. DAoC has fewer bugs and more features at release than EQ will have after SoL is released. The only area that EQ beats DAoC in is pure content, and that will change.<br>
96. DAoC doesn't seem to have the same account hacking and hijacking problems that EQ does. Mythic restores lost characters, they don't tell you touch luck, no reimbursements.<br>
97. Mythic's upcoming feature list looks like something out of a RPG player's wet dream. EQ has more of the same in line in SoL, including poorer implementations of some of DAoC's current features.<br>
98. DAoC gives you the numbers right up front for all skills, spells, abilities, and the experience you are awarded up front.<br>
99. The spell effects in DAoC are absolutely gorgeous.<br>
100. Mythic hired TWEETY to be their main PR. /drool... the best VI can do is Absor (sorry bud, Tweety owns you). <p>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>

<br>
But I think you could have done a better job.  Some of those 100 actually point to where EQ is superior. Bottom line is that EQ does some things better than DAOC and vice versa.<br>
<br>
As for CS, Mythic is trying, but they've yet to come within shooting distance of Verants CS, much as people liked to complain about it. Not having Guides is a DISADVANTAGE, not an advantage. <br>
<br>

Yes there is. You only stay as a 'ghost' for 1 minute per level. That means you have 5 minutes at level 5, 50 minutes at level 50.. a MUCH shorter res window than in EQ.<br>
<br>
21. Not always. If a mob 'calls for help' then greys in the area will attack you. Also there is an assist code that means lesser mobs group up with slightly tougher ones.. even if the lesser ones are grey, all of them will attack you if you attack one of them.<br>
<br>
23. nitpicking, but the actual figure given by mythic was 4 minutes, not 1. Also, I have to admit this is hard to believe, health is very slow in regenning, I could see a full bar taking more than 4 minutes for me at 15 already, let alone higher.<br>
<br>
24. Depends on the type of buff. Not all buffs are concentration buffs.<br>
<br>
72. Lol, you HAVE to be kidding... their CS sucks giant goats. Average appeal answer time in the game is about 8 hours, and thats if you play peak time. I play off-peak and have an unanswered appeal I made nearly 2 weeks ago.<br>
<br>
But yeah, I could only nitpick on 5 items. hell, I doubt anyone could make a list of 100 good things about EQ and not have more than 5 contended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  All in all, a damn good game.<br>

21) So much for realism.<br>
22) see (12) comment<br>
24) not true of all buffs<br>

27) true in EQ too<br>
2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   you can make a mint off some EQ trades as well<br>
31) so much for realism<br>

33) so much for realism -- but people still get lost<br>
34) and it fails to help too, at least as often as people get stuck in EQ.<br>
40) no it doesn't, it just requires powerleveling before twinking.<br>
41) and boy does it make people mad when you steal any amount of experience from them, even by healing them.<br>
45) direct falsehood...connection and lag problems are one of DAoC's major issues now...much worse than EQ for those affected<br>
46) which means running away is much harder...one of the reasons people use alt-tab, to ensure loss of aggro<br>
47) which porting class would that be? And you can't take the horses where you want to go.<br>
4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and permits intra-realm griefing by denying people experience at will<br>
49) there will be. Besides the built-in hacks (like alt-tab)<br>
53) and people are still complaining the death penalty is too harsh<br>
54) but you can't shout, and you sometimes can't even get a chat channel.<br>
58,59) reworded repeats of previous items, ignored<br>

6<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and will drive people away....people work hard for their items, they don't want them to vanish<br>
69) it's pretty much the same.  establish a few techniques, and use them over and over again because they're the ones that work.<br>
70) you can't even do a general 100 right....while the graphics may be cool, I really doubt you can name 100 advantages of them.<br>
72) Last I heard their average /appeal time in-game was 14 hours, and out of game was 6 days. I do credit them for admitting how bad it is.<br>
73) If this is true, you should start screaming now. Think about it.<br>
74) They may not be afraid, but the fact is that they only answer the posts they want to. They have an ignore policy on just about everything that they can ignore.<br>
75) See (73).<br>
76) Not true.  They've been down for many hours sometimes.<br>
77) Have you been banned yet? They don't have time to do anything more than fix names right now.<br>
7<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But the underlying features aren't there yet.  %t, etc.<br>
79) Sound is garbage. EQ had better sound when it launched. It &quot;sounds&quot; like they didn't use any audio experts at all.<br>
81) I'll give you this one, but only because DA is so small, not because the content level is high.<br>
83) You can't clone EQ's interface.  People are always complaining about EQ interface features that aren't in DA.<br>
84) And reduces the sense of community everywhere else.<br>
85) see (72).  Prompt?<br>
86) perhaps not, but they don't tell anyone when they do it, so nobody is discouraged by it.  Also see (72)<br>
87) False. They do not provide official forums of any kind. Any forums you have found are not supported by Mythic.<br>
8<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I answered this previously. No guides = more CS overload.<br>
89) Advice system supports greifer activity.<br>
90) Then why is everything camped?<br>
91) Or sell it on ebay.<br>
93) Future promises aren't now. We're talking about now.<br>
95) False. I'll get detailed if you want to argue.<br>
96) See (72). They have had corrupted characters.  Account hacking will come later, when people have more to lose.<br>
97) SoL isn't out yet...perhaps they will take DA ideas and make them better.  After all, the bulk of DA is EQ ideas in the first place.<br>

99) duplicate of (70)<br>
100) Sex discrimination, eh? Well, most gamers are male. <br>
<br>
Bah..I'm too lazy to go fill in the ones I skipped...I hit the highlights tho. You are so far off-base on some of these, I just decided to shed some reality on it.  Both EQ and DAoC are good games, but DAoC is NOT at the same stage of developmnent that EQ is in.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) The penalty isn't just experience, it's con points too, which costs money.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Check my #2 again. I stated if you got a rez you would not be subjected to any greater death penalty than a few xp lost. You do NOT lose con if you get a rez. The death does count against you for the number of con you lose the next time you die without a rez, but you lose none if rezzed.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 10) That's assuming you can beat the other campers to the spawn.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 16) I rather doubt this.

Apparently the Scout class is the hardest to solo up currently. They aren't as hard to solo as a Warrior in EQ, so my point stands.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 17) And the ability to only learn a few of them well, or many of them poorly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My point is that there is a large variety, so that you won't see very many people even of the same class that are the same with respect to their skillsets. And in this game, yes, it's hard to be good at everything. My personal preference is for systems like that. You must choose your path.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 19) MAJOR class balancing is still in progress, or haven't you seen the nerf screamers on the vault boards. Which majority--you and yourself?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Are you reading the IGN vaults? I'd say 50% of the posts are happy with the balance, 40% more want some minor tweaks, and 10% are whining loudly because the tweaks of the other 40% are getting them nerfed. This isn't different from Rogue whining in EQ, we know they are full of shit. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Compare this to VI classes (Necro, Paladin).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 21) So much for realism.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ok, this I suspect is a difference of tastes on our part. Let me explain to you where I come from. I DETEST games that throw hardships in and hamper fun based on saying &quot;It's more realistic.&quot; That is THE LAMEST excuse, in my opinion, for a game to hamper your fun. DAoC took exception to that excuse and decided to go with the philosophy of &quot;If this isn't fun, it isn't going into the game.&quot; This is a GAME, not real life. If I want realism I'll go to work. When I go to play I don't want to be bothered with unnecessary hardships in the name of realism. EQ has it's faults in being realistic as well. This is THE biggest difference between DAoC and EQ. It's change in basic design philosophy. I'll probably be referring all of your &quot;So much for realism&quot; responses back to this response. If that's the best reason you can come up with why you don't like one of DAoC's features, it's probbly a perfectly valid feature, just something you don't like on personal tastes. To each their own.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 22) see (12) comment<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You aren't suggesting that EQ camps are less crowded, easier to find, and pop faster than DAoC camps are you? /boggle<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 24) not true of all buffs<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That is true, however, it IS true of MOST buffs. ALL EQ buffs run out. Therefore, DAoC is better than EQ since there is less hassle maintaining buffs. How much fun is shaman spell swapping at raids? Buff once in DAoC and be done with it.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 25,26) jury is out here...i suspect the epic quests are not of epic difficulty, so their value will be diminished<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Fair enough, I can't debate this since I haven't read any completed epic guides. It seems unfair to assume that an epic quest in DAoC would reward poorly. Head over to www.lewtz0r.com and check out some of the items there...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 27) true in EQ too<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No, you're misreading my statement... I should have been more clear. There are decay factors in DAoC... the same exact item you see at a vendor, if made by a player, has higher % ratings for it's durability and usefulness. EQ really has no counterpart to this one sicne they don't support item durability and decay.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you can make a mint off some EQ trades as well<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yes, SOME tradeskills, that are viable only to SOME classes. In DAoC you can make a great deal of money off any tradeskill under any class, hence DAoC &gt; EQ in this respect.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 31) so much for realism<br>
32) so much for realism<br>
33) so much for realism -- but people still get lost<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->See my response to #12 above. As for people getting lost, are you saying that they don't get lost in EQ as well? Only if they are running ShowEQ... otherwise you get a broken sense heading skill you have to train up, and it's far more inconvenient to use than a simple onscreen compass.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 34) and it fails to help too, at least as often as people get stuck in EQ.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I've been stuck in EQ so bad before I had to /duel a player and have him kill me, then drag me out of the rocks I was stuck in. CS was nowhere to be found. I've been stuck in DAoC 3 times so far, and that command has never once failed to get me out.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 40) no it doesn't, it just requires powerleveling before twinking.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yes, you can powerlevel a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>little</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> in DAoC. It's fifty times worse in EQ, I'll just hand my twink monk a tranquil staff and cloak of flames and solo to 50 in three days... and what about the tried and true Druid damage shield method? Ha. DAoC is a lot harder to powerlevel.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 41) and boy does it make people mad when you steal any amount of experience from them, even by healing them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This doesn't invalidate my point. It's a better solution than EQ has to stop KSing.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 45) direct falsehood...connection and lag problems are one of DAoC's major issues now...much worse than EQ for those affected<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Bullshit. I have had ONE linkdeath since launch, I have far more in EQ. I think this is mainly due to the server lag in EQ on raids. How many people do you see dropping like flies on EQ raids? People on a 56K connection cannot even come raiding with our guild, they ALWAYS go LD. DAoC does have some lag issues, but they are better than EQ.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 46) which means running away is much harder...one of the reasons people use alt-tab, to ensure loss of aggro<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You were talking about realism earlier... you would rather use an exploit like crossing a zone line to clear aggro than actually be forced to outrun a monster to stay alive? You're being selective, are you biased against DAoC? Granted, I'm strongly biased FOR DAoC. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm listing this reason because I hate the LOADING PLEASE WAIT messages in EQ, and I DON'T miss the crashes to desktop EQ has given me on an average of one out of 5 zoneline crossings.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 47) which porting class would that be? And you can't take the horses where you want to go.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Have you seen the shit that druids have to put up with? Eternal newbie tells... same with Wizzies... always begging a port. In DAoC nobody puts up with that since it doesn't exist. I also don't have to wait an hour for my guild druids to finish porting the whole guild over somewhere for a raid. In DAoC everyone can just hop on a horse and get there. As for not taking horses where you want to go, you are correct. The best bet you can do now is take the horse that is going to run past the place you want to go and jump off. Mythic already stated they are changing this so there are more routes. You will also be able to own your own horse in the future. Much better than EQ...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and permits intra-realm griefing by denying people experience at will<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Which will get you banned immediately (well, 6 hours later when CS can finally find the time to answer the tickets...) just like any in game griefing with EQ. The point of this one was that it hampers powerlevelling, and it still stands.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 49) there will be. Besides the built-in hacks (like alt-tab)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I am in absolute agreement with you here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, since they aren't there yet, my point still stands.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 53) and people are still complaining the death penalty is too harsh<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Whiners would complain that the brick of gold you gave them is too heavy to carry to the bank. The death penalty in this game is NOTHING compared to EQ, so my point still stands. Once you get 50, you are done levelling. I imagine it'll strat to suck when you die for the 1000th time at 50 and lose 1000 con points, but that'll be addressed I'm sure.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 54) but you can't shout, and you sometimes can't even get a chat channel.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Again, personal preference. Thanks GOD I don't have to put up with newbie chat spam on /ooc. /auction and /shout. I welcome the peace and quiet. Sure, I can shut them off in EQ, but in EQ the game really demands that you use them. Not having them in DAoC means I'm not being left out of anything important since the important information will also have to take another route to my chat box.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 58,59) reworded repeats of previous items, ignored<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ha. Read them again. You missed the differences. Those are actually VERY important differences, and these are big selling points for the game.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 62) and totally useless, as long as alt-tab or the like is around.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Huh? This remark has no bearing I can see on my 58 thru 63... what one were you referring to? It's totally out of context for 62...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 63) how many dragon level encounters can you find<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Just the Salisbury Giant so far, and he spanked us bad. I've also seen that MASSIVE spider demon once... in EQ you don't get to fight dragons until Naggy and Vox, in DAoC I'm already seeing big mobs, with a ton more on the way in the future. I'll wait! Remember that at launch Naggy and Vox were the ONLY ubermobs in the game... no gods, planes didn't exists, no kunark, no velious, etc. Mythic will phase these into the game much like EQ did since they aren't important to have at launch... they are only necessary for a mature playerbase.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 64) you do if you want to see more than a fraction of the world....not that's its very big anyway<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Spoekn like one who has never journeyed far from the roads. DAoC is as large as EQ. Add up the size of all 3 realms, then add in the RvR. That's BIG. Even without RvR there is a lot of space and a lot of places to visit, again with plenty more on the way. I expect EQ will take the size throne again with SoL however.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 6<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and will drive people away....people work hard for their items, they don't want them to vanish<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Like they do in EQ when they mysteriously poof... or when VI's CS refuses to reimburse a RotWF when the quest bugs and you lose the product of 400 hours of camping. Seriously tho, item decay isn't that bad. Nothing vanishes, it just needs repairs. It's also more realistic, since you say you like realism so much.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 69) it's pretty much the same. establish a few techniques, and use them over and over again because they're the ones that work.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Wrong. In EQ all a warrior does is hit attack, or hit taunt and attack. big deal. In DAoC every weapon style has several moves. It's NOTHING like EQ. I play a combat class in both, so on this one I do speak from experience.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 70) you can't even do a general 100 right....while the graphics may be cool, I really doubt you can name 100 advantages of them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Oh, I could... you can't possibly be suggesting that DAoC's graphics are anywhere close to EQs... it's like comparing ascii art to a painting. And this top 100 seems to be coming along nicely, since I've refuted most of your points thus far without many problems.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 72) Last I heard their average /appeal time in-game was 14 hours, and out of game was 6 days. I do credit them for admitting how bad it is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'll tell you what. I'll retract this one for two months, and we'll see if they sink or swim. I still think their current CS is better than VI. All VI does is listen and then say &quot;We can't help you.&quot; At least with Mythic, when you get a response you get real help. VI has faster response time, for now.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 73) If this is true, you should start screaming now. Think about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I disagree. The playerbase knows what it needs better than the game developers. All you need is someone to temper the brilliance from the bullshit, and Mythic has people working on that now.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 74) They may not be afraid, but the fact is that they only answer the posts they want to. They have an ignore policy on just about everything that they can ignore.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->VI has a BAD attitude and an ignore policy on everything, even things they shouldn't ignore. You cannot possibly be trying to tell me VI has better communication with players than Mythic. Did you forget what whineplay was like?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 75) See (73).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Beiefit of the doubt in this case means not doing the RotWF twice. I'll take it in a heartbeat. Check out my response to 73 as well...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 76) Not true. They've been down for many hours sometimes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->First two days, on launch. Not down much since, and the patches are FAR shorter in duration than EQ.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 77) Have you been banned yet? They don't have time to do anything more than fix names right now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Nope, I am not a RP nazi, but I get along just fine with 99% of them. I'll take RP Nazi's over &quot;D00d, ru n00bi?&quot; Any day of the year. Personal perference again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  At least I can get the assholes kicked off my server. Haven't had that happen yet, but it's nice to have that option. Have you seen FV in EQ? That is not a RP server.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 7<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But the underlying features aren't there yet. %t, etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hah. Did you forget EQ's total lack of chat features at release time? DAoC has them beat in spades. Granted, it needs a lot of work, but so does EQ chat.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 79) Sound is garbage. EQ had better sound when it launched. It &quot;sounds&quot; like they didn't use any audio experts at all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Maybe I'm biased, I have a SBLive5.1, and the surround in my speakers is gorgeous. EQ has shit for sound, it's all repetitive, and half the time it doesn't even want to work right. I love it when the &quot;AH!&quot; I hear from taking a hit is 50db louder than the rest of the sfx. Nuff said.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 83) You can't clone EQ's interface. People are always complaining about EQ interface features that aren't in DA.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I defy you to name one. I have a one hundred percent perfect EQ interface clone programmed into DAoC right now. I've even got the strafe working. People need to stop complaining and RTFM!<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 84) And reduces the sense of community everywhere else.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'll give you this one, it'll hamper community development at least in some ways. I'll take that over the noise, but that's personal preference again.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 85) see (72). Prompt?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I've waited as long for a GM on many occasions. I'll give you that for now, EQ will have faster service. See my response to 72 above for the tradeoff you make...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 86) perhaps not, but they don't tell anyone when they do it, so nobody is discouraged by it. Also see (72)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Oh, they warn first... then they ban. Just like EQ, but at least with Mythic, you can be banned for being an asshole all the time, especially on an RP server.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 87) False. They do not provide official forums of any kind. Any forums you have found are not supported by Mythic.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ok, you got me here, I thought the IGN were official simply because of the number of mythic employees posting to them. Change my statment to this:87. Mythic develppers frequently post on playermade public forums in order to address issues and discuss the game with their players. Vi once did this, but couldn't handle the criticism and shut their boards down, turning them into a moderated forum that is useless for communicating with their developers.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 8<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I answered this previously. No guides = more CS overload.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->/advice reduces it, serves the exact same purpose as guides since EQ guides can't do a damn thing about anything.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 89) Advice system supports greifer activity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->How about that VI GM who summoned and bound players in VP under Phara'Dar's nose to prove a point? Any system is subject to abuse. Just because it can be abused it does not invalidate the system.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 90) Then why is everything camped?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Lootwore: Greedy SoB who does nothing but service himself in a game. You can only run the majority of quests ONCE, so once you do the quest and get the item you are done. Everyone in your group gets it too, so there are no arguments and ninjalooting. How EASY would it be to do the WW scout quest in EQ if everyone there got the reward? This feature will cut the lootwhoring down to zippo. Think outside the EQ box my friend.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 91) Or sell it on ebay.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->/shrug, let them sell it on ebay or in game in the cities. DAoC's point was once you get it you can do what you want with it. There's no silly cosmic accountant like in EQ. I like being able to do with my items what I please. That ebay reason is a pathetic attempt to refute... you're grasping here.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 93) Future promises aren't now. We're talking about now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Should I just throw out all of the advances that EQ has promised in SoL? My list would look very different, and be FAR superior to this one. You are talking about now, I am talking about now and the future. The ranking system IS here now and EQ doesn't have it. Point stands.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 95) False. I'll get detailed if you want to argue.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Do you want a top100 most annoying EQ bugs list? I'm sure I can get you one, if I continue with nothing to do at work. I can do a list of 50 on pathing problems alone... DAoC has a few quest bugs, big deal... they aren't showstoppers. The biggest I think is falling through the ground in Camelot... that's not as bad as the bug in EQ net code that knocks you off the server on zone...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 96) See (72). They have had corrupted characters. Account hacking will come later, when people have more to lose.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Account hacking will always be there, agreed. That still doesn't invalidate my point. Mythic RESTORES your character after a hack or accident, EQ simply BANS you. Point stands.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 97) SoL isn't out yet...perhaps they will take DA ideas and make them better. After all, the bulk of DA is EQ ideas in the first place.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The bulk of DA ideas are pen and paper RPG, Earthdawn in particular, with phenomenal content developed for the game world. The MMORPG aspects of DAoC do borrow heavily from EQ, but with many basic design flaws corrected by people who actually know how to make a game fun. Mythic's list for added content includes things that EQ isn't capable of doing, like allowing you to own land and buildings. Point stands.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 9<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And no information on what they mean.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->So? In EQ you can't get any info without hacking the game. At least DAoC gives it up front. They've also explained their formulas as well, much better than VI. Point stands.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 99) duplicate of (70)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ok, you got me here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I was wracking my brains at this point trying not to be a duper too...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 100) Sex discrimination, eh? Well, most gamers are male.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hah. I am racist against idiots, and I discriminate not on gender or looks but on brainwaves. Go to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.bowlofmice.com/tweety">www.bowlofmice.com/tweety</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and check out those rants.

<br>
Just wanted to mention that, because you mentioned losing 1000 con for the 1000th death in level 50. Not the case, you lose the same 3 con you lost in deaths 3 to 999 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think that /appeal list isn't really first come first serve. I logged in Camelot a few days agao and the next day couldn't get into the game. I made another charachter and /appealed the situation and I got a response in under 3 minutes.<br>
<br>
That same night my group had an exp leach (caster casting one spell on our pulls to syphon exp). We asked him to stop many times and finally we all /appealed. It's been about a week and that's still in line. A friend did get a reply and it seems that this guy is going to find himself picking a new name as he gets transfered to a non-roleplay server. His name was the same as one of the dungeons in Albion.<br>
<br>
Second.. You lose 1 con point for the first death of each level, 2 for the second death and 3 from every death in that level from then on. If you get a res you recieve less experiance back (assuming you pray if you don't get a res) but you do not lose the con points. I'm still not really sure what Res effects does though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uarakazul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arakazul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/01 8:54:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hehe</span><hr size=1> Ok a couple points. <br>
1. Raviel you do have way way way too much time on yoru hands at work :P<br>
<br>
2. Question for you too Raviel. How did you manage to get the strafe working. Right know I have my eq interface identical to my daoc interface except for the strafing with mouselook. In EQ I would use A and D for turn left and right and then if I wanted to strafe I would hold the right mouse button down and use A or D at the same time allowing me to strafe. In Daoc I have A and D set to turn (as it should) but holding the right mouse button down while pressing a or d only lets me turn rather than strafe. If i understand you right you got this straightened out....how please? hehe <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showMessageRange?topicID=80.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showMessageRange?topicID=80.topic&start=41&stop=45>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=80.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showNextMessage?topicID=80.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.emailToFriend?topicID=80.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.threadControl?topicID=80.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=80.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=80.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14>Other Games</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
