<br>
<br>
to the person who red through red cons...i've seen the same thing happen...chances are they were just lazy...i know they could see you....i know blue people can see you now if you go through a mile gate....i was just sitting in innis and had a green nightshade following me around while stealthed.....not  that they got lucky and found me once or twice but they followed me, thier distance was enough to /stick and tbh this is purely unacceptable....before the path it was impossible nearly to stick to a stealthed person equal or higher level...and still nearly impossible to stick to them if they weren't way lower than you....<br>
<br>
please run some tests with someone who is only 66% stealth spec and youll understand how really unfair this is.....it pretty much makes stealth worthless....<br>
<br>
another suggestion i could make to fix it is this....make the see range for detect hidden classes work at the buffed over level range... i.e. i have 46 stealth plus 2 from rank right now totalling 48..i am 44th level....i could see someone with 48 stealth as though they were an even con (5 paces) <br>
doing this would work out great imo for assassins who choose to take 50 stealth (right now absolutly no point) but if this change was implemented eventually they would have a huge buffed stealth (60+ depending on what the buffed skill cap is, i hear its 11 from rank+realm but noone really knows for sure on my server) in either case at max they would have 71....and thats if they  full stealth spec...imo if anyone sacrifices cd and envenom to go full stealth (you wouldnt even sac crit or piercing/blades) they deserve to be the master of detect hidden.....understand having 71 stealth in this case would NOT let you hide like you were level 71...only see other people...this is assuming we're using the old stealth system we use to have...which still needed a minimum range of 5 paces for an even level con with detect hidden....<br>
<br>
another change i would like to see is a level in stealth that makes it so when stealthed you cannot be f8'd .....it seems fair to me that the person should actually have to see you notice you and click on you to detect you.....rather than just sitin a doorway in attack mode and hit f8....(ive seen this done alot, it gets you terminated on keep raids)<br>
<br>
another change i think would be viable is to make it so danger sense tells you when you have been clicked on by a member of an enemy realm....(this one seems like a no brainer to me)<br>
assassins are now the number one targets of archers...as we die in two shots with NO crit and have no bladeturn or stuns or pets or anything thas going to stop an archer from plugging us again...at least in this scenario we would have 3 or 4 seconds while they are drawing thier bow to stealth up...if we're already stealthed then too bad for us...imo it wouldnt be broken because youd have to loook at the message and still react very quickly or be plugged.<br>
<br>
this one is a bit far fetched but very cool and useful imo nonetheless.....<br>
change distraction so that in rvr combat enemry realm members see your char flash where you throw your stone...(it makes a projection of your char for them to see) the point of this is this:<br>
im going up to milegate x......i see 10 high levle players camping the gate waiting for someone to try to get brave and come thorugh...i throw the stone off to the right side...they see a flash of my char a few times like im unstealthing and stealthing back up...(ive done this many times to  play with a group and get them to run around while i can look for one of the members to get separated.)  they run at you like mad....you run up to the caster who was sitting down and is now unguarded.....wham perf! soandso was killed by evlimeca...then they say HOW DID HE GET WAY OVER THERE SO FAST? ohh thats right distraction doesnt suck now...there would be a million good instances where this ability worked great....it would get us through cramped hallways...add a little more confusion to keep raids when they are looking for a rogue thats nowhere near where they thought they saw him...and all in all probably be the mnost fun &quot;toy &quot; to play with in the game.<br>
<br>
these are just suggestions imo its stuff we need...like ive said in my other posts stealth is really our only defesne...part of that should involve some confusion, early warning, and immune to people who are just trying for very easy assassin kills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uinfiltratorx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Infiltrator X</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 12:41:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2128.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden changed (good news)</span><hr size=1> Has it occurred to the team leads to actually petition Mythic into explaining to the general population how the stealth/detect algorithms are supposed to work?<br>

Either way, what's on pendragon is not necessarily what is on live right now.  I'll be testing this more tonight I hope.  It is definately a welcome change. <p><B><big><font color="#ffffff">Bile Silhouette</B></big><BR>Pendragon Smurf of Death<br>

<br>
My targets are attacking me first a lot more now, before I get PA off. This used to happen with Red cons and sometimes Orange but almost never with lower cons. I can only assume I am getting spotted swooping in  for the kill sooner and they just spam their attack key. Either that or I've gotten rusty.<br>
<br>
If this trend holds up than along with enervate being nerfed its gonna be mage class for me. I love a challenge but I don't enjoy getting my teeth kicked in on a steady basis.<br>

Prior to patch, blue con Black Badgers would uncover me maybe 1 out of 20 times.  Post patch it is more like 50/50.  I also get the Mob &quot;turn and face but not uncover you&quot; thing almost every time.<br>

1 easy solution.  Change PA to a BACKstab.  Problem solved.<br>

<br>
i might of put it in one of my earlier lengthy posts, but i dont remember as it was late...but why is anyone without detect hidden even able to see us at all....i know its not realistic that we can hide in the open, but maybe we have special cloaks the blend in...maybe we're all just ninjas it is the art of invisibility after all....maybe we're all psychic and just make it appear as though we aren't there in our oppenents head...My point is it shouldn't be based on reality now matter how much the casters cry about it...if it wa based on reality casters would just be guys with no weaponskill running around in dresses with sticks, cuz oh yeh spells are REAL either.  <br>
<br>
at this point im really not holding out much hope for this game anymore though i do love it...best case scenario i see is an expansion comes out with alternate skills much like eq....and we take another stab at making everything ok....it's just way too far gone at this point....i seriously doubt i'm the only one who has noticed server totals seeming to slip over the last few months...the fact that everyone has made 50 and doesn't do exp anymore making it so anyone who isnt't 50 (many many many nightshades, in fact the closest nightshade on my server to 50 that still plays is 45.)  i applaud mythic on a tremendous effort on making pvp fair enough to be fun for most people (uo and ac failed horribly at this, eq too..) but the way they went about it was just bad..instead of having a server of 2000 people i have 3 of 666. there are plenty of things that could be done to fix everything but it really appears that yet another game is doing down the tubes due to the &quot;vision&quot;<br>
<br>
on a good note starwars comes out in les than a year and sb before that...hopefully one of those two can finally make the rogue class balanced instead of extremly broken or extremely bad....<br>
