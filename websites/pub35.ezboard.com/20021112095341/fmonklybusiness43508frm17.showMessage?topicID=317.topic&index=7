It seemed obvious to me, however, that something needed to be done considering warriors &amp; other plate classes had been experiencing a passive nerf since about the launch of Velious.  The basic problem that VI has finally confronted is that you cannot continually improve classes in rebalancing efforts furthering the ongoing game mudflation.  This was definately a problem they brought on themselves through poor itemization, but nerfing or removing those items from the game would have certainly caused every bit as much of an uproar.  I still think they made the right decision in the long run, and this stands as one of the few right decisions they have made.  No matter if you improve one class or nerf another, relatively you have done exactly the same thing.  In this case they chose not to continually overpower one class in order to compensate for another overpowered one.  In the long run I believe the game will be better off for it.<br>
<br>
I have had the balance arguments before with monks &amp; was always met with, &quot;don't nerf monks  ...oh, and warriors are fine where they are.&quot;  There was a problem, and something did need to be done about it.  Despite appearances, I never like seeing any class nerfed.  The armageddon attitude of monks here and elsewhere, however, has risen to comical levels.  The best suggestion that I can make to monks is to cut the drama &amp; start making rational objective arguments with some unbiased backing data.  These constant threats of massive account cancellations only make you look like selfish children who can't have their own way.  Do yourselves a favor &amp; try to achieve some objectivity instead of just having a tantrum and throwing around some biased data.  It's the dramatists making threats &amp; exaggerationg the consequences that earn the jibes from warriors such as myself.  <br>
<br>
Take a step back &amp; look at some of these threads from the outside.  Surely you can see how infantile some of the monks on this board are acting.<br>

I could easily add about a dozen more.  It's time to start making some rational arguments if you honestly think you have been treated unfairly. <p><br><font size=2>

The vast majority of the posts in this particular forum are venting.  Considering the size of the monk community, as well as the fact that this change negatively affects all monks, the outbursts seem reasonable.  After all, if VI stated that warrior DPS was too high on average and needed to be knocked down a tier, wouldn't there be lots of complaints on the warrior boards?  (insert &lt;class name&gt; for warrior)<br>
<br>
If the few posts with post-patch data are correct, VI apparently has made it more difficult for monks in the 1100 ac range, while not touching the 1400+ ac monks at all.  Maybe this is a mob-specific change, but if not they didn't begin to address the problem at all.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure you're aware of this, but telling a roomful of angry people to &lt;stop whining/quit throwing tantrums/settle down&gt; rarely has any good effect.  You are, after all, browsing the monk board.  Feel free to take a break from browsing until we have some concrete data (barring VI changes, probably in a day or so we should have some).  Sarcasm may be a justified response to melodrama, but it draws in people like myself to defend my class.<br>
<br>
I didn't start a twinked iksar, I leveled myself to 45 pre-Kunark with such uber gear as my bare fists, wu's gauntlets (yay lightstone effect), gator legs, and froggie crown.  I had to stay under 14 lbs, so i couldn't loot FS.  I've deleted/given away plat to stay underweight.  In short, try to remember that there are some of us here who have been around for a long time, through the ups and the downs.  Hearken back to the days of Kunark, when warriors essentially did monk damage, while still tanking the best with or without defensive.  It would have been easier to nerf warriors, but instead they put monks on a different offense table and gave us better weapons.<br>
<br>
A word on mudflation:<br>
In this particular case, mudflation is utterly irrelevant.  The problem is the nature of the best gear for monks, not how much of it enters the game.  If VI had a linear progression for gear, there would be no problem.  <br>
<br>
1)  Draw up a set of uber gear for various classes<br>
2)  Compare them to see if they make different classes too close together.<br>
<br>
Or, what's even simpler, work out a plan for &lt;insert class here&gt; by item slot, stating expansion-specific maximums for stat increases.  Tada!  Problem solved.<br>
<br>
I do resent the fact that items I will never get and people I will never meet have indirectly caused <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ability to take damage to be decreased, regardless of the amount of the decrease.  Is this whining?  /shrug it's a fairly subjective term. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=291578"><IMG SRC="http://lyndar.netfirms.com/sigpic.JPG" ALIGN=center></a><BR>Grandmaster<BR>Bristlebane</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=317.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=317.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=317.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.emailToFriend?topicID=317.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.threadControl?topicID=317.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=317.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=317.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17>Monk Change</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
