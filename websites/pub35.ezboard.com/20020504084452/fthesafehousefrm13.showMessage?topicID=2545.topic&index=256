As some of you know, I was at the point where I needed to go into DN and get the two ground spawns to drop. I was worried about doing this but it turned out to be no big deal at all. Very easy to do solo.<br>
<br>
I zoned in, had 4 invis potions with me and a levitate potion. I drank one invis potion, ran to the doors leading down to the paebla area, had a little trouble getting the doors to open but finally managed to click the right spot. I stepped inside and down the ramp a ways. Drank a levitation potion. Drank another Invis potion (which it turns out I didn't need) and ran to the bones. Short run. The bones were very obvious. <br>
<br>
The levitation potion kept the trap from going off. I dropped the invis by casting Invis to undead (just to be safe) and tromped around on the bones til I finally hit the right spot. The verbage rambled on...ground spawns appeared, I grabbed them and gated to Thurgadin. It was really pretty easy although I did get a RUSH from it!  <br>
<br>
I checked out the dragon skin and the bone dust that I had to combine in the Urn. They were both No Rent. I had forgotten about this part. This caused me to go into a bit of a panic because I had some faction work still left to do, and I knew it! What had not been mentioned, was that once you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> COMBINE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> these two no rent items in the Urn, the Urn is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> no rent. Once you combine the Urn, you can log. No problem. This is what I did and everything worked out fine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> FACTION</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: I proved just how <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MAX ALLY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> faction you have to be to interact with Oglard. I had recently helped in a Myga slaying which dropped my Max Ally CoV faction. I was still Ally, just not max. Oglard wouldn't talk to me. He said I needed to prove myself before such things could be discussed. An obvious faction isssue. I went into Kael, killed about 35-40 giants, went back, he still wouldn't talk to me. So I went back to Kael, killed <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> TWO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (2) more giants...and these are the greenie giants near the EW zoneline first bridge...and I maxxed out ally to CoV. I went back to Oglard and everything was fine. He responded, I turned in my Urn, got the Urn back, and took it to the Wyvern. So those TWO piddly greenie giants were enough to keep me from talking to Oglard and getting the responses I needed. THAT's how Ally to CoV you have to be for this quest!<br>
<br>
BONE DUST and a QUESTION:<br>
<br>
Now I have a question. When I turned in the Urn to the Wyvern, I got ONE bonedust back and a book. But I need TWO bonedusts: one for the blade and one for the skin. How does this work? Do I split the bonedust? <br>

<br>
When you do the first combine with the starmetal ore (after the *split* that only results in one piece), you'll get back Blade Core - 1st Fold (name is not exact, might be something like Ore - 1st Fold-it has the same graphic as a brick of velium-ie-pink block of ore) and Remaining Bone Dust (which is what you use for the first of the 10 skin fold combines). Heh, I was panicked on that one was well, but crossed my fingers, typed /petition I didn't get all the pieces I was supposed to on a quest turn in, and hit combine with my finger hovering over the Enter key =)<br>
<br>
Now I just need to talk my druid friend into camping the giant fort with me again and I'll be ready for Garzicor's Wraith /sigh <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukneesmasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kneesmasher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/8/02 2:03:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2545.topic&index=262>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What I've Learned Recently</span><hr size=1> Thanks NightGod!  I appreciate the response. I figured it was something like that. I plan to start the smithing tonight, so it should be interesting. We'll see how lucky I am.  I failed on a trivial Velium Vapor potion just yesterday so who knows!<br>
<br>
Smithing at 176. Everyone seems to think that it is all trivial now at 175 or so...but there's still that chance!  I have 6 star metals to work on, but only one chronium since it's lore.  I have my staff, luckily.<br>
<br>
Grundo is not to be taken lightly, by the way. He hits about like one of the regular giants, but he has a whole lot more hit pts.  So don't be fooled.  He's tough to bring down. With a druid to snare and DoT though, he went down without much trouble.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

Things may all be trival at that point but you have to do a total of 20 or some combines in a row with out a failer and to have a reasonable chance at that you need to be beyond trival for the item.<br>
<br>
Personally I have now failed on the smithing part of things 4 times.  First time I did the 5 folds successfully and all where trival but failed after the 5th fold on the skin. Second try I failed on the very first combine of the starmetal with the bonedust and didn't even get to the point of trying the skin again. Third try I failed again after the 5th fold on the skin again. These where all with 181 skill and a tinkered smithing hammer.<br>
<br>
I got irritated with repeating this part and gathered up enough for another 80 plate tries and got another 3 skill ups pushing me up to 184. Went and got the stuff for another try. Failed after the 7th fold of the skin.<br>
<br>
Probably gonna probably try another round of skill ups on smithing to hopefully get in the 187-190 range before I try again.<br>
<br>
After failing the smithing part you need to go to thurgadin again and get another book for 50pp. Go to Crystal Caverns and kill the dorf again to get another axe. Turn the axe in to get another urn. Head to dragon necro and get the skin and dust again to combine in the urn. Head back to Skyshrine and turn in the urns to get the bonedust. Then head to Overthere and kill the cliff golems again. Now you can try the combine again.<br>
<br>
Personally I can do the DN and CC parts solo but I still got tired of dragging my friends out to OT to kill those 2 golems again and again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=2545.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=2545.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2545.topic&index=263><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=2545.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=2545.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2545.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2545.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
