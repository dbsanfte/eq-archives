Nerfing chars are most of the time necessary, i can understand it to try to BALANCE the game.... <br>
Clerics were nerfed now and unfortunately i cant say if it was huge nerf, but one intention was that they &quot;seem&quot; overpowered coz half of albs playing smite clerics...<br>
if u really want to make the game really more balanced, then damn start nerfing archers!! You really dont wonder that they were on every list at every fight on top list ??<br>
U even made them stronger by nerfing the Shadowblades on the one hand.<br>
I mean everyone who is not an archer have to agree that they rule the battlefield most of time...<br>
Guy1 was killed by Archer<br>
Guy2 was killed by Archer<br>
Guy3 was killed by Archer<br>
......<br>
Stealth even is overpowered !!!<br>
In my opinion best would to remove stealth completey for minstrels and archers, only assassins should have stealth coz they need to kill enemies in melee.<br>

Before 1.46 we were demi-gods in RvR, true. BUt we were balanced in 1.46 and they still keep nerfing us because of whiney ass casters who are used to playing EQ where casters ruled.<br>
<br>
Here's a clue, See Hidden it lets you see Archers from your clipping plane even when they are stealthed. SBs totally destroy archers, unless it happens to be the 1 minute in 30 the archer can have TS up, and the archer happened to purchase it. If you as a SB are getting your ass kicked by archers regularly, the problem isn't with archers it's with you. <p><center><img src="http://www.realultimatepower.net/ninjasig.jpg" border=0></a><br>

ARCHERY ADJUSTMENTS in 1.46<br>
<br>
- We've decreased (again) the aggro that archers do to monsters while fighting monsters. This means that archers can now do even more damage to monsters without having the monster turn on them. <br>
<br>
- We've increased the damage that archer Critical Shot does against higher-level monsters (monsters only, no change was made to RvR CS damage). <br>
<br>
- Archers will hit more often in group situations - the group melee &quot;to-hit&quot; bonus has been increased. Archers (as well as any melee attacker) has more of a chance to hit a monster based on the number of people in the group. Archers now have a bonus over and above the regular melee bonus on &quot;to-hit&quot;. <br>
<br>
- Arrows that do different damage types (crush/slash/thrust) will now correctly show the damage additions. <br>
<br>
- Archers will no longer see tenths of seconds when readying arrows. We never intended archers to see their timer on such an intimate level - it was initially set that way for balancing and debugging purposes in beta, and was never changed. Please note that all other timers in the game (spell timers, ability timers, etc.) print in seconds, not tenths of seconds. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DID NOT INCREASE DRAW TIMES OR IN ANY WAY CHANGE DRAW TIMES IN THIS PATCH. We changed only the way that this is printed to you. <br>
****U mean that nerf ???*** <br>

ur right that archers were nerfed a bit in 1.46 but thats not a tragic nerf isnt it ??<br>

i mean u can stilll kill most of the mage classes and other classes in game...<br>

<br>
Thier draw time and CS damage got nerfed, it wasn't documented. Archers are dissappearing on my server fast, please have pity man. Don't you have any archer friends? They got nerfed in almost every patch, if I played one I would have quit long ago. /salute those archers that are still hanging in there, after getting beat up badly by the nerf bat. <br>
<br>
Archers are not much now without thier stealth, they DD like a caster, that's about it, nothing else.<br>

<br>
A little unsure of why you are quoting PvE adjustments, or are you taking up the cause of the AI mobs that we get exp off of? This has NOTHING to do with RvR damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;- We've increased the damage that archer Critical Shot does against higher-level monsters (monsters only, no change was made to RvR CS damage). &quot;<br>
<br>
Once again nothing to do with RvR damage, but now I hit harder if I am dumb enough to pull w/a crit. Basically negates the little help we got from your first quote.<br>
<br>
&quot;- Archers will hit more often in group situations - the group melee &quot;to-hit&quot; bonus has been increased. Archers (as well as any melee attacker) has more of a chance to hit a monster based on the number of people in the group. Archers now have a bonus over and above the regular melee bonus on &quot;to-hit&quot;. &quot;<br>
<br>
Well seeing as melees got this all along but archers didn't what is your point? All these came about because of numb-nuts like you who thought archers brought nothing to a group.<br>
<br>
&quot;- Arrows that do different damage types (crush/slash/thrust) will now correctly show the damage additions.&quot;<br>
<br>
WTF is this even on here??? The more I read your post the more I am becoming convinced you don't even play this game. <br>
<br>
&quot;- Archers will no longer see tenths of seconds when readying arrows. We never intended archers to see their timer on such an intimate level - it was initially set that way for balancing and debugging purposes in beta, and was never changed. Please note that all other timers in the game (spell timers, ability timers, etc.) print in seconds, not tenths of seconds.

****U mean that nerf ???*** &quot;<br>
<br>
Yes this is a good nerf to start with, seeing as our shot times also mysteriously got longer by about .5 - .7 of a second after this but it took us as a community 3 -4 weeks to run tests to prove it because of this nerf.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;ur right that archers were nerfed a bit in 1.46 but thats not a tragic nerf isnt it ??&quot;<br>
<br>
Try also counting the tons of nerfs BEFORE 1.46. And then add in the ones AFTER.<br>
<br>
&quot;i mean u can stilll kill most of the mage classes and other classes in game...&quot;<br>
<br>
Unless they have BT, /face, and the common sense to run the other way.<br>
<br>
&quot;i mean read the postings here that some archers complain to loose vs assassins <br>
what r assassins made for ??&quot; <br>
<br>
It's not that we lose to assasins that bothers us, it's that we have -0- chance. You can now see us from the clipping plane for @#%$ sake.<br>
<br>
&quot;what about the mages? u ever played one in RvR ?? they r dead meat most of the time!&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes I have and no they are not if you know how to play them right. Mages have gotten sooo damn many counters to Archers it's not even funny. If a mage dies to an even level archer now he was a dumbass. <br>
<br>
&quot;u ever played an tank like an armsmen ? they also dead meat...range attack is still uber skill on archers and cant be beaten....&quot;<br>
<br>
Ever heard of engage??? Look it up you might find it usefull to stop archers. <br>
<br>
<br>
I said it earlier and I'll say it again, the problem isn't with the classes, the problem is with you. Face it you suck. <br>

<br>
furthermore,while i agree archers have been constantly nerfed,they are still one of the most powerful classes in the game,due to the nature of there attacks.<br>
<br>
thats not really a class issue though,its mythics failure to even attempt to figure out how to set up a game that relies on pvp for interaction.<br>
<br>
it isnt archers that need to be nerfed,what it is ,is that the ranged attacks should be brought into line,or melee ability brought up to par with ranged attacks.<br>
<br>
currently the game shows that ranged attacks of any form,are clearly superior to any melee attacks. the only exception is melee stealthers,and the only reason for that is there ability to close to melee range undetected in most cases.it isnt that assasins are uber melee,its the fact that we can remain undetected till we melee.<br>
<br>
problem is mythic throws in  a counter to stealth ranged attacks&lt;see hidden&gt; which is way to powerful,destroyes stealth meelee attacks ability to survive &lt;stealth nerf&gt;. all this does,is eliminate archers from solo rvr,drastically reduce stealthers group rvr ability. so basically we now have the fact that casters ranged attacks are the top of the pile in rvr.<br>
<br>
this essentially means casters rule the realm,in group rvr,because thers no way a melee oriented force,is going to be able to close and kill enough of the ranged attackers before they suffer massive losses,thus meaning they lose the fight time after time. this is on the asumption that all things are equal numbers wise etc.<br>
<br>
now mythic is throwing in resists,to try to counter this,without any vision on how this game operates. so we reduce stun,reduce this reduce that,but all that happens is that the next class thats in 2nd place moves to the top of the list,and the realms still remain unbalanced as  a whole.<br>
<br>
but wait,you guys dont care about that do you,all your interested in is flaming some poor sob,who's using english as a 2nd or 3rd language and cant really make his points clear.<br>
<br>
no wonder the safehouse is a hellhole anymore,wish we could turn back the clock and keep the origional 500-600 posters who were here in 1999,and at least keep it friendly and reasonably polite.<br>

Add in the bugged PC bows from Alb that all Scouts deny but Mythic and the CSRs say exist and you are gonna be hurting.<br>

On a side note Melanu, what is your bow specced to? I notice a lot of hunters complaining about really low damage but I also hear them say that they only specced to mid 30's in bow. Just for curiosities sake. <p><center><img src="http://www.realultimatepower.net/ninjasig.jpg" border=0></a><br>

I remember the Hunter TL telling them not to spec over 39 in Bow, add that into the fact that most Rangers and Scouts go to at least 45 or so (I am at 46 myself and staying there ). I thought maybe that was the issue. And as far as less range, they have about 1 - 2 steps less than a ranger who has 2 steps less than a scout. Not earth shattering but can be frustrating, heh.<br>

And yeah, I always wanted to play an Infiltrator, that's why I am here. Lvl 12 and climbing on Percival. Hopefully NWN won't derail me too bad, already paid for it and will pick it up at 10am on the 19th.<br>

Edit; oh and Aiden, about this quote &quot;it isnt archers that need to be nerfed,what it is ,is that the ranged attacks should be brought into line,or melee ability brought up to par with ranged attacks.&quot;<br>

I already hit for less than a LW Hero one level below me. He's the Hero TL and my GM, we ran logs to prove it awhile ago.<br>

<br>
take a force of 24 healers/meleers from midgard<br>
<br>
vs a force of 24 casters/scouts/meleee/clerics.<br>
<br>
the fight starts off  aoe mez,aoe stun,aoe root etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
it then devolves into a stun/nuke/shoot killfest in most cases.<br>
<br>
this scenario is extremly common,and given the current nature of things,the advantage is always with the casters,due to the range factor.<br>
<br>
it doesnt really matter if a hero or armsman,or warrior is rushing you,by the time he gets there hes down to 30% of his health,and an easy finish for that group of casters,due to there range potential.<br>
<br>
you can even throw in pbaoes,aoe's,aoe roots,and its even more one sided.<br>
<br>
with a drawtime of around 2-2.5 seconds you do less damage then a hero yes. however you get 2 shots for every swing of the heros spear.  add in the 1500+ range you get,you can kill most anything that charges you.<br>
<br>
but its not the archers that are the real problem,your shots can be blocked,currently theres no blocking of any kind on nukes,pbaoes,roots etc at all. <br>
<br>
with the upcoming changes,it might balance out,the problem i find is that mythic tends to throw changes in without any though,thus it doesnt balance out,it just tips the odds/balance in another direction.<br>

It's just the nature of ranged attacks.  If you can hit your enemy before he can hit you, you have an advantage...which, by the way is one of the advantage of stealth.  To archers though, you must add the additional advantage of having TIME after your attack in which your enemy STILL CAN'T HIT YOU.<br>
<br>
The ranged attacks + stealth + speed shout + excellent damage output = a very tough class.  Another little nicety that I don't know is used much, is the ability to switch from thrusting damage to thrusting damage.  I don't know if it would help much though, as broad heads might out damage any other kind of arrows.<br>

Archers are much more effective assassins than assassins.
