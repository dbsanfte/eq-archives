I am a 57 rogue and my husband is a 58 monk.  We've always duo'd together, before and after the patch.  He has some very nice armors that I've bought for him, CoF, Oiled Greaves, Fungi Tunic, etc; and I have some very nice armors too, currently sporting a CoF and a suit of matchless/priceless dragon armors from WW.<br>
<br>
He has noticed since the patch that he is hit harder now, but guess what?  He still tanks better than me.  I get the $*$@ beat outta me anytime I try to tank, even when I wear my fungi.<br>
<br>
Go ahead and keep crying to Verant to nerf the Rogues.  If what you are saying is true and Rogues can truely tank better than Monks, then something does need to be done.  However, *I* don't see it.  Do rogues do more DPS?  Sure, if we can get behind the mob and keep aggro off.<br>
<br>
I started out on my rogue in May of 1999.  We were a broken class.  Rogues had to start backstabbing after the mob was 1/2 life or they'd get hit, with no evade.  Poison didn't work, PickLocks was useless, and I remember people refusing to group with me because of the &quot;Pickpocket nerf&quot;.<br>
<br>
I sympathize with you guys, it sucks to play a nerfed class.  But rogues have done their time, we spent a large part of the original expansion nerfed.  Trying to bring new nerfs to people who can do more DPS only in certain situations is sorta silly.  But good luck guys. <p><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh no, not <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16387" target="top">Justice Fruit Pies</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->!

i for 1 would hate to see any other class get nerfed, espically as a result of monks trying to get back some sort of a role in EQ. i opposed fully the planned nerf to pallys and am glad they won out. think you may be catching monks sounding off rather then calling for nerfs to rogues <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=norpin>Norpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand High Poobah</span><br>  Posts: 4355<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/26/02 8:53:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogues tank better than monks</span><hr size=1> Every time I see one of those posts about rogues tanking better than monks I can't help but laugh.

We probably don't tank worse than Rogues but our tank skills are still pretty poor. We don't do damage in the same way as Rogues either.<br>
Mostly our equipment is geared to pulling and surviving a CR etc, post patch thats pretty much useless. I think its a question of finding out what exactly our role is, and what we are capable of. Rogues to be fair have  a  clear role and I am not knocking it. Prior to the patch I viewed both of us as useful in say a CR. Situationally one is better than the other. Post the nerf I would be lucky to survive many retrieves.<br>
<br>
At the moment I just do not follow what our role is. We did less damage than a Rogue because in many situations we could tank better than they, post patch I do not have much of an edge on damage  over a warrior, I do not have much of an edge over  a  rogue for tanking either.<br>

Actually a cleric can take more damage than a monk with the right gear, but it doesn't make them a better tank. Of course the same thing was true pre nerf between monks and the tanking classes, warriors, paladins and shadow knights. My son now plays a rogue that I  used to play and he can tank as well or better than I can post nerf. We both have similar quality equipment.<br>
<br>
Actually in many zones, especially in velious, my 54 druid can out tank me at level 55. If my druid didnt have to med to keep mana up, I would let him tank when I 2 box now. He has to heal himself  a lot less and the mobs die faster with the monk is hitting from behind. I can kill 2 times as many mobs before running out of mana this way than letting the monk tank and having the druid stand throughout the fight. Of course neither way is efficient enough to be practicle for exp gains. <br>
<br>
Nerfing a class to make another class better is almost never the answer. I still don't see why monks needed nerfing to balance things and I have played almost every class 50+. What I see is either class envy caused this nerf or VI wanted to give monks an incentive to buy PoP and not make them too powerfull at 65. Of course this could have been accomplished without a nerf if they had some more imagination, but we know they don't have much of that and refuse to listen to their customers in that area.<br>

However, in raids we have a clearly defined role of pulling. I have to laugh when I see people post about how sks are so much better then monks are. SKs are broken in more ways then we could imagine, many argue that they are the worst class in the game right now(poor damage, inferior tanking compared to warriors, agro spells just got raped, etc.) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16458">Brother Coraniz Harhar</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grandmastersyke>Grandmaster Syke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/28/02 7:42:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/malmrose/everquest/sykeface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogues tank better than monks</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have to laugh when I see people post about how sks are so much better then monks are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You'd be amazed if you saw a good SK pulling.

depending on what mob you fight, and what tactics you use...monks 'can' be better than rogues...mobs that one would push up against a wall, will not have a backside for a rogue to stab...POOF, there goes 30% of the rogues DPS...which turns them in to gimped warriors...  <br>

Monk/sk/necro pulling combos are just plain awsome. each class has something different to contribute.

SKs darkness/invis is useless on most raids, FD speed is much much more important.<br>
<br>
Then again it all depends on what type of raid you are on. For example, anyone who understands prox agro can pull NToV yard trash, but a monk is best suited to splitting the stooges.<br>
<br>
In any case, I doubt any guild uses an sk to pull over a monk, unless you are raiding kael arena. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=discipleanomalos>Disciple Anomalos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 870<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/29/02 12:01:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>key of that was fungi...put on the fungi yourself and then have him put on a PSC or something...and see who tanks better then <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Guess what, soloing/2-boxing IS NOT meant to be efficient.  Go get a group! XP is much faster that way if you're grouped with skilled players.<br>
<br>
I'm a suck ass tank.  Monks tank better than me with similar gear at this level.  The only time I can tank, is with a really skilled healer and the mobs are 10 levels below me.<br>

<br>
Hmm, I guess making 4+ Yellows on my 48 Shaman last night in about 3 hours grouping with my 55 Monk wasn't as efficient as it could have been, I could have got the last 2 blues I needed to ding.  Depending on group make-up a two or three person group imo will make the most EXP.  Have the Shammy and a Necro to compare soloing, solo EXP can be decent, but a 2-person group &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soloing if they are the right two classes.  A 6 person group is only better then a 2-person group if everyone is working as hard in the full group as in the small group.  Somehow when I've had a group with 6 people where the Chanter and Cleric are meleeing I don't think that's the case.<br>
<br>
Throughout most of my 40's, if I feel like it I can make 1/2 a level a night or more if I go all-out for EXP and don't get bored.  My biggest 3 characters are only L55 so I haven't seen the L59 hell, but I can tell you that up to 55 it was very rare to get as good of EXP in a group as it was 2-boxing a Monk/BL combo (and BL's suck as a support class), and now that I'm going Monk/Shammy I think that gap will increase. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ranceed>ranceed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/30/02 2:01:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bleh</span><hr size=1> Im sick of people saying &quot;Well yeah, rogues are good n all but if you push a mob into a wall, there goes their BS!!&quot;<br>

<br>
I'm really sorry but these changes aren't affecting the 40-60 crowd in dreadlands and velks.  No one is really worried about if a monk or a rogue outdamages who in an xp group at that level...hell, it's dependant on weapons and funding more than anything.  If a rogue got his epic at 50 and you're using your bare fists, you lose.  If you've got a tstaff and he's got a couple 10/20 daggers, he loses.  The game has variety and play style and options at that point which you can use to overcome your nerfs, believe me.<br>
<br>
The point at which our class lacks definition is the endgame.  Everyone's using 15/20 or much much better weapons, rogues are getting crit BS's for 1200 and more when they can use it, wizards are dropping 4k crits like there's no tomorrow, warriors pop defensive, rangers whip out a bow, mages keep up with everyone now that they're allowed to nuke, paladins group heal, SK's use +aggro spells where needed and pull quite well, I could go on...every class has a defined role, something unique, something special that sets them apart in raids.<br>
<br>
well almost every class.  Monks USED to have that roll...we were solidly between rogues and warriors for melee, we made excellent rampage tanks but never MT's due to no taunt, no EB weapons, no defensive / evasive.  We really didn't step on anyone's toes, and honestly I don't think too many people were crying out for a nerf.  What would you rather have pulling for your raid, a monk who lives through the pull or one who gets rezzed every 10 minutes?  Thought so.<br>
<br>
Now we lost our tanking, and while VI showed us some uber damage, they're taking that away too.  Most endgame warriors are using 16/20 or better weapons, they keep up with us just fine thanks.  Their str also caps out easier than ours, mostly due to large +str gear and inherant racial bonuses, and with the POP cap being well over 300, most monks aren't hitting that limit...parse away and tell me STR doesn't count, because it does.  Long story short, warriors are stepping on our damage and VI doesn't see fit to immediately correct it, but when we got near their tanking we got kicked in the dick.<br>
<br>
The real issue that has a bee up everyone's ass is that our naked fists are UBER right now, and that's a pretty nice thing to have.  It also fits the original &quot;vision&quot; for what it's worth, any of you oldschools probably remember laughing when a warrior went around showing off his god loot (bloodfire, etc) and we still outdamaged him with our bare hands.<br>
<br>
If we can't tank for shit, why can't we at least be guaranteed some good damage?  Considering the kick we take from not using weapons, which for the well equipped monk is 300-400 HP, wouldn't it be reasonable to at least allow us to pound a mob we can't tank?<br>
<br>
I'm beating a dead horse, sorry...the nerf is going to come, and more monks are gonna go, and nothing will change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ualaa>Ualaa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/30/02 9:39:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=597.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bleh</span><hr size=1> Read quote.. about monk fist damage.<br>
<br>
Verant decided that monks needed an increase.  They increased monks.  They decided the increase was too great, so they intend to reduce it.  Monks are still receiving an increase in dps (fist damage higher then previous to nerf).  If people seem to think its good, then its balanced once more.  If they parse it, and feel its not good.. and enough of them post intelligently rather then just bitch and complain, Verant will look at their intelligent suggestions and make changes.  They may never come to this board and post a reply.<br>
<br>
Just look at it.  People have posted a monk should have damage increased, since the defense was lowered.  And Verant increased the damage.  So what if Verant messed up and increased the damage too much.. when they balance it again (according to what they consider balance) it is still an increase over what monks were doing hand to hand a week or three weeks ago.<br>
<br>
If the monk community is still unhappy, Verant will look at the intelligent suggestions and implement something.  They are a business.  They like your money; what business does not?  I don't like to see a nerf, nor does anyone I know.  But it has happened, and there's not much we can do aside from actually walking away from the game.  Post intelligent suggestions, backed up with facts (parse it, don't post speculations) and you will have a chance that it might be acted upon.<br>
