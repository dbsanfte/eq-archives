etc. Just remember, it is a game, and it is for fun..<br>Everyone would have an equal oppurtunity for this(well, maybe PLers would have a better one heh). I'm sure others have thought if this idea, but I have never seen it posted.<br>Also, not going too much into detail, im lazy.<br><br>Ok, This new advancement is granted only after one has recieved thier class title from the AA abilities.<br>Having obtained level 60, and learned enough skills to earn your class title, it is assumed that you have mastered your class(by game definition i mean, I seen some 60 newbs...).<br><br>What I am thinking is maybe, after mastering your class, you could begin to learn the skills of another class. Now of course, I'm sure the first thing that comes to mind to all of you is some level 60/60 war/shaman guy running around owning the world. Thats why They could make this a mad time sink. Don't double the exp, Raise the exp required per level, to basically double the time required to ding. <br><br>For example, level 1 takes the average person about 5-10 minutes when fighting white con moss snakes. Now make level 1 take 10-20 minutes when grinding on Krups in chef. <br><br>Another example, level 44 takes an average of maybe 15 hours? make it take 30. This of course would start to get fairly insane with level 59 etc. <br><br>How much power would this add to the class?<br>Well, alot... but not quite as much as it seems. If needed, they could even cap the level at which you can gain with the new class. even as low as 30, or 46. <br><br>So when you get your title, you may select a class, you instantly gain any inherant abilities of that class, and gain exp with that class with the same time of bar you use for AA. let me use an example. <br><br>Lets say I am a 60 rogue, and have just attained my maruader title... ok, for some reason, I want to be a shadowknight. I type some BS in such as /train shadowknight.<br>I now have the ability to Harm touch(for 11 dmg, since im lvl 1), able to raise 2hs, 2hp, 2hb etc. (they would have to code *SOMETHING* to prevent us from backstabbing with @#%$ like tantors tusk though heh.) and able to equip any SK gear, but with the same level requirements for the casting as your SK's level is prolly. Once you select a class, you canot just get those benifits, and then switch... if you switch your class, you lose all the abilities you earned. which is why they should make the training command some wierd long thing that you could not accidently type. <br><br>Well, anyway.. not saying they *should* do this, or even it would be a good idea... just saying that I think it would be fun. Wondering what everyone else thinks. <br><br>and if so, what class would you go for offhand(don't think about it too much). I am thinking rogue/bard, rog/ench, or rog/sham. this actually wouldn't be quite as overpowering for raids as it seems, but yeah.. it would make exp grinding, soloing, dueling against someone without it.. pretty trivial. still neat though.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufashidusct.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fashidus CT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/27/02 2:19:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23061.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Idea for new charactor advancement...</span><hr size=1> Wow that would kick ass.. but theyd never do it because::<br><br>/train rogue<br><br>now everyone can sneak and hide and everyones a rogue.<br><br>Awesome combos... * / paladin... * / cleric... * / enchanter.<br><br>I think level cap will go up with planes of power... maybe 70... maybe higher. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukaaillasra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaail Lasra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/02 1:38:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23061.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Idea for new charactor advancement...</span><hr size=1> Yeah, but if they wanted to make a rogue just for the sneak/hide or somethin... then they wouldn't be able to get any skills from other classes.

The better the subclass, the more AA points required to train in the subclass. The subclasses would be a very large upgrade for anyone willing to put in the time. Here is the sacrifice part, when you hit the train button, you zone and land at your race's starting point as a level 1 again. There could be more to this process, possibly tie in deities into the process. Imagine visiting your god in the PoP, and he is so taken back by your faith(faction for killing your gods enemies) that he offers you the chance to become more powerful then you ever imagined. You would then complete a quest and receive an item that works in conjunction with the AA skill for your class.(crazy coding involved here I'm sure) In the end you basically  end up rerolling as an innately superior class and get to enjoy leveling to 60 again.<br><br> There are alot of balancing issues, for example, when you become your new class, do you lose all of your equipment? Can you cast your level 60 spells at level 1? Do you even get to use your spells from your previous class or are they forever gone? These questions could go either way depending on the power of the new class.<br><br>The real problem on implementing this is that it would take so much effort to create something like this for something that is designed for so few players. Even the people who met the requirements to train in their new class would/should think long and hard about it before doing it.  <p><B> <a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3186 ">Inles Emissary of Magic</a> </B> <br> 60 druid of <a target="new" href="http://www.eqalliance.com/intrepid/intrepidframes.htm">kUpO fLuX</a><br><img src="http://asherklist.netfirms.com/kupo.jpg"> <a target="new" href="http://www.tholuxe.com"><br><I>Tholuxe Paells</a></I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umakabrei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makabrei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/02 11:57:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23061.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Idea for new charactor advancement...</span><hr size=1> Hehe, multiclassing EQ...

Such as a DE rogue that DC's into a Necro is probably not going to have very good Int.<br><br><br><br>As for hp and mana, they should not be cumulative.  ie. when you level up to level 10 in a class, you wouldn't have the hp/mana of that class at that level added to your pools, but rather, the higher of the 2 would apply.<br><br>As a hypothetical example, if your a shaman, and at level 10 your shaman got another 50 hp and 50 mana.  And now, your a warrior and the warrior would get 100hp and no mana at level 10.  So taking the higher of each, you'd have 100hp and 50mana.  But since you alread have 50 and 50 of that, when you hit level 10 in warrior, it would simply add 50hps to your max hps.<br><br><br><br>As for when you should be able to dual class, I think the best way to handle it is that once you hit level 60 you simply go to the applicable guild master in your home town and get your first level in your new class awarded to you.  As for AA points, I don't think any AA points should be required to dual class, and I think that AA points should still be gainable at any time while you are dual classing, since it's a seperate exp bar that you can set yourself.  And as you meet the AA requirements for your next class, those powers would be added to the AA list of powers you could purchase. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unakilosgaremonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nakilos Garemonde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/1/02 12:57:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23061.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Idea for new charactor advancement...</span><hr size=1> I just want them to add quests which result in AA skills.

One of the main things that keeps this game going is personal advancement, and this is a nice way to advance imo. <br><br>I think this would be alot of fun, and yes, raven.
