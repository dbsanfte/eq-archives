<br>
1) sneak hide is great, but is it pretty much guarenteed that instead of sneaking up behind someone that a caster will ALWAYS have see invis up, thus rather than gaining the element of surprise... i gain the element of a wizzy nuking me for mega-damage while i casually walk myself up to a weak party member?<br>
<br>
2) does anyone think this should be changed. i mean, really... its invis, but its not REALLY invis. its a class specific ability. i just dont agree with verant telling us &quot;if you make a rogue, you will be a sneaky little theif/assassin&quot; then placing flaws in all of our abilitys (you can see sneak, you cant pick certain locks, PPing in groups will gain you a bad rep because it steals from the mob itself) perhaps we should organize a revolt? hehe. revolution action.<br>
<br>
3) if i pickpocket with success on PvP, will they still get the message &quot;so and so stole x amount of coin from you&quot;? or is it set up the same as for mobs... that is if you succeed, you get no aggro, they have no idea. if you fail they still dont know, you just dont get any loot. or if you fail miserably, they get pissed.<br>
<br>
4) will there honestly be enough money for a first time character to invest in poison making and still have an edge in gear that keeps you from being destroyed constantly?<br>
<br>
5) does sullon have item loot currently? or coin only?<br>
<br>
6) how does the diety team thing work? like... everyone that ISN'T of bristlebane i can PK, or is it set up where certain dietys are teamed, such as mithaniel, erolissi, and some other good dietys are one team, then the evils... etc etc.?<br>
<br>
7) will a single backstab on a caster combined with a spine break poison give me plenty of edge to demolish even high dmg caster, such as wizzys? this is assuming that i'll kill a spine broken necro or chanter before he can get enough dot's or charm on me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  how can i make some money? obviously if i spend 15pp making a spine break poison, and only loot 3pp, i'm gonna be broke in a hurry.<br>
<br>
all advice is appreciated. sorry for spamming the board with multiple posts =) but i'm a PvP hardcore newb<br>

Although it also depends where you are. If you head deep into enemy territory they feel so safe there that alot of casters dont bother casting it. Go to Kunark, alot wont bother.<br>
<br>
2) Yes and no. As a rogue on SZ I do not rely on hide at all. I would absolutely LOVE it if hide became its own type of invis. However I would also see it being semi overpowering and make alot of casters quit and roll up rogues (I want as few rogues for competition as possible. We need more tanks and clerics. we have to many casters)<br>
<br>
3) If you pickpocket with success the pickpocketed person recieves no message. If you fail you can get a multitude of messages. You can also be successful but cought.<br>
<br>
4) No. I am in my 30s and have invested no money in poison becuase 1) I dont travel anywhere dangerous solo. Becuase of this reason poison is a semi waste of money til I have plat to blow and 2) I put all of my money into tailoring. I also work on saving money to purchase resist gear. At the moment though with funding a tradeskill I have no money to waste on poison where it is only semi useful at this moment in time.<br>
<br>
5) Coin only loot if you are within + or - 5 levels of that person. I think you can loot if you are a low level killing someone 6+ levels above you. <br>
<br>
6) Certain Deities are teamed. Bristlebane is team neutral, Cazic Thule is on team Evil and so on and so on. <br>
<br>
7) Once you get some good backstabbing weapons and higher level yes. Although Spinebreak poisons are much less useful now that they are snare instead of root. root would really mess up a caster. snare helps but it is not as good.<br>
<br>
8: You cant. You missed out on the tradeskill fad where beginning smithers and such were raking in the money. Now selling banded armor is still semi profitable but not even half as much as it was in the beginning. Tailoring is semi profitable but not much. I do it becuase I enjoy the tradeskill more then others. Currently I make most of my money from guild donations to further my tradeskill. I make maybe 1-300p a week with normal looting becuase frankly dividing loot between 6 group mates is slow going. Like I said before poison takes alot of money. If thats your only tradeskill to work on then it wont be as much of a problem. However then you wont be able to buy resist gear.<br>
<br>
Advice is dont talk trash or bitch when you are killed. It will get you corpse camped and griefed.<br>
<br>
the higher level I get the less rogues I notice around although there are still a ton. Honestly there are enough rogues on the server. groups usually consist of 2-3 rogues at the levels 6-25 and at 25+ there are usually at LEAST 1-2 rogues per group. Need more warriors and such.<br>
<br>
PvP wise I will tell it how it is. As a rogue you will be owned in 1 on 1 battles by casters until you get levels and resist gear. At lower levels you dont have the fast high damage weapons needed to interupt a caster nonstop. You dont have the magic resist to resist mez, blind, root, snare and all other spells that make you easy prey. This will change but it takes time.<br>
<br>
Heres a few pays to make some cash though as you go through your levels. You will make lots of money by collectin components for high end tradeskills.  HQ pear pelts sell for about 5-10p. I personally will only pay 7p becuase I dont make a huge profit selling backpacks as it is. collect all spider silks and combine them into swatches. Sell these. 1p per swatch can add up. kill spiderlings for spiderling silk and make silk threads. collect all LQ pelts and MQ pelts. use a skinning knife to turn the MQ pelts into low quality. combine 1 silk thread and a LQ pelt to make a leather padding. blacksmiths will pay well for these leather paddings becuase they are needed for 175+ skill. HQ cat pelts and wolf pelts are worth 1p each. Those are the common ways. once you get to better dungeons and better loot you start getting item drops that are actually valuable to players.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps some. And dont quote me as I may be wrong. These are just my experiences so far on this server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugnmishgearbinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gnmish Gearbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/01 8:26:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rogue for sullon. many ?'s</span><hr size=1> Everything Mazeron said is dead on but I wanted to add one thing, you can also *fail* a pickpocket but not give any message. It says something to the extent of, &quot;You can feel the cold hard metal on your fingertips but you can't quite grasp it. Better luck next time.&quot;<br>
<br>
If they see a message, you will know because their character will emote &quot;Stop THIEF&quot; and any nearby guards will try to kill you. Be wary of that.<br>
<br>
To summarize, there are many varying levels of success and failure. <p><b><i>Gnmish Gearbinder</i></b><br>Gnomish Rogue of Bristlebane<br><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon Zek</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uannid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anni D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/01 11:08:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rogue for sullon. many ?'s</span><hr size=1> Rogues have a few other setbacks.<br>
<br>
No dispelling enemy teams. This makes poison worthless unless you are an evil thanks to dead man floating being unremoveable. Melee combat in general versus a caster near impossible. Damage shields that hit for more than you strike for is a good for instance. <br>
<br>
Not that it even matters, but talk all you like. If they try to grief you, it will backfire when your friends get there and camp them down a few levels/hours whichever they get tired of first.<br>
<br>
If you are going to play a melee, go evil. At least you can get DMF and be immune to shaman attacks and rogue poisons as verant shows no interest to try to allow anyone to dispel the enemy. Dispelling is something you would only do to a friend, like striping 4 enchantments off of them.<br>

However they should be fixed sometime soon. (soon as in Verant time AKA 1-10 patches from now) Dispell is SUPPOSED to work on the enemy but right now it is flagged as a benificial buff so cannot be used on enemy teams. This is not working correctly and will be fixed.<br>
<br>
Heres a run down on the teams. This is how the teams are NOW not what they used to be when the server first started. Evil used to be totally easy and newts a little challenging. Evils since then have lost more people and newts have gained more kind of evening it out.<br>
<br>
Evil-Easy in the essence that they have alot of uncontested zones to level up in without really a worry of constant attacks from other players. They own Kunark which has the best exps from around 25-50ish.<br>
<br>
Neutral-reletively easy. Neut team has gained more people over time and has more area to hunt in then they used to and we are gaining levels. We are a bit harder then evils becuase we start leveling from 1-30 in zones that are always near goods or evils so PvP starts early. <br>
<br>
I do not mean to dimean evil but evil zones are not near other team cities to pose much of a problem. Take Butcherblock for example. neutral starting position but it is constantly being attacked by goods. evil gnomes from steamfront come over too. lots of PvP as soon as you hit level 6. Black Burrow is always in strife between newts and goods. Evils can level up in Nektulos, then EC (freeport is an evil city) then Oasis, then Cazic Thule, Then Upper Guk, Then Lower Guk. This is all just on the mainland. You can head over to Kunark in your 20s and find even less PvP except for the occaisonal good/newt team raid going through. they dont last long and are very very very not permanent.<br>
<br>
Good-Very challenging. They are outnumbered between newts and evils by a fairly large margin and have VERY few zones to level up in. They are a good challenge if you want to always watch your back. I personally took the easier way out and went Nuetral.<br>
<br>
Thats a rundown of the teams and how I see them (as well as many others)<br>
<br>
All have their ups and downsides. All 3 are good choices and each team deserves respect. Goods deserve the most respect just for choosing that team though hehe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uannid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anni D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/10/01 4:49:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rogue for sullon. many ?'s</span><hr size=1> According to verant, it is by design that you cant dispell your enemies.

Which means it is working as intended at this time. We are hoping for them to change it, but no one bothers to do a /feedback, so it will likely just stay this way forever.<br>
