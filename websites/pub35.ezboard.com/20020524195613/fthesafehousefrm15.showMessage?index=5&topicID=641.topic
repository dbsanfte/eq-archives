<br>
Tallon is cool! But it has bad x-teaming...and from what I hear its worse than vallon. But we make do and fight it where we can, course some purists like Cees will call light only guilds x-teaming (which I am a member of ) so its a tough call.<br>
<br>
maybe Im not a pvp elitist as such but Tallon has a good mix for me and I enjoy the mix of xping and pking.<br>
<br>
I even enjoyed tonight when I had a good group and was looking at 31 easy tonight...till QC turned up who are an x-team guild and wiped us out so I had to scoot and it was too late to move on to another hunting spot.<br>

Aye Nalinis cant argue with that.<br>
<br>
Ive never needed a GM yet and dont imagine a situation where I would.<br>
<br>
Who needs a GM when you can just kill the fecker who is pissing you off!<br>
<br>
Course sometimes you cant kill them cos they are harder than you....but thats only to be expected.<br>
<br>
In that case you go and get yerself harder. or get guildies to help ya!<br>
