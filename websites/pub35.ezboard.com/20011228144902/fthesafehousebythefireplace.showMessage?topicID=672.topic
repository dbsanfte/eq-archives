My frail-like posture, almost inviting a challenge seemed to go unoticed, as passers by seemed more worried about evading to the comfort and shelter of home. Thoughts of mindless fools as they retire for the evening just to wake at sunrise and start the lemming existence they live, brought a smirk to my usually emmotionless face. <br>
<br>
My work for the evening has yet to commence. I have been charged by a wealthy aristocrate from a not so distant city to... let's just say &quot;eliminate&quot; some of his competition. Reluctantly I agreed to half payment up front other half when I deliver an amulet that resides around my mark's neck. As proof that i have completed my task. <br>
<br>
I stood below the window of the unfortunate soul I was supposed to dispose of. Studying the wall, looking for handholds and foot holds. The wall was as smooth as a gnome's ass. <br>
<br>
&quot;In the name of Antonious Bayle, HALT! who goes there?&quot; Shouted a town guard that obviously had some sort of magic allowing him to sneak up on me.<br>
&quot;Spare some copper, me bruddah?&quot; I said, acting as feeble and diseased as i could.<br>
&quot;Bah!, Be you gone from the politician quarter, you filthy beggar!&quot; The guard demanded as he delivered a swift kick to my hind quarters. <br>
Stumbling to the ground I made a loud exhale as I crashed into a wagon full of barrels. &quot;Yes sir! Thank you Sir!&quot; I managed to say as I regained my footing. I scurried off like a snow bunny running from a Elder Griffon. I ducked into the first alleyway I came to. Tossed my beggar attire to the ground and began to check my equipment for damage from the fall I took due to the menacing guard. I pulled a small vial from my pouch and uncorked it. A foul stench of death invaded my nostrils. Ahh, this was my best batch yet.<br>
I poured the foul liquid onto my most trusted blade. This will be a quick death for anyone foolish enough to step in front of me. <br>
<br>
I peered out into the street. It seemed almost too quiet. No one walking the streets. The guard had left. No noise at all. This is the ritzy part of town but there should be some noise. Following the contours of the buildings i made my way back to the window where i had been most rudely interupted earlier. I noticed some tiny peebles protruding from the wall. My first inspection was rather rudely interupted by a law keeper. Replacing my dagger back into its sheath I started my accent to the window. Easiler accomplish by one of my stature. I slipped through the window as quietly as a shadow upon the wind, and collected my baring in the shadow of a huge dresser. Sliding my blade from its rest, I peered around the dresser to the bed. A hump of blankets laid there. Silently I moved along the floor boards to the edge of the bed. I slowly stood up. Dagger leading the way. I moved the blanket with my blade to get a look at his face. As the blanket fell away, my free hand reached for the mark's mouth. But, i stopped as quietly as i started. The man's eyes were open and his mouth was froze in mid-scream. Someone had taken the mark. <br>
I immediately began searching the room for any clue as to who it my have been. there are only a few that i know of the would have the ability to perform such a contract. Little to my surprise i found nothing. I went back to the body and found that the amulet was still around his neck. I ever so gently yanked it off and through it in my pouch. Back to the window, I got one leg out and the Bedroom dorr came crashing in. &quot;Simon! You killed Simon! MURDERER!!!&quot; Yelled the young boy weilding a sword that was nearly double his size. <br>
I slid my other leg out the window and landing in the street as silently as a puma. <br>
The child came to the window yelling shouts of Murderer!! Assasin!! and other choice words that should not have came from a child's mouth. <br>
I ran back down the alley where I had ditched my disguise earlier. There was a grate about halfway down the alley that lead to the city sewers. I slid into the stinking sespool of the sewer system and took a seat on an old crate. Who could have taken the mark before me? At least i have the amulet. My employer has a few questions to answer before relinquish it to him.<br>
<br>
