<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The priestess lowered her whip, her face a twisted mask of hate and lust, splattered with drops of blood.  Enraged she grabbed a fistful of Ann’s hair and jerked her head back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The only thing I wished I had stopped was the day you were conceived.  You are nothing, a freak, defected at birth and an embarrassment to me.  I should have you quartered and hang your stinking carcass from the walls of the temple.” She hissed her upper lips quivering with the tightness her face muscles.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For that moment the pain that had ripped through Ann’s body was gone, as a nauseating wave of numbness enveloped her.  For her nineteen cycles of life she had felt an outcast, different from others, subjected to ridicule and torment, but she never felt her family did not want her.  They were Teir’Dal, no mercy for the weak, their hateful spiteful ways always to make her a better dark elf, but alas she was truly unwanted.  The whip did not crack on her back to punish her for weakness, she was the enemy, no different from the halfling tortured so long ago.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In an instance the agonizing pain crashed on her like a thundering wave pounding the shoreline.  The whip fell again and Ann screamed, her eyesight faded, blackness enclosed and her mind slipped into unconsciousness.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wake her Terrin.  It shall not be so easy.” The high priestess ordered handing the whip to the young Teir’Dal.  “When she wakes saw of her feet, and let her dine.  I vaguely remember she appreciated such punishment when but a child.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “As you order, your enlightened.” The young male answered.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A shall be washing her stench from my face.  Have her healed at the temple and come for me before continuing with the punishment.” Ann’s mother said turning from the room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The temple?” The male asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Do you question me Terrin.” The woman glared at the young man.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No your enlightened, I do not, but…” He fell into silence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman took at deep breath her ruby eyes flaring.  She expelled the air slowly as if she was trying to hold her temper.  Her lower lip quivered slightly until she pulled it between her teeth.  The young man lowered his eyes afraid he overstepped his bounds.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But what?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s just that she has been such an embarrassment to your family, that I thought it would be better she disappeared.” Terrin said cautiously.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a silence, for a moment, a time span that seemed to last forever to Terrin, his fate in the balance.  There was no doubt the power of this woman, or her insatiable lust for hatred and he was not sure where this would leave him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Go on, Terrin.” Her voice was overbearing like the executioner asking if there were any last requests.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If we let others know of her betrayal, it will be a mark against you as her mother.  Others will use this to wrest you from your deserving position of high priestess.  Others already speak of her weakness and lack of faith.  If they truly know she was an unbeliever it will strengthen their position.” Terrin said cautiously picking his words.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And your idea?” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I take her to the East Commons and feed her carcass to the lions.  We let it be know Anndazzadarian went to Faydwer to prove her loyalty to her family and Innourok.” Terrin swallowed hard, unable to read the thoughts of the woman glaring at him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ann’s mother let out a deep evil laughter, a twisted smile crossing her lips.  Terrin felt a wave of relief swell over him.  He knew this laughter well enough.  She was pleased.  Terrin stood firm, even though he felt himself tremble inside and he nearly had to hold his breathe to keep from shaking when she rested a hand on his shoulder.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You are a wise boy.  One day you will be a leader, one who will bring much glory to the Teir’Dal.  Be certain to gather all her belongs and be rid of them as well.  There must be no clues of this.” The woman turned from the room a low snickering laughter expelling from her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Terrin waited until she was gone before turning to the battered girl hanging from her wrists, blood oozing down her back and legs.  There was little care in how he pulled her limp body down or how he threw her on the bed and wrapped her in blankets, bundling her up, and packed everything of hers into a large cloth sack.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ann did not feel the pain, or the jostling of her being thrown about, wrapped in blankets and carried from the only home she ever knew.  Occasionally a pain tore at her, knocking her back into unconsciousness for the brief moments that she had woken from it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Several times she felt the black pull of death coming for her, but she welcomed it and feared it at the same time.  If Innourok took her soul the punishment would be never ending, but if her soul was lost there would be nothingness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Terrin was quick and careful to get out of the city of Neriak with Ann strapped across the back of a pack horse, rolled in canvas, like the roll of a large field tent.  Few paid him any attention as he passed by, just another young Teir’Dal following the duty of the great lord of hate himself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It did not seem that way to Terrin. He felt every eye was on him, the guards looking suspiciously on as he passed by.  He waited to see a cleric come from the darkness and demand to see what was on the second horse, but it did not come to pass and in time he was riding south in the Nektolus forest, bound for the East Commons, the land of the humans.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The forest was dark, the canopy of trees twisted in a wicked weave fighting to reach the sun light above, shadowing even the smallest beams of sun light from entering the woods.  Even at noon with the sky blue and empty of clouds, beams of sunlight did not penetrate the woodlands as if some vile curse of darkness drank the light before it could reach the grounds, but there was a faint glow of light.  It was like light through heavy drapes.  At night the darkness was that of a cavern deep underground.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The path Terrin rode was well traveled, even though it went to the hated lands of the humans.  Many dark elves traveled those lands to sow their hate and bring the downfall of the other races.  Humans were one of those races, but not the truly hated.  They were foolish tolerating the Teir’Dal, though with suspicious eyes.  It would eventually be their down fall, but for now it was more to the advantage of the dark elves not to be at war with them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Terrin crossed the bridge and entered the long gorge that passed out of the valley the Nektolus forest was securely tucked away in, he felt somewhat of a relief.  Relief to leave behind the thoughts he was being followed, relief that what he had suggested did not back fire leaving him to a far worse fate than Ann.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was nighttime, the time of the Teir’Dal, born of hate and forged in darkness they could see as well at night as day.  Their sight surpassed all the other intelligent races and rivaled even many of the wild animals of Norrath.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still it was not a safe journey, not for a lone dark elf to make.  There were always the potential for wild animals or the foolish human who thought he could make a living at adventure.  One maybe two would not be a problem, but they seemed to often travel in larger groups.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then there were the death fists orcs.  Barbaric, but dangerous, fierce warriors in a constant war with the humans of Freeport, but also would not think twice of killing a dark elf, surly to dine on their flesh in hopes to gain the infinite intelligence Teir’Dal possessed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Terrin’s mare twitched her ears and snorted nervously as they moved further from his homelands and into the commons.  The dark elf slowly looked around in the darkness his eyes penetrating the gloom.  He could not see it, but he felt it, somewhere close by, a presence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He pulled the reigns hard on his steed and the beast jerked its head at the sharp brutal bit the Teir’Dal used.  There was no doubt who was in control and it was a control gained only by pain and punishment.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Terrin slipped out of the saddle and let the reigns drop to the ground.  The packhorse behind him looked around wide eyed, snorting nervously at what ever was out there.  This was as good as any place Terrin thought.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It seems your stench of blood has attracted the animals already.” Terrin said releasing the binds that held Ann to the horse and dropped her to the ground.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A slight moan escaped her as she hit the hard pack ground. “Well you are still alive.  Stronger than I would have ever thought you could have been.” Terrin said kneeling over the bundle of blankets.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He loosened the binds on the cloth she was wrapped in and uncovered the blood and sweat covered form of Anndaradazzian.  Her breath was so light only taking her wrist in his hand was he able to know she still lived.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tonight I was weak.  I showed mercy and I don’t know why.  I am sorry it had to end this way though, we could have ruled this world, sister.” Terrin brushed the caked white hair from his sisters face, his own eyes an impenetrable portal of darkness.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The horse jittered more nervously.  Something was near, Terrin could sense it.  Close but hidden well, stalking them, patiently waiting to spring.  He could feel the eyes on him, almost hear the snarls of a beast, likely a wolf on the trail of blood.  It was circling.  Terrin stood and checked his sword in its scabbard. Listening for sounds, only the hoot of an owl and the chirp of crickets could be heard, the musical night song keeping the lonely traveler company.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly it was closer. Terrrin wielded about, it should have been close enough to see.  Nothing.  Breath came a little quicker to the dark elf.  He was a warrior trained to kill, fear was not an option, yet his pounding black cancerous heart told otherwise.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It flashed before him, a streaking figure, white in the darkness.  Then it was gone.  He tried to follow it but could not.  A branch snapped behind him, he whirled about and there it stood, white as snow, nearly as large as a bear, fangs bared, nearly close enough to spring on him.  Again it began to circling, vanishing into the trees, as if it was as black as night.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A white wolf should not be able to hide from Teir’Dal eyes, yet it was gone.  Terrin drew his dagger and knelt next to his sister taking her hand in his own, panic nearly taking control.  His heart raced with fury, far from the safety of Neriak, far from the power of his mother.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I spared you torture sister, but your life I can not.”  He drew the dagger across the tender flesh of her wrist, standing even as knife still sliced, not turning back to her, his mind only on being free from this place, away from the prowling wolf.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp White flashed in the corner of his eyes, a scream nearly escaping the warrior’s throat.  Panic was upon him as he pulled himself into the saddle his head snapping back and forth.  Steel drew across leather, the sound a frightful tone, the blade lightly vibrating in the warrior’s hand. The way home was lost to the frightened Teir’Dal, his head twisting in a panic trying to find his bearings.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A deep howl ripped through the air like a war bands trumpet.  Others answered in the distance, voices in the dark, talking in unknown tones of the smell of flesh and blood.  The pack horse bolted, Terrin’s steed jerking forward under him, but a quick hard yank on the reigns caused it to rear back, with what sounded like a scream escaping its throat.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then Terrin laid sharp spurs into the beasts side and it bolted, crashing through trees and brush.  Terrin felt the fetid breath of death in his face, a white flash before his eyes.  He ducked, as the massive beast bowled into him leaping the height of his horse.  Terrin managed to twist to one side and keep from being unsaddled, but he lost his sword.  His horse thundered away for home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wolf trotted into the clearing where the body was, cautiously sniffing the limp corpse, the scent of blood heavy in the air.  The wolf circled the fallen Teir’Dal girl as if sizing her up, who she might be and why she was here.  Turning away, in a bound the wolf was running from the clearing, back into the night.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A moan escaped Ann’s lips, low, nearly inaudible.  The wolf stopped, but did not turn as if it was deciding if it should return to the girl.  He continued into the woods.<br>
