Whisperling quest)</span><hr size=1> I am very interested in finding the source of the Xakra shield as I, like many others, started a Vah Shir Beastlord when Luclin came out.  To help you all, I am including the background quest up to the point that we need to find the Xakra Shield.  If anyone knows where this drops or what quest it is attained from, all of us who are doing the quest would appreciate this information.  Thanks!<br><br><br>Quest:  Whisperling<br>Starts in:  Shadeweaver's Thicket<br>Starts with:  Groo McManus<br><br>Groo McManus is in the White Building on the left following the road out of Shar Vahl into Shadeweavers Thicket. He's a Barbarian. <br>You say, 'Hail, Groo McManus' <br><br>Groo McManus says 'Greetings adventure seeker. I have come from afar to study this strange thicket. The spirits are strong within this region, but they are secretive as well. I am willing to impart my wisdom to those who will aid me in my exploration. Are you [interested?] <br><br>You say, 'I am interested' <br><br>Groo McManus says 'Very well then! Let us begin. First you must attune yourself with the nature of spirits. For this you must learn to find a spiritual anchor. Find such a thing within the crater that surrounds Shar Vahl and return it to me. Then we may continue. I cannot tell you more, but there is a Vah Shir who has the knowledge that you seek. Seek him out in this thicket to learn what you can. <br><br>Tiamon Aroo is the Tailoring Merchant in the Building near the bard's camp fire in Shadeweaver's Thicket. <br><br>You say, 'Hail, Tiamon Aroo' <br><br>Tiamon Aroo says 'Greetings Astrall, watch where you step for the [needle clawed hoppers] are just about everywhere! <br><br>You say, 'what needle clawed hoppers?' <br><br>Tiamon Aroo says 'Those wretched vermin swarm to our city and trade routes in search of the refuse left by careless travelers who pass through these parts. They are just about useless and their stench brings bile to my throat. I would have set out to poison the whole lot of them if it was not for their unique [claws]. <br><br>You say, 'what claws?' <br><br>Tiamon Aroo says 'The claws of the hoppers act as a [spirit anchor]. They are specialized in tearing into the fiber of the shadow beings that roam the thicket. I find these claws useful in [binding] the silk fashioned by the [shadeweavers]. <br><br>You say, 'what spirit anchor?' <br><br>Tiamon Aroo says 'A spirit can only materialize within our realm by binding themselves to an object that is a spirit anchor. Some bones and stones have such properties. A spirit anchor can also do the most damage to the material form of such spirits when used as a weapon. I use the claws of the hoppers as a sewing needle of sorts to [bind the silk] made by the [shadeweavers]. A standard sewing needle would only pass through the substance of the silk. The hopper claws can pierce through their ethereal fabric effectively. <br><br>(You can skip talking to Taimon Aroo and just go hunt up a needle thin claw.)<br><br>Give GrooMcManus the &quot;A Needle Thin Claw&quot; <br><br>Groo McManus says 'Excellent! You have done well. I can sense that you are in tune with the spirits around you. Take this, for you will need it in your next task. When you are [ready] for your next lesson let me know. <br><br>You gain experience!! <br><br>You say, 'I am ready' <br><br>Groo McManus says 'You have learned a fraction of the nature of the spirit. To exist within our realm they must become a part of our realm by binding themselves within material. The hoplings claws have evolved to tear spirits from their material anchors. A disrupted anchor will normally send a spirit to the planes in which they belong, but sometimes the spirit becomes lost. This has happened within the crater that surrounds Shar Vahl. We must do what we can to [help] the lost spirit. The lost spirit had found the nearest anchor to take refuge in when its own anchor was destroyed. The spirit now lies trapped within the very claws of the hopling that had tried to destroy it. Will you help? <br><br>You say, 'I will help'<br><br>Groo McManus says 'Near the south bridge of Shar Vahl city, a mysterious rock formation hangs precariously within the crater. When you have arrived, you stand beneath the rock and call to the wind, speak the word 'Lumanes', be sure to clear all thoughts from your mind when doing so. If we are not too late, a kindred spirit will speak with you. Take your discoveries to my friend Shavra in the crater, she will know what to do. <br><br>Head into Shar Vahl<br><br><br>Your Location is -852.56, 890.03, -343.91 <br>You say, 'Hail, Dar Khura Shavra' <br><br>Dar Khura Shavra says 'Lo there wanderer. Something is amiss within the region, have you not felt it? I sense a [whisperling] nearby. <br><br>You say, 'what whisperling?' <br><br>Dar Khura Shavra says 'A whisperling, who brings us dreams, you cannot see them. They do no harm, but I sense anger in them. They have made an enemy. If you are willing to aid us in our research, please seek Groo McManus in the shadeweavers thicket, he has some insight on these whisperlings. <br><br><br>Your Location is -580.14, 560.43, -345.56<br><br>You say, 'Lumanes'<br><br>a whisperling speaks softly, 'Lumanes Astrall, Our cousin, a spirit of frost, is trapped. We may not intervene. Only one of flesh may aid us. Are you one [able to help]?'<br><br>You say, 'I am able to help'<br><br>a whisperling speaks softly, 'Then we thank you. We will lure it here. But beware, it uses our cousins strength to protect itself.'<br><br>A frost covered hopling spawns here.  You must attack it quickly before it despawns.<br><br>You will loot a &quot;A Frosted Claw&quot; (NO DROP/NO RENT - Primary Piercing - DMG:2 DLY:25 SV COLD: +1)<br><br>Go back to Shavra and give her the &quot;A Frosted Claw&quot;<br><br>Dar Khura Shavra says 'Oh Astrall! This is a whisperling, and she is beautiful! You must find a way to free her of this anchor. Take her to Ragnar, he may know what to do. Let me put her in this bag to keep her safe for now.<br><br>Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better.<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>You get a &quot;Frost Bag&quot; from her. It's a 0.0 NO RENT object<br><br>Spiritist Ragnar is in the Var Shal Alchemy Shop west of the Bank<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Spiritist Ragnar'<br><br>Spiritist Ragnar says 'Well hello... How may I help you?<br><br>Give the Frost Bag to Spirit Ragnar<br><br>Spiritist Ragnar says 'Eh? What have we here?'' Ragnar examines the frosted claw carefully. He closes his eyes and begins to chant while holding the claw cupped between his hands. As he opens his eyes he nods at you and begins to speak. ''You have done well to bring her here Astrall. This is a whisperling, her name is Siver. She is very young, so it is hard for me to understand her. From what I gather, she has an important task to fulfill, but I am still unsure what that task may be. Please take her with you for now, I think that is her wish. Perhaps Grawleh will be able to assist us further, and maybe even find a more suitable anchor for her. I think it would be wise to show her to him.<br><br>You gain experience!!<br>You also get Claw of Frost. (NO DROP/NO RENT - Primary Piercing - DMG:3 DLY:25 SV COLD: +1)<br><br>Elder Spiritist Grawleh examines the contents of the bag carefully. This is no ordinary spirit Astrall. It is a whisperling, a bringer of dreams. You are quite lucky, I think she will go with you. She will be able to protect you from cold magic. If you need more protection you can call on her to help you endure the cold. This is how the Dar Khura weave their spells, we ask the spirits for their aid. This scroll will show you how to call on her for her protection. You will also need to construct her a more suitable spirit anchor. This claw will not contain her much longer. Please hurry to Ragnar with the claw and a fresh [bloodling carapace]. It may buy us some time before she fades away.<br><br>You gain experience!!<br>He gives back &quot;Siver's Claw&quot; (NO DROP/NO RENT - Primary Piercing - DMG:3 DLY:23 DEX:+1 SV COLD: +1)<br><br>Bring Spiritist Ragnar a &quot;Bloodling Carapace&quot; and the &quot;Siver's Claw&quot;.<br><br>Spiritist Ragnar says 'Well done Astrall, I hope it isnt too late.'' Ragnar begins to chant over the carapace and the claw, holding each in opposite hands. A soft light travels from the claw to the carapace as the claw turns to dust. Ragnar opens his eyes and begins to speak, ''It has worked, but all we have done is buy ourselves more time. While you were away, I have been speaking to Master Barkhem. He has a shield frame that can support these carapaces. You will need to craft such a shield by including this carapace and into the frame along with enough to fill each slot. You are doing quite well young Astrall, Siver has grown a little stronger. You can make use of her innate dexterity by weaving this spell.''<br><br>Spiritist Ragnar hands Astrall a scroll before he continues to speak. ''When you have completed the construction of the shield, return it to me and I will strengthen the anchor.''<br><br>Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better.<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>He gives you a &lt;Random Scroll&gt; and a &quot;Frosted Carapace&quot;.<br>It's a 0.0 NO DROP item<br><br>You can buy the Carapace Shield Frame from Master Barkhem who is in the Armory to the North of the Pool in front of the Palace..<br><br>Now head to Shadeweaver's Thicket and get 7 more Bloodling Carapaces.<br><br>Place the &quot;Frosted Carapace&quot; in the Carapace Shield Frame along with 7 Bloodling Carapaces and combine.<br><br>You get a &quot;Dull Frostweavers Shield&quot; (AC 3 DEX: +1 SV COLD:+3 5.0 wt SHM BST)<br><br>Bring the shield back to Spiritist Ragnar in the Alchemy Shop.<br><br>Spiritist Ragnar says 'Nicely done Astrall. This anchor should be sufficient to keep Siver bound to this realm for a while. She is strong enough to blind your enemies with a bright flash of light now, all you have to do is call on her spirit. I still cannot make complete sense of her thoughts, I think she is trying to tell me of another whisperling entrapped within the crater. Keep an eye open for the whisperling Scorpialis.<br><br>(Scorpialis is a weapon from the TailFang Quest. This may be another quest.  As yet, there are no details on how to proceed once you have Scorpialis.)<br><br>Spiritist Ragnar says 'In the meantime, you can seek out a shield made of Xakra. Xakra made of the ethereal fabric of the spirit realm. I know the Shak Dratha within the thicket are weavers of this rare form of shadow silk. Such a shield can help us strengthen the anchor, making it easier for Siver to aid you. It will also improve her health greatly. She has been through a lot and is in rather poor condition as it stands now.<br>Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better.<br>You gain experience!!<br>You also receive the &quot;Frostweavers Shield&quot; (AC:4 DEX+1 SVCOLD+4 MAGIC NO DROP)<br><br>EDIT: Wanted to give credit to Allakhazam's for the quest description.

It might just be a hint on how a very lowbie could get her hands on a magic weapon, which is required to kill the frost covered hopper. Shamans can't use the dagger, but it was easy enough just to burst-of-flame him to death (he is very highly resistant to cold spells, go figure). All other Vah Shir classes can use the dagger.<br><br>You tried hailing the Shak Dratha smith, but what was your faction? As far as I know, the Shak Dratha (the dark grey shadeweavers) start off threatening to everyone. You have to kill the Gor Taku (light brown shadeweavers) to raise faction, and it looks like you have to kill a lot of them.<br><br>Once I'm comfortable with the run to Paludal, I'm going to work on faction.

Get 4 rotting jawbones from skeletal brigands and he promises to tell you more - but the rotting jawbones don't seem to drop (unless it's like 1/200 or something).. Similarly, the first step in that quest for 4 darkened jawbones doesn't seem completeable either..<br><br>The quests for 4 shak dratha hearts, or 4 gor taku earthcaller stones also probably reveal some more background about the whole mess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umalqanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malqanar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/2/02 6:23:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3623.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: smith</span><hr size=1> Interstingly, Shak Dratha seem opposed to the whisperlings.<br><br>When you kill Centi in Akheva, you lose Akheva and Shak Dratha factions, but gain Whisperling.<br><br>I might revise my policy of killing Gor Taku, and start killing Shak Dratha instead.
