At the tender age of four, I was awoken by the sound of an unfamiliar, yet beautiful voice.<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; I asked in wide eye surprise.<br>
She chuckled softly, &quot;I guess your new Mom&quot;  And with that she scooped me up and ran into the streets, into the dark.  Now whether it was from sleepiness, or fright, or shock, I don't remember this flight...just that my life was changed.<br>
Initially, I would ask questions about my Mom and Dad...always to be put at ease by the beautiful lithe woman I got to know as Denna.  She was young, fun, and eventually my parents faded from memory.  Every so often, late at night, I would hear her creeping from the house, only to be fresh and awake upon my descent down the stairs early for breakfast.  <br>
By the time I was 11, I was a dextrous and strong youth, capable of wrestling a bully to the ground, or juggling several balls with both hands.  I was not big, nor overtly strong, but I learned life's great equalizer.  Skill.  Those with the skill would always win over those with raw strength or size.  Denna was still sneaking out of the house, and one night I decided that it was time to learn where she went on her nightly escapades.  <br>
Quietly, I snuck out after her, staying to the shadows as a desperate alley cat, pursuing her, almost stepping in her same exact footsteps.  Several minutes later, she stopped at a large house, who I knew to be the house of a rich, albeit dangerous merchant named Tragorr.  She fumbled with the lock, though it made no sound, and slipped inside.  Moments ticked by, and curiousity overcame fear.  I followed, moving inside almost as quietly as she.<br>
Not hearing Denna, nor anyone else for that matter, I glided up the stairs, staying low as to not be seen.<br>
Stealth was a new high, and I rode that cloud from one room to the next, looking for evidence of my adopted Mother.<br>
The last room was quite large, and gaudily adorned with riches beyond any I had ever seen.  My eyes eventually strayed to the bed.  There, lying in a large pool of blood with his neck slit, was the Tyrant of Feeross, Tragorr.  Horrified, I stood in shock, having witnessed my first murder.  In death, he seemed more peaceful than the man I had seen riding his horse through the market, yelling and pointing.<br>
&quot;Does it bother you?&quot; she whispered.<br>
Stunned, I spun around to see Denna.  &quot;Wha-what happened?&quot; I stammered.  <br>
&quot;I killed him&quot; she said flatly.<br>
I didn't answer...I couldn't.<br>
&quot;He killed your Parents.  In fact, he paid me to kill your parents.  Your father was a personal guard of his, and your mother...was Tragorr's mistress.  Upon learning of her indesretion, he paid me to kill both of them.&quot;  She looked at me, with pity and...love?<br>
&quot;You see dear, after all these years, I waited for the right moment to exact revenge on the man responsible for my...for you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why do you kill?&quot; I asked, still unsure of how to react to the killer of my parents, two people whom I could barely remember.<br>
&quot;I kill for money...I kill only those who I percieve to be dangerous and evil, and I kill because I am great at what I do, and evil people, ultimately, pay well to have others of their &quot;kind&quot; killed.&quot;  She said this matter of factly, as if killing were the same as baking, or being a skilled tailor.<br>
I looked at Denna, th playful, fun, and loving person I had known for the past 7 years.<br>
&quot;Mother, will you teacher me?&quot; I said softly.<br>
With a nod, we left, walkeding arm in arm, from shadow to shadow, to adventure after adventure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=812.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=803.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=811.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=811.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=811.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=811.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
