<br>
Sad, but true.  My rogue was parked at the group the other night while the druid had free reign of the entire zone.<br>
<br>
I don't even carry the res stick on the rogue anymore on raids for emergency CR.  It goes in the druid's bag, since she has a much higher chance of survival.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knights with the instant-cast invis item from a green dungeon are superior in many stealth areas as well.  Imagine being able to click hide on-the-run without stopping.  Think of the advantages to pulling.  That's what Shadow Knights do now.<br>
<br>
We've already lost many of our stealth advantages.  Other classes do it better.<br>
<br>
The evade nerf is going to be a disaster for high level uber mob raids.  Taking the rogue down 2-3 places means you will be back at the top by your next BS.  Assuming evade is even succesful.  And not interrupted while you are getting pounded.<br>
<br>
I really think Verant needs to take a close look at exact aggro numbers each class is accumulating in these encounters before they even consider this nerf.  I'm willing to bet even a non-procing rogue will be at the top almost constantly for the full duration of a fight.  Evade was the only thing keeping us alive for more than a few backstabs.  Add in one or two other rogues, and it's a death spiral.  More than 2 rogues becomes a handicap.<br>
<br>
<br>
Master of Stealth: no more.  Improved invis and instant-cast items and spell-invis crossing zones kills this.<br>
Master of Damage: no more.  We'll either be dead or have auto-attack off, praying the hide button pops up again before we die.<br>
Master of picking pockets: woot!?<br>
Master of unlocking doors: woot!?<br>
<br>
I'm finding it very hard to believe that nerfing evade is in the interest of class balance.<br>
<br>
It won't affect a single thing in normal single-group situations.  It WILL affect everything in multi-group uber mob raids.  In which case it's a nerf to uber encounters, and rogues are just a sad victim of consequence.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just fix sneak/hide across zone lines, leave the rest.  Thanks.<br>

<br>
* On epic encounters, the rogue needs to avoid getting attacked in the first place.  It was easier when we dropped down further on the Hate list, so we'll have to be more careful.<br>
<br>
* On experience grinds, pity the poor tank trying to keep agro.  They already had problems even with "good" evade.  Learn root-prox agro.  Love root-prox agro.<br>
<br>
* The "small percentage" of pre-evade is the critical unknown here.  The previous proposal put it at 33%.  If the pre-evade percentage is too small, rogues will be bouncing from prime-agro to next in line all through the fights.<br>
<br>
As an aside, unless I am mistaken, this change to evade would have been a significant nerf even before Velious, so has little to do with expanded hate lists.<br>
<br>
By the way, how does Jolt work?<br>

As it is now, I evade and drop to the bottom of the hate list, after the 20 melee. I can bs one time and go from #20 to #1 in one double bs. My bs will max haste cycles 3 times to one evade. So by makeing me #3 when I evade means that I will be tanking 90% of the time, hench dead rogue. Since evade was made when there was a 12 max hate list, why not make evade drop you to #12. This will solve many problem such as having multiple rogues in a raid. As you plan if you have 3 rogues in a raid one will always be tanking, hence dead rogue. It seems like to me rogues are going back to pre-evade when the class was unplayable at high levels. <br>
<br>
The way that is planned is unacceptable. <br>

<br>
One thing that I thought would be unique would be to have a rogue quest (probably around a level 40+ quest) that rewards you with a good secondary only 1hand basher that procs some sort of evade or hate reducing effect.  Maybe instead of adding hate per hit, for the duration of the proc it would subtract hate.<br>
<br>
And, please; do your best to try and get Ravenscale made into a quest.  I think of all the classes, those who play rogues are more inclined to quest for items rather than camp for them.<br>

Taking in to account that you were #1, that makes #2 now #1, and since you were behind the former #2, instead of being in position #3, the evading rogue is actually #2 after an evade.  So instead of moving to the end of the hate list, we move ONE position down.   Hell, the second you finish hitting evade, you will quad, land a bs, and be back at #1 without evade being reactivated.  How people can say this will not effect 6 man groups is beyond me.<br>

Lets see you origianlyl intended evade to drop us at most to the 6th spot, but you increased teh hate list, so we are curently dropping to far, BUT now having us drop to 6th is no longer the idea??? <br>
<br>
Your current plan has rogue only dropping to #2 from #1 (no idea why you smoke screened people saying you would fall behind 2 but infront of 3  #3 is irrelevant since all you are doing is changing places with the #2 person) is total garbage. <br>
<br>
Lets imagine 2 or more rogues on a mob. Hi rogues will swap  around at top of hate list until they are all dead first. Imagine 5 rogues on a big raid.<br>
<br>
Leave it as originally designed with rogue dropping 5 or 6 spots per successful evade. Any less is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
I mean imagine the upraor if you planned to change FD so that they only dropped 1 spot down hate list.... ie they would still get owned if they were only person aggro or mem blur and atone..... Wake up.  We currently drop 59 spots your  proposing to have us drop  only 1 spot only if we are #1 and basically nothing if we are not #1.<br>
<br>
Be very careful you are very close to destroying one of the only blanced classes in eq and it took you 2 years to get us here. Heheh I thought this was tuning week. WTF can you possible give up so much to the other classes and then propose a gigantic nerf to another. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ruccus>Ruccus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 6:35:38 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://pages.sprint.ca/deanweb/files/PUCKSMALL.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> I was just reading some of the other posts, and they have brought up a good point - in the method suggested of evading down to between second and third on the list, a group with multiple rogues would in effect be helping to kill each other.<br>
<br>
If 2 or more rogues with similar weapons were attacking a mob, they would quickly start to outpace the hate of everyone else - meaning whoever evades sends the mob onto the other rogue instead of the tank. The new top person on the hate list would be the second rogue.  If the second rogue evades, the first rogue is back on the top of the hate list. This was the reason evade was implemented in the first place, to help get the mob onto the tank.<br>
<br>
I think the percentage method would be better, as it will always decrease hate on a success, and doesn't penalize a group for having more than one rogue.  We need to find a way to evade that doesn't affect other rogues attacking the same mob.<br>

Evade would NOT have been topic of conversation by so many had you not mentioned the proposed change.<br>
<br>
Second.  It was stated pretty clearly that the changes to evade were oversights from the begining and should have been changed long ago.  So NOW you come to us again and tell us that was was going to be done to Evade as a fix for what should have already been done is now not what you are actually going to do because it's not how it should be done either??  Come on!  I hate to say this for running the risk of never getting another Verant post again, but you all seem to be slightly clouded in your perspective and thoughts.<br>
<br>
I'm not so sure I understand the point of the new idea for Evade.  Are you now saying that evade will make mobs that are taking more damage from a rogue than a tank forget about the rogue for a few moments due to evade?  Frankly I thought your percentange idea was better....maybe in practice it would have made rogues think hard about how much procing/damage they do in certain groups but it definately seems more logical to me.  In fact if you gave any serious consideration to the idea of making Evade a seperate skill as it should have been from the beginning, then the application of percentage increases corresponding with evade skill increases seems even more reasonable.  <br>
<br>
Finally, the lack of willingness to implement code changes (significant or not) to provide a game change to either balance/polish or enhance game play is exactly what angers your paying customers.  Furthermore, the idea that you have to go back and make a change to something that was intened to function a specific way to begin with and thus requires code changes to make it happen certainly illustrates your capabilities to make our suggestions happen and only serves to bolster the frustration felt when ideas are shot down because they would require effort, work and a genuine concern for the reasonable and majority ideas of a given class or community of players.<br>
<br>
I am not so out of touch with product development as to not understand that at some point you guys have to wrap things up call something 'complete' and begin working on new challenges and products.  Maybe if you would just have the guts to say....&quot;Hey, EQ Gamers.  We are trying to finish all the balance and polishing so that we can make EQ 2.  Get off our backs about this stuff because you wont get what you want&quot; people could actually respect and UNDERSTAND what you are doing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=anaia>Anaia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 6:40:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oops...forgot my point.</span><hr size=1> My point that I was going to make before getting into a rant was that w/o Evade monopolizing the discussions, all the other issues that you have basically chosen to ignore or say you dont have time or desire to change would be all up in your faces.

Ok now your Evade &quot;fix&quot; might work if there is only 1 rogue fighting a mob if there are 2 might as well kiss one or both of them goodbye. This is nothing but Verant using a sledgehammer to squash a mosquito.<br>
<br>
My @#%$ 33% was bad enough but this will be worse why the hell should I play my rogue when I will be a liability to my guild on raids and be a manasink to clerics again? I guess we could just have ONE rogue for every raid? Man you guys must have alot of free time to dream up ways to screw it to players. <br>
<br>
Ok now I know this might be a foreign concept to you guys before you nerf evade take a look at 2 rogues same stats lvs and amounts of attempt to evade. They fight in a big group 20-30 people against a WW dragon with the average weapons of lv 55-60 rogue i guarentee that the pre-nerf rogue will do alot better.<br>
<br>
I forsee this either 2 things will happen rogues will use slower less damaging weapons or will not attack the mobs until much latter. Both are very bad why should guilds have rogues if a warrior would be better? Might as well bring some tag-along twinks to open doors.<br>
<br>
Evade was the skill that made people able and want to play a rogue. I remember when it was me and 2 other guys at lv 50 for like 6 months before evade.You made our class playable,sigh I fear you are doing this just so we will die more or that uber mobs die too much to rogue groups. <br>
<br>
What purpose for this nerf? What would be the big damage to the game a la &quot;Donal's bp&quot; level of harm to the game? Using Verant Logic If a class can do x damage to y uber mob then nerfing we must go! I have seen logs of the damage done to the mobs that have 1 million hps rogues did a hell of alot more then any other class. Wizards did the least. <br>
<br>
So if we put the pieces of this seemingly opaque Evade nerf we see the following: Rogues do alot of damage=Verant alarms go off in the tower of Nerfage=Verant examines logs sees that Rogues help out the party,guilds by a huge amount=Verant looks for a way to &quot;Balance&quot; things out=Evade is put on a system of reduicing our hate from #1 to 3=Verant does no testing=a guild uses 4 rogues for a raid=all rogues get pulverized into tiny pieces=Verant employes give each other high fives and put another class sticker on their computers signifiying another class &quot;balanced&quot; into desolation.<br>
<br>
Man if it ain't broke don't fix it.You guys don't look for innovative ways to help players you put up roadblocks and landslides...I have seen alot of good suggestions other then 33% or from 1 to 3 how about as a rogue gets higher in lv he gets better at evade? I know this is a hard concept to accept but try. At lv 30 he gets 20% or from 1 to 2 on list at lv 40 30% 1 to 3, at 50 40% or 1 to 5, at lv 60 50% reduction in hate or from 1 on list to 10th. <br>

Ya see reward us that would be better then just a phantom nerf in a patch and the problems with going from 1 to 3 are huge if you got 2 or more rogues in a group using their skills when they evade good chance they will just be trading places on top of the hate list due to the Huge ammount of hate a rogue generates! If wars could taunt like they should supposed too it wouldn't be so bad but man all of us will just be greasy stains on the ground again like it was before Evade.<br>
<br>
What is worse then not having a Class defining skill? Having a Class defining skill and not being able to use it(backstab) or using it and then having it taken away(Evade). Kinda makes you think what skill,spell,ability,item that I worked for and sacrificed for should be valued at why should I bother to get it or Risk anything if Verant takes my rewards away?<br>

I have no problem with this. Making us only 1 point of Hate behind the #5 person would be acceptable to me.<br>
<br>
With current evade, I still have to deal with Failed Evades, multi-mob situations (I can't evade them all, and I'm often more of a target than the tanks OR the enchanter when they break mez), and creatures on which evade just seems to have no effect. Oh, and being able to climb back up the hate list with record speed. One failed backstab often seems to do the trick.<br>
<br>
I just don't want to see us go back to the days when we did no more damage than a warrior, because the second we outdamaged him, POP! We were aggroed and could never backstab it again, no matter how much the tank taunted. We became the worst of both worlds.<br>
<br>
While I don't think this will happen, I do have my misgivings about this proposal. Unless the percentage of hate we reduce is really significant (33% or above), AND if the amount of aggro a successful OR failed backstab causes is double-checked to make sure it's not way out of proportion (I still harbor a belief that a backstab attempt ALWAYS counts the same as a max-damage backstab, regardless of whether or not it actually hits or how much it hits for - very much like a nuke). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umodoh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Modoh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 7:05:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> (long, sorry, but I had a lot to say on evade and instill)<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure that these evade changes will work well.. a hard coded jump from #1 to #2 hate spot will sometimes be next to nothing.  Take the contrived example where rogue at #1 spot has 10000 pts of hate or whatever, #2 spot has 9999 and #3 has 9990; from what I gather this would put us somewhere around 9995, losing a whole 5 points or so, to be put immediately back at #1 as soon as we hit the mob.  While this case is extreme, the idea behind it still stands.  <br>
 <br>
I think finding a good percentage or other method of lowering hate based on how much hate you have would better solve this new problem, or at the very least make sure that in dropping one spot in the hate list that the change in hate is actually useful.  <br>
<br>
As for the other changes: <br>
<br>
Bind wound changes are very welcomed since I often find myself in small groups being on test.  <br>
<br>
Pickpocket changes are good, though I wish coin would be taken from a separate pool. (I know it was at some point, my friend's beta rogue could steal 500 copper at one swipe..  and while he didn't want the 500 copper, it was obvious that the mob doesnt normally carry that much)<br>
<br>
I'm dissapointed somewhat that poisons wont stack, but I can understand being a coder myself that sometimes its hard to adapt code without a great deal of work.<br>
<br>
I am somewhat worried about the changes to instill doubt/backstab being connected.   I realize that the kick on instill and backstab are on the same timer... but in many cases because of the lag time between pressing instill doubt and when the actual attack happens I find myself hitting the instill button long before backstab lights up, and having backstab light up just before the kick works.  Also, when instill doubt fails the check to even try to kick, without the greying out i can still use backstab.<br>
<br>
If the instill doubt changes time the greying out of the buttons to the actual kick itself and not the press of instill's button, then they would be fine (and of course, NOT grey out backstab when the skill check fails to try to kick).   However, from what I understand about the EQ client, I doubt it is possible to grey out on the kick itself.    <br>
<br>
Summing up my instill doubt stuff:   <br>
<br>
If instill doubt cannot be activated before actual recycle time of the kick/backstab, it will be a significant decrease to its effectiveness.<br>
<br>
If instill doubt greys out backstab even though it has failed the skill check to actually try to kick, it will be another blow to the overall usefulness of the skill. <br>
<br>
Overall, I feel that simply leaving the button greying alone is a better option.   To prevent confusion, adding messages describing why your kick/stab didn't happen would be a better choice IMO than greying out buttons at times when you were previously able to use them if you understood what was going on.<br>

If a Warrior can no longer do his job in the presence of a rogue because of a combined effect of the new Evade and the old Taunt skill problem in the higher levels, that's <i>two</i> classes that have been nerfed. <p><a href=http://eqforge.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=5067 TARGET=_blank>Raxee L'Noamuth</a><i>, 43rd rank Roguess of Fennin Ro<br><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uminionx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MinionX</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 7:18:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~minionx-podw/pokepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm<br>

I really think this is worth some consideration ....what about you all?<br>
<br>
Personally, I really dont understand why evade was ever combined with the hide skill. It seems to me that Evade as proposed to work with the new percentage reduction in hate would function much better as a stand alone skill that improves/reduces the percentange of hate reduction as the skill improves. Given that hide/sneak is somewhat comperable (though not identical) to the invisibility spell in effect why wouldnt casters casting invis on themselves or another person reduce/remove hate? I think the point is that it wouldnt. Evade was of course added because it was needed, yet it seems that perhaps given the thought going into the skill at this moment that some consideration should be made as to why it is not an actual 'skill'.<br>
<br>
Furthermore if Evade were uncoupled from the Hide skill, I would like to see some changes made to Hide to address the total lack of need to pursue skill increases much beyond 80 (the point at which constant success is almost a guarantee). Perhaps it would make sense to allow the Hide skill - beyond current abilitie to remove visibility - to also provide a percentage chance to make a mob with hate &quot;forget&quot; you. This would completely remove you from the hate list and provide you the ability to not have to zone to remove aggro's effects. Obviously this percentage would be contingent on the level of the monster and perhaps the amount of current hate you have accumulated. If mob A has been beaten to a pulp by a backstabbing rogue, its highly unlikely that he will completely forget about him w/o the rogue having amazing abilities to HIDE to extents that prevent the mob from finding him. Given the right circumstances the rogue could then conceveably successfully 'Evade' from combat (reducing the hate) and then attempt to 'Hide' to get the hell out of there. So the big question is how can this be abused. Frankly if implemented right...'Hide' to remove hate would be successful in my mind only 1 out of 6 or so tries vs a monster with say 50% hate and equal level. I can see this giving a rogue the opportunity to maybe get it to go off when trying to flee. <br>
<br>
Finally, I really think that the above changes to Hide can eliminate the silliness of the train that runs to the zone and says 'aw shucks...we didnt get that warrior in time before he zoned' from turning around and saying....'well...we'll just stroll on back to that rogue who we still hate and beat him up some'. At some point there needs to be a mechanisim for a rogue to get out of danger...we dont have the HP's of tanks...cant gate, evac or SoW like casters...so why not do something similar yet uniquely different to feign death. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvestas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vestas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/01 7:32:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Geez...come on~!</span><hr size=1> Not a bad start, I admit I don't see a reason why a rogue should be able to evade to the bottom of a 50 person long hate list especially if not during a large, plane like encounter (where all 50 people would be engaged anyway). <br>
<br>
However, I agree with the other posters that 2 positions down is just not going to cut it.  With multiple rogues on a large raid you will garaunteed end up with a hate-loop that is unescapable until the rogues shut off auto-attack and cease backstabbing (side note: I've done it before way back before evade existed, and, quite honestly, would do it again, but it cannot be denied that it would be making evade relatively useless on large raids).<br>
<br>
Your intent here, I think is obvious, to keep rogues &quot;relatively&quot; near the top of the aggro list, as they are large threats and deal massive damage.  But I urge you to take a close look at fights in general and how often a rogue is actually truly at the complete bottom of the list.  I often find that if I'm not mashing my evade button every chance I get I will get aggro'd upon.  Perhaps, considering your average group is 6 people, a rogue should be bumped 6 spots down the list (thus only causing a small issue where in tiny groups a rogue would be lower on the list potentially than someone engaged).<br>
<br>
However, no matter how you slice it, depending on the number of rogues involved, there is a strong chance for a rogue hate -loop.  There needs to be some way for &quot;tank&quot; based classes (those with taunt) to be able to get &quot;ahead&quot; of rogues consistently.  I suggest careful, careful testing and analysis of any evade changes when paired in small groups with taunting and non-taunting classes as well as large raids.  I understanding that such testing is difficult to do but will be valuable and enlightening and avoid much frustration.<br>
<br>
As a side note, what about making backstabs be displayed like crits? I know it's a small thing, doesn't effect overall gameplay but would give rogues much more visibility as to our worth (as it is right now, at higher levels most people shut off &quot;other people hits&quot; and even if they didn't, they don't see the rogues attacks).  Yeah, I admit, it's an ego thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
