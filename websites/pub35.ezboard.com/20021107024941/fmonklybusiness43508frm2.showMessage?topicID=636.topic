<br>
If you would like to submit an article to the main site, or have any comments on existing content, then email them <a href="mailto:guides@monkly-business.com">HERE</a>.<br>
<br>
Guides MUST be posted here first before they are submitted to the main site, allowing you the guide writer to add comments passed on by other players, or corrections to be made or added.<br>
<br>
Guide links also must be posted here (in this thread, so that I can add them to the list. If you do not add them to the list below, they may be overlooked. Simply add the name of the thread, and a link, and I will incorporate in the big list compiled below. <br>
<br>
<b>Definition of a Guide</b><br>
<br>
The definition of a Guide is a detailed summary of a zone, specific mob, quest, hunting place. This normally takes the form of detailed things such as your level and equipment (not in minute detail) when writting a hunting guide, your race or faction if creating a quest to do with good/evil races, and mob details such as damage output and spell resistances when writting anything to do with taking down x mob.<br>
<br>
A guide is not a one line section, or a small paragraph. Please check to make sure your comments are not already covered elsewhere (ie a simalar topic). If not, then expand your paragraph with more info, and make it a proper guide.<br>
<br>
We would like guides to follow a simalar format, with samples shown below. If your guide (more related to Hunting guides) already exsists, PLEASE DO NOT POST A SEPERATE one. Post it within the same topic. <br>
<br>
eg. 'Solo guide: Quelious Monk 1 to 30' written by Zinj, does not require a seperate 'Solo guide: Quelious Monk 1 to 30' written by Bodi, no matter how much Bodi likes to see his name in lights.<br>
<br>
<b>Hunting Guides</b><br>
<br>
Hunting guides please post in the relevant thread. If one does not exist, then create one and post your guide.<br>
<br>
Zone guides will generally be absorbed into hunting guides, UNLESS they are zones which contain lots of variaty. You should find seperate Zone guides for Crystal Caverns, the Soluseks, Lake of Ill Omen, but not really for Fungus Grove or City of Mist, unless hugely complex.<br>
<br>
If you include a map, DO NOT link it directly from EQAtlas or Maps of Norrath or anywhere else. They have to pay a bandwidth, and I do not want us to add to it. Links are fine, as are maps you host yourself (as long as you note the original map owner)<br>
<br>
We have hunting guides now covering all continents and sample level ranges, so please check if you have any suggestions.<br>
<br>
<b>Sample Thread headings:</b><br>
<br>
Solo Guide: Race of Monk if relevant (level) to (level) <br>
Level Guide: (Continent): (level) to (level)<br>
Quest Guide: Quest item<br>
Skill Guide: Skill<br>
Faction: (Race) (Continents)<br>
Mob Guide : Mob name<br>
Zone Guide: Zone (levels)<br>
<br>
<font size="+3"><b>THIS FORUM IS HEAVILY MODERATED !</b></font><br>
<br>
Do not complain if your post has been moved or even deleted if you do not read these instructions. Bumps and questions will be deleted or incorporated into threads depending on relevance.<br>
<br>
No content commentary will also be deleted from posts here, and also the cropping of peoples sigs within threads (one per person and possibly only the person who created the thread), and large ones to be culled to allow easier printing.<br>
<br>
If you find your hints and tactics posts 'missing'; its very likely a Moderator has consolidated a parallel thread. (ie you have posted the same subject as someone else but have not checked back to see whether it has been done before.) This is because all like information placed in one thread is a lot easier to find and to use than digging through a couple hundred different more or less identical threads. So, if you're going to post, please check to see if someone hasn't posted it already, or if it can go under a thread already opened on that topic.<br>
<br>
This forum is delibaratly not Read Only, as sometimes people post worthy extra information to the original post, so will remain open to all to add further comment.<br>
<br>
<b>Do Not Ask Questions Here</b><br>
<br>
Please obey the board rules and only post guides here. If you have a question to ask, please ask it in the relevant forum, NOT in here.<br>
<br>
<b>Other information</b><br>
<br>
This forum is for people to post guides on how to <b>do</b> something --rasing a trade skill quickly, raise difficult factions, recomendations for equipment/resist gear/luggage, what quests to do when.<br>
<br>
And a final word to say that Your post could be deleted or moved, if in the wrong forum, depending upon the whim of the Moderator at the time.<br>
