<br>
My guild has worked extremely hard trying to find out Seru bane weapons and due to some luck found the start of the Vex Thal quest. We still don't have Seru bane recipes.<br>
<br>
Why should I share what I found with those that don't wish to share? Seru bane recipes not being posted was the main reason I didn't spoil the Vex Thal starting point.<br>
<br>
Rather than say nothing except I know the start and you don't, I tried to provide some information, nothing as cryptic as the Seru earring quest, something that was actually a clue.<br>
<br>
I provided the name of the mob that gives the quest details. I provided the purpose of the Glowing Orb of Luclinite. I confirmed that the quest is available and live. Lot of good information in my post, but so many concentrate on the negatives.<br>
<br>
Im sorry I can't give you the walk through, YET. I'd like to give my guild the opportunity to actually progress a bit in the quest, rather than have to deal with other guilds on my server competing for the same spawns etc.<br>

<br>
As far as we know, FoH is the ONLY guild to have completed the quests.  They figured out the quests completely on their own.  As far as I know, there was not even a hint of spoiler information available  2-3 months ago when they started.<br>
<br>
To date, no one we know has solved the Vex Thal key quest.  A LOT of people have been dilgently spending HOURS of in game time testing theories, getting faction, hailing NPCs, etc.  They then came to these boards and posted EVERYTHING they knew.  You then, using information you got from Safehouse, to further the quest, then come back here and &quot;tease&quot; everyone else.<br>
<br>
It is like the difference between Microsoft and Linux.  FoH is like Microsoft, in that they do not come to the safehouse for spoiler info and figure out everything out on their own. (Please no Microsoft cracks, I know this is a loose anology)  In essance, they own full rights to all their information.  We at the safehouse are more like Linux, in that we are a community of users working together to solve a problem.  And when we make a discovery based on information we got from the safehouse, it is our duty to report back.<br>
<br>
What you are doing is akin to getting the source code to Linux, making some changes, then claiming it to be your own product.<br>

Possibly, the Vex Thall key quest involves the ressurection of  Akelha'Ra's spirit into a new body. And the reward is the key? (just speculating).<br>

Anyone tried to cast Call of Hero in zones where it is disabled and if somethng pop up which look like a questmob ?<br>
<br>
Any other things dont make sense because most parts can be done from other classes or it is tip which shoud lead us in the wrong direction which is possible to :P.<br>
<br>
Hope the one which done the quest can confirm this or say if it is wrong.<br>
<br>
To the Luclin shards.<br>
1 shoud drop from Wurms in Maidens. Maiden zone make sense and the only mobs most most try to avoid are the wurms there which pop up or the wolves which are a pain to kill.<br>
<br>
1 shoud drop in Umbral. <br>

I assume it might drop from any zone where you can find XP-giving mobs for levels 60.<br>

Luclin, the Maiden of Shadows rules the Plane of Shadow, She is short of stature, about 4'9&quot; tall; sleek and thin, with an elfin body structure. Her short hair is deep gray with long side locks down to her stomach. Her silver eyes have no pupils and her skin is solid black. She wears black and gray robes and a shadowy mist perpetually swirls around her feet. In one hand she bears a massive silver and platinum staff carved in the shape of two tendrils wrapping around one another to form two humanoid hands at the top. Floating just above the cupped palms of the hands is a small black orb whose surface has an iridescent sheen similar to that of oil.<br>

its easy to get confused because rather than provide useful information like, &quot;luclin is the daughter of xxx god&quot; they give you a description of her dress and staff.  way to go verant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usyndo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>syndo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 10:20:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4684.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> luclin - goddess or demi godess.</span><hr size=1> Sub-Deities<br>

Noting the Guide screenshots shown <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.psyborg.com/screenshots.html">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> from various other threads, the assinine bane recipes needed for Ssrae/Seru, and the fact that there are some weapons with not only bane vs Akheva but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Greater</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Akheva, I have a terrible feeling that Vex Thal may require Greater Akheva bane weapons to even fight there...<br>
<br>
Also, though the Itraer Insignia IDs as Symbol of the Shadow, I continue to wonder if Itraer actually denotes Greater as in Greater Akheva...  Nearly everything in those VT screens was named Itraer, and Itraer Insignia techincally isn't even an Akhevan name, it's just an english description...  Has anyone with a bane vs Greater Akhevan weapon ever had their hits turned on and notice an increase in dmg output vs IV? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxenjuroxerofist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xenjuro Xerofist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 11:30:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4684.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Timesink^2</span><hr size=1> just throwing out a couple things that have sprung to mind while reading this thread...<br>
<br>
I'm thinking what's required is just 8 shards + 1 other item (the celestial source of power) and not 10 shards.  Akelha`Ra is 8 letters if you don't count the accent(`)...and to this day, there's been 8 shards found.  And also to note, a 10 slot quest container would be used for quests that require 10 OR 9 items to combine, since they don't make containers with odd numbered slots (or at least i've never seen or heard of one).<br>

<br>
The 9th and 10th shards are very likely to be in the parts of the planet that no one sensible hangs around in : Scarlet Desert, Tenebrous Mountains, Katta Castellum, Grieg's End.  That entire half of Luclin is very poorly represented in the scattering of shards. The only one found from that area has been the Acrylia shard and that is only due to its popularity as an AE place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=4684.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=4684.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4684.topic&index=68><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=4684.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=4684.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4684.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4684.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
