<br>
Instead of setting you to 120, or reducing your total hate by 33%, this is what we are going to do.<br>
<br>
If the rogue is #1 on the hate list, a sucessful evade will lower his hate to a point between the 2nd and 3rd person on the hate list.<br>
<br>
If the rogue is NOT #1 on the hate list, a sucessful evade will lower the total hate by a few percent, allowing &quot;pre-evade&quot; to remain a viable tactic.<br>
<br>
At no time will Evade increase a rogue's hate, it will always reduce it. <br>
<br>
Now for other changes:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bind Wounds</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Skill cap pre-50 for Warriors and Rogues was 100..we're moving this to 175, with a max skill of 210.  This means 70% binding well before 60th level. We're also adjusting other classes caps higher as well, but in reality, only Monks, Warriors and Rogues used Bind Wounds with any frequency, and only Pure Melee and Priests will be able to bind to 70% of max hitpoints.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pick Pockets</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  Instead of a hard cap at level 45 for target NPCs, we're leaving it as it stands up to level 50 for the player.  After a player is past 50th, it is (Player Level)-5 to set the level of an NPC you can pick pocket.  All other pick pocket restrictions will remain in place, no magic or no-drop items can be purloined.  So, to simplify this, at 60th you can steal from 55th or lower NPCs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Instill Doubt/Backstab/Special Attacks</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  We are not going to change the functionality of this, but we are going to make ID grey out backstab and vice versa until the timer has expired.  This should make it easier to know when you can use the skill, and prevent a lot of dud ID attempts.<br>
<br>
We simply can't make stackable poisons without a great deal of coding, and we feel that poison as it stands now is workable.<br>
<br>
Hide and Sneak through zonelines/logoff/linkdead is possible, but once again, will take a significant amount of coding and testing..we're not saying no to this, but we are also not promising that we will do it.<br>
<br>
No other special rogue ability will be added..no stuns from behind, no instant escape skills, etc.  <br>

<br>
That sounds much much better.<br>
<br>
&quot;If the rogue is NOT #1 on the hate list, a sucessful evade will lower the total hate by a few percent, allowing &quot;pre-evade&quot; to remain a viable tactic.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few percent?  How much is a few?  Still good that this will work.<br>
<br>
&quot;At no time will Evade increase a rogue's hate, it will always reduce it. &quot;<br>
<br>
What about a failed attempt to evade?  Will this increase the hate number?  And if so, how will this relate to &quot;pre-evade&quot; hate numbers?  I.e.  if a failed evade increase your total hate by X% will a pre-evade decrease your total hate by the same %?<br>
<br>
The rest sounds decent but having stackable poisons should have been done from the get go and I think it is worth the code time it would take. <br>
<br>
Hide/sneak through zone?  Same thing..this should also be done even if it will take alot of code.<br>

<br>
Pure and utter BS. Poison isn't worth a damn. At least remove the apply delay. VI said back when it was implemented that the &quot;improvement&quot; necessitated it. Poison still sucks ass, no reason to have that delay if they don't stack (you can only carry so many of em).<br>
<br>
At least do that. This is a pile of @#%$ though honestly.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're do lazy to do things that should have been done right the first time, but weren't.. so we're still not gonna do em now&quot;.<br>
<br>
Don't know why everyone really cheers you on, other than at least being honest with us and keeping us informed. Everything I've seen them design is completely flawed, and then when they nerf things that are inherently broken (Donal's BP, Manastone) they claim they didn't forsee design issues. How you couldn't is beyond me, but maybe someone should buy VI a clue. <p>Bedrenken Pigsticker<Br>

Much better IMHO than a percent change. Other changes look nice too.<br>
<br>
I know we're not supposed to direct questions at you or try to get your attention, so I'll just pose this as a general question and hope you'll answer =)<br>
<br>
In the first thread, you discussed hate list values, specifically melee attacks adding 50-500. I'm not sure if those were hard numbers or just relative to the other numbers you were putting out. Where do melee -misses- fall in 'hate list value'? Was that the low end of the 50-500 or a seperate number? Anyone? *wink* <p>Dalarian Silvershade <semi retired><BR>

I for one, understand the changes are required for evade and accept this change.  We lost the ability to pull mobs off of our clerics/enchanters and I am glad we will once again be able to help the group in that respect.<br>
<br>
Pickpockets/Instill/Bind Wounds are fantastic changes!!<br>
<br>
About the sneak/hide programming.  How about just making a change to the .ini like [SneakHideZone]=TRUE so that every time you zone into a new area, you're automatically have sneak/hide on? <p><table border="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><img src="http://www.eqcaster.com/images/logo1.JPG"></td><td>With all the jewels, gold, and diamonds<br>in the world...<br><br>Nothing means friendship like<br>a stack of bone chips.<br><br><a href="http://www.eqcaster.com">EqCaster</a></td></tr>

I don't think evade was a big rogue issue until you decided to change it. Now you have made it an issue.<br>
<br>
I think the real rogue issues are poisons and skills and abilities. These you just glossed over with a &quot;we can't do it without some programming involved so we won't&quot;<br>
<br>
Not exceptable. I think we need to discuss what we thing are rogue issues. Throw them all out on the table and discuss them in the same mannor that the other classes have been doing.<br>

  Ok, very interesting developement.  With this situation, there no longer exists the problem of being unable to evade a certain percentile of damage (ie, rogue at 100 hate, warrior at 50 hate, rogue evades 33% hate and is *still* the tank).<br>
<br>
  There is a new issue that I'm very concerned about, though.  Is this going to create a very real problem with raids involving multiple rogues?  In the past, the rogues operated independently, for the most part.  They could all take their hate way way down the list and put all the tanks above them.  But, if each rogue simply steps between the 2nd and 3rd person, will that create a loop of death of some sort between rogues evading onto each other?<br>
<br>
  You know that rogues run very high on that hate list and we get there just by doing our jobs.  What are we going to do with 3-5 rogues present on a raid?  Will evade be disfunctional until at least some of those rogues are dead?<br>
<br>
  Is it a much better idea to put an evade from a rogue who is #1 to move them to say, the 5th or 6th position?  After all, if you made it the 6th position, wouldn't that be a very strong argument in your favor that you are *not* changing evade to damage the small group functionality of the rogue, but simply trying to balance them in full raid situations?<br>
<br>
  And by the way, what does jolt do?  Is it a number reduction or is it how evade currently functions?  I'll try not to make snap judgements since I don't know the answer, but all the negatives of jolt have corresponding links to  disadvantages of evade.<br>
<br>
  I'm just begging... please, Kendrick, please... do not make me have to play a rogue as I did in the pre-evade days.  Please please, I like to fight the mobs my guild engages... please, I don't want to be the rogue that has auto attack off for extended periods of time while waiting for everyone else to build up hate.  Please please, I played that game for months, I discussed why a rogue had no value without a hate reducing method, it was talked about on this board, and evade was born.  Whatever you end up doing with evade, just please please do not reduce me back to the way it was... a dmg dealer who had no options to do dmg without taunt.  I'm just asking that before you do it, you make sure it works and that you are happy, thank-you.<br>

<br>
Can pickpocket become more viable post 50 by making it a &quot;Pilfer&quot; ability?  As in Pilfer, I mean that pick pocket will attempt to steal an item/money and do a little damage [equivalent to &quot;Kick&quot; in dmg... maybe around 20 or so... or even 10 dmg].  While pick pocket will not be all that useful in high level encounters, it will still be something to use for some extra damage and maybe even a little taunt [for further aggro management].<br>
<br>
Can we see a cap increase for Safefall?  The cap now is a bit low. <br>
<br>
Since poisons can't be stackable, can you add multiple charges to a vial?  Or can we combine multiple vials into a vial with multiple charges?  It's all about having enough room to carry them...  <br>

If the changes to evade work well I'm saying all those changes are great.  Thanks again for the attention to the back-pokers. <p><table>

Step two: make this change because of high level only encounters<br>
<br>
How about this...<br>
<br>
Instead of changing evade on all level mobs, 55+ mobs only seems sufficient. This will mean it works on all high level encounters and evade will still be the skill we know and love for our leveling purposes. 30% chance to evade + interrupt + 66% change overall (leaving 33% of working)= ~96% chance of rogue death? How about switching the overall change to possibly 50% not 33% loss in hate. And another thing? How about fixing Taunt, adding MORE taunt to the warrior FA weapons, maybe switch some taunt values around for Snare, Slow, Tash...Your screwing this up in a big way if you intend to keep this change in, ultimately even the best rogues will be effected. I admit I'm a 55 rogue twink, I left because I wanted to LIVE and DO damage to high level monsters over what my ranger could do. Please reconsider everything that you propose, at least do some testing <br>
<br>
(sorry this is a repost from the other thread but it gives the same state of mind)<br>
<br>
As for the other changes, I adore the bind wound change, I end up using that skill a lot when I solo with my wizard wife.<br>
Pickpockets? /shrug, hardly use it, don't see a purpose, but s'ok, whatever helps I guess<br>
<br>
I just don't want this class to go from crap to good, then right back to crap again. Rogues are the wizards of melee so to speak. Do wizards have to regulate their dmg? No, they nuke their asses off to get the job done. What do we do? we backstab our asses off. test test test test this! <p><BR><B><A HREF="http://eqforge.com/ranger/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=76" TARGET=_blank>Dragooner Darkmoon</A> - Warder of Drinal</B><BR>

<br>
Evade<br>
I can accept the decision to change Evade as long as issues like those are tested and fully understood.<br>
<br>
Bind Wounds: <br>
That sounds fantastic!<br>
<br>
Pick Pockets<br>
Again, very nice!<br>
<br>
ID/BS<br>
Glad to know that skill is getting some more user feedback in it. The lack of error messages when using ID/BS was aweful. Glad it finally was able to get some attention.<br>
<br>
Poisons<br>
When it comes to stacking poisons: I tried to look at poisons the same way I look at fletching. However, since one attempt to create arrows yields more than one arrow, carrying the ingredients in your pack was easier to swallow. The state of the poison skill is just so far off what it could and should be that it just makes me sad. The unwillingness to put the resources into polishing up the entire skill system, trade skills included, is inexcusable. It is not about whether VI thinks it is important to themselves or the players, it is about time and resources. Instead of polishing EQ, VI chooses to devote those resources elsewhere. Balancing issues are #1. I understand that. I only hope that when that phase is over, VI will choose to finish their game.<br>

I'm going to assume, since you aid you weren't hired to handle rogues, that this is not your doing and you're only the messenger, trying to help us by giving us the inside scoop.<br>
<br>
I aint shooting the messenger. But I am going to give you a message back.<br>
<br>
I have seen two very feasible ideas to make a "stacked/charged" poison. I came up with one, and so did another Rogue. You can find mine in the Laboratory, his is in the Rogue Talk thread and I don't know of any other places. Both involve summoning the poison vial, rather then charging it.<br>
<br>
To say that it cannot be coded is crap now, we have come up with creative alternatives and workarounds, I don't want a crock about it not being feasible. Please look into it, and then either 1) change it with one of our ideas or 2) simply admit that you don't want us to haul a few poisons around easily, if this is the case.<br>
<br>
Sorry to sound pissed, but to be quite frank, there are two very feasible workaround posted, and neither were acknoledged. Yes, I am offended.<br>
<br>
EDIT: And yes, I realize that poison was not even mentioned in this post. However, as this is the exact same post Absor made in Rogue Talk (part two) I'm going to assume that it was not read. Maybe I am wrong, but really a "We've seen some interesting ideas for poison improvements and are checking with the coders to see if it's possible" would be nice.<br>
<br>
Furthermore: THANK you for the other changes :)<br>

A backstab, two or three hits, and you're back in slot #1.  With the lag timing issues, you could easily be moved to number 2 and back to 1 without ever seeing a change.<br>
<br>
We don't know how much a few percentage points is if we're not number 1.  It sounds less than 33% to me.  I'm more interested in a fixed percentage of somewhere between 25-50% hate reduction which will allow more control over how we use hate in battle.  <br>
<br>
But rather than a fixed percentages, I'd like to see an increase in evade as levels increase.  My idea is start at 21% at level 3 and increase 1% every three levels, for a total of 40%.  I like to see skills that increase as you gain levels.<br>

I really hope it's the latter.<br>
<br>
Considering the large raid / multi-rogue situation, can we have a best of both worlds?<br>
<br>
If you are #1 on the hate list, Evade will drop you between the #2 and #3 positions, *OR* drop you the fixed percentage that you normally get, whichever hate value is LEAST?<br>
