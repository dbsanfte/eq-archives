e: Earring of Veracity *new thread*<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Grabbing back to what Tilbok said:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Tilbok Furruner reads through the report, hands you a small satchel then starts to explain, 'Finally news from Euzan. I knew that it would take a long time to get planted within Seru, but i still worried about their mission constantly. This report shows that you have earned trust from Euzan, so I in turn will show the same trust. Euzan and Torsten were placed in the city for information. They are deep undercover and risk their life everyday. Every person in that city is ingrained with the [purpose] of either destroying Katta or converting his people.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what purpose?'<br>
<br>
Tilbok Furrunner says 'The teaching in the city is that Katta feigned his death to blame it on Seru. When in fact Seru actually poisoned Katta. The crusade that Seru leads is false and must be stopped. We must gain access to Seru's [chambers] and destroy him and show the city the truth.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what chambers?'<br>
<br>
Tilbok Furrunner says ' We do not know much about Seru's Chamber, that is what we need you to find out. This will require great effort on your part. We need you to infiltrate Sanctus Seru and bring back reports from each Consillium. I do not know who will have these reports, and I have only heard rumor that they exist. Return to me with the Satchel full, and your Etched Earring.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While reading through the posted suggestions, I keep seeing people assuming messengers or couriers who will transport to reports you are looking for to Seru himself, or something.<br>
<br>
I think - based on the above information from Tilbok - that this is actually in the wrong direction. The reports are not transported anywhere or anything, but they rather detail about the security of Seru and his residence. No matter how much they may hate one another, all four Consiliums are working to protect Seru ultimately.<br>
<br>
Each Consilium is specialised in one specific direction. As such, each Consilium will be responsible for the defense and security of his housing in the field in which they are active. Their activities in keeping it tight is covered in those reports.<br>
<br>
Considering their envy, they are most likely trying to keep these reports away from the prying eyes of the other Consiliums. But combined, these reports give one hell of a good idea of the layout and functioning of the security of the house in which Seru can be found.<br>
<br>
You are not required to enter Seru's Chambers just yet - you must gather information on it first. Reconnaisance. Spying. Infiltration.<br>
<br>
I don't know how, where or when, but I personally think the reports are found inside each Consilium.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utynkmindrifter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tynk Mindrifter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 10:21:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reports</span><hr size=1> ok guys<br>
<br>
Rhurric a question<br>
 the guy that jumps your when you hand in your reprot to the file cabinet<br>
<br>
Guard Hargrar<br>
the one who summons you immune to fear and has a good amount of hp hits from 50-100s<br>
this guy is within the heart consillium as is the file cabinet<br>
<br>
is he the link that we are missing to start this?<br>
What I am asking is that if we die/zone/gate out before he is dead are we missing something tht he drops?<br>
<br>
also the story up to this step is very straight forward painted red to me nothing cryptic about it thus far. I believe that once i hand in the next item to euzyn the clue will be had to lead to the next npc in katta and the reports NOTHING seems so whacked out once you actually do this quest.<br>
<br>
I am intrigued to know that TWO people have infiltraded seru<br>
BREGUN was questioned and kept notes hidden in the bookself<br>
Torsten a member of the heart went looking for the info<br>
euzyn a member of the heart as well wants you to replace documents in the file cabinet of the heart consillum for a member that is NOT NAMED assumed in the HEART consillium<br>
Guard Hargrar finds you tampering with the fiel cabinet and tries to beat your ass(succeeded in smashing me lol all 900 hp)<br>
next you hand your earring and the original report back to euzan and blamo another quest which i logged off to look at my noted (I eqlog everything because my memory sucks sometimes)<br>
<br>
SO we are looking in the AREA of the HEART for the report<br>
THIS is the first step and I assume tilbok will point out who in the heart we are looking for for this consillium report...........matpa perhaps............will research this in a moment<br>
<br>
CHOW<br>

ps eq log for ya<br>

[Thu Feb 07 06:48:00 2002] Torsten Reidan pulls out a hollow book entitled 'A Detailed Look at Etiquette and Proper Grammar' and opens it to find a journal placed inside.  'This is astounding.  The information in this journal is invaluable and must be brought to the others attention.  Take this insignia.

[Thu Feb 07 06:53:23 2002] You say, 'how do i earn yoru trust'<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:23 2002] Euzan Jurek leans in and whispers to you, 'Let it be known that assisting us will show your distrust in everything this city stands for.  If you do not want to get involved I urge you to walk away now.  However if you wish to [bring about change], stay and I will tell you how to earn our trust.' '<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:49 2002] You say, 'i wish to bring about change'<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:50 2002] Euzan Jurek says 'Good, you must do something for us.  One of our members, who needs not be named, is due to be called for the Question.  We need you to go into the Heart [Consillium] and replace their records with this one.  This false record shows that they have completed their Question and still have time until their next one.  Changing the records will make the question pass over us so that we avoid being discovered.  Go in stealth, when you have completed this task bring me back the original records and your Insignia Earring. '<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:55:12 2002] You say, 'what consillium'<br>

Might be the answer to all this, since it's in one of the 'just above my post' posts that Rhuarc is hinting about..<br>
<br>
&quot;Has anyone given a shard to the file cabinet????????? &quot;<br>
<br>
I note that this was asked (never really answered), Rhuarc posted just after it, then a few hours later posted something that he then deleted.  So, if possible, and if you're willing, would someone please try this lead?<br>
<br>
Now, let me get this off my chest..<br>
<br>
People don't come here and post about quests to be dorked around by people looking to inflate their ego by lording information over others.  People come here to collaborate, because it's fun to work stuff out with other people instead of beating your head on the wall solo.  They do it here because the tools for communication ingame literally suck.  People also come here (or to other 'spoiler' sites) because they are completely frustrated and stuck on a quest, and would give up completely on it, if not for an answer to a question or two.  There's not any good way to get this information across without the ability for them to go ahead and read the whole thing, but hey, that's their choice.<br>
<br>
So simply- if you know how this quest is done, and you feel like withholding that information from others, if you could personally give *direct* information about the direction to head but think it's way more fun watching people try the wrong methods, please do me a favor- BUGGER OFF.  This forum isn't about childish 'I'm so cool cause I know and you don't' games.  Either become part of the process, or find somewhere else to masturbate.<br>

An enchanter won't help, the only other method might be to get an AoN and use the skel illusion from it.<br>
<br>
Right now it looks like the answer is the kill the praeserta and hand the shards to the file cabinet. How pathetic. Explain to me how this is 'cryptic'? Just another uber-guild 'smack mob 1, hand doohickey to mob 2' deal. Yawn. Killing 4 red to 60 mobs for an item which is a minor upgrade to an Ivandyr's hoop seems out of whack.

<br>
The only thing that bothers me about that approach is that by raiding the zone to kill the bosses, it's not really much of an 'infilitration' so much as an 'invasion'.  By the time you're done getting the shards, I'd expect you'll be KoS or nearly so with every faction in the zone.  This may not matter, as the quest giving NPCs so far seem to be on Katta faction- that may be why.<br>
