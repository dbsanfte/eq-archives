<br>
I'll be taking thrust to 50 either way.<br>
<br>
My question is there is a 4 hit evade chain ratfang/beartooth/liontooth/wyvernfang in the thrust line.  Does the full chain not do enough damage to be viable compared to the CS evade chain, or does the stun on ratfang negate/hinder the Dragonfang stun? Just curious why no one seems to talk about it.<br>
<br>
Anyone tested this? or could test this for me? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/unandurius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nandurius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/10/02 8:31:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3717.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/phaas/phazer-avatar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Evade Chains</span><hr size=1> You want 50 thrust, 39 crit. Use the extra points to boost DW or whatever =D<br>
<br>
<br>
Attack chains:<br>
<br>
1) Light targets: Perf, CD, SS, then either let lifebane finish, or finish with garrote/ah.<br>
<br>
2) Heavy targets: Perf, Dragonfang+tranquilize, Dragonfang+wyvernfang, (tranq and wyvernfang are backup styles.) until dragonfang sticks, then use hamstring, leaper, hamstring, leaper.<br>
<br>
The detaunt tranqulize has no bonus damage, but a high bonus to defense. This causes other players to MISS you (it may also improve your chance to evade, but evades happen so often this is hard to judge.) Wyvernfang has nice bonus damage (+70-ish) and an attack speed debuff.<br>
You should land DF within 2-3 rounds (~75 bonus damage) and then hamstring/leaper will hit for 80-90 style damage each, twice.<br>
<br>
Unlike garrote, this is very endurance effective =P<br>
<br>
You're right about the thrust-evade chain stun, it will set off the one-minute stun immunity with the short stun (3s.) <br>
<br>
I logged/parsed some style damage while fighting in DF, this may give you an approx. idea of style bonus damage of the thrust styles up to 50, and cs up to 39. Only interesting to see how styles compare to each other, ignore the actual damage numbers they depend on so many factors (mob/player, weaponskill, weapons, item bonuses etc.)<br>

The thrust evade chain is a joke.  The damage on it is pathetic.<br>
<br>
It is very easy to get the evade chain off.  This is especially true if you are using it to follow up dragonfang.  Without the evade chain my infiltrator would have been retired ages ago.<br>
<br>
I think the main reason most people dislike the evade chain is that they use gar/AH as their any time attack.  The defensive penalty on garrote reduces your evade percentage dramatically so you do not evade nearly as often.  By not useing gar/ah and instead giving up a little damage in favor of defensive bonuses I cannot remember the last time I had a fight in which I did not evade at least one attack.  Once you evade once you can live on the evade chain for the remainder of the fight.  Dragonfang, hamstring, leaper, hamstring, leaper, rib separator, ripper can all be done off of a single evade.  These styles also give a defensive bonus promoting more evades once the chain is begun.<br>
<br>
I have no difficulty keeping hotkey room for the evade chain.  I have my opening moves on my first page of HK's which has PA, CD, SS, Tanqualize, Wyvernfang, stick, stealth and sprint.  Then my second page is for combat after the opening tranq, wyvern,dragonfang, ham, leaper, rib seperator stick, stealth(only have 47CS so I don't have Ripper or I would drop wyvernfang to make room for it.  I also have a combat bank which has Gar/AH in place of tran/wyvern for times when I just need to do damage in a hurry and get out, but it is rarely used.<br>
<br>
Wyvernfang is not part of the thrust evade chain, it chains off tranqualize and does similar damage to garrote without the high endurance cost or defensive penalties.  I use this chain in place of Gar/ah because the damage loss is not that much, it uses much less endurance, and having a defensive bonus rather than a defensive penalty helps ensure that I evade a rediculous amount of attacks.<br>
<br>
Despite the effectivness of dragonfang, Once respec is in I will most likely be changing to slash spec because amethyst slash/diamond slash would allow me to do better anytime damage without taking the defensive penalties associated with gar/ah.  Also, chain classes are becoming much less viable targets with epic armor, purge and IP in the game, so I am going to work towards killing other assassins and archers more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3717.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3717.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3717.topic&index=4><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3717.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3717.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3717.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3717.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousefrm31">Official News<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm30">Lesser Classes<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
