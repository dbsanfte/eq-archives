Some solutions please read.</span><hr size=1>  <br>
 I came up with some things I would like you to think about and talk with the other team leads about. I think these two ideas would help with some problems at hand.<br>
 <br>
 1) In the assassin realm of classes, two of the 3 are not broken. Once &quot;re-spec&quot; is put in, Shadowblades will be able to change their templates around to their style of play and infiltrators are fine as is. This leaves Nightshade as the assassin class that needs just a little bump to fall in line with the other 2.<br>
 -problem.. Nightshades are lacking in the ability to last long enough in a fight to do the damage that the other two assassin classes can. This is mainly due to race restrictions that leave them with low constitution and low hit points.<br>
 -Solution.. By design Nightshades are suppose to be weak. The realm abilities give some leeway but not enough to bring them in line with their counterparts in the other two realms who also get realm abilities. As a hybrid caster, Nightshades should receive the &quot;ABSORB&quot; buff of 5% that all Direct damage pure casters get (pure casters also get a 10% absorb buff, but this is to much for shades). This buff will allow them to last a little longer in melee situations while not covering their weakness of low hit points and constitution. It is also in Line with the caster part of the class.<br>
 <br>
 2) Recently character moves to &quot;Pendragon&quot; and &quot;Mordred&quot; were automated for the public. A problem on many servers is the balance of realm vs realm in the RVR high end game. Through the use of character transfer automation some resolution can be accomplished.<br>
 -Problem.. Some servers lack enough players in the enemy realm at high enough levels to make RvR fun. Often times large groups on one side have no counter from the other realms and soon those players become bored with the content and DAoC in general.<br>
 -Solution.. Allow characters to log on to a server of their choice and make a level 1 character reserving the name and complete the character &quot;copy&quot; as was done for the &quot;Pendragon&quot; test. But set a limit to transfers for each server based on RP status earned by the realms in the past 7 days. If your realm is earning the most RP on your server for the past 7 days, no transfers to your realm can be made. A reply is sent through e-mail informing you that the move to that server will not be processed due to realm vs realm balance issues.<br>
 <br>
 With item #2 above I can see a lot of people saying that if you limit who can be on a server in a certain realm, then friends can not join and new players would be forced onto servers they don't want to be on. This is not true. This will not effect new players or the making of characters on a server at all. What it will do is keep established strong rvr realms from getting stronger while allowing some of the strong rvr players from other servers to copy over within their realm and boost their side of the war between the realms on the server with the balance problem. <br>
 <br>
 It will also allow people to move to servers where they will have the most fun and find a home where they are happy with DAoC and making new friends. Adding a new dimension to the RvR aspect of the game.<br>
 <br>
 Think on this for a bit.. (exactly how I worded it, not reading to much into it) and see what you think.<br>
 <br>
 Take care!<br>

Some solutions please read.</span><hr size=1> as i stated in another thread,my only choice is to respec to crit blade. which is more of a solo play style, i chose a 5 spec,so i could solo,and could have some use in group, with a normal meelee damage base.  i didnt group to be a solo player 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
it took me 31 days to make 50 on this charecter,i have little interest and the time to spend another 20 days levelling up my infiltrator on another server to get him to 50. i spent 80% of my time on my sb solo trying to level,basically due to lack of groups,i have no wish to repeat that painful process on another rogue class charecter.<br>
<br>
i also expect infils to get nerfed in the future,mabye as soon as the next patch. even if it doesnt happen,i started playing in beta, waited for release, spent 4 months waiting for them to make the class playable,came back 2 months ago,only to reach 50 and get nerfed back into what rogues were at the start of the game.<br>
<br>
realize im ranting a bit,but i guess in the end it comes down to being tired of paying for a product that hasnt really improved in quality since the release,and in many cases is more limiting then the first 2-3 months of the product were.<br>
<br>

Some solutions please read.</span><hr size=1>  Well I have kept quiet while many people here have brought up the points about the Shadowblade class being broken. I did this so I would not upset anyones plans for what they were trying to get added to the class.<br>
 <br>
 But now you come to a thread I started and state the same things. Sorry I have had enough! If you think other classes like infiltrator are more to your liking then go make one. If you don't want to level one up then go buy one or trade for one, but don't try and tell me that a class that I have played since November of last year is broken!<br>
 <br>
 No one at mythic said that shadowblades were supposed to be &quot;Shadowzerkers&quot;. No one said that they should be &quot;Critblades&quot;. That is all something PLAYERS came up with, trying to &quot;min/max&quot; the game. Will re-spec help this.. yes!<br>
 <br>
 Are shadowblades as good as Infiltrators? ..No. Are they better than at least 65% of the other classes in the game when it comes to RvR? ..YES!<br>
 <br>
 I am a Shadowblade.. level 50.. I been through the drill. You can try and tell me all you want to, but don't try to fill my head with notions of how weak shadowblades are, because I know different, ok?<br>
 <br>
 Sorry about the rant, but lets get back on topic.. If you want more for shadowblades then that is fine, but the two items I posted earlier in this thread are what we should be talking about.. A fix for Nightshades (they do need it) and A fix for server balancing in RvR so we can all find players to compete against.<br>
 <br>
 Take care!<br>
