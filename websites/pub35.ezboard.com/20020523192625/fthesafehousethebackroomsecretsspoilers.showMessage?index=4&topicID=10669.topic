The question was not answered and the thread the guy pasted above is locked so further discussion on that was impossible.<br>
<br>
Incidentally there are 5 other topics started all with Burrower Parasite in their Subject field with various discussions , some irrelevant to me (comparing it's difficulty with AoW) and some relevant to me but the responses included stuff like "drop hp below zero and you can then loot corpse". <br>
<br>
There was one intelligent response I did find breaking down the number of waves and the number of mobs per wave etc (as opposed to Prudance's drivel above). <br>
<br>
I understand the last wave consists of Core Burrowers who flurry and are unslowable. I was wondering if there were other wurms unslowable as well.<br>
<br>
Also I apologize to anyone who feels I am "gimping" the encounter by preparing for it in advance. I simply wish to be most prepared for it. I will gather whatever info I can and then go for it. If you do not wish to divulge such information because you feel cheated, I respect that. If you do care to help, I appreciate that.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

3 waves of 12 mobs, 3 waves of 6 mobs, 1 wave of 2 mobs, then the big dong himself.  I dunno how long each wave lasts, with 40 people we don't have much downtime between waves (maybe a minute).  Only a few of the mobs in the first3 waves are mezzable, I forget which though since I'm Mr. F8.<br>

Go and give it a whirl, you'll learn more there than you'll ever learn here.

<br>
before you charge the ring, have everyone pick up and put into their inventory a rod of mystical transvergence.<br>
<br>
valuable assets to the raid:<br>
<br>
-necromancer<br>
-bard<br>
-6 warriors<br>
-4 clerics<br>
-wizards with manaburn<br>
-druid<br>
<br>
your group configurations for warriors should be as follows:<br>
<br>
1. warrior<br>
2. warrior<br>
3. warrior<br>
4. cleric<br>
5. cleric<br>
6. bard<br>
<br>
with 40 people as parv has previously mentioned you would require two groups of these, so essentially you require at least 4 clerics, and 6 warriors (a hybrid tank will do in this case).<br>
<br>
the first three waves are simple, there are 12 mobs each, these mobs are the equivalent of a krup knight in sebilis.  they can be AoE'd, and most likely should be AoE'd (to preserve resources).<br>
<br>
so the first three waves come in exact 5 minutes flat.<br>
<br>
the fourth wave is quite difficult, but since your raid party's resources (mana, HP, rune 5's) should be particularly high (this all assuming you use a very low number of people), assuming your guild knows proper assist,  heal main tank tactics, the worms should be no problem - they will be under control.  keep warriors above 50% health, and utilize <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> celestial elixir</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as much as possible.  do not completely neglect complete heal however - just keep it in moderation.  clerics build an immense number of aggro during this encounter.<br>
<br>
the fourth wave consists of 6 worms with a moderately high attack rating.  they each have around 40-50,000 hitpoints, so your guild should be able to do approximately 300,000 damage within 5 minutes.  the key here is dotting each and every one of the 6 mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> this round your warriors will be using defensive off of the bat.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
assuming your raid party has maximized its damage (there is no need to explain this) by dotting each and every single mob properly, upholding damage shields on each and every melee, you should have killed the 6 worms with at least 40 seconds to a minute to spare.  my guild has done this encounter with 40 with minutes to spare - the key here is.. the more you do the burrower, the better you'll get.<br>
<br>
the next wave is wave 5.  this is a tough one, your raid party (assuming yuo've used 40 up to this point) should be fairly low, or lacking of resources (low mana, buffs have fallen).<br>
<br>
this is your &quot;damage&quot; round.  have every single melee assist off of the first main tank, and use their damage disciples.  wizards with mana-burn will assist the secondary main tank and use it (my guild has around 3, thusly resulting in 20k-30k instantaneous damage on one of the worms).  that is 2 worms made short work of.  usually when using 40 some-odd people, we will have one enchanter kite a burrower in circles until the first five have been slain.  this will allow for clerics to catchup in mana.<br>
<br>
there are several guilds that tend to &quot;perma-train&quot; some of these worms in a very odd location, thats fine, whatever works for you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> as of this round, your warriors will not have defensive, but for wave #6, they will.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
wave number 6, this is a breeze, your warriors have defensive, and you have exactly 7 or 8 minutes to kill all of the worms.  remember to dot effectively, dotting is key here with low pops.<br>
<br>
its also convenient mid-way for wizards to fully dump their mana into ae'ing the mobs.  be sure your warriors keep the worms close together.<br>
<br>
one of the main problems you'll be facing when attacking the 6 worms is multi-summons.  this happens because the worms are so close together, and damaged.  to prevent a warrior from being one-rounded (swiped with no chance for a heal), keep their hitpoints above 50% at all costs (all warriors should be CE'da t the beginning of each spawn).<br>
<br>
the 7th wave consists of two worms, designate two main tanks, assist off of one, very simple.  i woudl say they have a damage output of... roughly 70% of telkorenar.<br>
<br>
when the actual mob himself, burrower parasite (8th wave, final boss) spawns, treat him like the avatar of war.  for those that don't know how to heal against he avatar of war, here is how it works.<br>
<br>
cleric group:<br>
<br>
1. cleric<br>
2. cleric<br>
3. cleric<br>
4. cleric<br>
5. cleric<br>
6. shaman<br>
<br>
assume the complete heal rotation goes from cleric 1, to cleric 5, consecutively.  each cleric will have a hotkey that looks as follows:<br>
<br>
/g Casting complete heal on % t (target)<br>
/cast (CH spell-gem)<br>
/pause 20<br>
/g Cleric 2 HEAL NOW.<br>
<br>
cleric 2 won't necessarily be cleric 2, it'll be the name of cleric 2, but for lack of names, numbers used.<br>
<br>
pause 20 works nicely, and a defensive tank will not die unless the burrower gets lucky, double flurries, something stupid.  if you have a 3-digit IQ, yuo'll be able to figure out the rest.<br>
<br>
the shaman is in the group for sake of torpor'ing the clerics in the event that they rod down to keep mana peaked out.<br>
<br>
if you want to change your CH mode to AoW-mode... change the /pause 20... to /pause 13 (or 12).<br>
<br>
be sure nobody but clerics use the rods.<br>
<br>
using a 2hander against AoW is nice as well (like a gaudralek, TSBS, palladius's) for the main tank (as with the burrower parasite).<br>
<br>
if you want instant aggro, camp a fungus beast gland, 10 charges of snare instant casting.<br>
<br>
