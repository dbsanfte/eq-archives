You talk to General Staginar, he is in the first building to the right behind the bank.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  You say, 'Hail General Staginar'<br>
General Staginar says 'Greetings, Kormus. Are you here to serve in the war against the grimling horde? <br>
You say, 'yes i am here to serve in the war'<br>
General Staginar says 'As you probably know, we've been battling the grunts for nearly a generation now. They have proven to be a challenging opponent. We've inflicted great casualties upon their kind in this war, yet somehow, they seem to grow even more numerous. Barring some miracle, they will become a serious threat to Shar Vahl very soon. One remaining strategy has a chance of bringing us victory, but none have met the requirements for its implementation. <br>
You say, 'what are the requirements?'<br>
General Staginar says 'Our intelligence has provided us with some information about the enemy. They blindly follow a being they refer to as 'the master'. Our high spiritists have sensed a powerful presence from the caverns beyond our mines, but only those who possess a special key can venture there. None who have obtained the key and ventured into the caverns have been seen alive again. <br>
You say, 'where can i get the key?'<br>
General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander holds half of a magical acrylia obelisk that will transport the wielder to their master's stronghold. I have slain the high commander who held the other half of the obelisk and I have the knowledge of it's construction. I will only give it to one who has proven to be a powerful soldier, for nothing less would stand a chance against the enemy ruler. <br>
You say, 'what high commander?'<br>
General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander will only appear if their compound to the north is overrun. There are two encampments near the compound that will need to be invaded as well in order to secure the area. It is a very complex mission and I will only authorize you to lead it if you have demonstrated competence. Serve our people by successfully completing the lesser raids here in the forest. Bring me the Golden Medal of the Shar Vahl as proof of your prowess, or, if you are already at least as powerful as I am, there is another test that will give me confidence in your abilities. <br>
You say, 'what other test?'<br>
General Staginar says 'If you are less experienced than I am, performing this task will gain you nothing. With that in mind, take this box and venture through the mines and into the caverns. Combine in it Gooplart's tooth, Gizgargank's scalp, Grikplag's skull, Gnildaria's eye, Gnerpokkel's heart, Gilgaplank's toes, the husk of the summoned burrower, and the shackles of a Vah Shir captive. Return to me with the Box of the Hero of Shar Vahl and I will send a team of our veterans to escort you into battle.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You receive a container (cannot remember the name of the box exactly). This container has 8 slots, one for each piece.<br>
<br>
Behind the building with the general is a perch with a an imprisoned grimling. Talk to it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  You say, 'Hail, an imprisoned grimling'<br>
an imprisoned grimling looks up at you through wild eyes, 'You help me, I tell you things! I no lie! You not kill me. I beg. Things I know, you will see.' <br>
You say, 'what things'<br>
an imprisoned grimling says 'Big catman in jail we have. I got key. I give you key and you not kill me. I beg! <br>
You say, 'what key'<br>
an imprisoned grimling says 'Take, take, I trust. You no kill me now. Hurry, locks change soon!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You receive a forked key (cannot quite remember the name). The key is lore, no rent and no drop.<br>
<br>
I thought about getting the items General Staginar talked about in the Caves leading to the Acrylia Caverns - some semi named up, lots of runes dropped but no notable item except one grimling toes who aren't even no drop. Farmed the Caves for 2 hours, then we moved into Acrylia Caverns. No single grimling outside in GW saw invis and no grimling inside does. So it is rather safe to roam there.<br>
Beware: Mobs (30% SKs) level 42 and up, resulting in multiple 600+ HTs can turn this cakewalk quickly into a nightmare. AC strips levitate buffs and you cant levitate inside. Do NOT try to CoH in AC - this will result in a grimling hero spawning that is reported to be lvl 57 (I cannot confirm that but I didn't try) and the 'spell not working in this zone' message.<br>
Spawn time is around 8 minutes I believe (didn't time it but it is short) so you better be moving forward while rolling through the zone - agro range of the grimlings at lvl 60 is rather short so you could squeeze through at some point.<br>
Rather small, boring zone with 3 exceptions: <br>
a) A kind of summoning circle that spawns (or rather shows) grimlings around it when you enter it - those are illusions I think because they don't have names and disappear as soon as you leave the circle.<br>
b) A waterfilled cavern with fishes inside (don't see invis) and a 'Summoned Hatchling' ('Sandwurm/Shai-Hulud' model) that cant be targeted. Dropping invis does not produce results, cavern is surrounded by grimlings, some of them 'grimling summoners' (summoned the hatchling perhaps?) which are nowhere else to be found.<br>
c) A kind of ruined temple area with grimlings and 'a possessed corpse' (vah shir skeleton) - some of those skeletons are casters and see invis, all possessed corpses seem to be around lvl 46 SKs. A large stair which leads to a closed drawbridge like castle front (drawbridge is not a door and closed) and a large room with a lava pool in the middle - you cannot get out if you fall in so watch out.<br>
Here is where the interesting part starts. To the left of the large room is a door which leads to another locked door - if you use the key you got from the imprisoned grimling you find the imprisoned vah shir.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  You say, 'Hail, Trondol Shir'<br>
Trondol Shir looks around frantically, 'What are you doing here? You'll be killed! Do not waste your time trying to help me. Save yourself and leave at once!' <br>
You say, 'i will help you'<br>
Trondol Shir shakes his head in frustration, 'I am beyond help. The key to my shackles is held by the grunts' high priest, curse him. I feel his dark magic pulling at my soul. I am doomed to join the legion of our fallen people that serve their twisted master here. <br>
You say, 'what key?'<br>
Trondol Shir opens his mouth as if to speak, but lacks the strength to form words. <br>
You say, 'what high priest?'<br>
Trondol Shir Trondol speaks slowly between shallow, labored breaths, 'Through some kind of dark magic, the grunts steal away the spirit energy from their victims. I know not what they do with this energy once they procure it. When the victim is all but drained of life, the high priest forces them to walk to the end of the platform over there. He then performs some sacrificial ritual that hurls the prisoner into the pit. Shortly thereafter, the bones of the fallen are collected and reanimated, destined to serve the grunts forever. I have seen this a dozen times now, and now my time is near.' </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I suppose you get the shackles the general requested from Trondol Shir if you free him. The lava pool is surrounded by other non targetable grimlings and there is a 'plank' leading out above the lava from a room which is accessed by a door on the opposite side of the large room.<br>
Inside is a grimling priest (actually I believe talking to Trondol Shir made additional priests spawn on the exact spot - priests conned blue to lvl 60) who is again not targetable and 4 possessed corpse. I could not kill the corpses solo (left my team out because we had no inviser) and the priest didnt react to my presence if deinvised. The 'plank' which will lead the captured Vah Shir to their fiery fate is reported to have an irresistible trap and will hurl you in the lava - I didn't confirm that though.<br>
<br>
I suppose you somehow need to trigger the ceremony to have a chance to kill the priest and free the captured cat - the key to free Trondol Shir should be dropped by the priest. Handing the key to Trondol will result in him giving you the key back.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will return later tomorrow and try other ways to free Trondol. Help with getting the 7 other quest parts (which I doubt to be dropped by grimlings in the Caves which someone posted after killing named and non named grimlings for two hours) would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
P.S.: Lvl 60 SK, Pally and Cleric did this<br>

Also none of the grimling camps have respawned yet (or Veteran Cullin I believe) since failing the war a few days ago.<br>
