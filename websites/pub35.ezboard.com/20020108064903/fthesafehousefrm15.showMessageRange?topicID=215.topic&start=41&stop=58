<br>
 The people who support a one character pvp server seem to primarily want people to be responsible for their actions/rep.  So that somebody can't make an evil PK who gets great loot and gives to their &quot;good&quot; character with the good rep.  One solution: Just like there's a /guildstatus command you can use to determine what guild an anonymous character is in, make a /playerstatus command to list the non-empty player slots (names only) for a player.  Sure, it's totally not roleplaying, but neither is the /guildstatus command, and besides... so what?  It makes people be unable to get away with reputation shenanigans and still allows people to have multiple characters, multiple classes, multiple trade skills, etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
95% of Darkenbane, the people you despise so much, is made up of alts from the people you would call friends. As they smile in your face, they take note of the gear you wear, and plot their next attack on you at a zoneline. This is where 1 character per server comes into play. <br>
<br>
Maybe you dont realize it, but that is a fact. They are there, and they get away with it because they have their primary who gets to wear great gear and look pretty, while you wonder where they get all of their money and items from.<br>
<br>
When you only have one rep, yes you can still be a pk. But now you have a serious penalty. If you went to log in right now, what do you want to do? XP? Level? PK? Then you pick the character accordingly. When you are tired of dealing with people hunting you for your acting inapropriately, and tired of the GMs having to warn you time and time again, you log on your &quot;happy character&quot; and all is well. Your friends that you just ganked a minute ago welcome you with open arms. Not knowing that later that night you will transfer their items to your &quot;happy character&quot; and then sell them off making that character rich and more powerful all the while leaving your friends behind.<br>
<br>
This is the truth of the game, especially on Rallos. If there was only 1 character per player per server, I imagine Darkenbane would be a MUCH smaller guild. Toss in xploss upon death, and now you have Darkenbane being a dead guild.<br>
<br>
The fact unfortunately is that the way Everquest is designed, it fully supports the naked random ganker, and punishes any other playstyle. However, there are other games on the horizon, one of which has to get it right. If not right, I would settle for just better.<br>
<br>
1 player 1 server 1 reputation. That is what is required.<br>

Yes, I would be fine with a 1 character server, I just don't know if that's fair. I just about only play Canbik, my nexyt highest character ever is a necro, level 14. That's how bad it is heh. So, yes, I am cool with it, I just don't know that I support it.

The Shanks try to keep "Grief" players from getting into the guild.<br>
<br>
Just having a character of another race doesn't qualify as a grief player.  Contrary to some opinions, most of us although we are very xenocidal in character, do not confuse the character with the player.  I'm sure that some of our better members had Dark Race characters before coming to the Shanks.<br>
<br>
Now if, we had reason to suspect that one of our members were passing privaledged information to others, outside the clan then, we would consider removing that individual from the guild.<br>
<br>
One character per server would go a long way in preventing this situation from ever occurring. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A> at: 5/11/01 4:07:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukambic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.13thshadowcompany.com/svimages/new_post.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 5:05:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New pvp server, What changes HAVE to be made?</span><hr size=1> Aye, that is a good viewpoint. I have seen it come up many times in SD though, about if a member were to have an alt in a PK guild, or any guild that was not in the same alignment as SD, would we boot them? I have always strongly voted no, as that blends all the characters together. Here, I'll come right out and say it, I have a character in Malificus Sect. They are a "team" guild I guess, all evils who rolepvp, which I enjoy because it gives me some PvP that I don't get on Canbik. I get to do things I'd never be able to do with Canbik, aye though in-character. Both characters are traveling down two different paths, and I enjoy that so long as I do not get that confused. Regretibly, many people <i>do</i> get that confused. That I suppose is where the problem lies. I guess many of the changes suggested would not really affect me, I just don't necessarily support them because it could affect me at a later time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=elegance>Elegance</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 10:15:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New pvp server, What changes HAVE to be made?</span><hr size=1> ah-HAH!
