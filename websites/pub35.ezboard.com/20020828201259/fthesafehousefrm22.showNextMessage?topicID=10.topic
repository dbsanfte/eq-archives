So I thought I would post a bit on my experiences on it to answer peoples questions.<br><br>Level 46 Shadowblade<br>My template<br>33 (+12) Stealth<br>34 (+6) Leftaxe<br>35 (+9) Axe<br>39 (+9) Crit Strike<br>7 (+5) Envenom<br><br>My realm rank is 3 (+2 to all skills)<br><br>Tentitively, My level 50 should look something close to -<br>37 (+13) Stealth<br>34 (+6) Leftaxe<br>43 (+9) Axe<br>43 (+9) Crit Strike<br>7 (+5) Envenom<br><br><br>What do I get out of this template?? Damage.  Pure steel damage.   I don't have to worry about resists, I don't have to worry about reapplying poisons, I just hit my style buttons and hit hard EVERY swing.<br><br>Do I regret the envenom loss?  Not at all.  My crit strike and Axe skill will ensure I have a nice opening perf/creeping death.  Close to that of a pure critblade.  I use envenom for it's secondary abilities.  I LOVE the new snare.  It makes my styles hit over and over, they never leave my range.  I keep infectious on the second blade.  With that my damage is fast enough that I can overcome most heals.  I will not move envenom up one more drop.  The enervate line is nice, and the dot is much better, but that's just not how I do my damage.  I hit you hard and don't stop hitting you hard until you are dead.  And you WILL be dead!<br><br>How's doublefrost in RVR?  Oh... my.... god.  You will love this style.  It is the &quot;stealther killer&quot;.  It's sometimes tough to setup a perf on an assassin or high stealth archer.  You lose them from target nearest enemy too fast to setup the front facing.  You don't need it.  Doublefrost is all you need.  It hits SO hard.  Against yellow con assassins/archers, you're looking at +120 to +150 on your style damage.  That makes my hits around 230-250, plus my leftaxe hit.  300ish damage a swing, they just have nothing to defend against it.<br><br>What's the best thing about this template?  Pure and simple.  I can kill things that other shadowblades can't.  Where other shadowblades are dumping damage in the first few hits and praying.  I have a nice dump of damage in those hits and then I have something to push through the rest of their hitpoints... doublefrost.  I don't shy away from armored opponents.  In fact, I do some stuff that most people think are pretty insane!<br><br>Suggestions to those following the soulblade path?  Hold the line.  Find the path you like and follow it.  It truly shines as you reach the 45ish area.  You'll truly shine.  It's hard to lay off envenom, it really is.  But in my opinion, getting your spec to 34cs/34la is your primary goal.  Once you hit it... you're golden.  Work on hitpoints!!!  Con and +hitpoint items are your friends.  You are going to be staying in fights where other assassins would be running.  You can't do this without alot of hitpoints and if possible Slash/Thrust/Crush resistance items.   <br><br>At 46 as a kobold I have 1047 hitpoints with zero buffs.  My thrust and crush resists are beautiful.... I struggle against slashers, but the others die nice, I hope to up my slash resist next.  Leaves me in the fight a 2 or 3 more rounds, in which i get 3 more doublefrosts off!!<br><br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br>Stick with it, soulblades, you'll love it!!!<br><br><br><br>SoD<br><br><br><br><br><br> <p><B><big><font color="#ffffff">Bile Silhouette</B></big><BR>Pendragon *Legends* Smurf of Death<br> <br><i>Half the world is composed of idiots, the other half of people clever enough to take indecent advantage of them.</i><br>BILE WAZ HERE!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=biabia>Bia Bia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/21/02 11:21:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Shadowblade Soulblade template</span><hr size=1> thanks for the input bile.<br><br>im going with this temp:<br>stealth 37<br>left axe 39 (really want frostygaze)<br>axe 39<br>crit 34 (pa, cd)<br>envenom 28<br><br>im wondering what kind of pa's ill be able to get with crit at 34. i mainly just want creeping death for the stun, so i can get a few doublefrosts in.  but im considering leaving left axe at 34 and getting crit bumped higher.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jaxx>Jaxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/21/02 7:14:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Shadowblade Soulblade template</span><hr size=1> So there are three fantastic templates for an uber assassin that can be followed if you are an SB.

The left axe skill is what decides dual wield, in midgard you can only wield an axe in the second hand, that is why it is called left axe.<br><br>On a second point, Bile which do you find more useful, the higher LA skill or the higher CS skill? I am trying to choose my final template and I am having issues deciding between 39 in CS or 39 in LA. There is another thread on this, but I was wanting to get your opinion as well.

But here is the prospective specializations at level 50:<br><br>37 stealth<br>44 Crit Strike<br>43 Axe<br>34 Left Axe<br>8 envenom<br><br>From 1-25 I train in sword (much better styles) at 25 I switch to Axe (from new respec changes...), and also I wouldn't train at all in stealth until 24. 44 CS gives Rib Seperation which rocks. Also, you could leave envenom at 1, and bump up axe to 44 with AT until 24 and have 0 points left over, and have +7 in gear/Realm Rank, but the 44 axe style isn't incredibly useful (although in recent news they said they were going to change some of the styles that went off of rare events like fumbling, so who knows...). <br><br>With only +5 to envenom, I can get the 3rd snare, and 3rd strength debuff. If I really need some poison damage, all I have to do is ask a guildmate.<br><br>Also, I think they call it soulblade because it embodies the nature of a shadowblade- cold, hard damage. Just my opinion.<br>I hope this has helped someone with creating their own shadowblade.<br> <p><i>"Here is a hand full of warnings..
