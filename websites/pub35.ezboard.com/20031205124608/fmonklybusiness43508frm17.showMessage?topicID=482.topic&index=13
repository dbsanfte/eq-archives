<br>
Please show me how, in similarly equipped situations where monks don't VERY MUCH outdamage warriors?    The simple fact is, you do significantly more damage in about every situation to warriors, and any claim to the contrary is asinine.<br>
<br>
Even IF you had the exact same weapons, which isn't the case in the natural progression of this game (ex. Primal Sword 13/20, fistwraps 15/20), monks STILL have flying kick, which compared to max kick skill (avg kick=28 points, my fuggin level 38 monk has better flying kicks than my 60 warrior with massive AA's kicks for).   Your weaopns skills are higher, AND you are a separate damage table.   You can NOT separate and dismiss these one at a time, because to do so is simply avoiding the aggregate bonus of having these.  Then, at EVERY level of play, dropped monk weapons are better than dropped warrior weapons, period.    <br>
<br>
In almost every parse I've ever seen, non-defensive warriors come out far behind non feigned monks in terms of relative damage output.   Of course, the fact that monks got aggro without having to have a taunt button was evidence enough of monks superior damage generation abilities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=osyris>Osyris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/20/02 3:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=482.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Normal Monk</span><hr size=1> Well the way i informed VI of myAnger was to Send in a number of Feedbacks and then Retired my Monk account Cancled my account..<br>

A parse by itself doesn't tell you much either.<br>
Many warriors attack the front or side of a mob, while most monks attack the rear which means we aren't dodged riposted blocked and more of our damage lands.  If you put the monk in front of the mob and the warrior behind the mob the warrior with the same weapons will outdamage the monk because he is playing smarter.  If you put the warrior in front of the mob and the monk behind it, that exagerates the difference.<br>
The only accurate comparision is a warrior and a monk attacking the same mob from the same side.<br>

You know how things get changed and tweaked and all?<br>
<br>
&quot;Getting aggro is not about doing the most damage, if it was warriors would use their most damaging weapons to hold aggro and smart ones do not.&quot;<br>
<br>
Outside of high end luclin encounters that I've never been involved in, which are in the process of being tweaked right now, high damage 2 hand weapons seem to hold an interesting amount of aggro when compared to their predecessors and the days gone by.<br>
<br>
Some procs and their effects have had their aggro causing properties changed over the past year or so (disease counters being one of them).<br>
<br>
So, while I understand what you're getting at, I think you need to keep in mind that things have changed a bit since Pre-Luclin. Damage IS a key component to maintaining aggro (always has been). And just when we think we have a handle on the game's combat mechanics, they're going to change them again.<br>

Hahahaha, the fact that you can assume that I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to aggro issues makes me chuckle, but what really makes me laugh is the ignorant statement that follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Getting aggro is not about doing the most damage, if it was warriors would use their most damaging weapons to hold aggro and smart ones do not.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In a case of such a statement of epic ignorance, I'm surprised you can figure out how to log onto EQ.  The fact that warriors CAN NOT get DPS based aggro because their DPS is crap is why warriors must rely on lower damage weapons with aggro generating procs in order to maintain aggro, because.....are you sitting down?   They would get outaggroed by everyone if they did.  The fact that warriors cannot keep sustained DPS generated aggro doesn't bolster your claim AT ALL, as a matter of fact, it works directly against it, as warriors' DPS sucks.   If warriors had monklike DPS they could maintain aggro without the need for crutches like &quot;enraging blow&quot;.<br>

Such a statement is nonsensical.  I'm a fanatic for parsing stuff, and for analyzing data, which is why *I* am the referenced source that people use make the claim that &quot;warrior taunt works 8% of the time on level 60 mobs&quot;.... from MY data, which was parsed and posted on several message boards.   I actually PERFORM the data collection on every mob I fight, and analyze it against everyone.   The fact is, non-tanking warriors generally do, aside from bards, the WORST DPS out of every melee on Ssra mobs, this includes Paladins/SK's as well based on weapon selection and availability UNTIL warriors have access to high output 2h weapons, which isn't the case until Emperor/Seru are killed.  <br>

If they're tanking, yes, if not, then they won't be standing in front of the mob, unless they're retarded and have a deathwish.<br>

It's still going to favor the monk, plus, the &quot;same weapons&quot; no longer exist post velious.<br>

<br>
It STILL favors the monk.  For the SAME reasons I stated above, weapons favor monks, damage tabl;e favors monks, and flying kick favors monks.  There is NO offensive aspect which favors warriors whatsoever, whereas there ARE defensive aspects which favor monks, such as every avoidance skill.   Overall, they favor warriors, due to HP, separate mitigation post-nerf, but pre-nerf the ONLY stat in the entire game that favored warriors was hitpoints, this is wrong, and is why the nerf came about, not a SINGLE other aspect of ANY melee besides hitpoints favored warriors, not ONE.   <br>
