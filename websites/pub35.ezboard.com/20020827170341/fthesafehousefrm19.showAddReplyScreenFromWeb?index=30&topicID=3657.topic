There are so many things you are leaving out Tiwgy that are significant differences. First, your 2.5 spec pts mean more than a SB's because they have to spec LA and you don't need to spec DW/CD nearly as high. Infiltrators can be buffed beyond 550AF whereas SB's and NS's cannot except with a realm ability or a charged item. Your weapon choices allow a greater selection of targets than a SB. Your realm abilities are greater than a SBs.<br>
<br>
Kraka is right though. The real crux of the matter is infiltrators should never have been given 2.5 pts to begin with. Unlike many of the infiltrators on this board, I don't believe in nerfing anyone. Since that rules out reducing infiltrators 2.5 specs to something more appropriate, the only equitable solution is to increase all assassins to 2.5.<br>
<br>
You are wrong on Doublefrost btw. I play a 50 zerk from time to time and the damage is still considerably less. I guess you ignored all those posts from Old Mill saying the same thing (he has 47 LA skill). What is it with you infiltrators and Doublefrost? All bummed out because someone has a skill that can kill you? Take a hard look in the mirror and think how those tanks feel when you unleash Dragonfang on them.<br>
<br>
It is OK Tiwgy, I am getting bored with this game anyways. I grow weery of all the Albs trying to tell everyone else how their class should not get this and that. I guess if you cannot win on the battlefield, you win in the Nerf War. No worries, let's see how much fun you have when there is nobody left to fight. Keep up the good work Tiwgy. Really keep it up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/utiwgy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tiwgy </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 7:15:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3657.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Smokin</span><hr size=1> Baym first that is not what Kraka is say at all . You missed the whole point of my post yet again . I'm not saying that right now Infil are not alittle better off then SB . What i'm saying is if you give them everything a Infil has PLUS the stuff SB have that Infil have ,then you are right back where you started from but with SB/NS on top with Infil on the bottom. <br>
<br>
If it would stop this stuff i'm all for give all assassins 2.5 per level , the same weapon sytles and DW. Lets take LA ,the hit points and use of two handed weapons for SBs. The spells away for NS.  and make everyone Infil . <br>
<br>
That from now is my vote how to balacne the assassin classes . Lets make them totally cookie cutter . Would that work for you Baym ?<br>

It use to be a fairly even chance vs and inf or a NS.  I remember going agains evenly conning slashed speced INFS or NS and walking out with just a hair of health (very common).  Now these days I get outdamaged by a thrust inf.  Since pre 1.46 i had nearly teh same outcome  agains infs and NS and now i get royally roled by INFS and am about in the same place with NS as i was before I concluded that INFS are that much better post 1.46 since im using NS as a reference.<br>
<br>
Personly What I find wrong is that a thrust INF outdamages me.  Considering that i have a bonus on him and he has a penelty on me I find it kinda wrong.<br>
<br>
look at my previose post I dont belive that assassins should be cookie cutters but I do agree that they have to be alot closer to each other then they are now in overall effectiveness. <p>----------<BR>

<br>
Well, most are in agreement that Infs are the best game in town as far as all around use is concerned, and many thoughts (and jabs) were exchanged.<br>
<br>
I'm actually ok with being weaker than an Inf, means I have to make up with skill.  I think we'll find that with the Inf being identified as the &quot;1337 00ber&quot; power-gamer's class to play, there will be a huge influx of people who rely on it's inhearent power rather than skill, tactics, and patients (target picking).  The only problem I have is with completely imbalancing things – DragonFang is in this category.  Letting a class that has Evade VII take more than 2 levels of Dodger is also a bit suspect (even though all assassins have it, I can feel for tanks that can’t hit at all).<br>
<br>
Change the DragonFang move to be behind-target based and change the stun effect to heavy attack speed hinder or snare.  Review the Slash moves so that the Amythist/Diamond moves are as-is, but that Diamond doesn’t have +very high to-hit but small or medium bonus instead (it shouldn’t be a guaranteed thing to make a second chain move).  In both Slash and Thrust ensure that there is a 18/39 chain off evade move that gives them a medium to-hit, medium stun (like the LA Comeback -&gt; Frosty).<br>
<br>
I’d normally take offence to the NS piercing medium stun off evade move, but I suspect that NS’s actually use this to run rather than continue tanking... and in all honesty NS’s do need something.  Given that the stun duration will be reduced with resists, I’d say let them keep it (cause they generally won’t be specing 50 Pierce and the move isn’t a high level one).<br>
<br>
Leave SB LA Double Frost in it’s nerfed form, but give the Snowquall (29) and Icy Brilliance (44) more damage (and reduce agro for PvE), these are a back-facing move, so should not effect PvP much.  Leave the pitiful ~+50 HitPoints as-is.<br>
<br>
And finally give NS and SBs 2.3 spec points... a small increase but perhaps enough to raise two or three skills up by a point or one skill up by 2 or 3 by end-game.<br>
<br>
The result of this should be that SBs are slightly more effective in PvE, Slashing Infs will still probably generally beat other assassins, but the change to DragonFang and limiting Dodger to 2 should bring the Thrust Inf back into the world of us mortals.<br>
<br>
As an aside, if we add all these two-bits up, we'd be able to pay another two-bit programmer's wages to fix all this... *cough*  just kidding.<br>

I'm pretty happy with it, not because it does super huge damage (although the damage is good, too bad it eats End like Fat Albert scarfs hot dogs), but because it is an any-time.  In RvR the lag and speed buffs makes it almost impossible to do the three-chain Rav, Atro, Scath, so now it's just DF as backup to Comeback, which is possible in the Chaos that they call RvR.<br>

<br>
<br>
1. balance realms first-pick a path stick to it. either equal opposing classes,which requires cookie cutter approach.  or you balance based on areas of specality.<br>
<br>
2. you can then balance classes based on #1. any attempts at balancng classes without making sure the realms balance out is just an effort in futility,which results only in more problems for mythic to overcome.<br>
<br>
now,people wont like this,because personally i think the best way to balance realms,and avoid the standardized template for all classes across realms,is to specalize. this was/should still be mythics intent. the problem is mythic has failed in that.<br>
<br>
you can talk about balancing the rogue classes among the realms till your blue in the face,but it wont really solve anything,or make this game any better in the long term,unless you figure out how to balance the realms. when you have armsmen who are better then every midgard tank then you have serious issues when trying to say midgard is the meelee realm.<br>
<br>
for me personally i think that shadowblades should be hands down the best meelee rogue in the game,nightshades should be masters of rogue style magic,and infiltrators should be the best all around rogue in the game. i think this pattern should be repeated with all classes in there repsective realms. unfortutnely its far to late to make the kind of drastic changes this would take,so its rather doubtful it will happen.<br>
<br>
as much as you wish to argue against the facts that rogues should be equal,you cant have equality amongst classes,if you cant create equality amongst realms.<br>

<br>
Shadowblades best melee(maybe even take away any chance at high level poisons, except maybe for snare/root poisons only mid-lvl ones at that)<br>
Nightshades best with magic/poison<br>
Infils best defensive give em sheild spec, drop down to 2.2 spec points and give them an additional 10% percent on shield blocks<br>

Just for the sake of knowledge, here is what would happen:<br>
<br>
Stealth 36<br>
Slash 50<br>
Envenom 37<br>
Shield 47<br>
Critical Strike 2<br>
<br>
- Forget the 5 second Creeping Death stun, the Infiltrator can open up with an 8 second stun and immediately drop poisons. If in casual combat, they can open with a shield stun and do the same. During the stun, they can spam the Amethyst/Diamond slash combo for free 1.5 to 2 times, depending on delay. Against a Bladeturn target (mages), the Infiltrator can open with Backstab I then stun.<br>
<br>
- Infiltrators can Engage archer attacks like Scouts can.<br>
<br>
- Infiltrators will have a base of 35% Evade. With shield bonuses and realm points, this Infiltrator will also have approximately 32% blocks with shield. Add in the fact that Shield blocking is 100% DEX based and Evade is 50/50 DEX/QUI, or add a few levels of Dodger, and you have one very very slippery Infiltrator (Those bonuses combined are better than any tank can hope to obtain through near max parry/shield)<br>
<br>

full spec thrust Inf is the best defensive rogue now that evade and stuff actually work.<br>
<br>
For a good while, shadowblades were the best offensive rogue (before the evade fixes and dodger), and had the same defense as infiltrators... but now SB's got hit with a nerf bat, reducing thier damage, while inf got increased defense (shadowblade theoretically did too, but thier offense is probally &lt; Infiltrator offense now). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
