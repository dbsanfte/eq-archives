I'm bored of EQ, and frustrated with the many problems that marr what could be a much better game.  I'll likely pop on once in a blue moon just to say hi to a couple friends, but not for more than another month, since I'm cancelling my account soon.  I think I'll be happier without it all, although there's some peoples I'll miss.  But hey, I'll still lurk here, a bit, for a while.<br>
<br>
So adios.  Quite probably I'll log on before my account is done and give away my stuff or something (on Erollisi Marr).<br>
<br>
Following this is a copy of the letter I sent Verant.  I'm doubting I'll get a useful response, esp. since it's lengthy.  The last thing they can handle is a long, well-written statement; Ozzak's main thread on the Sony Gameplay board is further evidence, and the same goes for many unanswered questions from too many unsatisfied customers.  <br>

<br>
This is very long, as I am very long-winded.  So, I’ll understand if no-one bothers to read it.  But hey, at least I can say I tried to explain what I think needs correcting in EQ, and that I put some thought into it.<br>
<br>
I’ve spent several hours downloading and re-downloading patches in the last couple of days.  Now, finally, after the servers are supposedly up again, I try to get on, and find I’ve got to download yet another patch.  On my 56K connection, it takes a half hour or so, and is half-way done, and then stops, going no further.  I’m sick and tired of this.  This is, I think, the final straw.<br>
<br>
Which is too bad, because EQ does have a lot of great qualities; obviously, that’s why it’s so popular and addictive.  But at some point, especially after the initial glow of its better qualities becomes old and fades away, the glaring problems make this game more trouble than its worth.  The various technical problems are a very significant part of this.  Verant has never properly organized its servers to accommodate the large number of users.  Right now, still, the setup is able to handle off-peak usage properly, but it has never been able (in the four months that I’ve been playing) to handle peak time usage.  Which is such an old and tired problem within the online industry that it’s a cliché, a cliché which is even parodied on TV commercials, about not being the silly little company that makes the mistake of not being able to handle its own business.<br>
<br>
This increases the technical problems of accessing downloads, accessing the horribly bottle-necked login server, getting on to the desired world server, and then staying on and being able to play in a functional matter. <br>
<br>
My typical gameplay is like this:<br>
<br>
1) Run the patch server.  If there’s a patch, it may take as long as two hours or so to download, just because too many people are accessing it at once, I’m guessing.  Lately, I’ve had to re-load the same half-loaded patches again repeatedly, feeling very lucky if I get through one intact.<br>
<br>
2) Get to the login screen, featuring some ridiculously proportioned woman.  This only furthers the notion that the company is indeed run by pubescent boys, but that’s for another rant.  Type in my password, hit Connect.  Half the time I get an error message stating that I can’t get through due to high usage or some such thing.  I hit OK and then Connect again.  OK and Connect again.  OK and Connect again.  Generally after 20-50 times of hitting these buttons in sequence I can get on.  Sometimes though I just can’t get on at all.<br>
<br>
3) I make it to the world server selection screen.  I enter my usual server, Erollisi Marr.  About three-quarters of the time, I manage to get reasonably quickly into my character selection screen.  The remaining times, my screen goes blank and I end up back at the login screen.  From there I should just quit, disconnect, and then start all over, since if I try to just log back in, my chances of making it all the way in at this point are very small.<br>
<br>
4) Hopefully sooner or later I make it into the character selection screen, I hit the character I want and try to enter Norrath.  Again, about three-quarters of the time I succeed, the remaining times I don’t, and get bounced back to the login screen, and I then quit, disconnect, start over.<br>
<br>
5) So after these steps succeed or fail, I eventually get into Norrath; the whole process takes anywhere between five and twenty minutes; I’d say the average is about ten minutes to log on (which seems like a very long time, when you’re staring at a computer screen and just waiting).  If it takes longer than twenty minutes, I generally just quit for a while.  But if I do get on, then I can try and play.  Usually, the first time I successfully get on, I can expect to go LD within ten minutes about one-fifth of the time.  Which means sitting there while my computer very slowwwwly figures out that I’m being disconnected, sometimes taking a full five minutes between starting to go LD and finally showing me a black screen with the words “You have been disconnected” showing.  Which I usually greet with some sarcastic remark that involves profanity.  Quit, disconnect, start all over.<br>
<br>
6) If I don’t go LD, or if I do but get back on well enough, then I will tend to play for a few hours; I used to watch too much TV, now I barely watch any, and play too much EQ.  During a typical three or four hour session of EQ, I can expect to go LD a couple of times, and have laggy periods that last for about a quarter to a half of the time I’m on.  Sometimes, though rare, I’m lagging the entire time I’m playing.  It’s like being ill or something and just trying to forget that you are, and act like nothing’s wrong and try to enjoy yourself anyway.  It’s still rather frustrating though, and has led to many unjust deaths of my characters, botched interactions and trades with other characters, etc.<br>
<br>
After detailing all this, it astounds me that I’ve lasted this long.  I’m glad I’m quitting.  I haven’t even begun to list off all the many gameplay problems I have with EQ.  Ha!  Well fear not, here’s some:<br>
<br>
1) It’s a good game in many respects, but not quite the kind I’d like.  One major problem is that I like the creative side of RPGs, not the powergaming side.  EQ seems to cater to the latter by allowing /auctions and having people do camping and re-doing quests til they're blue, but not much to the former.  Verant has resisted any notions of an RP server, which is too bad.  I know a lot of creative, interesting players would flock to it.  Instead, I’m stuck playing with many people I’d never want to be near in real life.  I’ve met many great and interesting and creative people in EQ, and many more puerile, immature, obnoxious, idiotic, illogical, little boys in EQ (mind you, I've met some young guys who have been truly intelligent and creative).  The fact is, though you can try and use tools like /ignore for the first 20 morons, and just mentally ignore the remainder of them, and try to not let them affect you, it’s just not possible to resist these buggers.  There’s too damn many of them.  In any given gaming session I put up with people who are discourteous (KS-ing, harrassing, not communicating), rude (making stupid and cruel comments against others, as well as making remarks specifically against women, homosexuals, minorities, etc.), lack etiquette (i.e. shouting dumb jokes to the zone, intruding on others attempts at doing something, ninjalooting), and most of all, just don’t plain communicate (in an intelligent manner) as much as they need to when they need to, and seem to live to antagonize others (constantly trying to correct one another, one up one another, insult one's EQ savvy, reprimand someone for a certain price on an auction, etc.).  As I said, there’s lots of good players, and I’ve been happy to meet some of them, but there’s more bad players out there, and they’re very vocal about what makes them bad players.<br>
<br>
2) I made the mistake of having my main character be a rogue.  I wanted to be a rogue because I had RP ideas which the rogue would well suit.  My first character that I played for more than a few minutes was Keeh Fatamorgana, dwarven rogue.  She has her own personality, dialect of speech, interests, backstory, the whole works.  Eventually I realized that rogues are a broken class, and that Verant has zero intention of fixing them.  The common notion for them, to be either some sort of assassin and/or a sneakthief that was good at fiddling with traps and locks, has never been well-employed in EQ.  Poison is a really bad joke, and though it’s been promised to be fixed for a long time, I don’t believe it will make up for much when it is newly re-implemented.  Furthermore, there are no traps, and no locks.  Kunark will supposedly have some locks.  Too little too late, I’m not even going to buy that thing and I shouldn't have to buy it to have a class be workable.  Backstab is a neat idea, but isn’t enough, and a rogue needs to be able to use it repeatedly, and therefore in a group; but if any class should be able to solo, it’s the assassin/rogue.  That was my desire and intention, and of course, I learned that Verant wasn’t going to support this.  Alas.  And here I’ve invested tons of time and energy developing this character.  Oh yes, I’ve read all the posts regarding rogues; your arguments over it being a nearly balanced class are ludicrous, and if you can’t see why, well, nothing I say here will change your mind.  The rogue is a weak warrior with a couple clever abilities, but not enough to call it a rogue.  The cover art on the Kunark box depicts Verant's rogue pretty well - he's the one that resembles the dopey little kid that's trying to slip and fall and bash his head open on some rocks.  He looks like the Wesley Crusher of EQ.  <br>
<br>
3) Kunark.  I understand the need for expansion, but you’ve got to understand that there’s a lot of confusion over why you’re working on an expansion when, a year after release, your product still has lots of bugs that need fixing and aren’t getting attention.  I can’t count how many bugged items I’ve come across - scads of potions that don’t work, trade skill items that are broken, mob warps, program crashing bugs!, ad nauseum.  Example: one of the worst bugs has got to be the East Freeport Boat Bug.  When zoning into E FP on the boat, many users get to crash back to windows.  Then it’s a mad race to try and get back on in time before the boat has re-entered the Ocean of Tears, hoping you can log back on to the boat and jump ship before you’re forced to go on another boring round-trip.  The boat itself is buggy and astoundingly boring, it’s bad enough already.  I once spent two hours riding that boat before I could get off in E FP.  After several petitions, I eventually had a guide tell me to re-install EQ to replace the corrupt E FP file; of course, after doing this, and successfully entering E FP, I then had to face the same problem all over again the next time I tried entering that zone on the boat, since the file gets quickly re-corrupted.  Sure, I’ve /bugged and /feedbacked, and then /laughed about the futility of those actions.  And look how long it took to fix the warping mobs (not all of which are fixed) - how incredibly frustrating a bug that was.  And it took you what, a year or so?  I and a lot of other players have a hard time making sense of Verant’s priorities unless we look at it in terms of pure profit: it’s more profitable to make the expansion and not put so much resources into fixing the problems.  That’s an ugly line or reasoning, but I’m pretty sure that most people out there see it that way; that the problems aren’t worth more than the resources it would take to fix them, especially if we can keep the folks addicted. <br>
<br>
4) What else can I cite as being a very good reason to quit?  Well, the combat itself is actually rather boring.  Hit Auto-Attack.  Hit Backstab.  Wait.  Wait.  Backstab lights back up again.  Hit it.  Scamper after fleeing monster.  I’m out of range somehow.  Keep running, maybe I can catch up to wherever it supposedly is.  Targeting often sucks as well.  Staring right at something and unable to target it, whether it’s actually warped away and I’m lagging or not.  Anyway, the point here is that it gets pretty old pretty quickly.  There seems to be a very small number of different kinds of opponents, they just have different skins and names.  I’ve never used more than rudimentary ideas of strategy as any complex ones have never been very useful in EQ.<br>
<br>
5) The quests are often all the same as well.  Instead of handing in deathfist belts here, I hand in crushbone belts there.  Four bone chips, please, over and over again until you puke.  Am I playing a game, or am I just a part of some weird little virtual machine?  Hard to tell sometimes.  There are some better quests, which have some slight story and/or puzzle elements, and those are good, but most of the quests instead simply involve bringing this to that person or killing a bunch of these things over and over.  Rogue quests are particularly embarrassing.  There are no gnome rogue quests at all, even.  The dwarf rogue quests, the two more interesting higher level ones, produce items that are laughable for someone who is high enough in level to do the said quests.  The Freeport quests are truly creative; one NPC wants you to buy him some ale from upstairs, and three other NPCs want notes delivered to other NPCs in West and North Freeport.  WOW!  Look at all those notes we can deliver!  Sorry, I want to remain polite and civil, but you have to admit, those quests are horribly lame.  My rogue always goes to the warrior guilds to do their quests instead, which is funny, because rogues, as I said, are just warrior wannabes in EQ.<br>
<br>
6) Along the same lines, Events are mind-numbing and non-sensical.  The couple of Mistmoore/Ring of Scale episodes I’ve endured have been just a mess.  Amazingly dull, non-interactive, badly conceived, just a total waste of time, unless you’re the one character that got somehow picked to interact confusedly with the event PCs and receive some clever toy.  Otherwise it’s like watching a really badly done play, one which constantly has the possibility of audience participation, but never really does.  If a play in real life was so poorly done, people would throw things or heckle, and that’s what most people at these events do, heckle and argue during them.  The heckling and arguing is always more interesting to watch than the play, and that’s really weak.<br>
<br>
7) Well, I’m even boring myself now.  I could go on for another ten or twenty numbers, but what’s the point.<br>
<br>
<br>
So you’re probably losing this customer very soon.  I still can’t load the latest patch, and am too unamused to even try.  I’m sure I’ll try sometime soon and give it a go or two in the future to see some virtual friends I’ve made through EQ, but it won’t be long before I quit, unless I’m surprised with some fundamental changes in the game (which I really don’t expect).  It’s too bad, because despite all the problems, obviously there’s a lot to the game, it was a great diversion, which is why so many play, and even I, with all the above problems, have played for so long.  It’s too bad for EQ too, because I have been a very good player.  I roleplay, but I don’t go overboard to seriously annoy non-RP players; I observe etiquette, am very conscientious of courtesy, and enjoy being generous and interacting with others in a friendly and creative way; and, like many people out there, I’m just not an idiot, and frankly, EQ needs all the non-idiots it can get.  But at this point I’m seeing my ditching EQ as being a very good thing that will make my life substantially better.  Instead of being the fun, creative escape it should be, it’s become, old, tiresome, and frustrating.  Bah!  Humbug!  <br>
<br>
Good luck with everything.  You all have difficult jobs, and many customers that are expecting services in an industry that is still very new and unknown.  I’m sure other creative companies will look at your experiences and learn from them, and some interesting competition will arise in the near future.  <br>

I download all the patches in less then 5 minutes, and get on my char in about 3. Zone times range from 15-30 seconds. If you really want to play, try upgrading your computer. No, it won't help all the time, like when the servers are down. But after I upgraded from my P133 with 49 ram and a voodoo2 card to p3 500, 128 ram, and a guillemot 3d prophet, I suddenly wanted to play much more =).<br>

Logging on and actually getting into the game is almost as difficult as it is to find a group once on.  I was able to solo nicely befor level 20 but now at 31 i find it inpossible.  I do not understand what groups have against rogues, when I do get grouped I always get complemented on the ammount of dmg I am capable of and am usually re invited to join but when those members move on then I must restart the whole process of getting into a new group again.  Then because we are so group dependant we are forced into poor groups.  I cant count the times when I joined a group and upon asking &quot;so who is our main tank?&quot; I am told &quot;well you are can u pull something?&quot; Doh!  We are a misunderstood class and I had hoped that at lvl 31 or so people would know our role in a group.  I almost deleted my rogue so many times because of the frustration but I cant help it I just Love playing a rogue despite all the shortcommings.  I hope you dont quit because of the frustration of always getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop but I can relate.  Well I'm off think there is another patch I gotta download haha...Diggins <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showPrevMessage?topicID=206.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showNextMessage?topicID=206.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.emailToFriend?topicID=206.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.threadControl?topicID=206.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=206.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=206.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing>Retirement Wing</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
