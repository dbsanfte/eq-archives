   To go one step further.  To the person that it doesnt effect him.  Lets say his guild is TOV capable maybe it is or isnt.  They in HOT and have close to a total wipeout, only living people are Rage ready cleric but doesnt have the click stick and a couple of FD classes (monk, sk) CR under way Cleric rez's chanter and bard they group up now start to rez other key people, Cleric OOM.  Oh 5 minutes to pit repop the person with the timer afk cause he is dead and going to get that snack beer and bathroom break so unable to infom them to get to the top or pull everyone faster up there.  Bamm spawn pops all people dead.  Necro runs to get coffins everyone gets to run to TOV for a coffin party very long CR ensues possibly some people could loose rez exp.  <br>
<br>
No same scenario Clickly Cleric runs to HOT monk gets all bodys.   Click x40 everyone sitting up top shaking rez effects.  Pop in pit.  You stare and laugh at it knowing once buffs are done you are going to own that dragon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They Made the triggerable version of Faydedar and now that has smoothed over the Druid Moans and Goans. There are still some small issues with that Spawn but only having to wait 4-12 hours for the next trigger is alot easier than to have to wait 5 to 7 days.<br>
<br>
I dont hear too many folks complaining about the Quantity of Druid Epics entering the game, Although the Cleric Epic is alot more useful to Guild Raids and the like, an Epic is an Epic and just as important to the Individual who has achieved it.<br>
<br>
I am a 59 Cleric who has been waiting for Rage, While I feel the Excitement of the possibility of finally getting my Stickk I am also Worried at the Hate that this will cause with my Fellow players as I have never seen one uncontested Ragefire kill since he was moved to Skyfire.<br>
<br>
Please Verant, Make Rage a triggered mob like the Druid Epic or at least fid a way to Avoid player conflict in this encounter. <p>Carnor Vor<br>

What i REALLY detest about certain mobs, is the requirement for camps that exceed 8 consecutive hours...I mean 50+ hours waiting for something to spawn? COME ON...people need to eat/sleep/work for god's sake!<br>

<br>
What I dont understand is why people think continuous camping for rage is required, or a good idea.<br>
<br>
Camping certainly doesn't reserve you the spawn, either in player opinion on any server I know of, or the eyes of the GMs. Unless you have some kind of 24/7 guild, there is no way you will be able to bring up a force at short notice at 6AM local time. <br>
<br>
So it is clearly better to camp Rage in normal play sessions, while doing exp with a guild group in Skyfires, with enough other forces a port away to come and help if it spawns.<br>
<br>
So, cost = high (in terms of lost sleep, relationship disruption, etc), reward = zero. But people still do it. I assume they get some kind of perverted masochistic pleasure from camping that long. It certainly gives them something to whine about, which reward enough for some.<br>

If you're in a raid-capable-guild, the call will come for you to help kill this spawn at some point, and this will affect you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me repeat again for those that didn't hear me.<br>
<br>
THIS DOES NOT AFFECT ME.<br>
<br>
My God people, it's like LOIO for the higher levels. Yeah I may be here someday to help some cleric work on his epic. True.<br>
<br>
Here is the additional truth that you silly gits just don't seem to understand. If you all act like bungholes, I'll leave. There's plenty to hunt in the next zone. My time in game is more precious for entertainment than for standing around trash talking another guild. Why? Why the hell would I do that? It is absolutely pointless.<br>
<br>
If you need my blade to kill some monster fine. I'm your rogue. I've got your back to the end. If you think I'm going to stand around some foolish pissing match while Guild A gets thier panties in a bunch because Guild B apparently has their fingers in Guild A's honeypot, you've got another think coming.<br>
<br>
THIS DOES NOT AFFECT ME.<br>
<br>
This is why I avoid LOIO and other @#%$ zones. People who can't play nice and be civilized are not the people I want to play with. If someone killsteals, I don't waste the GMs time with a petition, I move to other hunting zones and come back later. Ragefire will respawn.<br>
<br>
Don't make assumptions and make blanket statements that goofy crap like this matters to everyone. Because it does not. Not all of us care, not all of us will ever be at Ragefire, most of us our rogues for that matter. We can't get the cleric epic.<br>
<br>
So pull the panties out of your crack and go play the game. There is lots of other things to do!<br>
<br>

It's fitting punishment in my mind.  (Although I don't know why its easier than just poofing the items).<br>
<br>
GMs do make mistakes though, but I have no idea if this is one of those time, since I really only have your explanation of what happened. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwoodyhearn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woody Hearn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GU Comic Artist (and gnome punter)</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 12:58:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23352.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gucomics.keenspace.com/images/dfc_me.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: worth it?</span><hr size=1> I thank this very thread for being the inspiration for today's strip.<br>

As a cleric that just finished Ragefire, there are many ways to improve this camp, but I do like the idea of a rooted mob.  That would probably help a lot. <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18050">Aalavar Naeramarth</a> -- 57 Dark Elf Necromancer

But as I said, they didn't have 10 people trying to kill Ragefire, they had 1 bard keeping him charmed while they got more people in the zone, and try to keep him from being killed by the group of 30 who was there.   That's the difference. <p><center><a href=http://www.geocities.com/eqgrubs>The Grubs: Biting the Balls of Norrath</a><br>Portly Bugger: 60 High Priest<br>Xique Buggergrub: 54 Enchanter<br>Dustmyte Bedbugger: 43 Warrior</center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uportly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Portly</A> at: 4/20/02 1:55:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubarrandaam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BarrandAam</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.midsouth.rr.com/yamahaman/lostboy/ff8gifs/Squall.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/20/02 3:18:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23352.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.health-tracker.com/pics/barr_new.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: worth it?</span><hr size=1> So you never had aggro on a mob, dispelled a mob currently 'engaged' by another player/group/guild, and you are amazed that someone says 'thats wrong'.  Would it have been different in your eyes if the bard had been using rage to kill other mobs? <br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is your guild was at fault and the gm realized this and did something about it. If the gm spent '5 minutes' talking to your cleric and the questions and answers were anywhere near the following:<br>
<br>
Dif the other guild have control of the mob?<br>
-yes<br>
<br>
Was the mob dispelled by you or a member of your guild/party<br>
-yes<br>
<br>
Following this, did you kill the mob<br>
-yes<br>
<br>
<br>
Then thats all the gm needed to prove your guild did not follow regulations on a mob, and had to suffer whatever consequences are deemed adequate.
