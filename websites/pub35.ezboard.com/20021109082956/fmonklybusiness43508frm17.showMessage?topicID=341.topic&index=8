<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
1 - High lvl soloability has only been marginally affected. Those with high end game equiptment have not really been effected much at all. For example on a 10 FG shroom run where I was running almost full health b4 the patch, with no down time and simply constantly pulling as 1 died, it seems to be about the same now. No down time ending 94-100% health at the end of the runs.<br>
<br>
On the other hand a monk lvl 60 with 100+aa not in high-end equiptment fighitng next to me had a very hard time soling single shrooms that he normally was able to, ending at 50% health.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
2 - High lvl raid situations. Spending the night in Vex Thal fighting I did notice that mitigation was lower and while b4 the nerf I would have no problem tanking until the warrior's taunt pulled it off me, tonight I tended to FD earlier and then get back up. We didnt have a healer in our group the whole night and even with 1500 AEs I didnt die once, while almost always getting agro at least once during each fight. I also tanked a few times when we had more then a few non-mezzables come in. If I had had a healer in our group I prolly wouldnt have FD'd at all during the fighting, except on the named NPCs (where it's simply bad to agro, for the guilds sake) <br>
<br>
I was in a fighting group and not the pull group tonight. Our pullers didnt die any more then normal, although it WAS obvious that tactics were adjusted to make up for the mitigation decrease. More tags were made vs single monk pulling.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In conclusion ... Mitigation has been adjusted down and it's obvious in all content. The mid-level and non-uber guild monks have been hit, by FAR the hardest on this latest patch. As I mentioned b4 no high end content guild purposely uses monks to tank, and as such not much has changed in the high end content for monks, other then you may end up FDing a lil more then normal. The real issues come with the mid-lvl monks who may have created the character with the thought as a soling class now being unable to to so anymore. It would be like creating a Mage or Necro, because you liked the ability to solo, and then having thier soloability removed.<br>
<br>
For the game's long term viability, an adjustment was needed to align some of the mitigation issues to better fit the &quot;big picture&quot; of melee class balancing. Although I dont like the more dramatic effect that it has had on the mid-level and non-uber guild monk community, I do think it may allow for a better game in the long run. <br>
<br>
I sort of felt like my old self .. sneaking in doing some major damage, then when I got to agro .. FDing off a bit or deciding to take some heat b4 backing out (FD) and then stepping back up to the plate .. felt a lil more RP tonight then I have in a while 8-) <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45917" TARGET=_blank> <IMG SRC="http://members.cox.net/gstg/ironsig.gif" BORDER=0> </A>

(Athough sometimes the shrooms would get lucky, and I would have to rest).<br>
<br>
I tried a Shik'nar. The results were a bit different. Pre Patch I could solo these about 70% of the time. After the patch, I only managed to solo 1 out of 5 attempts. However it was still close, and it doesnt bother me too much. Just means I need a buff or two.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly the main raid targets on our server didnt spawn before we went to bed, so I can't comment on our pulling abilities yet.<br>
<br>
PS. Anyone else remember the value for Block before. 225 now, Im sure it was 230 cap before. Pitty verant had to nerf our avoidance abilites as well as our mitigation. <p>Sensei Corasik Thule<br>

What seemed to be change I take alittle &quot;higher&quot; hits but Avoid alot more. But have alot of data to compare with just not the time untill the weekend. Have 100mb of logs before the change of simular SSRA fights. <br>
Now im just collecting alot of data after the change.<br>

But at first glance I didnt see any diffrence in total damage taken, or its to small diffrence to see with the bare eye...<br>

I do notice more max hits but it didn't seem that they were missing more often either. This nerf is pretty much what I expected, a noticeable change but no more than that. The uber monks will still be able to solo farm AAs easily, but they might have to actually use mend more often now. I will try a night of doing melee type mobs (sebilis) and see how much I need to mend. Before patch, I didn't have to every 6 mins because of high regen, tap weapon, and lots of min hits.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that VI knows we weren't tanking bosses or otherwise taking warrior's places in groups. All this nerf does is make us who we should have been at the start of EQ. Yes, our mitigation was a mistake from day one, believe it or not, so really this isn't a nerf, rather a fix. It can't be a nerf when it was never intended. Of course, I'm very disappointed that VI waited 3 years to do this change, but then, we did get a free perma ministonestance for 3 years, too. VI knew all along(I guess their turnover didn't help), they just needed an excuse to nerf it and what better excuse than PoP, the expansion for ubers. <br>
<br>
I don't feel that this nerf outright disabled anything that a monk could do before, whatever that might be. If it has, then a few more gear upgrades will put you where you were. We're still among the best soloers in melee. I say "among" because uber rangers solo very well too. With high dmg shield(spells + clicks), regen/FT15 items for no down time healing (just like our mend) and archery to do 1-2k to mob just on the pull, plus slow proc on epic.. they can do seb actually better than a monk, especially now. With FT being usable to a ranger, it compounds their solo power even more. They are the only double attack/dual wield class that uses both regen and FT, and they have arrows that do nukish dmg on top of it.<br>
<br>
When I first made my monk, I wanted to do dmg. I had no idea I was going to be a tank too. My idea of a monk was from TorilMUD where they had a cap of half the AC warriors could get (they got crunched bad) but man, they could hit 8+ times a round and hard like a truck. All I wanted is to be a "hitter" class, but I ended up with so much more... for those who had higher expectations at creation, stick with it, as long as your gear sucks, there is that much more power to gain still. There's a lot more about power than AC and hps, clickies/effects are huge. <p><br>Grandmaster Denzalo - <a href=http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Denzalo>Profile</a><br>Guild <a href=http://www.afterlifeguild.org>Afterlife</a> of Mithaniel Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usenseiyammi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sensei Yammi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~xypher00/mai-robe.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 1:54:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well</span><hr size=1> Question to FoH, I was just wondering, are ya happy that ya @#$@# off thousands of monks just cause you couldnt deal as much dmg as monks ? just curious <p><img src=http://www.geocities.com/senseiyammi/raster.gif><br>
