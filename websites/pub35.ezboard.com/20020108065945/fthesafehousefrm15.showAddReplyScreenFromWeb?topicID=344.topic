I’ve played EQ on Rallos Zek since release.  I was there when no matter how you died, anyone could loot your corpse.  I was there for the now legendary gnome-elf war, and I was there for the raging battles between good and evil in Freeport and Qeynos.  I stuck around through the following years, playing a part in some interesting dynamic quests, getting pkilled and occasionally pkilling, and I watched as a guild fell apart due to a few dedicated pk’ers targeting us exclusively.  Shortly after that I left the game.  I just couldn’t keep giving money to a company that so steadfastly refuses to look into why pvp is so unviable as a fun way of playing the game, despite the fact that it has 4 servers full of people willing to play the flawed version of pvp, and despite the fact that the raging success of the team’s servers openings indicates that there is an even larger fan base willing to play a balanced (or at least fun) version of pvp.<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago I decided to come back to the game.  I had left a lot undone that I wanted to do, and I just missed playing the game and seeing my friends.  But now that I’m back, I’m not going to be silent anymore about the horrid state of pvp in Eq.  And so, this letter.<br>
<br>
I want to address what I see as the major deficiencies that prevent EQ from having a fun pvp system, and to suggest some remedies.  What I hope is that Verant will respond with an outline of what their plans are to make pvp more fun, and to address my propositions.<br>
<br>
CLASS BALANCE IN PVP<br>
Look, I understand that we can’t do much about this now.  This is a PvE game, and there will be no real changes to the classes.  BUT I still can’t talk about this without mentioning that this game is woeful in regards to pvp balance.  Now the traditional response is that grouping would solve this, and that may be so, in part, but there are still classes who get DD spells that inflict more damage than characters in another class would have as hit points in one to two casts!  Also, some classes have no way to escape from attack, and thus no way to save themselves, and in return for this loss of ability, they are given nothing in return.  A paladin who can’t gate, and can’t shadowstep/sow is a dead paladin if attacked by a caster.  Finally, pet classes are just so far out of balance that it is sick, and necromancers…well, shouldn’t have to say anything about them really.<br>
<br>
Still, nothing can really be done about class balance, at this point, in terms of dramatic changes, BUT there are a few ways to address the issues I’ve outlined above.  First, disproportionate damage outlays ratio.  You took a good step by implementing the pvp DD nerf, but more needs to be done.  Particularly, caster classes with fewer hp’s need better resistances to other caster class nukes and dots.  One shammy dot or one to two wizzy nukes can kill a mage or druid.  You have enough time to notice that you’ve been hit, stand up, hit a hotkey for a spell and die.  SO, I would advise you to look into rebalancing how offensive spells in pvp affect each class based on that classes unique features.  OR you could simplify it a bit by setting the max damage for each spell to be a percentage of HP’s of whatever target cast at.  Thus, Ice comet, which at 1120 damage would insta kill an unbuffed lvl 50 druid, could be set to take off at max 50% of a lvl 50 druid’s hp, with possibilities for resistances thrown in, and say 60% of a warriors hp, since warriors have higher hp’s and higher resists to help mitigate this damage.  I’m not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it is the only way I can see to balance a game where a few classes who can deal large amounts of damage from long distances can be kept in check relative to classes with either small amounts of hit points or no ability to traverse long distances quickly.<br>
<br>
Melee binding<br>
I know that you’ve said no to this a hundred times, despite the fact that 100% of your player base supports the idea, and despite the fact that the game would be more fun with it included.  You have your own ideas about why to keep this out, and we, respectfully, disagree about them.  BUT I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that every time a melee class is pkilled they are transported back to their bind point, and have to journey back to their corpse.  The risk v reward argument that you use to shut down melee binding pleas on blue servers, doesn’t apply to this case, because a group could be as careful as possible to keep the tank alive, and still have to suffer through the down time of waiting for the warrior to get back because they lost them to a wandering wizzie pk.<br>
<br>
Secondly, because most melee classes lack any kind of travel enhancement (sow, gate, etc), they almost never are able to re-engage the person who killed them.  Since it takes them so long to return to their body, the caster who killed them is long gone.  Also, if they were to catch up to said caster, the caster could gate or sow their way away.  If melee’s could bind, or had more places to bind in, these difficulties would reduce.<br>
<br>
Guard Pathing and Cities.<br>
IF it is an exploit for a group of players to use a mob’s pathing and the structural limits of a zone to engage in combat with said mob without fear of being attacked, then it is an exploit to utilize terrain and mob pathing issues to attack players who are sitting beside guards when the intent is to use the guard’s limited aggro radius and the silly issue of aggro (why does a guard aggro when a spell is cast, but not when one lands?  What sense does it make for me to get nuked beside the guard, and he’s fine with it, but if I cast back when I’m standing near him, he’ll attack?) to attack a player without any fear of repercussions.  For instance, say I’m in the bank in kelethin.  A wizzie comes up, targets me, and runs outside of the guard and banker’s aggro range.  Next, he nukes me.  Now I have two options, I can return fire (assuming I have him targeted) and then get attacked by the guard, or I can run for it.  Given the lag inside the bank, the need to click open the door, etc, running will get me killed, casting back will get me killed and cost me exp.  SO I bag, and die.  This is an exploit, and has been a known problem for years, and you’ve never done anything to address it.  And don’t get me started on the whole pet issue.<br>
<br>
Solutions: 1) increase guard aggro radius so that it is at least as long as a caster’s spell range, <br>
<br>
2) make guards aggro when someone near them is hit by a spell, arrow, or pet (This just makes too much sense for it to be implemented, I’m sure).  <br>
<br>
3) Turn off pvp within certain areas of zones, such as near banks, merchants, guilds (just an idea, not one I support, though it bears mentioning and is better than the current state of affairs), <br>
<br>
4) put faction hits for pvp back in, but do so with a) an aggressor flag so that defending oneself is possible, b) make faction hits dependent on who is being attacked so that the amount of faction lost is directly proportional to the amount that the character is liked by its home town (so that attacking a gnome necro wouldn’t cause too much faction loss by a good gnome warrior if the warrior wins, but attacking a high elf paladin who is lovingly looked upon by high elves would cause his attacker to be hated by elves), c) make faction hits zone dependent, not just race dependent.  So if you start a fight in gfay, you run the risk of taking a faction hit against elves, even if you are attacking a dwarf.  d) tie c) to b) so that you could still attack a dark elf in gfay without fear of taking a faction hit against elves, unless that dark elf was for some reason liked by the wood elves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Risk Vs Reward<br>
<br>
The big one, the big cahuna, the largest single issue on pvp servers.  The most ignored issue by Verant, the one you’ve never addressed, the answer we’ve never gotten, the solutions you’ve refused to implement.  Currently, there is no risk to pk’ing, and nothing but rewards from doing it.  I’m not talking about roleplayed pvp, where the roleplay is in and of itself (for me at least) worth the risk.  The best pvp I’ve ever engaged it was between me (playing a lvl 30 WE Ranger), a horde of little lvl 10-20 Elves, and about 3 lvl 25-35 Dark Elves in Crushbone.  The DE’s had taken up residence in the castle, and proceeded to attack me whenever possible.  I died, and kept dying, until I’d rallied the entire zone to come and heal me.  Minor healing spells were being cast all around me, lvl 10 rangers feeling like clerics, a few pallies dropped LH on me, and like 10 people were binding my wounds when I got low, and I managed to take out two of the DE’s.  In total I died about 5 times to them, got them just the two times, they looted my bread, my wine, and a BS mantle, and I got a leather mask and a pair of Splitpaw gloves (the old +2 dex ones).  The other times I died, they didn’t loot anything.  Thing is, I played this encounter in full gear because they sent me a tell saying they’d go easy on the loot, and that they just wanted to have fun, which we did.  After the battle, the SK and I played snare-darkness racing around the moat.  He won, cause he resisted the initial snare…<br>
<br>
Point is, that kind of pvp is rare.  Most often what you encounter is the lone naked caster with two good +INT items in their hands and one in the range slot running around zone lines looking to gank people, or hanging out outside of aggro range in a city like kelethin.  And what happens when they kill someone?  They loot and bag a valuable item, then they /auc it, and run around, free from any reprisals because they know that even if you kill them, you can’t loot back your item, and you can’t take anything from them.  There is no risk in their behavior.  Even reputation doesn’t bother them, because it isn’t worth anyone’s effort to try and kill them—they just respawn again and go off to get more loot.  And if they want to go on a raid, or group a bit, they logg in an alternate character and go and do that without anyone in the group being wiser.  Consistent with your actions in other matters in the game, when one aspect of the risk versus reward balance is thrown off, you must do something to repair the imbalance.  My suggestions follow:<br>
<br>
1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Implement a working faction system.  I gave some suggestions about faction above, so I won’t repeat them now.  Though I will say that this would not do enough alone to balance the risk v/s reward alone.  However, I would prefer it to nothing, and I do think that in a game so dependent on faction in terms of pve, it would make sense to have a functional pvp faction system in place.<br>
2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Coin only loot.  It bears mention that a large number of pvp players support coin only loot.  They feel that this would allow for freer and more frequent pvp encounters, greater ability to roleplay, less of a dependence on no-drop items, ability to compete with full-equipment and thus to compete on a more level playing field.  There would be other benefits to this change as well, and despite the vocal support of most players on Rallos Zek, and despite the runaway success that the change has had on the other Zek server, Verant keeps refusing to think deeply about this.  This one change alone would repair the whole darn issue.  You’ve created a game where characters are dependent on gear to compete and then allowed a loophole that risks destroying an entire server to stand.  This loophole both allows certain classes to compete without gear, as it forces other classes to be unable to compete for fear of loosing gear, which is needed to compete.  Make it coin only please.<br>
3)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Time limited item loot.  This is a nice idea about how to deal with loot rights.  Essentially, this is similar to coin only loot, except that once every two weeks you can be looted for one item.  I’m not wedded to the time frame, I could even see it being as little as one week, or as much as one month.  Point though is that you’ll get the time needed to re-equip yourself before you have to risk loosing another item.  Lets say you’re a lvl 50 druid wearing a shroud of nature, and you get pkilled.  They loot the shroud, and you head off to camp Droga.  15 hours later you have another shroud, but now you can pvp without fear of loosing that shroud for a few more days.  This would still allow the risk of item loss, but wouldn’t make it crippling, as it is now when you loose more than anyone could replace to pk’s.<br>
4)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No Drop pvp.  Make all items looted from other players no-drop, and make it impossible to loot items that you cannot wear.  This way we avoid having wizzie outfit his twink warrior in lvl 50 gear that he gets from pk’ing lvl 50 warriors.  I’m not so sure I like this, but it’s an improvement over the current system<br>
5)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lootable Containers.  Let us open containers when we kill someone in pvp, this way there would be no bagging, and we would have a chance of getting back an item that was taken to us.  This is not a very good idea, since it would still allow people to loot and bank items.  Perhaps there would be a way to make it so that items taken via pvp would be unable to be banked for a certain amount of time.  Combine that with lootable containers and the only way to keep an item pvp looted would be to camp out directly afterwards.<br>
6)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Experience Loss.  The one no brainer that probably won’t ever be allowed.  At first blush this might seem like a bad idea, one that would give pk’s an even greater weapon with which to inflict damage.  And it might be that after all, but it would at least allow some real way to punish a pk for their actions.  I’d like to see what would happen if someone pk’d a member of my guild if we could cause them exp loss.  We’d put them right back down four levels before the night was over.  I think that this would allow for a more equal risk than the current system, but it might be too much risk for the general player base to bear.  If so, then Verant still needs to address the imbalance in the risk v reward.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that three things could be done to “fix” pvp in Everquest.  First, you must do something about the imbalance between the classes, and, no, making debuffs more powerful is the wrong way to go.  I think that taking a serious look at how a pvp rule-set for the spells functions in a pvp environment would be the first thing I’d do.  That way you could discover just how unbalanced spells that were designed for use against 6000+ hp mobs function in an environment where most characters have at the most 2000hp.  I don’t expect major revisions out of this review, but if you were serious about pvp balance, you should begin here.<br>
<br>
Granted, that the game is too late in its lifecycle to dramatically change pvp (unless you are, as I suspect, hoping to take a few more years out of the ol’ hoss) class balance.  Thus, I feel that you MUST do something to change the OUTRAGEOUS imbalance between risk and reward.  I think that you should implement melee binding.  I feel that you should do something to address guard pathing exploitation issues.  I think that you should implement a working faction system (see the one outlined above for an example of one that might work a bit better than the ill fated one tried a few years back).  I think, furthermore, that the single most critical change you should make is to either make all pvp coin only, or to allow for exp loss upon pvp deaths.  If you do not wish to make changes as dramatic as that, then I heartily recommend that you implement a time limited item loot as described above, so that pvp players do not have to constantly risk all of their best and most necessary items while the pk’s of the world risk nothing and gain everything.<br>

<br>
1) You use an unbuffed level 50 druid.  Why would a level 50 druid be unbuffed?  Pumice?  Chain debuff?  This druid would not typically be encountered without say, an enchanter starting the attack.  A druid can obviously buff himself up with SLN, magic, fire, and cold resist for starters.  Why isn't this protection enough?  And every caster class can gate--DD damage spells without knockback won't interrupt a caster.  Who are you thinking of here, rogues?<br>

2) Melee binding.  The issue is--will anyone play casters if melees could bind themselves?  The answer--there's a lot less incentive.  Melees are more fun.  Melees are now more powerful in P v E due to the fact weapons and equipment have been dramatically pumped in power whereas spells have not.  They are probably more powerful in P v P now, at least on coin loot servers.  Melees do not spend 80% of the game pre 35 looking at a book.  If melees could bind, casters should be able to med without a book and without sitting.  As for transportation, melees can now purchase sow potions and Traveller boots.  <br>
<br>
3) Item loot issues.  You play on Rallos, you missed the chance to transfer characters to a coin-loot team server.  True, somethings need to be thought of, such as protecting some items, but even melees have their days on Rallos. <br>
<br>
4) Faction system and exp loss.  Addressed on Sullon Zek.<br>

Period.  Especially on a pvp server.<br>
<br>
I enter West Freeport, as a rogue, during peak hours looking for a bind.  <br>
<br>
Blue server:  If I'm on a blue server I can find one in under five minutes every single time.  Never had a problem.<br>
<br>
Vallon Zek "Lighty team":  There's a good chance I'll find one within 15 minutes.  But take away the evil team (dark elves, trolls, ogres and iksar).  Also take into account that Freeport is a battle zone, usually occupied by folks under lvl 12.  EC is mainly evil so I can't step over the zone and yell for a bind.  There's a good chance it will take me 1/2 hour or so to get that bind.<br>
<br>
Vallon Zek "Pure team":  Verant has finally admitted that the server was meant to be played this way.  So let's look at my bind chances now.  Take out the evil team as well as all the elves, half-elves, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes.  Also remove all the human team players who won't bind you because you play in a pure team guild (I've been turned down for binds by more barbarians than I care to count...and Morvran is a barbarian).  It usually will take me at LEAST 20 mintues to find a bind.  I've also spent over an hour looking and come up empty.<br>
<br>
For all those categories add in the fact that you're constantly in danger of being attacked.  So as a pure team barbarian, not only can I not be bound by the other teams, but I'm also in danger of being attacked and killed by them.<br>
<br>
Move that scenerio to a more out of the way place, like Velious, and it's even harder to find a bind.<br>
<br>
Now you ask, "who's gonna want to play a caster if melees can bind?"  Um....people who like to play casters.  You really think people play casters just because they can bind?  And I'm talking about only the ability to bind (like with a bind stone) in cities.  Not anywhere they choose like casters can.<br>
<br>
"Melees are more fun" is so subjective.  Melee characters are only more fun for people who like playing melee characters.   And sure we've recieved some nice weapon upgrades, but you know what?  You land ONE snare on me and I'll probably die.  With the resist debuff upgrade I've gotta have some major resist gear, but in reality most of us don't have the funds or the means to get that stuff.<br>
<br>
You look at a spellbook.  That differs little from me looking at a tree while I rest.  You're a caster anyway, you're supposed to be memorizing your spells har har.<br>

I'm talking about pvp.  If you can actually say there isn't something wrong with that bind system then I invite you to play Morvran for a night.  You'll change your mind.<br>
<br>
Listen, no one pays for binds anymore (like they used to back in the day), so binding a melee is a nuisance for both caster and melee these days.  If you're already in a group you've gotta disband to join the binder (or bindee).  You may have to mem the spell, or get some mana.  Lower level people may fizzle a bunch of times as well and have to med again.  It's a pain in the butt for everyone involved.<br>
<br>
Then consider play time.  I REALLY don't have an hour to waste trying to find a bind.  I usually don't have 20 minutes to waste finding a bind.  And I shouldn't have to.  A caster can bind pretty much anywhere they want at any time.  A melee should be able to easily bind in a city.<br>
<br>
Back to pvp:  My main gripe is that on a blue server, once you've made it to your destination city you're safe...you just need to find that bind.  But on a pvp server, you're never safe until you find that bind.  Couple 20 minutes to an hour to find a bind with some ass, 8 levels above you, ganking you before you get that bind and now you're spending another 1/2 hour to an hour running back on a CR.  And now that corpse-camping is legal?  My @#%$ can you see the problem??<br>

Are there less casters?  Not at all. The class selection appears to be leaning towards more casters (at least in Beta).<br>

<br>
I think Sony made it that way on purpose for several reasons.<br>
<br>
On the one hand it certainly encourages grouping.  All the melees in my regular group never have problems getting a bind - I bind them.  Maybe those who are 'looking for a bind' should talk to thier caster friends about helping them out.  There is bound to be someone that will help you - unless you're just a loner by nature...which means you made your bed and you should lay in it rather than changing the rules for everyone else who can deal with it.<br>
<br>
On PvP servers this definitely limits bind rushing.  On a PvP server when I die from PvP combat, I arrive at my bind point without mana.  A melee on the other hand arrives naked - but fully capable in terms of running to his body looting back up and being at 100% at that point.  I have been bind rushed by melees before and it is not fun - as I watch my mana drain away and they keep coming and dieing.  Eventually they win because I run  oom.  Reverse the roles - there is no way a caster can effectively bind rush a prepared melee.<br>

<br>
How does it encourage grouping?  When is the last time you went off and fought alongside the random stranger you were just bound by?  Oh wait, you're a caster, ...when's the last time you went off and hunted alongside that random, winy, melee who begged you for a bind?<br>
<br>
Caster friends are nice to have, but there are many times you have to run an errand on your own, and you shouldn't have to drag along a caster just so you can safely bind in a city.<br>
<br>
"unless you're just a loner by nature...which means you made your bed and you should lay in it rather than changing the rules for everyone else who can deal with it."  --First, if I'm a loner by nature than I can't help it.  Second, binding has nothing to do with making friends.  It keeps you, as a melee, from adventuring and it interrupts whatever the binder was doing.  Third, explain to me how changing those rules would adversely affect the pvp game?   As far as I can tell the only people complaining would be casters...but what would they lose?<br>
<br>
To your second point about bind rushing:  This does NOTHING to diminish bind rushing.  Nothing at all!!  Think about it, if you're in a city like Highpass and you kill a melee who's bound there, then he can still bindrush if he chooses.  Regardless of whether he could bind himself or was bound by a caster he can still bind there.  Allowing melees to get binds from npcs wouldn't change that situation ONE BIT.<br>
<br>
But if you kill that melee out in the middle of South Karana then he'd have to run from a bindable city, just like he always has.  We're not talking about the ability for melees to bind anywhere they want, just for them to bind themselves in the places they can currently be bound.<br>
