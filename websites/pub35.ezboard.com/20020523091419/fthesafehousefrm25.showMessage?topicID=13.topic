It allows for any setup but is still really detailed.  The only problem is, no one i know around here(richmond VA) plays it.  My friends from high school play, but they're two hours away and i cant make the drive enough to play consistent campaigns.  The local shop mostly plays Vampire: The Masquerade and D&amp;D 3rd edition.  I find both of those games too limiting.  It may just be the DM's, but I need a wide open system to play in.  Anyway, I encourage everyone to take a look at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/">gurps</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->and give it a try. <p><Center><img src=http://injijo.homestead.com/files/kitten.jpg>

Meaning that I would never pick it, but don't mind it.  Character creation can get down right insane (without the GCA) if you are allowed to use a fair number of books.  The afore mentioned stat problem is also true.  Dex and Int are linked to skills in such a way that it is often highly adventagous to have a very stat heavy character that is by large unskilled than to have a relatively average character with lots of skill.  The points just don't work to your favor for skills.  Also *most* GM's I have played under cannot get into there heads what an average person is, and what a good roll is.  I end up in games that you practically have to have a crit success to actually suceed, granted this is not a fault of the system, but a fault that the system seems to have on GM's.<br>
   For the record, my favorite systems are D&amp;D 2nd Ed, west end Star Wars, and 7th Sea.   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29902" border=0><img src="http://shadowshifters.iwarp.com/images/Sjarin_safe.jpg" border=0></a><br><br><i>'Do we have anything even resembling a plan??' - 13th Warrior</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukintire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kintire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/02 9:13:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lot's of D&amp;Ders, but does anyone play GURPS</span><hr size=1> I've played a good deal of gurps. Not a bad system, but has its flaws. IQ is far far too important, Dex is far too important.<br>
Also, it is a little prone to powergaming.<br>
<br>
I do prefer the design system to random generation though, which is a wargaming legacy that needs to die now. Its the main main flaw of 3rd edition... that and the class system.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uinjijo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>injijo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://injijo.homestead.com/files/10x10.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/02 1:12:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lot's of D&amp;Ders, but does anyone play GURPS</span><hr size=1> Most of the problems with GURPS come with bad GMs.   It's easier to GM a lot of other systems because they aren't so open ended.  A lot of GM's end up giving out too many points and the players become to powerful, a lot of gm's let players start with too many points.  It's true it is better to buy a really high Dex or Int then to buy several skills, but it's easy to fix that.  I usually put a cap on the amount of points that a player can put into those two attributes and I disallow or alter defaults on a lot of skills.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utelurinon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telurinon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/02 2:06:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/fun/muffinmansmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lot's of D&amp;Ders, but does anyone play GURPS</span><hr size=1> The biggest problem I had with GURPS is that it is very difficult to make a decent Mage with the base 100 starting points...unless you go for one of the cliched powergaming routes.

You could have like a 12 int and a 12str  abd 3 levels of magical aptitute and still have like 20-45 points to spend on spells.  Which could be like 15-30 spells at IQ level or higher. Unless you are talking about the mage: the ascension gurps translation, then I agree, but i think they are recommened to be 200-300 point characters.<br>
However the basic book only has about 40 or so starting spells,  So we created levelbased spells.  The spell in the book is level 1.  But for 2x the point cost and ^2 the mana cost you could get the output of the spell times two.  And you can have a multiplier up to the level of magical aptitude you have.  So you could buy up to Lighting 3 if you had magical aptitude 3.  That would also do 3 times the damage of lighting 1, but it would also take 3 times the mana to cast it.    We also bought the grimore book for extra spells. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utelurinon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telurinon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/02 4:56:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/fun/muffinmansmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lot's of D&amp;Ders, but does anyone play GURPS</span><hr size=1> By decent mage, I mean one capable of casting a couple decent level buffs, an attack spell or two in combat and not having to burn out 3 power stones to do it.<br>

Since the range to the target is 5, you have a -4 to skill to cast it, giving you a 50% chance of success.  Once cast, it is resisted by Will.  Odds are in your favor here, but sill not 100%.  If you are a pretty standard mage, you probably have a Str of 9 to 12.  5 points of Fatigue is a huge chunk of your casting ability taken up with a single spell.<br>
<br>
The only reasonable way to make a reasonable Mage is with the bonus Fatigue advantage, but that is kind of cheesy.  another thing you can do is set your game world in a high or very high mana zone so power stones recharge more quickly, but that has other drawbacks as well. <p><SELECT NAME="D1">

<br>
That said, it is perfectly true that mages burn out terrifyingly quickly. You just have to have high skills for the fatigue breaks... which cuts down the number you can have of course. Also, the magic system is very mechanistic and flavourless, or at last I find it so. The Gurps Voodoo magic system is much better... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utelurinon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telurinon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/19/02 2:56:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/fun/muffinmansmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lot's of D&amp;Ders, but does anyone play GURPS</span><hr size=1> I really like the GURPS Vooodoo book.

<br>
Our group took to using the rules for quicker combat from the GURPS Supers book.  Essentially, if I recall correctly, instead of parry being rolled seperately, it was folded into the to hit roll as a sort of average.  It really helped reduce combat length, although you do lose an element of the tactical game.<br>
<br>
It's a trade off.  You'd have to try it and decide for yourselves whether it would benefit your group. <p><SELECT NAME="D1">

Still you alway manage to have the 15 IQ, edietic memory lvl 2 I put 4 point into a skill to have it to 20 type of player.<br>
