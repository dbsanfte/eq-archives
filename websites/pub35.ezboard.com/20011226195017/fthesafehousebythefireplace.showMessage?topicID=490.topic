After several failed attempts to backstab his enemy, the young rogue was determined to make this one count. Rigorn, Gerrek's friend and hunting companion, was doing his best to taunt the gnoll, goading him to face away from the young rogue. <br>
<br>
Gerrek's corded forearm muscles bulged with his barbaric strength as a rush of adrenaline surged through his body. The gnoll guardsman had turned away from him, exposing his back. <br>
<br>
The foul gnoll was frothing at the mouth and barking wildly at Rigorn.  Gerrek focused on his target and started shift his wieght from his back foot to his front, as his guildmaster had taught him.  Sensing the danger, the powerful gnoll quickly turned back on Gerrek slashing at him, landing several blows and stunning him momentarily.  Gerrek quickly recovered, and set his feet solidly on tunnel's dirt surface.  <br>
<br>
The light from his torch flickered casting dancing shadows of the three combatants on the walls.  The young rogue instictively threw down the torch and ducked away from the melee, vanishing from the gnoll's sight. The confused gnoll found himself slashing the air in the area where Gerrek had last appeared. <br>
<br>
True to his warrior spirit, Rigorn taunted the gnoll once more anticipating the young rogue's actions. The gnoll found himself in a rage, determined to rid his evil lair of the two intruders. The guardsman slashed at Rigorn opening a large wound down his left bicept. The smell of blood made the gnoll howl madly, and he raised his shield above his head to bash down the injured half elven warrior. Rigorn knelt and raised his two handed sword in a vain attempt to parry the gnolls attack. He closed his eyes and felt the gnoll's shield hit him, but the impact was far less than he expected. <br>
<br>
The gnoll then slumped down on top of the injured warrior. Rigorn heaved the limp body to the ground, and looked up to see his friend Gerrek grinning. <br>
<br>
&quot;The glory of vengeance is mine!&quot; roared Gerrek. &quot;The Tribunal shall reward us for this deed my warrior friend. Hail the spirit of the seventh hammer!&quot; he cried, raising his arms to the sky in triumph.<br>
<br>
Rigorn eyed the young rogue with approval. Gerrek's weapon, the tooth of a giant snake, dripped with gnoll blood. The impact of the rogue's backstab was tremendous. The blow had opened a gaping wound in the gnoll's back between it's shoulders. The gnoll's heart had been pierced from behind as the weapon had been maneuvered with deadly skill. The signature of a rogue... <br>
<br>
As Gerrek eyed the lifeless gnoll, a surge of memories washed through his mind. It had been gnolls like this that had slaughtered his parents when he was a young child. The emblem on the gnoll's shield reminded him of the form he saw standing over his parents as he watched them die. He was nearly overcome with emotion. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have much more to do.&quot; Gerrek said coldly. &quot;My mission of vengeance will not be complete until I see the blood of gnoll chieftain himself on my blade.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All in time my young friend.&quot; The older warrior said calmly. &quot;You have taken your first step as a warrior of the Tribunal. Let us rest and heal our wounds now, the night's battle has not yet ended.&quot; <br>
<br>
Gerrek took out his dagger and cut a large tooth from the gnoll's mouth. &quot;It will please the warriors of my home to see evidence of this night's deeds.&quot; <br>
