Even before summoned focus items, Wizards had better DPS than rogues.  Rogues are a walking DoT, Wizards are big huge freaking direct damage hits.  Always has been.  Wizard heavy groups have been the KS group as far as I can see for a long time. <br>

Not so sure about that...the change probably got a lot of casters to log off their 50+ melee alts and back onto their mains...who still, even with focus items, do less sustained damage than melees.<br>

A twelve percent increase in DD power and efficiency is &gt;not&lt; going to break anything.  <br>

<br>
Kreugen you really are missing the point.  Step back from the big raids a second and try to understand this:<br>
<br>
Your comparison is ill formed.  You should be comparing a wizard (or any other casting class) with great loot vs a wizard that has nothing outside of the original release (pre kunark).  Must be quite a difference, right?  Wrong.   They have the same spells available and excluding level differences the same mana pool.  Yes there's tons of nice gear for casters but it doesn't *really* affect their damage output <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   over time</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Sure a wizard can ks by nuking fast.  So what?  Sustained damage is what counts.  That's how you get exp/axp or beat the raid mobs.  There's a reason you have mostly melee at raids instead of just clerics/wizards/mages/drudis.<br>
<br>
Turn the argument around and try to picture yourself still running around with a sub 1000 ac in valorium armor, a bladestopper, and darkmetal sprinkler.  That's a huge difference in your damage potential and output.   Also imagine no melee or hybrid dmg tunings that have taken place.  That's what casters just got a reprieve from.<br>
<br>
Lastly arguing that not all casters should have access to these items is illogical when vast amounts of kunark and velious weapons and armor are available to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> melee classes now.  The average sub 50 melee character today is much more powerful than they were before kunark and velious.  THAT is the difference.  Casters have not gotten a proportional increase in effectiveness in that time.  Not even close.<br>
<br>

1.  UNTIL you have played caster, healer, and melee to post 50 you cannot talk about class balance.<br>
<br>
i have , so i will.<br>
<br>
2.  &quot;blah blah blah, whine whine now casters do almost 60% of melee damage instead of under 50%....wah wah wah&quot;<br>
(paraphrased)<br>
<br>
MELEE DAMAGE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GREATER THAN CASTER DAMAGE...  melees are for survivability adn taunt and some damage...  but a wizard should ALWAYS UNDER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OUTDAMAGE A MELEE.<br>
<br>
the fact that verant is finally making it so that rogues do not so ridiculously overpower damage casters.... is a small step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
3.  &quot;wah uber mobs need upgraded now to compensate&quot;<br>
<br>
ahh... but when its a melee doing the increased damage, be it via new Ssra Temple loots or old primals loots... thats fine.  but when now casters can actually contribitue something to a fight, now we need to upgrade mobs?<br>
<br>
puh-lease.<br>
<br>
some people need to pull their collective heads out of their collective arses and take a freaking look around.<br>
<br>
melees solo better than casters.<br>
melees contribute more to a raid than casters.<br>
melees survive overpulls/trains etc better than casters.<br>
melees get all the toys, adn claim NBG as if caster loot actually existed.<br>
melees now need very little from casters other than conveniance buffs/spells, while casters need melees or cannot take dungeon camps except via AE groups, which require sucha  carefully balanced group it makes the holy trinity look like a friggin fair situation.<br>
<br>
melees are overpowered, all of us, including me.<br>
<br>
the fact that casters got a minor insignificant upgrade doesnt change that... now melees are just less overpowered than before.<br>
<br>
when i see 40%+ modifiers on caster items i will consider balance issues.  but while all the melees run around with 100% haste (item plus spell) or 120% haste (with new bard songs)... and casters are getting 10% ... <br>
<br>
heh.  FRSS is overpowered.  time to upgrade Vulak again.<br>

<br>
I think that the tuning that they've done here is fine.  I DON'T think that mages + pets, or wizards, or ANYONE should be able to outdamage rogues over the course of several battles.  Otherwise, most of the niche that Verant has given us is gone.  Things like wizard manaburn...that's FINE!  They SHOULD be able to toast things better than us.  But when you start decreasing mana costs, increasing mana regen capabilities, increasing damage output, and decreasing agro, you come dangerously close to allowing other classes to CONSISTENTLY outdamage rogues.  We can't manaburn, we can't tank as well as the tank classes, we can't cast utility spells, we can't bind, we can't gate.  We can do damage and be stealthy.  I don't think many people will want rogues for groups if we're behind all of the caster classes in damage output OVER TIME, as well as behind in all of those other areas.<br>
<br>
Casters did need tuning.  I think the percents may be a bit high on the summoned stuff, only because it gives them less room to grow for the better stuff.  15-20% should be where the UBER items put them.  Other than that, I like the change, and look forward the effects it has on groups.<br>

<br>
It was stated by VI, early on, that melee will always have more access to items than casters....because casters get spells.<br>
<br>
One poster above pointed out that 2 level 60 wizards, one with really lame equipement and one with vulak type equipement....there would not be much difference between the two.......this may be true....but should not even be included in this discussion......focus items introduced.....all get.....same boat.<br>
<br>
The real issue isn't if casters should get focus item making them better casters......hell....you could just give casters better heals, or better nukes.....and accomplish the same thing.  No one whines.<br>
<br>
The issue is....what makes me better in the endgame.  Melee, it was weapons.  Casters it was rare spells (a torpor/ malo shaman was better to have than one without or wizard with DG/GB)<br>
<br>
With spells being more and more available for all casters.....there now is not much difference between a seasoned caster and one that quit eq at 60...but never played SoV.<br>
<br>
I think that VI is heading in the right direction....not by giving mages the ability to summon something that everyone can use....but by giving casters things that make them better.  Like items that increase damage output that are found on AoW.  Not summoned.  You make them permanent....not no rent.  This will make those lucky few better....and stand out.  Implement the Ancient spells......etc etc.<br>
<br>
Look at the argument and ask yourself.....should I care if: healers be able to cast a heal spell faster...or heal for more<br>
wizards can nuke more efficient (lol, I dont even know how much they cast for specifically or how many times they can....I'm a rogue, and dont really care)<br>
<br>
If VI had just given them a cheaper/faster heal or a more damaging/cheaper nuke spell would that have mattered?  There is no difference. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4347"><IMG src="http://www.nwlink.com/~bstevens/Rogues/images/viscer1.jpg" border=0></a><br>

This is acually incorrect, wizards always KS uber mobs.  Each raid we have a group or 5 wizards + cleric and 5 rogues + cleric.  Team Wix0r 'always' gets the KS on an uber mob.<br>

<br>
Vi pretty much said, &quot;bah you want focus items? HERE HAVE FOCUS ITEMS! and made them summonable to the point where they're pretty much just an innate ability. They might as well just have MADE it an innate ability. High level players are removing their ntov/high end loots to use these items now (thx 8,5 sec CH, etc), talk about @#%$ up risk vs. reward.<br>
<br>
In fact, with a 15% decrease of casting cost, casting time, agro, +15% to damage, all which is summoned equipment, you may as well give Magicians Summon Primal weapon.<br>
<br>
Compare a L60 warrior who is in a small guild, or has few friends and just sits around Sebelis all day, acquiring experience and selling fungi tunics, with a main tank from a large guild. Compare the dps/effectiveness in tanking of the two warriors--there's gonna be a HUGE difference.<br>
<br>
Then look at a L60 wizard who bought the account naked off Ebay to port themselves around to a L60 wizard in a high end guild in your &quot;Team 0wnz0r ks style&quot; or whatever. Well the latter one has focus items!---Oh @#%$, thats right, so does that completely naked wizard, after talking to random_LFG_mage01 and offering him a translocate to next_dungeon02 to find a group. The difference comes down to a larger mana pool, few more hp, and nice resists, but both wizards can burn down and ks a mob, translocate, and all.<br>
<br>
Ancient spells are supposed to help show the difference between the last wizard example (except for all caster classes), but giving magicians give or six free summonable focus items which *everyone* can use is a step in the wrong direction, and tries to generalize caster classes even more.<br>
<br>
another example, of why the risk vs reward is @#%$ up:<br>
<br>
Say you're a L60 cleric, would you rather take this ring of destruction, which has some nice ac, hp, mana and resists, or something that totally alters your effectiveness, by allowing you to cast ALL heals 15% faster.

First of all 'mele' is the wrong term to use there because since when can a Rog solo anything post 20 without sitting for half an hour to heal...<br>
<br>
Rogues (and perhaps Monks) should be alowed to be the masters of damage and not wizards because thats basically all they can do... I have a wizard and a rogue, and I must say being able to TP all around absolutely OWNS!  It is so anoying to have to run around (actually more like walk) from zone to zone, and sure I can sneak/hide but that is SO SLOW, imagine walking from Freeport to Qeynos, yuk!<br>
<br>
When ppl bitch about class balancing they dont seem to take everything into account.  I'm not saying that its wrong to want some sort of class balancing, but just remember to consider the entire game for pros and cons.<br>

Dunno what you're doing wrong, soloed a rogue to 39 in 2 days /played with minor twinking gear (lath drinor, shaded dagger, iksar bp, rygorr, hp jewelry, etc). can solo rogues up to 50ish fine, though it isn't worth it L40-50 unless you can get a fungi, decent weapons an some nice hp stuff.<br>
Not to mention I see rogues soloing shrooms in fg all the time still.<br>
<br>
They aren't the greatest soloers, but it is not impossible. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14427">Lauralan of the Nexus</a>, 60th Warlock<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21609">Tyros Darkheart</a>, 60th Warlord<br>Lorean Korath, 53rd Vicar.<br><Mortalis> Antonius Bayle</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ualdarionshard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aldarion Shard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/02 4:00:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22859.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bah</span><hr size=1> bah again.<br>

wizards are the rogues of casters, they exist merely to do damage.  and casters as whole SHOULD do more damage than melees as a whole <br>
<br>
(think gandalf vs. bilbo... who do you fear more ina  dark alley?)<br>
<br>
wizards should outdamage rogues, rogues should outdamage all other melees, mages should outdamage all melees but rogues... it should go<br>
<br>
wiz<br>
rog<br>
mag<br>
monk<br>
necro<br>
warrior/ranger<br>
druid<br>
SK<br>
paladin<br>
shaman<br>
bard<br>
enchanter<br>
<br>
... melees, quite simply, have been unbalanced for too long, and now are upset that instead of outdamaging all casters by a factor of 2 they only outdamage wizards by a factor of 1.8 and the rest by 2.<br>
<br>
to summarize, wah wah wah.<br>
<br>
focus items need to go up to 40%, as haste items do, and we need the equivalent of haste spells, so we can stack for 100% like melees do with spell plus item.<br>
<br>
until then, melees hvae no right whatsoever to whine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=inane>INANE</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/02 4:10:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22859.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.teknojihad.net/img/hedii.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bah</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> wizards should outdamage rogues, rogues should outdamage all other melees, mages should outdamage all melees but rogues... it should go<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

/sarcasm off. If stuff were to go in game like that, especially if it was summoned or some @#%$ this game would be so easy it wouldnt be worth playing.<br>

you do realize 40% deduc on casting time would mean 6 second Complete heals? Much less Wizzies crit nuking for 6k with their L60 luclin nukes, few AA points and a + %damage focus item.<br>
<br>
Not to mention, with 40% focus items, you're complaining about how well shamans soloed BEFORE it..<br>
<br>
when 40% focus come around, expect to hear &quot;Talendor soloed!&quot; and other obscenely wrong soloings rather soon.<br>

I'd say clerics are the worst soloers. Honestly, they solo fine till about 53 or so (or however long it takes you to finally move away from Lower guk and your manastone), but overall their ability to solo is quite... crappy.<br>
<br>
Either way, imo all point is moot, because soloing for experience, as any class, has to be the most asstastically boring thing in existence. If I wanted to be bored and work, I'd just find another job and do that instead--and get paid for it. Sure occasional soloing when nothing to do and noone on is fine, or trying out some tough mob solo is exhilirating, but doing the same mob over and over and over and over ad nauseam is just a job, except you aren't getting paid. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14427">Lauralan of the Nexus</a>, 60th Warlock<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21609">Tyros Darkheart</a>, 60th Warlord<br>Lorean Korath, 53rd Vicar.<br><Mortalis> Antonius Bayle</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ualdarionshard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aldarion Shard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/02 4:23:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22859.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hehehe</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> you do realize 40% deduc on casting time would mean 6 second Complete heals?

now exlain this to me.  use little words so i can understand.<br>

WHY is it ok to DOUBLE the backstab damage (dps) of a unhsated rogue via item+spell,<br>

if we did the same to wizards it would &quot;terribly unblance the game&quot;?????<br>
<br>
whats good for the goose is good for the gander.  people made rogues to do damage, unless they started their rogues pre upgrade.  people made wizards to do damage.  why should one get upgraded and not the other?<br>

Because rogues don't get to teleport, cast manaskin, buff themselves, root, snare, and avoid getting hit to solo.<br>
<br>
with a 40% increase to damage, 40% decrease to spell costs and casting time, wizards could solo anything stunnable with 20k or less hp, without much effort at all. That there is the problem.<br>

hide<br>
sneak<br>
evade<br>
poison<br>
disarm trap<br>

assassinate<br>

.... youre right, rogues simply get no useful skills whatsoever to go along with their damage dealing. *SARCASM*<br>

look.  you cant just put class X up next to class Y and say hey look i hvae more parlor tricks than you i r0xor or whatever.<br>
<br>
you have to consider the abilities one ata  time.<br>
wiz DPS vs. rog DPS<br>
wiz utilities skills/spells vs rog utilities skills<br>
<br>
and claiming that rogues get less utilities than wizards is just asanine.  rogues get more utility skills than any melee with the expection of those overpowered warrior/rogue/necro hybrids called monks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=22859.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=22859.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=22859.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=22859.topic&start=81&stop=86>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=22859.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=22859.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22859.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=22859.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=22859.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22859.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22859.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
