Last contact I had with Koru was May 12th. I'm honestly scared something happened to her. I've sent multiple e-mails since then with no response and she hasn't logged on ICQ since before the 12th. I would post this over on NWHFJ, but she seems to read ON more than any other forum. If this doesn't belong here, go ahead and lock it. <br><br>I know some of her personal information (no, I'm not going to tell you others reading this. Koru confided in me and I'm not going to betray that.) and I've come to my capacity on finding anything out. I've even checked death records and news from Iceland. The only other option I have is calling her, and to be honest, I'm frightened to do that. I'm scared to find out if something did happen to her, and on a lesser factor, scared to call. She didn't give me her phone number, it was one of the things I found while looking for any info on her at all.<br><br>I hope I'm not coming off as a stalker, I'm just honestly frightened to my soles and desperate for any info anyone has. I've thrown up a few times over this.<br><br>In the last e-mail I recieved on May 12th, she was just about to start her job, and she was also caught up playing Morrowind. She said that she was e-mailing everyone saying she was legally dead till she hit level 20. I'm hoping with all my heart that this is the only problem and nothing more. But I can't hold it in any longer. I have to try all venues or I'll burst. I've lost too many nights of sleep over this.<br><br>Please, if anyone has had any contact with her since May 12th or knows of another way to bring her attention to this post, I'd be deeply grateful. I'm hoping that she herself will find this and I'll look like an idiot, but everything will be fine.<br><br>I don't even know if I'll have the courage to open this post unless it says, &quot;Last reply by Koru&quot; because now I've opened myself up and shown everyone what I am. A pathetic loser. But that is a small price for the chance that she finds this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utelurinon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telurinon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 7:49:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8006.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/fun/muffinmansmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KORU!</span><hr size=1> Pedric, relax man.<br><br>Koru posted telling everyone she was going to be away from the boards for a while playing Morrowind.
