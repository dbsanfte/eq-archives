I'm not sure it's possible to prove free thought, I do know I can't.  Basically the argument goes something like this ( I think).<br>
<br>
Person 1: I have free thought.  I can choose between this and that.  I chose this.  There were no restrictions on my choice, so I have free thought.<br>
<br>
Person 2: Your biological nature, the conditions of your childhood, and the current state of the weather predetermined your choice.  You just think you have free thought.<br>
<br>
I don't think the question will be answered anytime soon for the following reasons.<br>
<br>
1) It's basically the old predestination vs free will argument.  (still unproven afaik, for what that's worth)<br>
2) There is far too much data to actually come up with an accurate simulation for a given person in a given situation.<br>
<br>
The impact of consciousness on the two positions might be interesting to consider though.  As far as person 2 is considered, he/she is a passenger.  Person 1 is a participant.  <br>

My original idea - The very urge to rebel against the &quot;programming&quot; which the cynics claim discounts the theory of free thought among humans proves the theory of free thought among humans.<br>
<br>
In other words - I may be programmed to think certain things or react in a certain way, but when I question that, even for the express reason of questioning it.  I am thinking freely.  A computer will never question it's programming, merely alert the user or programmer that something is wrong in the programming. <p><center>Avethar Soulforge (retired)</center>

Wow, that doesn't make any sense. It is possible to be programmed to have free thought? Then who says we don't?  We could take Galileo as an example though. He was nearly killed for what he proposed (by those who had &quot;programmed&quot; him as you would say and those in the environment where he had been raised and where his mind had developed). So them trying to kill him because what he proposed was so different from what they thought and had taught him cannot be proof that he had free thought?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  How do you know you aren't programmed to believe that you are questioning your thinking?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because I can then question the theory that I am programmed to believe that I am questioning my thinking. Well, then you'll tell me I'm also programmed to do that, won't you?  So if I said &quot;I R h8 u&quot;, you would say I am programmed to do that, and if I said &quot;u r teh sux&quot; you would say I was programmed to do that.

That doesn't necessarily mean it should have been debated in the first place. Some people go way too far questioning things that are fact. So far that they get others to believe them, then debates ensue over things that everyone knew was true before. What makes me mad is 'scientists' that just make outrageous claims and then get a small following that will take their outrageous claim as fact.

Anyway, ponder that for a while. I do not believe that there is a God, a collection of deities, or any other mystical being. Therefore, I possess the ability to make my own decisions based on my own thought without having to resort to the will of some ancient creature used to pacify the masses. In short, that means that I could care less about homosexuality as it seems like a perfectly reasonable practice to me. To me, not to some deity that exists to appease and reassure people.<br>

So, condemn anything that you want to based on what your God supposedly says, but do not bother trying to convince me that what you say has any more worth than what is said by people who believe in invisible men because, frankly, you are one and the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utettsuo1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tettsuo1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 488<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(8/6/02 5:19:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1143.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~harulestokes/_uimages/StupendousManCharacter.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Program<br>

To question your programming, already puts you outside of the program.  Therefore, you've exceeded your programming.  Why does that not constitute free thought?  If you are no longer bound by the program, your thought become your own thereby making them free.<br>
<br>
As for the other examples, read my previous posts and think.  Oops!  Forgot you can't think outside of the &quot;box&quot;.  Until you can come up with actual examples of people being bound by their programming and unable to exceed it, be it biological or social, you argument is weak. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=281768>Tettsuo Otomo</a> 59 Grasshopper of the Celestial Fist<br>

<br>
I guess the original post was that a homosexual was trying to prove that Dr. Laura was using antiquated Hebraic law on a modern application.<br>
<br>
The only parameters of debate here should be whether those laws still apply or don't they.  Now the crux of the matter is that you would have to argue WITHIN the parameters of the Leviticus, the laws.  Any argument outside of the laws would of course disqualify your position as a debater.  <br>
<br>
In lamens terms, if you say there is no God then you can't argue on either side of the isle of whether UNDER the law is there still a modern application of such, OR whether the new testament, and the coming of the christ one, has done away with this.<br>
<br>
Now, clearly the christ said that &quot;it was said you shall take and eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.  But, I say unto you if your enemy strike you, turn the other cheek ... &quot; [paraphrasing mine]  But, nowhere did he say homosexuals are hunky dory.  So he, nor the apostles nor disciples ever countered this particular law.<br>
<br>
ACCORDING to the bible then, God thinks homosexuality is an abomination.  You can't argue he doesn't, because it says so in black in white.  You can't argue against Dr. Laura, because she is simply stating her belief in the statement.<br>
<br>
Now if you don't believe in God and such, it shouldn't really bother what he thinks.  I mean, what's an abomination mean to you if you don't believe in him.  So what he'll never bless you.  No skin off  your teeth right?  So what if he'll never protect you against Satan.  That shouldn't matter to you, since you probably don't believe in satan either.  Who cares what Christians think about you.  You don't believe in their God.  So the debate is moot for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=1143.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=1143.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1143.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.emailToFriend?topicID=1143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.threadControl?topicID=1143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1143.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1143.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5>Out Of Character</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
