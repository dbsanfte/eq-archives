Many monks disagree with killing Bro Z to get the robe – and the ‘honor’ of doing it is debatable (and often debated).  However, I’ll leave the discussion of whether it’s right to gank Z for another time and place.<br>
<br>
One note:  Brother Z is a well-understood spawn.  Brother Q in South K is not.  For the sake of your fellow monks, leave Brother Q alone.<br>
<br>
Brother Zephyl is one of four spawns in Rathe Mountains.  His alternate spawns, or place-holders, are Hasten Bootstrutter (the gnome for the J-Boots quest), Maldyn the Unkempt, and “a drake.” Killing a PH will get a respawn in 6-8 minutes.  Hasten is somewhere in the low 40s, and the other two mobs are easier kills, so there is no issue with needing firepower to take the placeholders – the amount of horsepower you need for Brother Z is that far above the PHs.  Before you kill Hasten, do an /ooc to see if anyone’s looking to complete the Jboots quest, for courtesy’s sake.  Likewise before killing Bro Z when you get him to spawn.  Note that he’s sometimes tough to make spawn – we’ve made him spawn in under 30 minutes, but sometimes over two hours with no Bro Z.<br>
<br>
You will need 2 groups of mid 50s, or 3 groups of 48-56 to do this fight effectively, easily, and with low risk.  Many say this fight can be done with a single group 55-60, and I fully believe them, but I wrote this from the perspective of a guild of high 40s to low/mid 50s.  And, in any case, a high 50s group likely doesn't need any advice on handling him.<br>
<br>
Brother Z is level 60-62 and is highly magic resistant, with only the Wizard Lure line of spells having any realistic chance of hitting him, so your groups should be melee and healer heavy.  Your main group should consist of a 56+ tank with autoriposte discipline available, two clerics in 50s with complete heal loaded, a backup healer, a shammy for buffs, and ideally another tank in case things go sour (or a necro to feed mana, but that hasn’t proved necessary so far).  The other two groups don’t need any special composition, just figure a healer or 2 in each.  Casters other than wizzies should stick to buffing and providing/controlling pets for melee, and any healer class should save all mana during melee for heals.<br>
<br>
Set up camp in the HG area, at approximately –600, +600.  Have trackers kill the placeholders till Brother Z spawns.  Once spawned, he can be held in place by hailing him.  Prepare for melee by buffing and hasting the main tank heavily, and of course buffing everyone else appropriately, and getting a good mana pool up.  Give Brother Zephyl a 2Hand Blunt weapon, such as a worn or fine steel great staff.  He will equip the staff, and this will eliminate his quad attacks.  He hits hard – in the 200-300 range, and flying kicks for more, so this step is pretty important.  Once everyone is ready, the main tank attacks and activates his autoriposte discipline.  During this startup it is important that NO ONE attack or cast at Bro Z, and that the clerics refrain from healing the main tank.<br>
<br>
After the autoriposte disc runs out, the main tank’s health will start to drop.  The clerics should decide before-hand who will heal first.  The first cleric should start Complete Heal when the tank is about half way down.  The other cleric will wait 5 seconds and cast complete heal after that, and both will continue to chain cast Complete Heal on the main tank.  The third healer’s job is to drop additional heals on the main tank if his health drops to 1 bub while the CHs are firing.<br>
<br>
About 20-25 seconds after the main tank attacks, all other melee start attacking.  Brother Z summons, so be aware of this and stay on the ball.  It will take time to knock his health down.  When he gets to 2 bubbles of health, the wizzies start to nuke.  Note that casters should not try to slow, debuff, or otherwise cast anything other than Lure spells on Brother Z – it’s a waste of time and mana, and may get you summoned.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Bro Z will stop attacking and slowly walk away.  Once you’ve finished him off, let the monk who’s gonna get the robe loot him.  He drops the RoTLC (no-drop), the black headband, a training tunic, the 2Hblunt you gave him, and sometimes some random little item like a rune.<br>
<br>
Congratulations, you’ve just looted a Robe of the Lost Circle!<br>
<br>
Start killing placeholders again, rinse, and repeat.  If you’re gonna do multiples, you may need to wait for your tank’s autoriposte to recycle.<br>
<br>
We’ve also had a monk start the fight with Whirlwind, main tank join 3 seconds later, monk feigns at low health and stays down for a bit to make sure tank keeps agro, and continue as normal.  The key to this fight is having the main assist hold aggro.<br>
<br>
Some may say this strategy is a bit of overkill, and I’m sure doing it a couple times will enable a guild to trim down the necessary bodycount, but for a first time at it this strategy is pretty much foolproof.<br>

It should be noted that this strategy could be considered an exploit.  It could also be fixed in a future patch and he will ignore equipment handed to him. <br>
<br>
I prefer to err on the side of caution, given the lack of real guidelines for what constitutes an exploit and what does not, this tactic may result in sanctions against groups/guilds/individuals who attempt it.<br>
<br>
Of course I also think the Bard strategy known as &quot;Twisting&quot; should be considered an exploit, but Verant has stated that this is a valid strategy for bards and do not punish anyone for using it.  Good luck killing Brother Zephyl if that is what you decide to do.<br>

<br>
Consider this, the express reason for giving this item to him is to reduce his effectiveness in combat.  This could be considered an exploit due to the fact that the logic and AI of the game does not recognize that this NPC is a better fighter without equipping this weapon.  If this were a real person, they would not make that mistake.  It is poor logic in the game's programming that makes this reduction in fighting effectiveness possible.  Manipulating game conditions to reduce the fighting capabilities of a NPC due to poor logic in the NPCs design may well be considered an exploit by the administration/staff.<br>
<br>
I only made my original point because there are so few rigid guidelines on what is/is not a exploit that you might get in trouble for doing this.  This is a valid concern and I think it should be mentioned as a possible risk whenever a strategy like this is suggested.<br>

I disagree.  It is very important for the main tank to piss off Zephyl as much as possible before anyone heals or other melees join in.  It is true that for alot of uber fights your main tank will get more &quot;bang for his buck&quot; using the defensive disc, in this case you want as much damage output as possible from your main tank in a short period of time without getting a heal.  <br>
<br>
I have done this fight many ways - everytime the level 60 warrior uses his defensive disc Zephyl seems to find some people he hates more than the warrior.  Everytime the warrior used riposete - no one died because Zephyl was really pissed by the time the first heal was needed.<br>
<br>
One other thing that wasnt mentioned above - get Rune V on the main tank before starting.  Main tank aggros beating on Zephyl - he waits for the Rune V to get used up first before hitting his riposete disc.  As soon as zephyl lands his first hits then tanks hits riposete disc.  This gives the main tank almost 15 seconds of fighting solo before any heals or any others join the fight.  This will keep Zephyl on the tank the whole time.<br>

I think Camthorn's thoughts are valid and should be appreciated rather than flamed.  He is only looking out for the well being of his fellow player and only saying that this is what Verant has done in the past, setting precedent, so to look out.  I don't think he is in anyway advocating VI's EULA beyond the point of simply echoing what it states.

It works like this, hotkey each song, hit the hotkey and wait until the &quot;casting time&quot; is done. This will start the song's effect, which will last for certain minimum duration regardless of what the bard does after that. So, after the casting time has passed, you hit the hotkey again, which stops the character from actively singing, but(and this is the key) does not stop the effect. Since the character is no longer actively singing, you are eligible to start a second song, so you hit a second hotkey and wait its casting time. Now you have the residual effect of the first song and the effect of the second song, while actually only &quot;performing&quot; one song. In this manner skilled bards(often called the poster children for carpal tunnel syndrome) can keep multiple group-effect spells going most of the time. I've heard of bards that can reliably twist three songs making them amazing groupmates in combat. Twist a regen song, a haste song and a mana regen song and watch everyone love you on a raid(except the mob of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
<br>
As an example:  (I've never played a bard, but I know a fair bit about this aspect of the class, I just can't remember if a bard's song takes effect immediately or if there is a lead &quot;casting time&quot; like a caster spell. I don't think there is, you get the effect as soon as you start singing. If there is, then stagger the following example adding the casting time to the duration. The basic sequece is still valid though.)<br>
<br>
Imagine twisting two songs, one with a 2 second &quot;casting time&quot; and an 18 second duration, Song X. A second with a 3 second casting time and a 12 second duration, Song Y. I hit a hotkey to start X. Two seconds later I hit it again and stop singing/playing X, BUT the effect has another 16 seconds before it wears off. So I immediately hit the hotkey for Y. Three seconds later I turn that one off and I have 9 seconds before I need to sing it again. I can swap out instruments, start a third song, whatever I want to do.  9 seconds later I start Y again.  At the time I start this, song X has 4 seconds of duration left. I give song Y it's three seconds of intro needed to establish its effect, then turn it off. Just in time to start song X again. <br>
<br>
It should be noted that the effects would of a single song would be continuous if you didn't &quot;turn it off&quot; but since the minimum duration of song X is 18 seconds and the minimum duration of song Y is 12 seconds, you sacrifice the ease of just turning it on and leaving it on for the difficult and tricky timing of turning on and off several songs to keep them ALL in effect continuously.<br>
<br>
The timings are precise, it's a bitch to do, but it's effect is amazing. Imagine a caster being able to chain-cast spells with no recovery time beyond the casting time. Once the little casting time bar is done, all your spells are available again. Bards have it a little rougher because they sometimes have to swap out instruments to twist certain combinations of songs, but it's still an amazing strategy. <br>
<br>
The reason it feels like an exploit to me? Well, the day you can sing &quot;Mary had a Little Lamb&quot; and &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; at the EXACT same time and have both still be recognizable, I might believe this was intended. Otherwise I will believe it was a facet of the client-server nature of Everquest and things had to have minimum/maximum durations in order to minimize the amount of snycronizing you had to do to keep the world displayed on the client accurate with the world being played out on the server. There might be one in ten million people who can play a song on an instrument while singing an entirely different song. But in Everquest anyone with fast fingers and knowledge of durations of songs can sing/play multiple songs at once. <br>
<br>
I have argued, on developer's corner as well, for a detailed definition of what is and is not an exploit. I feel that players will never get a fair shake as long as Verant gets to make up the rules on the spot. Twisting has been approved as a &quot;Strategy&quot; and the arguement ends there. <br>
<br>
Handing a 2HB weapon to an NPC with the intent of reducing his effectiveness in the upcoming fight? Is that an exploit? Maybe. Are you willing to bet your account and all the time/effort/money you've invested in your characters on it? That's what's at stake if you're wrong.<br>

Thank you sir.  For the record, I despise the Verant EULA.  There are many provisions I feel to be unfair and since I had no chance to give feedback or negotiate it's points, and because I signed nothing, I don't feel bound by it.(This is in contrast to my lease contract. I went back and forth with my landlord negotiating each point, and we hammered out a deal.  I had no such input into the EULA provided by Verant, and as such I don't feel bound by it as a contract.  In fact the validity/enforcability of such EULAs has yet to be established in a court of law.)  <br>
<br>
But I do have respect for some portions of it.  One of those portions is that I will not try to use my knowledge of the design limitations, or flaws in the design as the case may be, to manipulate game conditions in my favor.  I have recognized many such opportunities, even in a short EQ career like mine, but have capitalized on none of them.  <br>
<br>
Is powerleveling an exploit?  I would in general say no, but the topic is debatable depending on the tactics used.  <br>

<br>
After listening to a song, doesn't it effect you for a few seconds afterwards? If you're singing along (assuming not on stage) don't you sing a few extra bars even though it's done? Or if you're dancing to it don't you do a few extra moves before you finish?<br>
<br>
The bard isn't singing multiple songs. He sings or hums or strums a bar from a song, and while people are still thinking 'Yeah! Great song! Let's kick some ass!' he does the same with another song.<br>
<br>
How about the songs that don't require any continual actions from the bard? They're only one shot, or one shot with a duration. What's so unbelievable about someone belloing (DD+stun) at an orc, then screeching horribly at it (fear)? Or singing a DoT song which casts a multi-tick DoT on the target then singing a different song? If you kept singing the same DoT song it would keep overwriting the previous cast and would be pointless.<br>
<br>
Bello also requires that you stop and restart the song before you can use it again.<br>
<br>
How is any of this exploiting?<br>
<br>
And as far as I know, all bard 'buff' songs have the same duration, and all bard songs have the exact same cast time.<br>
<br>
Besides, bards are useless only playing one song. <p><center><font size=2><font color=ashen><a href=http://www.geocities.com/pren_tribunal/pren.txt><u>Pren, Human Master</u></a> on The Tribunal Server

Certainly, the effect begins to fade, but it's still there for a little bit.  Now if someone starts singing another song immediately, that's a different matter.<br>

True, he's technically not singing multiple songs at once. He's only singing one song and the residual effects of the others are still happening.  It's still pretty far-fetched.  Ever been to a dueling pianos concert?  It's wild.  Trying to imagine one person giving that effect blows my mind and it's even harder to suspend disbelief for the game since I['m a trained musician myself.<br>

I won't start in on specific bard songs or combinations of songs. I don't know the class well enough or have enough experience with it to argue specifics.<br>

<br>
In Norrath, by definition, twisting is not exploiting.  I have never said it is. I said that in my opinion, it feels like an exploit because no human(or elf, or half-elf or any of the races of Norrath using the classic definitions of those races) could execute such a thing in a real world scenario.  Am I willing to live with it?  Sure.  Am I willing to do it if I ever play a bard(something I will probably do soon because I like the class, some of my all time favorite RPG characters have been bards)? Sure.  <br>
<br>
Does it feel right?  No.  It feels impossible, it feels like we're abusing the fact that songs have minimum durations.  Sing two bars of a song and have it affect people for six times as long as we sang?  Especially when we're standing right there belting out another song?   Or belting out two, possibly three other songs?  Nope, still lost me.<br>
<br>
You want to argue that bard songs build up some kind of temporary enchantment in a magical sense?  Sure.  I'm ok with that.  But in that case it's the enchantment creating the lasting effect. The bard has moved on.  <br>

<br>
As for bards...<br>
<br>
Norrath is not a real world, it is a magical world.<br>
<br>
Bards twisting need not be justified any better than monks being able to fall hundreds of feet onto solid rock, swim across molten lava, get bitten by a poisonous snake and then instantaneously fix themselves up ;p<br>
<br>
Consider firstly that the bards are heroes, exceptional people and not your average person who can play an instrument.  Consider that their instruments and their very voices are magical.  And consider the possibility that instead of having a repetoire of nursery rhyme CDs they play hoping it will do some good, that they are BARDS, and adventurers, able to adapt their battle-drumming, and other magical battle rhythms to produce whatever inspirational effect or combination of effects they choose (within the constraints of level and twisting skill).<br>
<br>
Personally I find twisting to be entirely believable and think it adds a great component of skill and concentration to EQ.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=618.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=618.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=618.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=618.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=618.topic&start=101&stop=115>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=618.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=618.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=618.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=618.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.threadControl?topicID=618.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=618.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=618.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2>Guides and Tactics</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
