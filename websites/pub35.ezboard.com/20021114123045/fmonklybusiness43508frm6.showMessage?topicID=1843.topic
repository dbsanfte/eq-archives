When you're pulling a mob (or 2, or 3, or 20), don't bring it back to the group, but FD in range of the Main Assist's bow. <br>
He/She can then tag the current mob you have with you without much danger of getting adds.<br>
While this is going on, stay down, as many times I've gone to assist the party, and found I had some extra agro following me who decided to take the long way to us.<br>

Oh, and watch out for the ghoul's harm touch - 700hp gone in the blink of an eye.<br>

Like stated previous, pull mobs to a designated tag spot and call a tag (bow tag preferrably). <br>
Another tip, because the the horrendous pathing there, you may want to &quot;hold the hand&quot; of your pull to prevent him from grabbing many friends, in other words walk him back slowly to camp/tag spot. One time I ended up with Maestro and Lord of Ire pulled to SW camp! (Luckily the chanter was on her toes and we pulled it off).<br>
Good luck...oh, and by the way, Rakusha cloak is now Iksar wearable ) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=229105" target="_blank">

<br>
Tag a roamer. any roamer, as long as he roams all over the place.<br>
<br>
FD a ways out from your group, within sight of your MT.<br>
<br>
Wait. After a min, stand up and the roamer will path to you, bringing lots of friends. just fd, and tell your mt when it's good to tag. when they're ready for more just stand up again.<br>
<br>
you can do a lot of fear this way if you find the right places it's actually pretty fun =p<br>
<br>
Your hateful Iksar,<br>

Can not vouch for total accuracy about spawns, but it worked nicely the first time for me as first-time hate-leader and our first-time hate-puller. <br>
Now if anyone could trade me similar guide about 2nd floor, I would like that very much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Also, comment if something is fundamentally wrong about directions/instructions in this guide...I admit I am pretty much hate newbie and will accept any pointers gladly.<br>
<br>
All building numbers are references to this map on eqmaps:<br>

 <br>
Building 1: Zone in is here, no spawns in house, but zone-patrol can sometimes wander in house 1.<br>
 <br>
Zone-Patrol: it is 4 (?) roaming spawns which spawn on east zonewall at either house 5 or 12. They wander south and depop at southern zonewall. These are probably what will aggro on us at zone in. Mobs are (in order of appearance) cleric, spite, ire, rat.<br>
 <br>
Building 2: 3 spawns upstairs, 1 is box and other 2 abhorrent/ire. These don't usually aggro on break in. Pulling from this building has to be done carefully as the roamers go right beside this building and can easily aggro building 20, which in turn will aggro building 23 and everything between that and zone-in.<br>
 <br>
Building 3: 2 spawns, abhorrent/ire. These will usually aggro when fighting zone-patrol. So in break-in, we will probably have 1 from zone-patrol and 2 from building 3, and possibly roamer if it is just outside building 3, and if killing is slow, next zone-patrol mobs.<br>
 <br>
BREAK IN PICTURE (edited from eqmaps pic)<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hut.fi/~arova/corner.jpg">www.hut.fi/~arova/corner.jpg</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
 <br>
-Puller will always FD at FD spot (green dot)<br>
-Tagger (MT) will tag at tag-spot (dark blue dot)<br>
-Groups will wait at wait-spot (light blue spots) They will wait until MT has pulled mob at Fight-spot and announced ENGAGE.<br>
Something I learned earlier, the wait spot should be as south as possible because mobs REALLY ignore walls here. When puller FDs at FD-spot, even one character in room too north (ie. too close to FD spot) will aggro them.<br>
 <br>
We will stay clear of West wall and North Wall and try keep fight in SE corner of room. Our ONLY danger is when we aggro room 3, they might aggro the roamers who will aggro the big room west from corner-map (number 20 in big map)<br>
We will pull the zone-patrol and rooms 1 and 2 (and adds that come from roamers) and then call rest of the force in.<br>
 <br>
After that our main objective is to clear the roamers so we can move to main pull spot. We can also pull room 3, but roamers are 30 min repop so we need to move before they respawn.<br>
 <br>
After this we will move to 'pull spot'. We follow the green path (route to spot), about half up on zonewall. Do not go too low, because then you might aggro something from buildings, and do not go higher, because then you might aggro something on 2nd floor.<br>
If you aggro something, announce your aggro and die at spot. Do not run around.<br>
 <br>
When we close to SW corner, make sure to stay at zonewall. There might be imps visible at corner and if they aggro, just fight them in pull spot.<br>
Do not take short cut through floor on SW corner, as I have heard rumours imps are actually a spawn-trap at floor.<br>
We might be able to avoid spawning them totally.<br>
 <br>
Once everyone are in pull spot safely, we can start pulling.<br>
In every pull, no matter HOW safe single pull it seems like being, puller will NOT bring the pull to main group. Puller will always FD away from group, MT will tag the pull and pull it to group. NOBODY will engage before command ENGAGE.<br>
FDed puller will pay extra care on detecting if he/she has aggroed something else too. (with hate's funky pathing, a mob could have aggroed through wall and take as long as 30 second to come to hunt you)<br>
 <br>
Building 27: 2 monks/scorns downstairs, 2 upstairs. Need to be careful not to aggro Chapel (building 29)<br>
Building 26: 1 monk/scorn downstairs, 1 upstairs, Careful not to aggro roamers and chain aggro to building 20<br>
Building 25: box in NW corner, monk/scorn in NE corner, Careful not to aggro roamers and chain aggro to building 20<br>
Building 24: should be empty<br>
 <br>
When these building are clear, we have more safety.<br>
Next goal is to clear building 20 to avoid all the wall aggro. ONLY downstairs is needed though. Upstairs should be left to be pulled after we have moved to organ hall.<br>
 <br>
Building 20, west wing downstairs (pulled through backdoor):<br>
 -2 roamers under the stairs on NW part<br>
 -static priests guarding the hallway to eastern part.<br>
 -1 roamer in SW part<br>
 -1 roamer in the hallway to eastern part<br>
 <br>
Building 23: box and monk downstairs, 2 abhorrents upstairs<br>
 <br>
Building 20, east wing downstairs (pulled through front door, near building 23)<br>
 -2 static príests at the front door<br>
 -1 roamer just inside, near front door<br>
 -2 static priests near throne in SE corner<br>
 -1 roamer near hallway to west wing<br>
 <br>
Building 19: monk/scorn upstrairs, shouldnt aggro, no need to pull, but easy after 20 is cleared<br>
 Building 21: monk/scorn upstais, shouldnt aggro, no need to pull, but easy after 20 is cleared<br>
 <br>
Building 20, upstairs:<br>
 No need to pull as they rarely aggro unless you pull big aggro range mob from downstairs (like ashenbone)<br>
 -2 roamers at top of stairs, NW corner<br>
 -1 roamer in SW corner<br>
 -2 roamers in central hall<br>
 -4 roamers in east hall<br>
 <br>
After this work will be done to clear chapel (29) , if there is enough force to take maestro (or he isnt up)<br>
 -2 static priests at entrance<br>
 -1 roamer in the southern wall nearest to entrance<br>
 -2 static priests at SW corner<br>
 -1 roamer in SW corner<br>
 -6-8 random roamers that will roam all over the house<br>
 (After these, building 28 should be pulled)<br>
 -1 roamer under the stairs, ne from enrtance<br>
 -1 roamer in NE corner<br>
 -1 roamer in NW corner (just N from building 2 that goes north and south on west wall of chapel. Pull when at S end of route.<br>
 -Maestro at organ<br>
 -4 static spawns around maestro, usually spites and clerics<br>
 <br>
(Before Maestro is pulled, usually to SW corner, upstairs must be cleared)<br>
 Upstairs of Chapel:<br>
 -1 roamer at top of stairs<br>
 -1 roamer at SW corner<br>
 -1 roamer at SE corner<br>
 <br>
After whole chapel is dead, next pull spot is organ. This is great spot, lot of room to maneuver and almost no wall aggro.<br>
 <br>
In no specific order:<br>
 <br>
Building 4: box upstairs<br>
 Building 5: abhorrent downstairs, ire/ab upstairs<br>
 Building 6: box and ire upstairs, usually left last to pull as they will not aggro<br>
 Building 7: spawn right at door, 2 more spawns at SE side<br>
 Building 8: rev at door, 2 more spawns under stairs<br>
 Building 9: male rev at door, male rev at bottom of stairs, female rev upstairs at top of stairs<br>
 Building 10: three revs<br>
 Building 11: male rev<br>
 Building 12: box in NE corner, rev in NW corner, rev upstairs<br>
 Building 13: rev downstairs, 2 more revs upstairs<br>
 Building 14: male rev in SW corner, another upstairs<br>
 Building 15: female rev downstairs, 2 more upstairs<br>
 Building 16: box in far NW corner<br>
 Building 17: 2 revs at southern tip of building<br>
 Building 18: scorn or monk<br>
<br>
Puller's aggro:<br>
Puller will be eventually get aggro he/she cant shrug off. We will need to take our time and let puller /q out and relog to clear aggro for sure.<br>
Also, Puller should never ever bring mob to camp spot, but pulling (even in 100% secure pull) will be done with pull-fd-MTtag-combo. It worked very nicely last time. It can be bit slow, but rather safe than sorry.<br>
 <br>
FD/tag-spots:<br>
In SW-corner pull-spot, we found that one very bad pull route is between building 27 and organ hall. If organ hall is not cleared, the pull often aggroed mobs from organ hall who came charging for monk with train.<br>
Pathing between buildings 27 and 26 was weird, but that spot was doable.<br>
The best spot proved to be between buildings 26 and 25, as long as FD was done deep enough (almost at door of building 24) because pathing closer to camp spot lead leaving mobs too close to group and they sometimes aggroed.<br>
