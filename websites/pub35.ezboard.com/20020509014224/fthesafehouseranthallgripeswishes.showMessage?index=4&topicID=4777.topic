Myths Of The Middle East <br>
<br>
I've been quiet since Israel erupted in fighting spurred by disputes over the Temple Mount. <br>
<br>
Until now, I haven't even bothered to say, &quot;See, I told you so.&quot; But I can't resist any longer. I feel compelled to remind you of the column I wrote just a couple weeks before the latest uprising. Yeah, folks, I predicted it. That's OK. Hold your applause. <br>
<br>
After all, I wish I had been wrong. More than 80 people have been killed since the current fighting in and around Jerusalem began. And for <br>
what? <br>
<br>
If you believe what you read in most news sources, Palestinians want a homeland and Muslims want control over sites they consider holy. Simple, right? <br>
<br>
Well, as an Arab-American journalist who has spent some time in the Middle East dodging more than my share of rocks and mortar shells, I've got to tell you that these are just phony excuses for the rioting, trouble-making and land-grabbing. <br>
<br>
Isn't it interesting that prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, there was no serious movement for a Palestinian homeland? <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Farah,&quot; you might say, &quot;that was before the Israelis seized the West Bank and Old Jerusalem.&quot; <br>
<br>
That's true. In the Six-Day War, Israel captured Judea, Samaria and East Jerusalem. But they didn't capture these territories from Yasser Arafat. They captured them from Jordan's King Hussein. I can't help but wonder why all these Palestinians suddenly discovered their national identity after Israel won the war. <br>
<br>
The truth is that Palestine is no more real than Never-Never Land. The first time the name was used was in 70 A.D. when the Romans committed genocide against the Jews, smashed the Temple and declared the land of Israel would be no more. From then on, the Romans promised, it would be known as Palestine. The name was derived from the Philistines, a Goliathian people conquered by the Jews centuries earlier. It was a way for the Romans to add insult to injury. They also tried to change the name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina, but that had even less staying power. <br>
<br>
Palestine has never existed -- before or since -- as an autonomous entity. It was ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman Empire and, briefly, by the British after World War I. The British agreed to restore at least part of the land to the Jewish people as their homeland. <br>
<br>
There is no language known as Palestinian. There is no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc. Keep in mind that the Arabs control 99.9 percent of the Middle East lands. Israel represents one-tenth of 1 percent of the landmass. <br>
<br>
But that's too much for the Arabs. They want it all. And that is ultimately what the fighting in Israel is about today. Greed. Pride. Envy. Covetousness. No matter how many land concessions the Israelis make, it will never be enough. <br>
<br>
What about Islam's holy sites? There are none in Jerusalem. <br>
<br>
Shocked? You should be. I don't expect you will ever hear this brutal truth from anyone else in the international media. It's just not politically correct. <br>
<br>
I know what you're going to say: &quot;Farah, the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem represent Islam's third most holy sites.&quot; <br>
<br>
Not true. In fact, the Koran says nothing about Jerusalem. It mentions Mecca hundreds of times. It mentions Medina countless times. It never mentions Jerusalem. With good reason. There is no historical evidence to suggest Mohammed ever visited Jerusalem. <br>
<br>
So how did Jerusalem become the third holiest site of Islam? Muslims today cite a vague passage in the Koran, the seventeenth Sura, entitled &quot;The Night Journey.&quot; It relates that in a dream or a vision Mohammed was carried by night &quot;from the sacred temple to the temple that is most remote, whose precinct we have blessed, that we might show him our signs. ...&quot; In the seventh century, some Muslims identified the two temples mentioned in this verse as being in Mecca and Jerusalem. And that's as close as Islam's connection with Jerusalem gets -- myth, fantasy, wishful thinking. Meanwhile, Jews can trace their roots in Jerusalem back to the days of Abraham. <br>
<br>
The latest round of violence in Israel erupted when Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon tried to visit the Temple Mount, the foundation of the Temple built by Solomon. It is the holiest site for Jews. Sharon and his entourage were met with stones and threats. I know what it's like. I've been there. Can you imagine what it is like for Jews to be threatened, stoned and physically kept out of the holiest site in Judaism? <br>
<br>
So what's the solution to the Middle East mayhem? Well, frankly, I don't think there is a man-made solution to the violence. But, if there is one, it needs to begin with truth. Pretending will only lead to more chaos. Treating a 5,000-year-old birthright backed by overwhelming historical and archaeological evidence equally with illegitimate claims, wishes and wants gives diplomacy and peacekeeping a bad name.<br>

<br>
This would just invite every other nuclear power to join in the carnage. A first strike/sneak attack with a weapon of mass destruction goes against one of the articles of the Geneva Convention. Once you break that particular rule, the other side is free to retaliate in whatever way they choose---chemical, biological, nuclear, etc. This includes their allies as well.<br>
<br>
This is why we were so desperate to find evidence that Iraq had used chemical weapons against us--- with proper evidence, we could unleash a whole arsenal of nasty weapons on Iraq and signers at the Geneva Convention could not say a word about it.<br>
<br>
I have nothing again the people of Israel, but their country was swallowed up by other arab countries years ago. For some reason, the UN decided to resurrect Israel after World War II. This was a bad move in my opinion. It is in Israel's best interest to make peace with their neighbors, not bomb the crap out of them because they are rooting out &quot;terrorism&quot;. Israeli's and Palestinians have been suicide bombing each other for years. What makes things so different now? <p>Farvel MacDermott<br>

[Latin Hispnicus, from Hispnia Spain.] <br>
Usage Note: Though often used interchangeably in American English, Hispanic and Latino are not identical terms, and in certain contexts the choice between them can be significant. Hispanic, from the Latin word for “Spain,” has the broader reference, potentially encompassing all Spanish-speaking peoples in both hemispheres and emphasizing the common denominator of language among communities that sometimes have little else in common. Latinowhich in Spanish means "Latin" but which as an English word is probably a shortening of the Spanish word latinoamericano refers more exclusively to persons or communities of Latin American origin. Of the two, only Hispanic can be used in referring to Spain and its history and culture; a native of Spain residing in the United States is a Hispanic, not a Latino, and one cannot substitute Latino in the phrase the Hispanic influence on native Mexican cultures without garbling the meaning. In practice, however, this distinction is of little significance when referring to residents of the United States, most of whom are of Latin American origin and can theoretically be called by either word. ·A more important distinction concerns the sociopolitical rift that has opened between Latino and Hispanic in American usage. For a certain segment of the Spanish-speaking population, Latino is a term of ethnic pride and Hispanic a label that borders on the offensive. According to this view, Hispanic lacks the authenticity and cultural resonance of Latino, with its Spanish sound and its ability to show the feminine form Latina when used of women. Furthermore, Hispanicthe term used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other government agenciesis said to bear the stamp of an Anglo establishment far removed from the concerns of the Spanish-speaking community. While these views are strongly held by some, they are by no means universal, and the division in usage seems as related to geography as it is to politics, with Latino widely preferred in California and Hispanic the more usual term in Florida and Texas. Even in these regions, however, usage is often mixed, and it is not uncommon to find both terms used by the same writer or speaker. See Usage Note at Chicano.<br>

<br>
Hispanic can mean either. <br>
<br>
FWIW, I'd take Arab complaints about Israeli treatment of Palestinians more seriously if the various Muslim states treated thos same palestinians nearly as kindly as the Israelis do. You kno, in Israel, the citizens get to vote, have religious and political freedoms far beyond any of the other Middle eastern nations.<br>
<br>
When 3 wars have been launched using the palestinian lands as a starting point, and thousands have been killed by terrorists based out of there, I can perfectly understand why Israel feels the duty to keep such things from ocurring again. Yes, they are incredibly harsh, but they need to be. In a war of self-defense, there can be no half-measures and compromises.<br>

<br>
The country is a tiny sliver of land. In fact most of Israel's bigger cities could be <b>walked</b> to, on foot, from Jordan or another bordering country within two hours.<br>
<br>
Then take into account the proximity of air bases. Did you know that a jet fighter could fly from a Jordan air base and be bombing Jeruselem within... <b>five</b> minutes? Ya, that's right.<br>
<br>
Do you think the US would put up with that kind of crap? I live about 30 minutes (driving) from Nashville. I am going to have to make a confessions here: I would not feel safe knowing their was a potentially hostile air base with a possible intent of bombing my hometown located Nashville.<br>

<br>
<br>
The Fourth Geneva Convention on Rules of War was adopted in 1949 by the international community in response to Nazi atrocities during World War II. The international treaty governs the treatment of civilians during wartime, including hostages, diplomats, spies, bystanders and civilians in territory under military occupation. The convention outlaws torture, collective punishment and the resettlement by an occupying power of its own civilians on territory under its military control. In the fifty years since its adoption, the Fourth Geneva Convention has never been used to condemn world atrocities including those in Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo, Tibet, etc. <br>
<br>
Since 1997 the Arab group at the United Nations has been trying to invoke the Fourth Geneva Convention against Israel, in regard to its settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and in particular at Har Homa in Jerusalem. The UN General Assembly has adopted a number of non-binding resolutions condemning Israeli settlements, and calling for a convening of the signatory nations of the Fourth Geneva Convention. In February 1999 the GA adopted a resolution calling for a special UN session to be held on July 15, 1999 in Geneva to examine &quot;persistent violations&quot; by Israel. <br>
<br>
Israel rejects the interpretation of the 4th Geneva Convention applying it to Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, stating that those territories were captured in 1967 as a result of a defensive war against countries which had illegally occupied them since 1948. <br>
<br>
Switzerland is the Depository for the 4th Geneva Convention. This means that the Swiss are technically responsible for organizing and convening a meeting of the signatory nations. However, the Swiss may only convene the meeting if a majority of the signatory nations agree to do so.<br>
<br>
ADL has vigorously opposed convening the Fourth Geneva Convention in regard to Israeli settlements arguing that it could dangerously politicize the international legitimacy and high standings of the Geneva Conventions. It could open a Pandora’s box across the globe haphazardly applying the convention to a plethora of nations. Furthermore, it would give credence to the Palestinian tactic of using the international community to air grievances regarding the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and thereby threatens the peace process itself. <br>
<br>
International efforts led by the United States were successful in scaling down the July 15th special UN meeting in Geneva. The closed-door meeting lasted a mere 45 minutes. However, a resolution was unanimously passed stating that the Fourth Geneva Convention does apply to Israeli settlements in the &quot;occupied territories.&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
And from Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention-<br>
<br>
The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
And thus Israel's settlements in the occupied territory, one of the largest points of contention from the Palestinian side, is in violation of international law.<br>
