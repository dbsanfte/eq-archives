<br>
Sorry you are going through that.  Sucks man.<br>
<br>
Hey, I went through the same type of thing though.  i did get over it, and what really helped, was finding the right catalyst to help you forget about the other problems.  Otherwise they start looming over you, and you can't find anything else to distract you.<br>
<br>
I started writing music.  Now, I don't know if I had any talent at all...in fact, I am still not so sure I do.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But, it *did* help me a lot just being able to right about things, and be angry about them, and sing about them at 145 beats a minute with as aggessive drums as I could find to program at the time.  Admittedly, most of the synth stuff at that time was not very aggro, but I did what I could.  Now I really enjoy writing, and still probably have zero talent in it, but it still is a nice escape from reality when other things, like EQ, seem unable to help me let go of the day-to-day troubles.  There are plenty of free applications out there that let you play with stuff anyway.  I can always point you in the right direction if that is something you are interested in.<br>
<br>
Also, just merely writing things down seems to help me too.  Maybe it would for you as well.  Keeping a journal sometimes provides a nice release as well.  Plus, it's a lot of fun to look back on them a few years later and go &quot;Whoa!  Why was I worried about that?&quot;  Problems can seem devastating at the moment, but years later, you look at them and see that, while horrible at the time, the problems just don't seem nearly as bad when you look at them from a different perspective of your life.<br>
<br>
You need to talk though, just let me know amigo.  I will get you my e-mail addy, if it's not already on my profile...and I have no idea if it is or not.<br>
<br>
Take care, and things will get better for ya'. <p>Scuttle - Professional Natural Disaster - Now with new and improved Redemption.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uinkiewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inkiewiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/13/02 3:38:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4550.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah</span><hr size=1> Valentine's Day was an obscure holiday until Hallmark PR'd it into a reason to buy shlock and feel crappy unless you receive shlock from others.

Life looks really dark sometimes, but the darkness does pass.  Also, don't be too sure you're not &quot;clinically&quot; depressed, because sometimes it's hard to judge.  If the gloom just won't lift, try seeing a counselor.  You don't have to suffer needlessly.<br>

I know alot of girls who judge their selfworth by how much a signifigant other cares for them.  They're never happy.<br>
<br>
One of the most profound things any of my friends ever told me came from a friend who was, I'd say, grown up before she left HS.  She said, (and this is not an exact quote), "You will never be in a truely lasting, stable relationship until you don't need it".  Basically, you cannot have that relationship which will endure until you are happy with yourself as an individual.  So don't worry about valentines day.  If you have a signifigant other, show them you care.  If not, your not missing out on anything special.<br>
<br>
And if you go to Engineering College, you've probably got 2 labs, a Physics 2 exam, and a thermo exam the next day for a valentines day treat =).<br>
<br>
And what everyone else has said is right.  Everyone gets signifigantly depressed, the thing that separates the men from the women, (more litterally than women would like to admit), is learning how to deal with the feeling.<br>
<br>
(edit:  Oh, and don't think your so special.  I plan on getting myself candy for valentines day! ;-) <p>--------------------------

Sure, it all hurt like hell, and yes, I was depressed for some time over everything that had gone wrong in one short week, but I'm a perfectly functional, productive member of society, and I certainly don't project my dissatisfaction over my several failed relationships onto the rest of man- or woman-kind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

At any rate... It's not always easy, Pedric. Please don't feel bad about voicing your feelings. It doesn't make you a wuss or a whiner or anything like that. Sometimes you just need to get stuff off your chest. Please cheer up, though. I hate for any undeserving person to feel bad, and you definitely don't deserve to be depressed. You r0x0r, boy.<br>
<br>
And if it makes you feel better, I bought myself a box of chocolates today; it's even shaped like a heart. Not because I felt sorry for myself because I don't have anyone to buy them for me, but because I like chocolate, and it's everywhere this time of year. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You wont find a good relationship until you don't need it.  What it really comes down to is you can't love someone else until you love yourself, and you can't love yourself until you Know who you are.  Knowing who you are gets rid of alot of dependency on other people (Emotionally anyway).  It took me a while.  I had a marriage fail. It took me a lot of time since then to figure this out.

--- Life = Pile of Sh*t<br>
<br>
And how do we, as individuals, deal with the Pile?  Well... one example could be this:<br>
<br>
==============================================================<br>
<br>
Childhood:  What's this?  A huge Pile of Sh*t?  Mom sez not to play with it, but I'm gonna anyhow when she's not lookin'!<br>
<br>
Puberty:  Dang!  My parents keep on my ass about taking &quot;responsibility&quot; and &quot;preparing to climb the Pile of Sh*t&quot;, but screw dat!  Me gonna hang wit my friends, get my game on and explore my strange sexual urges.  I'll get around to that Pile tomorrow ...<br>
<br>
Young Adulthood:  I must hurry!  I must be the most fantastic &quot;Pile of Sh*t&quot; climber there ever was and leave my mark!  Why, oh WHY did I waste so many climbing opportunities when I was a teen??!?  It's not such a bad Pile of Sh*t really ... just needs some festive curtains and a wooden deck added in the back...<br>
<br>
Middle Age:  Bah ... this Pile really stinks.  I'm tired of climbing ... I should pace myself and just collect a paycheck at the end of each week.  Hook up with someone climbing this Pile of Sh*t at the same rate as me ... yeah, THAT'S the ticket.<br>
<br>
Old Age:  Finally making it to the top of the Pile, you see there is nothing BUT sh*t for miles and miles...<br>
<br>
Then everything just rolls downhill... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
==============================================================<br>
<br>
I think those three additions to &quot;Murphy's Law&quot; hold true for us all in Life:<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
1) You cannot win.<br>
<br>
2) You cannot break even.<br>
<br>
3) You can't even quit the game.<br>
<br>
4) Do not pass &quot;GO&quot; ... Do not collect $200 (wait ... that's FOUR )<br>
<br>
To survive, take full advantage of one of Life's facts: What goes around, comes around (i.e. - compassion begets compassion).  Don't take life too seriously and you should be fine.<br>
<br>
And for God's sake, DO NOT rip the tags off of mattresses!<br>

Enter college, muahahaha..I don't know why, but people are are just more accepting and not so petty with popular cliques. Before too long, you find yourself fighting off the advances of the ladies. Parties are fun too..Oh yeah, go to class for 3 hours a day.<br>

<br>
If I remember correctly, we're about the same age.   I'm 17 and a highschool junior and I've never had a girlfriend.  And do you know what?  I have no interest in getting one anytime soon either.<br>
<br>
To be perfectly honest, I don't even think people our age <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be dating yet.  Kids take this stuff way too seriously.  There's more important things going on that we should be worrying about.<br>
<br>
So if Big Bad Glip hasn't had a girlfriend yet, what are you worrying about?  That just makes you more like me, which can only be a good thing! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p><b><a href=mailto:Glip@thesafehouse.org><font size="5">Glip the Gnome</font></a></b><br>

Never been on a date.<br>
Feel no need to.<br>
<br>
You have more importent things to worry about. Wait till you can go bar hopping before you try getting into relationships, bro.<br>
<br>
Aside from that... Looked into therapy at all, for the depression? It (usually) does help.<br>

On the dating, I'm of the same mindset as you Glip and I agree completely with you, there are much better things we can do at our age. Like I said, there's only one woman I've ever been actually attracted to. I guess I'm just being silly and want attention.<br>
<br>
On the depression, I have seen numerous counsellors and have been diagnosed with clinical depression. It helps, but there's just no magic cure. I dip in and out, in and out, in and out. The only thing that can get me out is pure willpower.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the offers Kai and Trolo, I'll be sure to get back with you, I promise! Of course, I'll probably forget I said this 5 minutes from now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukintire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kintire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 3:41:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4550.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Pedric, if it is any help, I am almost completely convinced that you are a great guy.

Whoa!  You have one of those leather-wearing blue girls after you now!  You know what they say about those dark elf girls!<br>
<br>
...What's that?  You don't?  *sigh*  I don't either.  I was hoping you could tell me!!<br>
<br>
Oh and yes, High School sucks.  Mine was worse as far as the 'dating pool' went because my school was so small.  I had 6 people in my graduating class.  I was the only guy too.  You would think that would be good odds, huh?  Of course, with such a small group of students, you get very well acquainted with people, and I realized soon that I didn't *want* to date any of them.  Heh.  When you are out of High School, life is very very different.  I never understood those people that would love to live their High School days over again.  I hated that time of my life and would never go back were I given the chance.  No way thankyouverymuch!<br>
<br>
Things get better.  Much better.  It's even easier when you have a group of people to talk to that care about ya', and you have lots of friends here at the ol' SH.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Depression sucks - it makes everything seem so damn EFFORTFUL.<br>
<br>
If you are truly suffering from depression, get help with that medical condition first, deal with your problems after you have help lined up.<br>

I cannot offer any advice on how to get help - I have never followed the advice I jost doled out personally - I just drag my wife and I through my own episodes, being basically a dumb ass in many ways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showMessageRange?topicID=4550.topic&start=21&stop=36>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showPrevMessage?topicID=4550.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showNextMessage?topicID=4550.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4550.topic&index=21><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.emailToFriend?topicID=4550.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.threadControl?topicID=4550.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4550.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4550.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes>Rant Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
