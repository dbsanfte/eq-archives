<br>
Actually, most bards are pretty pissed about every class being able to buy one of our defining abilities.  One of the bonnuses that went through my head when I was thinking of what class to create next, was which class would be able to run away faster than the others (PvP server, sometimes surviving is more important that looking like a badass and dying).<br>
<br>
I remember when Kunark came out and everyone bound at the firepots.  All the wizards and druids bitched about how their class defining spells were being given to everyone.  That was nerfed within a month, to where noone could bind in TD again.  I am still waiting for horses to get nerfed, way too many problems with them, besides the speed factor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uemodius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emodius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 1:56:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bards and Casting items.</span><hr size=1> bards have no class defining abilities, you get them all from other classes =P jk <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukaaillasra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaail Lasra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 9:59:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bards and Casting items.</span><hr size=1> Just becuase you get something that is better than everyone elses, or something that they don't get... doesn't mean that it's a 'class defining ability'.<br>

They're way slower than me.<br>
<br>
I do dislike pali/sk summoned horses running as fast as I do at level 60 while being unsnareable, instant casting, undispellable, while my speed song is none of those things.<br>
<br>
As for the boots.  It's a bolt...that means that we have to run backwards and hope nothing blocks the bolt to kite with it.  Or instead I could pump out 200+ dmg every 6 seconds and not have to worry about LoS issues and partial resists.<br>
<br>
The boots are rare too, and nothing more than a toy since in groups there are SO many far better things to do.<br>
<br>
Nukers are balanced by allowing them to dish out fast damage while having a mana restriction.  Mages don't have to do anything like constantly sing for their parties while grouped, so basically if mages got something like this, they would have a 7 second cast 333 nuke that would not interfere with what they do best.<br>
<br>
Bard's boots interfere with what we do best which is party support/raid support.<br>
<br>
Big whoop.  <br>
<br>
We're the least played class in the game (besides BL but that new class don't count).  And we're only truly &quot;balanced&quot; by putting forth A LOT of effort in everything we do.<br>
<br>
Yeah few people play bards, lets nerf them so noone plays bards.<br>
<br>
(I do agree that perhaps mages need to be looked at in caster balancing more than most casters...but that has NOTHING to do with bards.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrimmlokk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimmlokk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://grimmlokk.homestead.com/files/icon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 3:08:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bards and Casting items.</span><hr size=1>  Personally the biggest advantage I see to the boots is on a PVP server.

 Also bards with Trak BP can heal on the run. That's a very cool little perk=) Not gonna make or break anyone really outside of a long solo fight, but very nice to have at your disposal. And I dunno the cast time on it, it's possible twisting a few songs will heal you faster assuming the songs are all up. And could toss in a fungi. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uclammorsz1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Clammor SZ1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 5:19:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bards and Casting items.</span><hr size=1> SS bp is pretty nice, but yeah, with AA points, songs and a fungi, you can do better regen with that then the ss bp (a 6 second cast time item).   btw, I'd like monks to be nerfed because of the amount of hp they can regen with AA points and good gear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utaldaris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taldaris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 7:50:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bards and Casting items.</span><hr size=1> Not surprised to see this here after the recent posting on a certain forum. Pretty shady attempt to get us nerfed if you ask me. Try asking for own class improvements instead of the nerfing of another. On the horse issue, I don't mind the speed and all. I just hate the bugs that revolve around them...The attack radius, barely being affected by snare, etc...<br>
<br>
Fact is, people I group with still will use my songs even when they have those horses. <br>
<br>
Please, lets not turn this into a nerf this class cause they get stuff I wish I had or don't like.<br>
<br>
This is a &quot;raiding&quot; game mostly and crying for nerfs will only hurt your raiding. EQ just wasn't balanced for PVP properly imho. And things such as the boots ARE situational. Any real bard would not give up the benefits of giving warsong(25% haste stacking) to melees, dmg shield songs to warriors(which you also need a mage to achieve top numbers), ae mana to entire raid...all to nuke for 333?<br>
<br>
And the running while casting thing been around forever. Willing to bet if those boots never came around this wouldnt be mentioned. Its just a futile attempt to get us nerfed somehow so you can feel better about Verant's neglect to your class. Do this crap the right way.<br>

well.. first you have the 33% damage nerf on spells in pvp.. then there is this thing called resist... mage spells in general is very easy to resist/do much less damage.<br>
People dont stand still in pvp.. and are usually running up and down hills were bolt type spell are useless.. and i personaly would rather snare the person im chasing then clicking my boots every 7 second just to have it go into a hill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umekanikos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mekanikos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 4:31:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Actually, Cuellar, and others...there's one mob that we can't outrun with selo and Nostrolo's tambourine, the dreaded shadow men... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uclammorsz1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Clammor SZ1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 10:05:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> mebbe if you are lvl 10~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udrakinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drakinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/14/02 11:47:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> i once saw a level 49 bard screaming around WC with his new fancy smancy Naggy drum who aggro'd the entire shadow men camp and promptly died to all their hits.<br>

<br>
You've never been seriously nerfed before or had class definining abilities ripped away in certain zones and nerfed in all the others so why are you even bothering to reply to pissed off mages?  <br>
<br>
God forbid some Pally or Sk work through 30 something aa points just so he almost match your speed or someone pays 105k to buy a horse that runs slower than you.<br>
<br>
Paladins can't heal or stun and SKs can't feign death or suck ac while they're riding their horse, and those are important abilities for them in a group right?<br>
<br>
If mages shouldn't be pissed off that bards get right click boots that have really decent stats and a cast time that is almost twice as fast as the no stat 2h mage staff, then bards shouldn't be pissed that people can buy horses that are slower than bardspeed.<br>
<br>
p.s. I don't care if bards can cast on the run or not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showPrevMessage?topicID=10676.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showNextMessage?topicID=10676.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10676.topic&index=43><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.emailToFriend?topicID=10676.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.threadControl?topicID=10676.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10676.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10676.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers>The Back Alley</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
