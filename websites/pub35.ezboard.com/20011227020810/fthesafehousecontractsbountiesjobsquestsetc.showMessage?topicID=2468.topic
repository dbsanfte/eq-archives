The two 110 story World Trade center towers were completely destroyed by two airliners that were hijacked by suicide pilots from a terrorist group. Each building had the capacity of holding 50,000 people each and were the center of the financial market in the United States. Both monuments have been reduced to nothing but rubble. <br>
<br>
This is not the only target that was hit during this surreal event. The Pentagon was also attacked by a hijacked airliner. Fortunately, this was only a moderate blow to the sound structure of the building. The Pentagon is home to the National Security Agency (NSA) and many other key political groups and assets. <br>
<br>
For the families and friends of people that have been affected by this I give my deepest apologies. Los Angeles (where I live) was also a considered target and the company I work for is in the heart of the city, only 3 blocks from the Arco Tower, the largest building in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, our New York office was in the one of the World Trade Center buildings on the 60th floor. 5 people work in that office. Only @#%$ knows if they are alright, please pray for them and the others. <br>

There is not much more to say about that, it's just a horrible act that never should have happened.<br>
<br>
There has also been a car bomb explosion outsise the State Department, and parts of Capitol Hill is rumored to be on fire. A fourth plane has also crashed outside Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, but noone are completely sure this is related to the other three. Unconfirmed information suggests it was a fourth hijacked plane, but that it was intercepted by US Air Force fighters. Please note that is unconfirmed.<br>
<br>
The reason I am replying to this post in the first place is that you claim the WTC was destroyed by &quot;two airliners that were hijacked by suicide pilots from a terrorist group in Palestine&quot;. The world press does not at this point know who was responsible for this act, and noone has officially claimed responsibility. For the sake of the palestinian people and others who feel persecuted by statements like that, I would prefer it if you did not accuse them of being responsible before there is an international unison that it is the case.<br>

Apparently there were 2 secondary explosions that have yet to be explained, probably gas lines or something similar. <br>
<br>
The other reports of car bombs and explosions throught the city have as of a few min ago all been proved not to have happened. <br>

I got wind of it about 1 hour after it happened during school.<br>
<br>
Many of the classrooms sat down and watched television coverage for 45 minutes or an hour.<br>

@#%$, I feel like it's Pearl Harbor or something... I'm gonna be telling this to my grand kids one day.<br>
<br>
<i>Sighs.</i><br>
<br>
It's just terrible that terrorism has to go on at all.<br>
<br>
My own personal speculation, and you can remove this if you want, but I think that it was probably on the American government (well, yeah... that's very high chances, we have a lot of people who hate our government, plus they attacked the Pentagon...), and capitalism, seeing how they blew up the WTC, and a lot of cultures hate capitalism...<br>
<br>
Anyways... we'll see how this unfolds... and like my History teacher said, this is only chapter 1 of a long story yet to come. <p><br><i>51, <b><font size=+3>ROGUE</font></b></i>

<br>
even if osama benladin isnt directly responsible for this disaster he is the foremost terrorist leader, and trains terrorists to commit these acts all over the world.<br>
<br>
I know we have a few law students that frequent this board.<br>
<br>
Would that be crossing the line?<br>
<br>
If that email and variations of that email were to include donations from  even 100 million people worldwide(quite small) and averaged just 10 us dollars per donation, that would be<br>
1 billion dollars.. You would have to think that would be a small price to pay to capture and end the threat of the most dangerous people to world peace.<br>

The US government cannot let this pass unanswered.  We lost the USS Cole, and those brave men and women have not been avenged yet.<br>
<br>
However, most people can pass off the Cole, saying, &quot;It's their job to die in defense of the US.&quot;  True.  However, it is NOT the average citizen's job to die for their country.  The desk is not a tank, or a ship.  These people do not expect to die going to work in the morning.  Nor should they!  This day is so horrifying that words fail to express it all.<br>
<br>
We, as a nation can NOT let this paralyze us.  Terror is the goal, and if we let it petrify us, they have won.  <br>
<br>
The American people WILL NOT be satisfied with inaction...blood is the only currency that will be accepted as payment.  And not just a little blood.  Mark my words, this will have serious ramifications, or it should.  One thousand men died on the USS Arizona in 1941 alone.  That day produced the most awesome military response the world has ever seen.  The World Trade Center and passengers and crew on those planes will dwarf that number to the point of insignificance.  The time has come once again to prove to the world why we are called a Superpower.  War, or &quot;police action,&quot; or counter-terrorism, whatever you want to call it will be the only acceptable reaction to this atrocity.<br>
<br>
The most frightening possibility is that this might be the spark that fires the next conventional world war.  Leaders of our allied nations are already calling for a unified reaction of the Western Democracies against the nations that harbor and breed these vermin.  We may be witnesses to the beginning of a New Crusade. <br>
<br>
To whoever did this, whatever nationality or religion, this is what I have to say: If you want a war, then let's bring it on! Let us commit ourselves to the eradication of whoever is responsible for this unto the last man, woman, child, and (donkey)…and then let us salt the earth where their blasted cities once spawned their wretched assassins.<br>
<br>
Whoever is responsible, and all in the chain of support must be made to pay!  Thousands of American souls cry out for justice…no, screw that…revenge!  And we millions of survivors must hear that call and find the sons of bitches that did this and kill them and all their friends, and families, and anyone who helped them.<br>
<br>
Today, September 11, 2001…a date that will live in infamy…will mark the beginning of our fall as a nation, or the day the Sleeper Awoke.  We dare not let this go unanswered!  May @#%$ have mercy upon the souls of those responsible for this chain of events, for if our leaders have any stones, the United States certainly will not.<br>

I don't think destruction of America was the purpose though, as there are better, weaker targets for that.  <br>

Killing leads to more killing which leads to more killing. This wasn't just some random attack because they were jealous of the US. There was a reason for this, whatever it may turn out to be. I'm just saying, if it was a palestinian group, it's hardly without aggrivation from the US. If anyone wants the whole lot of them to be bombed, I suggest you read up on the palestinian/israeli conflict. When you fan the flames of war, you get burnt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usilmaer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silmaer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/11/01 8:39:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Day of Tragedy in the U.S. - September 11th, 2001</span><hr size=1> This has to be one of the saddest days I can remember.

<br>
My heart goes out to the people of my country, especially those that have lost people dear to them. <br>
<br>
I know that we are not the first to fall victim to this kind of senseless violence and I hope that this event strengthens the bond between the peoples that wish to live in peace. <br>
<br>
I pray that those that can be saved and healed will be found in time. <br>
<br>
I also pray that those responsible are swiftly brought to justice.<br>

You can say whatever you want about violence but the simple fact is that violence is a part of human nature. It always has been and in the end will likely be our undoing. Religious zealotts cannot be talked to, they cannot be reasoned with, they can simply be exterminated.<br>

I want to say a few things:<br>
<br>
Firstly this is a disturbing and terrifying act, one which I might be called upon to respond to in a military capacity but that is for the future. For now I hope we can all try to draw some form of hope for survivors and perhaps our future in a world that has, if not quite gone upside down the at least, has been rearranged in new and scary ways.<br>
<br>
Second very minor information point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Pentagon is home to the National Security Agency (NSA) and many other key political groups and assets. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually the NSA is located at Fort Meade, MD about seven miles down the road from my house. While all the key intelligence agencies (CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, and others) do have representatives in the Pentagon none of them has serious assets placed there. most of those are scattered bwetween Langley and Chantilly VA, Fort Meade MD, and D.C.

I saw both buildings collapse at the time they collapsed, and watched the side of the Pentagon cave in as well. CBS brought in a reporter from CNN who nearly died in the collapse, and told about his experience less than a half hour after the first one fell. False reports were coming in from all over (I think Fox News handled it a lot better than CBS did). Nothing's ever quite held me with that &quot;edge-of-the-seat&quot; feeling before. This is my country, and I respect what it was founded on.<br>
<br>
First Observation: Look at how well organized the entire thing was. I don't think they were totally successful in their goals, but they sure did hit hard. Do you realize that this is the most intelligently orchestrated attack <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ever</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> conducted against the United States? Originally, the US was founded as the most rational country in the world, with freedom to pursue one's own life and happiness as the ultimate right. Generally, anyone who would fight the US (instead of join it) was irrational and would not lead such devastating attacks. Today, they've screwed up what was laid down as capitalism back then, and it's getting to the point where the intelligent people become alienated. The US used to be a haven for intelligence and ability. It's slowly working against it now. Don't you wonder what kind of people could be rebelling against this government?<br>
<br>
Second Observation: How did those terrorists hijack the planes? First, how did they board those planes without suspicion? I know everyone's now saying they passed through airport security with those cardboard box-cutters. Why didn't they find it odd that these multiple people happened to have these things in their carry-ons? This may mean that either the people did not all look the same (i.e. may not have all had the same skin color and such), or that the knives they had were not all the same kind (this is likely too). I'd hope the airport security wouldn't let something like that slip through unnoticed. But secondly, how did they take over these planes with knives? No one is sure just how many terrorists boarded each flight that was hijacked, but I'm sure the passenger-to-terrorist ratio had to be 7:1 at the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> least. Why didn't the passengers overwhelm these hijackers if they didn't have guns? Perhaps they thought the terrorists would at least land them somewhere safely, since none of them would know how to fly and the pilots could've been killed.<br>
<br>
Third Observation: Regarding the plane that went down in Pennsylvania... at first I didn't understand what they were getting at by crashing there, until I realized it was not intended to crash there. I've heard mixed stories from people who think it was heading to DC or to Camp David. I'm sure you've all seen the coverage of the man calling an airport tower with his cell phone in the bathroom of that plane, before and as it went down. But think about the cause in this case. I am willing to bet that someone, realizing the plane was meant act as a kamikaze anyway, sabotaged the plane (and the terrorists' plans) and made it crash somewhere where it would cause less damage. Someone was a hero today, though I don't think we'll ever know his/her name.<br>
<br>
Fourth Observation: This Usama bin Laden person is a likely candidate, and the US did indeed get hit by an unprecedented attack, as he had threatened. I suppose it's possible that bin Laden could've had the connections here in the US to get people on those planes without suspicion, and I know he has/had a training facility for pilots. They even showed the little Palestinian children cheering (though if you looked closer, only the children and a very few adults were celebrating). But it could very well be something more along the lines of the Timothy McVeigh type, where disgruntled Americans decide to strike out at the government. One thing to keep in mind is that the US receives these sorts of threats <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> often</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Bin Laden can certainly be held as a suspect, but we do not have conclusive evidence right now. Just because the Palestinian kids were cheering does not mean that their faction did it; you have to keep in mind that some places really don't like the USA. Think of it this way... if any a_non_American583 were to assassinate Saddam, I'm sure people in the US would be cheering, regardless of who did it. (On a side note, I talked to a couple people from Argentina earlier, one who said that Argentina was celebrating the catastrophe and one who said that if we need help fighting Afghanistan, we could call on him.)<br>
<br>
Fifth Observation: Sorry to include a religious rant in this, but I could not stand the scores of times I've heard people today saying that prayer and finding @#%$ is the answer, and no one saying that making an effort to think things through would solve it. It's like everyone thinks all their wailing pleas to imaginary friends will somehow save us all, and they never even consider the men who logically had to think about this, form a plan, and take action. When all this is over, these will be the people thanking '@#%$' instead of the men who immediately mobilized air defense all over the country upon news of the crashes, the men who flew the fighter jets to patrol American skies, the men who helped to conduct evacuations, rescues, emergency treatments, and donated blood.<br>
<br>
Sixth Observation: Bush's speech was mainly hollow, yes. It was basically a motivational &quot;we'll make it through&quot; soundtrack, with the recurring Christian theme throughout. Although I would not trust him to be my stand-in in a 3rd grade spelling bee, I don't think Bush can truly believe in (&quot;accept into his heart&quot;) the whole @#%$ @#%$ thing, regardless of whether he thinks there is a @#%$ or not. Am I the only one who becomes appalled at the thought of the United States of America being led by men who would prefer to drop to their knees and pray at the first sign of danger instead of take the best action as quickly as possible? Bush did say one thing that could've been meaningful (although I doubt it really was); it was the bit about making no distinction between the terrorists and those who harbor them. This sounded (to me) like he was saying we would take action against Afghanistan in order to capture bin Laden, if necessary.<br>
<br>
Seventh Observation: A lot of people are wondering if this will start a war (a world war, even). Personally, I doubt that it will. How many allies does Afghanistan have right now? And how many does the US have? It would be more like a squashing than a war, really, if we were to take action against them. Don't count on being launched into war.<br>
<br>
Eighth Observation: After looking at most of the news headlines, I'm thinking it is very likely that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> this day</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, 9/11/01, will go down in history books as the &quot;Day of Terror.&quot; I don't really like the helplessness that that name implies when I see it on the news. I also remember, earlier, seeing the Fox newscaster stop talking as the camera reset its view on the second plane crash and the collapses - and then he very gravely yet professionally stated &quot;This day, September 11, 2001...&quot; and began to recap the day's events, and ended with &quot;...and this is surely a day that will never be forgotten.&quot; It struck me as one of those quotes that we'll be seeing decades in the future when this kind of thing is covered in documentaries and movies that involve it. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=50436"><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/ikstriff.jpg" alt="Click for my EQCastersrealm profile" align="left" border=0></a><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/duel.gif" alt="rofl..
