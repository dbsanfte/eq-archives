This makes harder hitting weapons better than fast hitting ones for obvious reasons. There are many tricks to this, backing up before the person gets to you, jumping to get in/out of range quicker, ect... Basically you try to control when u are in attack range and when not, to make your opposition waste his attack. (Turning on melee when out of range and having to wait for weapon to recycle delay before attacking)<br><br><br> Rouges are at disadvantage while jousting… no uber 2hs weapons. However in pvp u can backstab while standing back to back with someone. So when jousting you should try to time your backstab attacks to co inside with you being in range and behind them (don’t have to be facing them as mentioned before). This is trickier than it sounds as u have to adjust for both players lag.<br><br>Movement speed is probably the most important factor while jousting. Who ever is faster should control when they’re in or out of range. Well those are the basics, Good Luck and have fun. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustonethief.showPublicProfile?language=EN>stonethief</A> at: 7/12/02 6:48:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uprodigious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prodigious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 10:13:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=700.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: jousting</span><hr size=1> if you're fighting a melee who can use 2h (ie all except bards and rogues), be on them all the time and follow them or you'll get totally owned from 2h jousting. they can run around hitting you for double 200 a pop while you only get a few weak hits in, and occasionally a backstab. <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21797">Marauder Prodigious Prodigy</a><br>Fennin Ro</font><br><img src="http://prod.homepage.dk/pics/1106bs.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uyemsk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yemsk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/14/02 9:40:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=700.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Backstab Joust</span><hr size=1> it's impossible to &quot;stay on&quot; someone as prodigous says in a fairly open area unless they really really suck, every rogue jousts at high level. At 60 pretty much every other mellee class has a huge advantage in that they can use 2handed weapons.  <br><br>Frontal stab, or backstab joust as you call it, is basically when the server thinks you're facing your opponent, but your computer thinks you're right behind him.  Think about it this way, whether or not you can actually hit your opponent (whether or not you're in range or facing him) is determined by the server.  Whether or not you're behind your opponent is determined by your computer.  So when two players are running at each other, if you press backstab at the exact moment at which you're an inch or so behind him on your screen, you will backstab without turning around and actually facing your opponent.  At what point you press backstab really varies depending on your lag.  <br><br>Once you get the hang of it, it's quite simple.  Movement speed advantage is helpful.  Learning how to ghost is also quite helfpul.  Running fowards, stepping back a moment then running foward again.  It takes a little while for the other computer to register that you have begun moving backwards, and it appears that you're moving foward, so the other player will swing, get a target out of range message, and give you a slight window of opportunity of attacking where he will have to wait for his weapon to refresh.  You can use sit in this way as well.  Sit down, get up while pressing foward or backwards and you'll ghost a bit.  <br><br>Strafe-running is also advantageous.  Not only do you run slightly faster when you strafe run (due to EQ game mechanics calculating max horizontal and max vertical speeds seperately), there is no animation for EQ players to move in a sideways direction.  So you'll appear to be stuttering to the side.  <br><br>There's really no way to explain it all so you'll understand, you'll just have to try it yourself.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubigpapathundercat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BigPapa Thundercat</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.smorgenstern.com/thumb/thumb085.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/02 1:31:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=700.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.smorgenstern.com/thumb/thumb085.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Backstab Joust</span><hr size=1> I may be nutz, but i swear that i saw a 2hander one time that a rogue could actually use.

Rogues excel at destroying casters and healers. You want to take down the big contenders in pvp, you need to be rogue'ish and be oppurtunistic, hit them when they are weak.<br><br>A week ago I had a rogue with decent gear (ss armor, epic) jump me after solo'ing a spider in velks... I had 2k life left. He duelists, missed both times, I swapped to primal lance, and jousted him for about 6 passes. He ended up zoning on a 748 cripple and I lost 500 life total.
