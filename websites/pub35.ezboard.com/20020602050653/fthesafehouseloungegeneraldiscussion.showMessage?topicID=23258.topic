You can sneak/hide past monsters that see invis, hide/sneak is instant, it requires no mana, can't fizzle (and at 200 hide/200 sneak I can't even remember the last time either failed) and doesn't drop unless you get attacked (same as invis) or you drop it (whereas invis can just drop) and, as has been pointed out, hide/sneak works on invis whereas cast invis works on one or the other.<br><br>See it that way and you get less concerned by the zoning issue.<br><br>One good thing about the 50s is that sneak speed gets faster.
