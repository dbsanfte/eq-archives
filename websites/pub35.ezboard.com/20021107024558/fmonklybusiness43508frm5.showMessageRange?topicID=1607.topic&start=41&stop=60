Really try try try to stay away from &quot;Chicks w/ Kids&quot;.  And I agree.<br>
<br>
What about &quot;Guys w/ Kids&quot;?<br>
Just to flip the script a bit ;p<br>
Most guys I know withs kids do not raise the kids.  Normally the woman keeps the kid.  Thats just the way it is.  SO, men have the luxury of having a kid yet not be as much of a burden on their romantic lives.  The pay for that of course is we dont get to raise the kid.<br>
<br>
This is a pretty bias baord for this discution being how its like 90% males 14-40 who play EQ.  I wonder if chicks dont like men with kids as men dont like chicks with kids?<br>
<br>
I think Girls DO like it when a man allready has a kid.  Dont ask me why... they just do.  Its the same thing when a guy has a baby in a public place.  Girls are all over you.<br>
When my and my friend who has two kids are out chatting to some ramdom females we meet.  When the subject of kids come up.  The reaction differnce is strange between me saying I have no kids and him saying he has two.  They ALLWAYS seem to like the fact he has kids.<br>
<br>
Its allmost as if they find him more of a man becuase of it... More able to impregnat them or something.  I dont know.  Its a weird vibe.  Only if they knew its simply becuase he is a male whore who never used a condom once in his life, HAH! <p><br>

Mind you she was a flake so it was a bad impression of the whole online thing.<br>
I was suprised about how many women there were in my area that actually use the service though. It may require some more looking into.<br>

In any of these situations be it kids or no kids just be honest about what you expect out of the relationship and what they can expect from you.  Always hear from the guy first what they want from the relationship or the jerks among us will just tell you what you want to hear to get you in bed.  And when they go first if its all lofty promises of love and devotion don't buy it.  No guy really thinks like that and the ones that do are either a bit psychotic or lack experience/maturity in dating and are prone to BS puppy dog love.  Both of which you don't want anything to do with if you're wise.<br>

<br>
I know it's not the 1950's and men no longer &quot;do the right thing&quot; i.e. marry a woman whom they've impregnated.  Also the marriage ratio is way low and the divorce rate is way high.<br>
<br>
I'm not old at all, quite young, but I wish it were still the days when people met, got married AND THEN had sex and kids, that's what it's for you know.<br>
<br>
If you get involved with a single mom, subconciously you'll feel pangs of resentment towards: the kid for encroaching on your relationship with the woman; the kid not being your own flesh and blood; the father for not taking responsibility ... etc  These are natural feelings.  Also the child may feel resentment towards you for the same exact reasons listed above.<br>
<br>
You're over 25 you need to be more mature about how you approach women anyway.  You need to start thinking in terms of relationships more than just knocking boots.  Trust me if you don't, you'll look up and be 40 or more and most likely lonely.  I understand that you meet attractive women and like them.  That's how it's supposed to be.  That's the first step.  Attraction -&gt; relationship -&gt; marriage [ a christian word, you can use any other word you like here ] -&gt; children [ this is how you live forever, or didn't you know ]<br>
<br>
Relationships are emotional.  Girls are emotional.  Boys are emotional.  Adding an extranious child in your would be relationship only adds to your feelings.  I know my parameters and I walk away from those situations immediately.  Don't play with the females emotions, nor the child's.<br>
<br>
Now lastly, don't create such a situation yourself.  If you're serious about  a woman, you should never go in thinking that divorce can get you out of a bad situation.  With this in mind then, you should make a good sound decision of whether you really want to marry someone.  Flimsy reasons for getting married should be thrown out.  Infatuation isn't a good reason either to get married.<br>
<br>
I'm the only child of a ... basically single mother [ father died before i could remember and they divorced before that ] single parents aren't a family unit.  The child needs the mother and father right there so that their development is perfect, so that they may observe closely, so that they can get from each sex what each has to teach, so that they can observe a sound relationship between a man and woman.<br>
<br>
I wish you all well.  Love yourselves.  Love your children.  Love your significant others. <p><table width="350" border="0"><tr><td width="144"><div align="center"><img src="http://www.geraldfield.com/nadinesplace/calvinquiz/spiff.gif" width="142" height="125" align="absmiddle"></div></td><td><div align="center"><b><font size="3">You are Spaceman Spiff!</font></b><br><font size="2">Zounds!

The following might make it look like I am a woman, but I am a guy.  I want to make this perfectly clear because, frankly, Anarkhan scares me! hehehe.  Also, I do not have a daughter of any age!<br>
<br>
If you look at things from the woman's point of view, she's got a kid or kids that she would probably like to see with a decent father.  There's a good chance that the natural father (assuming he is alive) isn't what she would consider a good father for whatever reason, even if the only reason is that she simply doesn't like him.  Who does she love most in all the world?  It's almost certainly her kids.  So, it is reasonable for her to be looking for a good father-type first.  Then, if she thinks you make the cut in that area, she might start checking you out for boyfriend/husband potential.  So, if she seems to be putting an unusual amount of emphasis on her children, that is probably why.<br>
<br>
Also, talking about the children is often a good way to separate the casual daters from the ones that have &quot;honorable intentions&quot;.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is a real turn off to men, not because they don't like kids, but because being a father typically means MARRIAGE!  And while most men (honestly) would like to be married one day, having a woman dropping what appear to be strong hints about marriage right at the very beginning when you barely know each other doesn't go over well!<br>
<br>
A woman with kids who is practical is not going to try and hide them from you.  They are an extremely important part of her life.  If you have a problem with hearing her talk about them, if it &quot;spoils the mood&quot;, then you should probably go find you another woman.  Likewise, if you can't love her children (in a clean, wholesome, non-Anarkhanish sort of way), then find another woman, no matter how appealing she might be to you.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that if you end up with a woman with one or more children, that you will end up with a connection to the father of those children and to his family, whether you like it or not.  So find out a little bit about him before you date his ex, things like whether or not he is a member of the Manson family who gets out of prison in less than a year.<br>
<br>
If any of her kids have problems, you will have to deal with that.  If one of them is addicted to crack or likes to torture small animals, that will become YOUR problem if you marry her.  And even though she may like to talk about them as &quot;our kids&quot;, meaning yours and hers, just wait until you do something with them that she doesn't like, like spanking one of her children if she is against that sort of thing.  Then suddenly, it's, &quot;Get your hands off of MY child!&quot;  Notice how the &quot;our&quot; becomes &quot;my&quot;.<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind with any divorced woman that there may be a darn good reason she couldn't stay married.  Or perhaps I should say &quot;a darn bad reason&quot;!  A typical divorced person will not say stuff like, &quot;It was my fault!  I am so unforgiving!  I drove my ex away!&quot;  No matter how much it might have been the fault of the person you are talking to, they almost invariably blame it 100% on their ex.  I know a woman that is on her fifth marriage.  I would like to think that she has just had bad luck, but I have to figure that there is SOMETHING wrong with her, even if it is just appallingly bad taste in men.<br>
<br>
Many men, including myself, would like to have their own kids one day.  If I marry a woman with five kids, I couldn't afford to have my own (biologically speaking).  That is not to say that I couldn't love her kids as my own, but I would still like to have my own if I can.  Some women with children are desperate for financial assistance and it often shows.  Sometimes these women want to find and marry any man that would make a half-way decent father and help her support her children.  I sympathize with them, but I don't want to get a woman who is marrying me for my wallet, even if she is doing it for the sake of her children and not out of greed.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think that divorce has gotten way out of hand these days.  You are supposed to figure out if you are ready to spend your life with someone during the dating phase of the relationship.  Marriage is not merely advanced dating!  Too many people rush into marriage, convinced that love will conquer all.  It won't!  If you marry someone that is vicious, or unforgiving, or unfaithful, or lazy, or whatever, then you will NOT change them!  In fact, odds are good that the very best behavior you ever see from that person will be while you are dating.  It tends to go downhill from there at least a little bit.  If you date someone long enough, it becomes more and more difficult for them to conceal stuff from you.  If they like to cheat on their significant other for example, they might fool your for a month or two, but eventually there's a good chance you'll figure it out.  I highly recommend long engagements for this reason.  I also recommend that you marry someone who is religiously and politically compatible with you.  Is there anything you believe in strongly enough to get mad over?  Why not find someone who shares your beliefs in that area?  If your religious beliefs are important to you, marry someone from your own religious group.  I know it sounds funny hearing stories from comedians who come from a family where one parent was Bhuddist and the other was Jewish or Catholic and Mormon or Muslim and Baptist, etc., etc., but if either partner in such a marriage takes their beliefs seriously, it tends to cause a lot of grief somewhere down the line.<br>
<br>
And then, after getting married, too many people give up too easy or leave for the wrong reasons.  Now, I am not saying that a woman should stay in a marriage where her husband is beating her or heaping emotional abuse on her or cheating on her or molesting their children.  But if all he does is leave the toilet seat up and throw his dirty socks on the floor, she needs to learn to live with it.  Likewise, if your wife doesn't do everything just the way you think she should, learn to live with it!  I know this sounds odd, but marriage isn't about being happy!  Don't get me wrong.  If there is no happiness in your marriage, then something is horribly wrong, but there is no such thing as a marriage where everyone is happy all the time.  A marriage that doesn't go through some hard times is a rare sort of marriage.  When I say a marriage isn't about being happy, I say that because so many people get married to someone because that person makes them happy and then when they go through a non-happy period, they think it's all over and leave.  BAH!!!  What a bunch of wusses!  <br>
<br>
I don't condemn one parent families.  Many people from such families turn out just fine.  But a lot of them don't.  It's good for children to have a father AND a mother.  Boys tend to model themselves after their fathers and marry women that are like their mothers.  Girls tend to model themselves after their mothers and marry men like their fathers.  Take away one of these examples and it is possible to end up with some kids that have problems, that have difficulty forming relationships or keeping them.  Not to mention the logistics of taking care of children for a single parent can be a nightmare, especially if money is tight.  <br>
<br>
I am a fundamentalist, although I have to say that Fadingcolours and I would probably disagree on a number of things.  Yes, I wish that everybody did things the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way, but I don't really expect them to do so nor do I hate them when they don't.  I wish people didn't smoke crack or drive drunk, but they do.  I can't change that.  I don't hate them for doing it, but I wish they wouldn't.  It saddens me more than it does anything else, like seeing a friend or relative destroy his life with drugs.  That's basically my attitude towards people with a more &quot;liberal&quot; morality so to speak.  Marriage is important.  Sexual fidelity is important.  People who value these things are not messed up or dysfunctional or full of neuroses.  They are often happy, well-adjusted people who gain a great deal of joy and satisfaction out of their way of life.  I know this isn't what Deirdre said, but when I read her postings in this thread, I visualize her saying stuff like, &quot;Death to the intolerate hatemongers!&quot; hehehe.<br>
<br>
Regarding the idea of chaperones, hmmmm.  I could see that working for SOME teens, particularly the younger ones, but even if all you plan to do is hold hands, having someone looking over your shoulder all the time on a date would not be conducive to a relaxed mood.  Maybe if the chaperone kept their distance it would be okay.  I know if I had a daughter and Anarkhan went on a date with her, there would be very big, well-armed chaperones with bad attitudes who would be constantly cracking their knuckles and glaring at him and saying things like, &quot;Keep those hands where I can see them!&quot; hehehe<br>
<br>
Regarding having hordes of concubines and wives, you guys are too much! hehehehe!  Everyone that I have read about who went that route got all kinds of grief from it.  It just ain't worth it!  Oh, your adolescent fantasies tell you it would be worth it, but trust me, it isn't!  <br>
<br>
ACK!!! Just noticed the time.  I gotta get some more work done and then get to bed so I can get up for work in the morning.  Later, people!<br>

&lt;my anti-child rant&gt;<br>
Guess it depends on the girl. I can't think of anything that would make me run faster or further, personally.  Yes, it's nice to see daddys with their kids. Would I even briefly consider dating one? Not on your life.  I have zero interest in raising children of my own, let alone taking on someone else's.<br>
&lt;/my anti-child rant&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;all-new rant&gt;<br>
This is going to sound nuts, but I actually know at least two girls (the sort with maternal tendencies) who would LOVE to take on a guy with a kid, because (get this) they want kids but they *don't want to lose their figures*.<br>
<br>
Is that mind-blowingly scary or what? If they're not even prepared to go through the pregnancy to get a child - because they might end up 'fat' - are they really prepared for any other kind of hard work that comes with being a mother??  Hell, I don't have a maternal bone in my body, but that doesn't stop me from seeing that there is something very, very wrong with that picture.<br>
&lt;/all-new rant&gt;<br>

Edit: had to add this little thing on Marriage after reading the post above.  <br>
<br>
The most accurate statement I ever heard about marriage was this:<br>
You don't marry someone you 'can live with'... you marry someone you can't live without. <p><br><a href="http://spacefem.com/uselessquiz/index.shtml">

In my personal opinion, MOST such people, if they suddenly found themselves headed for parenthood would adapt and end up loving their kid(s) when they were born, but some would have a hard time with it, resent the children, etc., and that is not a good environment for a child to be raised in.  If perchance you have a baby and don't want it, by all means, put it up for adoption!  There are couples standing in line to adopt an infant.  I know one couple that went all the way to Russia to adopt an infant.  They couldn't get one in America.  They spent many thousands of dollars in travel expenses and what-not to get one from another country.  I have heard of a couple that paid all the medical bills for a woman through her pregnancy on the condition that they get to adopt her child when it was born.  She didn't want to keep the child, so she agreed.  Later, after the child was born, she changed her mind and decided to keep it.  It was a real mess.<br>
<br>
Also, people who want kids should not marry people that don't want kids.  That's just a divorce waiting to happen.<br>
<br>
I have also encountered women that don't want to have babies because of what it could do to their figures!  A guy I know told me that his brother was married to a woman and she got pregant.  She did not want to have kids because of what it would do to her figure.  Well, we don't always get what we want and she ended up becoming pregant, despite precautions.  He was pro-life and she was pro-choice.  She wanted an abortion.  He didn't want her to.  She got one anyhow.  They got a divorce over it.  Remember what I said earlier about marrying someone with the same religious/political beliefs?  Those two should have never married in the first place.  Regarding the thing about preserving their figures, it seems like a rather shallow reason to me, but I suppose it is their privelege.  I personally can't understand it unless the woman's career is dependent on her looks (model, actress, etc.).  If I were married and wanted to have kids and my wife did not because of her figure, I would wonder just who she wanted to preserve her figure for, because it apparently would not be me.<br>
