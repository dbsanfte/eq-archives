It's primary aim is to provide more content to the high end gamers of EverQuest, whilst still adding some new functionality to improve gameplay for those high level gamers who may not have always been in the uberest of guilds.<br><br>Shawn Lord, a game-designer from SOE, walked us through the demonstration.<br><br>&quot;One of the great things about Planes of Power is that it will once again bring back the ability to form pick-up groups and 6 person groups and still be able to engage in raid level encounters...while there will still be encounters tailored to the current system of en-masse or large guild raids, we are trying hard to make the new high level content as accessible to players as we can.&quot;<br><br>What does this mean to your average EQ'ers?  Let me tell you.  First of all at least every starting city and the nexus will get a 'click' teleporter to the Plane of Tranquility.  This is one of two non-combat zones, the other being the Plane of Knowledge.  Within the Plane of Tranquility you will be able to also 'click' teleport to any other Planar zone in the expansion, provided you have passed the initiation requirements.<br><br>&quot;Initiation Requirements?  Is this going to be Ssra all over again?&quot; I asked the demonstration team.  They responded with the following:<br><br>&quot;Timesinks will not be as bad as they were in the Luclin expansion.  Characters will continue to advance in power as they work their way through the Planes.  Each Planar zone will have requirements but many of these may have multiple paths.  Players will be able to choose: Do I want to do a serious of involved quests or do I want to work on killing the boss mobs.  It won't always be that straightforward but there will be options for players.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is a definite story line in Planes of Power&quot;, says Shawn, &quot;you will begin to see that more and more as you start to play the expansion&quot;.<br><br>So what happens if you wipe out inside a Planar zone that no-one else you know is initiated to help you CR with?  Well to alleviate this a new concept of 'Graveyards' are being introduced.  If a corpse remains unlooted in a Plane for a certain amount of time it will warp back to the entrance area where the Graveyard is located.<br><br>&quot;How long will this time be?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;Well it won't be immediate, we understand people don't want their corpse warping before the end of a fight.  It's something we'll balance out, but we'll probably leave enough time so that there is a small window of opportunity to get a res once the corpse has warped to the Graveyard&quot;<br><br>&quot;We would be really excited to see more people going back into random 6 man groups and socializing more&quot; says Robert Fister from SOE, &quot;we are going to make sure that the travel to the Planes and then the adventure within them is designed in a way that this is possible.&quot;<br><br>I asked about the rumors concerning items which will not work outside of the Planes.  Shawn responded &quot;We will definitely be taking advantage of situational items.  Items which work best, or only, in certain encounters.  But we also realize that people need and deserve items that they can use all the time.  So you will see both in the end.&quot;<br><br>Not on display at the demonstration was the new particle and spell effect system which will also be in the expansion.  &quot;This is really the only major technical advancement we'll have, other than that we are really focusing on content&quot; says Shawn.  The new effects engine will be shown via screenshots and trailers in a few months, it will be the first upgrade to this engine since the games release back in 1999.<br><br>Overall the expansion is looking very good, the team is re-introducing some of the fundamentals which excited players in their Level 1 - 35 days and taking them to the next level.  It should be a fun time once it hits the shelves in late 2002.<br><br>You can view screenshots on this product <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/screenshots2/default.asp?Category=9&amp;Page=1">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22200>Biggwin Spivy's Stuff</a><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40628>Biggwins Tawink's Stuff</a><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52789>Biggwinz Tawink's Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/02 11:04:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2889.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Caster's Realm and PoP Info...</span><hr size=1> I think they stole Sol Ro's spear idea from the War Hammer 40k Eldar Avatar weapon =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaowyth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caowyth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/02 3:13:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2889.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Caowyth/fullsize/gir4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Caster's Realm and PoP Info...</span><hr size=1> Wasn't the new particle engine supposed to be in the last expansion? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uadrizzi01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>adrizzi01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/02 4:18:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2889.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Caster's Realm and PoP Info...</span><hr size=1> nope, sol expansion was just a timesink program made to keep us busy till they are finished with pop =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uanacrombiefellhanded.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anacrombie Fellhanded</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_whitespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/02 8:40:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2889.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://anacrombie.no-ip.org/images/Personal_Photo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Caster's Realm and PoP Info...</span><hr size=1> Nenjin Darkeyes!!!!!<br><br>That was the First thing I said when I saw the pic of that Weapon.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Anacrombie Fellhanded<br>Warlord<br>Death Knights <br>Xegony</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/02 9:12:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2889.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Caster's Realm and PoP Info...</span><hr size=1> To be honest I think they stole the whole model of Sol Ro from that.
