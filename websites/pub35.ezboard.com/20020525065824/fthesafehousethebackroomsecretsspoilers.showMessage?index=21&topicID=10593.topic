I think that some of the items, specifically vulak loot, was absurd for that power level though.<br>
<br>
So ultimately you're looking at the problem in one of two ways.  Nerf the items and their drops, or nerf the encounter.<br>
<br>
The rest of NTOV is very good.  Its challenging.  The item rewards are between balanced, to a little high. But vulak loot was absolute insanity for the encounter.  With basic strategy worked out, any guild with a reasonable amount of capability could kill that version of vulak.<br>
<br>
Now if vulak is spawned once a month, instead of once a week (or more, thx patches), at least that loot isnt the primary source of mudflation.  This assumes the script eventually starts working =p<br>
<br>
Finally, changing the rest of ntov is not the answer.  It was already done once, and I think that was enough.<br>
<br>
When velious came out, Venril Sathir and Trakanon didnt become bad ass.  That would have just been stupid.  Those mobs are a stepping stone for those ready to get to the next level. You say 'if your not prepared for ntov, go get prepared' when i say that NTOV is perperation for bigger and better things in luclin.  Taking that away from the other guilds, so one guild on each server can have vulak loot, is silly.  There are items of equal value (and in some cases better) dropping off luclin mobs anyways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uddubois.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ddubois</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/02 2:51:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10593.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So...its been about 3 months now since the change to Vul</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I pray to Tunare that spoonfeeding the lesser guilds wasn't a primary reason for removing Vulak.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->1) You're use of the word &quot;spoonfeeding&quot; indicates to me I should take the rest of what you say with a grain of salt.  You clearly have some issues you are bringing to the discussion that is impeaching your objectivity.  There exist guilds for which Feshlak or Eashen are exciting and challenging kills.  These people aren't being &quot;spoonfed&quot;, they just aren't having to compete so ferociously with other, more hardcore, players to experience the content.  I think this is a good thing.  I relish any time this game is about PvE and not PvP.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That would be a total miscarriage of justice and shortsighted in the extreme.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->2) In what way is this either a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot;, or &quot;shortsighted&quot;?  Please elaborate.<br>
<br>
This nerf of Vulak has most certaintly opened NToV content to a wider audience.  Tier 1 guilds are no longer highly motivated to crush Tier 2 guilds' efforts to explore the area.  Obviously, opening content to more people, who can make better use of it (as opposed to it being content with dragons with nearly-useless loot you kill to get them out of your way), is a good thing.  With first hand experience, I know the Tier 2 guilds are happy they are not getting crushed.  I also realize that both the Tier 1 and the Tier 2 guilds are unhappy that they will be unable to acquire any more Vulak loot, and that is something Verant should correct.  But it's a bit of a stretch to say this is some sort of a travesty.<br>
<br>
If in fact, it was Verant's goal to allow Tier 2 guilds the opportunity to move to that step of content, one thing they could have done instead was to have Vulak spawn once/twice a month instead of with every NToV pop, or to not spawn him on patch.  Tier 2 guilds would be more likely to have an opportunity at NToV to make attempts at the &quot;Vulak-free&quot; pops, while not removing him totally.  However, Verant would probably say their primary motiviation was to push the Tier 1 guilds into Luclin.<br>

<br>
And i think its quite clear by now that they nerfed vulak to avoid the constant comparing of his loot to that of the luclin bosses, as then it would become very obvious that luclin loot mostly sucks, especially considering that the mobs themself are ten times harder. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufandros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fandros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/02 5:35:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10593.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So...its been about 3 months now since the change to Vul</span><hr size=1> So basically your opinion is that Verant should constantly dummy down zones and encounters till an orc pawn feels happy?<br>

Wow, so your guild was talented enough to farm a slowable Vulak for months and got plenty of loot.  Now that other guilds are capable of killing him, you dog them out and tell them they don't deserve to be able to kill the same mobs that your guild killed during that stage of existence.<br>

<br>
In what way was it &quot;cheapened&quot;?  They didn't make Vulak easier so an &quot;orc pawn&quot; could kill it and get the loots you &quot;earned with you hard work&quot;, they removed him altogether.  I don't see any logic in your arguments, in fact, I'm not even sure what you are arguing.<br>
<br>
These Tier 1 guilds not only got the reward of being firstees, which should be its own reward for bragging rights, but they additionally now have the uniqueness of possessing what are now nearly-artifact level items.  Am I supposed to feel sorry for them, and upset that Tier 2 guilds finally get to play in an inferior version of NToV (which is because the Teir 1 guilds don't bother with it)?<br>

There are 3 things verant bases loot off of.<br>
<br>
1. Mob difficulty(duh)<br>
<br>
2. Duration of Raid(A mob that takes 1+ day to get to will drop better loot then an equal mob thats in the middle of some outdoor zone.<br>
<br>
3. Spawn time(There are 2 identical mobs. 1 is a 3 day spawn, 1 is a 7 day spawn. The 7 day spawn will drop better loot.)<br>
<br>
This is why vulak loot was so good. It took a day+ of raiding to attain(the &quot;reward&quot; of clearing tov) and only entered the game once every 7-8 days at the least.<br>
<br>
Now heres the problem... We all remember when SoL was first released, and the servers were brought down almost every day for 2 weeks straight. Well guess what? Guilds took the opportunity to farm vulak almost daily for 2 weeks, dramatically increasing the mudflation rate on pretty much the best loot on the game.<br>
<br>
Now fastforward to the present... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufrisleafshadow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>frisleafshadow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/6/02 6:25:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10593.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So...its been about 3 months now since the change to Vul</span><hr size=1> [quote]<br>

I'd wager that most of what you consider 'Tier 1 guilds'  were just organized earlier, have an ability for whatever reason have an ability to be at spawns early during the week (when 99% of all patches are done) and up until the recent spawn table changes controlled whatever mobs they wanted. Not every guild had this luxury, especially on some of the older servers, that are still very, very crowded. <br>
<br>
My server had just one guild with this ability for Kunark/Velious expansions, and now has at least 5 guilds at the NTOV/starting NTOV level. I highly doubt if my guild fought the old vulak that we would win the first try or two, but then again we may never get to find out now thanks to the 'spoon-feeding'.  Given that Vulak doesn't just spawn as a treat to uber guilds now has also resulted in increased shots at spawns for the '2nd tier' guilds, which all in all is a great thing because it breaks up a monopoly on uber mobs that a few servers had to deal with.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushamroc1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shamroc1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/7/02 12:34:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10593.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So...its been about 3 months now since the change to Vul</span><hr size=1> I KNOW where Vulak is.<br>

But Velious mobs don't conform to that, or the original game ( you can see they are revamping with CT now, which still hold the same old status quo...train city and lotsa deaths <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ). And on ToV issue VI is trying to upgrade that on Vulak spawn, which i think is dumb. I think they have no clue on those to do it, while also getting SoL content up to par , and now getting on to PoP. Btw, since they have done some changes in ToV, there is still some ugly kinks which they should focus more, instead of revamping stuff that works for the particular expansion.<br>
