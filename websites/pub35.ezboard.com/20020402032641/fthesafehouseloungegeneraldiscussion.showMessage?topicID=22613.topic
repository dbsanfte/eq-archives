Here is the situation:<br><br>I played a shaman to level 55 and acquired my epic.  I started an alt rogue when my shaman was about level 40 or so and have played him on and off since then.  As of late I have come to like my rogue more and have been playing him the most.  My rogue is now just over a yellow to 52.<br><br>So...tonight the guild plans the events of the night.  We kill the big lady in SG, onto lord bob in velks, and then to the general in kithicor.  Well the general is for another rogue in the guild.  We kill the general for him, so alls going great, but they refuse to do my rogue's because he is an &quot;alt.&quot;  <br><br>Up to this point I have never asked the guild for help on the rogue epic, the hate run was done solo and was ported up by a friend's wizard, renux was done with a single group of friends so I didn't get any guild help here.  I have collected all the robes including the Kedge with no help from my guild and have already acquired the quill.  BUT they won't do the general for me.<br><br>Anyone else find it a bit odd that we are already in kithicor, DEs already out of the way, and all we need to do is respawn the general pull and kill and bam...another rogue epic...but no thats too much to ask.  <br><br>If you were in this situation how would you handle it?<br><br>Mugn Mobs<br> <br>ps.  As of late I have made 80% of the raids and continue to put on levels so its not because of a lack of participation IMHO <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uizualxev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izual Xev</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/4/02 11:44:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Worries</span><hr size=1> that is dumb.  as long as your rogue helps the guild they should help your rogue.  my guild is small guild of 23 members including alts, we kill trak with under 3 groups and stuff like that, also we took CT out with little help from another guild, a lot of the members bot other characters.  all of our chanters are alts, lvl 60 and 58.  so i'm just used to helping the person behind the character not helping the character because he is a MAIN.. if thats how they wanna do it you might as well retire ur alt or have alt join a diff guild :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukizdean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kizdean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/4/02 11:49:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Utter and Complete Crap</span><hr size=1> With all the hard work out of the way, all you were asking was another 20 minutes out of your guild.<br><br>In my opinion I would be quite upset over this, I can understand a guild saying &quot;NO&quot; to an alt for loot over other mains, but this is completely ridiculous.<br><br>So, if you are one of his guild officers and are reading this, shame on you.

If they wanted you to default a quill (should it drop), then I would understand completely but to say they wouldn't even kill the General once set up is really out there.  Heck, it isn't like it takes more than fifteen minutes.  There is a potential drop in the quill and possibly some others that would be of use to any guild really.  Sheesh, I guess going after the mask is quite out of the question :)<br><br>I can only suspect this was some method of trying to control your Roguish urges, presumably to keep you focused on the Shaman role that might be of importance to the guild as a whole (?).  Either way, I'd deguild the Rogue at the very least and perhaps consider doing some shopping in terms of which guild I wanted to hang my hat in for all my characters.<br><br>/boggle <p><center><b><font color=RED><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78504>Celeris Tujimson</a><br>Blackguard of The Nameless<br></font></b><font color=CYAN size=2><i>"The church is near but the road is icy; the bar is far away but I'll walk carefully." ~Russian Proverb</i> </font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uabdielalazrad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Abdiel AlAzrad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/5/02 5:05:29 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~irasfel/_uimages/EVO3_26470.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get another guild</span><hr size=1> Well - not to quibble here but my first question would be "Does the guild have a policy on spending time epic-ing alts?"  I've been in a guild before that has a policy of NOT doing so - and while it may seem harsh at first there was some logic to it.  If they don't have a policy on it - well they need one :)   And they need to write it down somewhere.<br><br>The point behind not epicing alts where I was, was that even though yes your situation only required an additional 15 minutes, and we had some similar situations - it opens a can of worms.  The next alt down the road says "Well this will only take 20 minutes - and we did it for Fred..", and after that someone says "It'll only take 30 mins real quick to do my alt shaman's part here.. we did it for Fred and Joe!"<br><br>It's easy to pretty soon end up spending more time epic-ing alts than you are mains.  And epic-ing mains can get bad enough - to the point where it's a damn job description.  I've been involved in it in a medium sized guild and it was pretty nuts, if everyone was doing their alts too oh lord.. the nightmare begins.<br><br>Some folks don't mind doing that - I can see justice on either side - just depends on what people want to do.  I believe the solution that we eventually went to was one epic per person on guild time - alt, main, whatever their call - but 1 per person.<br><br>Sounds to me like the guild needs to make a decision, and state why that's the case - and from there you can decide whether or not that's a play style you can agree with.  <br><br>Not slamming ya, but just some reasons as to why your guild might say this - from experiences I've had.<br><br>Abdiel Al`Azrad<br>56 Leezard Shaman <p><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>It's such a sad old feeling<BR>All of the fields are soft and green<BR>And it's memories that I'm stealing<BR>But you're innocent when you dream<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukiladrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiladrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/5/02 10:33:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get another guild</span><hr size=1> doing an extra general used to only take 20 mins, so not a big deal.<br><br>But maybe your guild feels your asking too much.

At that point I didn't do anything on raids but heal and nuke and thats not exactly my idea of fun.<br><br>This is when I switched to my rogue as to have a more involved part in raids.<br><br>I do understand the arguement that well Alt_1 got his epic so why can't my Alt_2 get his epic and think this is a good reason.<br><br>I guess for now I will continue to try and tag along with another guild to kill the general and I guess if I can't get help from someone else I will eventually be high enough to deserve a 2nd epic in my guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Mugn  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustalkyrweaksoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stalkyr Weaksoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/5/02 12:44:40 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Worries</span><hr size=1> I understand your guild's decision.<br><br>I believe it was not made to piss you off, but for moral reasons.<br><br>It will upset a lot of people if an ALT got an epic, or someone had two epic's.<br><br>However, I do understand that it's a mere 20 minutes.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/5/02 12:45:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Worries</span><hr size=1> Wow, I am shocked.<br><br>When I did my rogue epic(my rogue is my main), I did mine, and default the kedge to myself(cause I lead the raid), after I was done we did 3 twink rogues epics. 3. 2 of them werent even in my guild.<br><br>Once the hut is broken, killing the general is a _cake walk_ if you are properly peopled. Were I to do another raid, if (not sure if it is possible) a 20th level rogue is ready to spawn the general, I would do it, just to have him get it out of the way. Not downing the general for anyone that is ready is just lame.<br><br>You put the time in for your epic, and the last part is easily sitting in front of you, do it. People that are bitter are probably the ones that havent even taken the first step on their epic. <p>Nenjin Darkeyes<BR>53rd Lvl Rake of One Hundred Swords<BR>Xegony<BR>"Dont open your eyes, you wont like what you see.
