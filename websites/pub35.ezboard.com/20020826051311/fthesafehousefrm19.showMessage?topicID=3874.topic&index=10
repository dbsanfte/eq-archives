GL at your new spot<br>
I agree that the assassin`s are not quite balanced yet, but compared to other class types in the game I do believe we are the closes to being balanced so far.<br>
the game has it`s ups and downs for sure. I do agree that you guys should be able to have high enough str to make slashing viable. all the haggling we are doing over 1 extra hit worth of hp`s is kinda a yin/yang thing from my point of view. now from an infils point of view, in these ns posts i believe you guys are either sandbagging that shout opf yours or someone on igrain must have figured out a niffty trick with em . i`m getting blasted by this thing for the difference of the fight. it works very well.<br>
now from everyones posts i guess igrain is the odd server we have many fine sb`s/infil`s/ns`s here but... the ns`s are top of the pile. they are great players and their rp`s show it for sure. yes ns`s are weak, but i believe at lvl 50 it seem`s to even out very well. i do strongly believe sb`s have the upper hand over ns/infils to the lvl 50 mark and that may be what started that whole freaking nerf sb`s craze crap.<br>
does the game still need tweaking for all assassin`s yea.. but I can`t see any game sweeping class changes comming our way. i would like to see them acualy rework LA damage so you would have to spec that high to get it viable. ns`s no idea what u need imho maybe knock spec pts up to 2.3, call me ingorant(i`m sure many will) but.. are both ns/sb`s at 2.2?<br>
<br>
just remeber what comes around goes around-usually sweeping class changes this month lead to sweeping class nerfs 2 months later <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 10:21:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the passing of a game icon</span><hr size=1> If something as simple as the shout damage were upped to 140 base, that would really be all the necessary tweaking, not even having to make it a lifetap. I can live playing with a 63 base shout, I've done so with many months and played with an underdeveloped class the entire time before that. What bothered me about the response were the things they measured (and belief) that those aspects of each Assassin were balancing.<br>
<br>
I don't burn bridges and will not post what was stated, but if you read it, it had a few of those &quot;how can you say this yet things are really like this&quot; kind of response to my request. For example, a statement that said a well speced Nightshade = a well speced Infiltrator with the extra points? Also, that Nightshades on servers with all strength relics do just as well as the Nighthshades that don't? Are those non +20% Nightshades just that more skillful to make up for it?<br>
<br>
On another post about balancing Bards and the AE Mez problem on the same day, the dev stated how important Music was because it contained both CC and their songs? If you know Bards, their CC and songs are kept in 2 seperate specializations, the dev must had been thinking Minstrels or Skalds. This is not just a dev that reads boards and makes posts, but tests out the game. If this represents the knowledge that someone responsible for developing the game is going to use to balance classes, I'm out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 1:54:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Agreed...</span><hr size=1> Not to thread jack or anything, but that was one thing(referrning to bards) that just made no sense to me, and I just couldnt help but to think it was a good sign Mythic didnt know thier own classes. Bards, Minstrels, and SKalds are the &quot;musician&quot; classes of each realm. One thing they all share is Run Speed, Mez, and some chants(dmg add, power regen, heal regen, depending on the realm).<br>
<br>
Skalds are pretty easy to spec -- Battlesongs and Weapon. Battlesongs is the only line they need to spec in to get their &quot;musical/magical&quot; abilities.<br>
<br>
Minstrels are very similar although they can chose to spec in stealth if they want along with weapon and instruments. But again to get their &quot;musical/magic&quot; all the have to do is spec in Instruments.<br>
<br>
But bards... to get their mezz and shouts they have to spec in Music. To get their &quot;musician&quot;(speed, power regen, etc) they have to spec in Nurture. Oh and they can spec in a weapon too if they want to hit something... along with Regrowth if they choose heal as well. But they still get the same amount of spec points as Skalds and Minstrels. I wont even mention the obvious sign of a mistake in the fact that the bards have a spell line called <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MUSIC</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and yet the spell line that actually *requires* an instrument and the spell line that grants them the *shared* abilities like travel songs is actually in the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Nurture</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> line. <br>
<br>
They really jacked up bards from the start and it seems they are still pretty unfamiliar with them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 8:45:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Refuted</span><hr size=1> Pure genius!<br>
<br>
Ignore most of damage that the shout does by offsetting it against a garrote!<br>
<br>
Is Elaa an accountant?  Obviously the DD doesnt count as damage because its a charitable contribution.  Ah, lets not note that its ranged damage because we consider only melee combat.  Lets not consider the front loading for compound interest.<br>
<br>
Lets write off 2% raw damage against reduced (but not by anywhere near 2%) style damage (perhapse the records were destroyed in a flood).<br>
<br>
The only time that the DD has a DPS of 3.15 is if the fight lasts an exact multiple of 20 seconds.  Most fights are decided well within 20 seconds (group fights - duels vary a great deal but snare kiting works well with the DDs).<br>
<br>
Lets not account for the way people actualy fight most of the time (hit and run or jousting), lets not make anything of the fact that you very rarely go below half endurance in a stand up knock down fight with another assassin (and rarely have stand up knock down fights with anyone else).<br>
<br>
The 63 DD is ranged, instacast, and front loaded.  The end cost is imaterial in 90% of fights and in any case you can cast the DD when OOE (unlike infiltrators or SBs who cannot use a ranged attack when OOE).<br>
<br>
Front loaded: if the fight lasts 10 seconds (i.e. someone is assissting the NS to kill) its effective dps is 6.3 if the fight lasts only 5 seconds (e.g. a typical hit and run: PA, CD on a caster) its effective DPS is 12.6.  If the fight lasts only 1 hit then its effective DPS is 63.<br>
<br>
Lets put some weighting on this and say that 1 in ten fights lasts exactly 20 seconds, 5 in ten last 5 seconds and 4 in ten last 10 seconds.  That gives an adjusted Effective DPS of 9.4 for the shout.  5.9% more total DPS than an infiltrator.<br>
<br>
So the nightshade has the best offence of any assassin by a significant margin.  The nightshade has two more offence RAs than either of the other two assassins.<br>
<br>
Defence:<br>
Your analysis takes only stats into consideration and not the smallness of Lurikeens which is an important defensive feature.<br>
<br>
Your analysis does not take buffs into consideration.  A well buffed and equiped NS will have arround 250 con (may need Aug con 1 I don't know hibi buffs) and the benefit of con drops off by about half after that point.  So the defensive stat advantages that a Briton enjoys are far less significant than your analysis would indicate.<br>
<br>
The only physical stat that is dificult to get to 250 is Quickness because there is no base buff and few items.  Infils who don't spend starting points in qui will have dificulty hitting this cap, no NS will have trouble.<br>
<br>
You fail to remark that no assassin has 'good' defence and relies on tactics and competant support for survival in many situations.  Hibernia has superior support classes (Warden, Bard, Druid).<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
The nightshade is superior by a significant margin, mostly due to the potent shout spell which not only out damages every other assassin in the overwhelming majority of battles but has multiple utility for disrupting an oponant.  Night shades have stats well suited to the role of assassination and benefit most from potent buffs which are often available in Hibernia. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aach</A> at: 8/3/02 8:48:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravnnevermoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravn Nevermoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/4/02 11:38:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Refuted</span><hr size=1> I've become more and more convinced that NSs are just as balanced as the rest of the assassins out there. <p>Ravn Nevermoor<Br>50 infiltrator<Br>Aeonian Prophecy<BR>NERF PBAE AND BUFFBOTS!!!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uolmoss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Olmoss</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/4/02 2:58:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Refuted</span><hr size=1>  I love guys that dont play nightshades telling us how wonderful we are..<br>

Testing shows only about 5% difference in damage between a 50 weapon specced and a 60 weapon spec char. Nightshades have shout dmg to make up for those difference. Shout is also a nice utility to pop stealther, interupt casters and stuff. <br>
<br>
As for Nightshades being defensively weaker, this is somewhat true. They have a little less hps, but evade a little more. Nightshades have the same hp table as other realm's assassins, but Hibernian races have generally lower con. They high dex, and very high quickness. Quickness = dmg. Which you didn't factor in when you mentioned about Nightshades offensive strength. We don't see Highlander tanks complaining about having lesser str/hps than Troll tanks. They live with it, knowing they have more dex and quickness to make up for it.<br>
<br>
Nerf Lurikeens! They are too small! Imbalance! Infiltrators need to have something to make up for this or just nerf the Lurikeens and make them bigger <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umelanu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melanu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/4/02 5:57:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Refuted</span><hr size=1> Hey,<br>

I have a few problems with some nightshades myself.  I have heard that at least one is not buffbotted.<br>
<br>
I can't say that Elaa's testing is wrong, but to flame on the safehouse boards is lame.  Go back to vnboards if you want to post like that Aach.<br>

<br>
It's more difficult for a Nightshade to obtain 44 Weapons 44 CS and will have to take a hit in CD/Envenom, but let's assume that an Infiltrator makes the same sacrifice but brings their melee skills to 49 Weapons and 49 CS. Certainly with realm points and items, any Nightshade can bring those skills beyond 50. However, the same Infiltrator with the same realm points and items can bring both those skills beyond 55 with the same difficulty it took to get the Nightshade to bring them beyond 50. Or the Infiltrator can keep 44 Weapons and 44 CS and face the same challenges as the Nightshade does in bringing them to 50, but have the added benefit of increased damge through DW and Envenom which the Nightshade sacrificed. Similarly, you can argue a well equipped Nightshade with the appropriate gear can take down a same level Infiltrator, but what if the Infiltrator is equipped with the same gear?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Nightshades have shout dmg to make up for those difference. Shout is also a nice utility to pop stealther, interupt casters and stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
Damage wise, I'm not convinced it makes up for all the differences in specialization points. Actual utility of the ability is debatable, mostly pointed out by other stealthers about the potential use. There's also added utility that comes with extra specialization points, but it is a matter of what particular styles a weapon specialization can offer.<br>
<br>
As far as the actual utility goes, poping stealthers are only useful when it's a lower level or low stealth target that I can detect, or standing above a keep climbing column and spamming Shout + Nearest Target. In the event of lower level targets, it is safe to unpop both out of stealth to destealth and rely on the level advantage, and those that have experienced on them were most likely lower level. In field RvR against level 50 Assassins, your opponents are almost always max stealthed, with a detection range just outside of a melee hit. Combined with client-server lag. That is why I keep the perforate button ready when stealthed in Assassin territory because the range of the shout means nothing against high stealth, even when I'm grouped. It is not advantageous to unstealth an equally skilled/equipped/level Infiltrator or Shadowblade with slight benefits tipped in their favor that allow them a better chance to win foot to foot against a Nightshade, even though technically the Nightshade did get the jump or first hit in.<br>
<br>
As far as interrupting casters, most shouts I ever use on casters do not interrupt their casting, and there are several reasons for this. Most of the time when I am running towards a caster, they are using Quickcast which is not interruptible. Also, if a caster is already in the midst of a spell when the shout is cast, the actual time the interrupt starts is a couple of seconds after it is cast, the same way a Nightshade can cast a DD spell after a mob has hit the Nightshade for a couple of seconds and not get interrupted, something SB/Infs wouldn't realize about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Quickness = dmg. Which you didn't factor in when you mentioned about Nightshades offensive strength&quot;<br>
<br>
I did, &quot;Nightshades swing faster by 2%, but it also decreases their style damage which cancels it out&quot; It doesn't cancel it out completely I should have added, but a higher quickness is only beneficial to non-style damage, the styled component of damage remains proportional to the actual delay swung. Most melee classes, including most Assassins, ignore quickness and spend their points in 10 STR/DEX/CON.<br>
<br>
The effect is small, and as you may notice the stat section in the Nightshade Offense section, it only makes up 1.2% of the 16.7% difference. Strength is not so much an issue as other may make it out to be, it is weighted towards the actual class differences. The only part where stats has a significant effect in class performance is Con, where hit points are something that does not have to be tested, and Con also has an effect on damage reduction. The new resists will have a positive effect enough to counter the Con differences, but the damage difference of the class differences still exists and remains the reasons why Nightshades will still deal less damage in melee, even with their shout as it is currently scaled.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: Nightshades are not a gimp class, but the moment you start making Assassin to Assassin comparisons, and Assassin vs Assassin fights occur very often, you can see why Nightshades feel they got the short end of the stick. What if to continue playing your Infiltrator, you had to change your race to Avalonian and had 2.2x specialization points and a 62 base shout. You wouldn't make a bad Assassin, but when traversing the frontier, you had to face Celt Nightshades that have more hit points and 2.5x specialization points, you feel compelled to group knowing that your chances are not all even out there. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 8/4/02 7:14:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=servo>Servo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/4/02 9:50:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Refuted</span><hr size=1> /sigh<br>

You've depressed me, Elaa <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  your tireless work at attempting to make the most of the 13 or so dollars we spend each month is certainly commendable by everybody on this board.<br>
<br>
p.s. Maurith!! I'm on Igraine, Servo/Susan/Cerveaux/Buzzer here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  maybe I've seen you around.. lol.<br>
<br>
p.p.s. oh yeah, that self-inherited Wild Arcana ability sounds awesome...<br>
<br>
p.p.p.s. And finally, yes, Bards need to be fixed. That's not to say that they're gimped... they perform well on the battlefield, mezzing and such, just as nightshades do, but they're simply _less_ than what a similar musician can be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukreigmeister.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreigmeister</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/02 2:12:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3874.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Refuted</span><hr size=1> Aach my shout does the same damage as my garrote and uses as much Endurance.<br>

A fight almost never lasts long enough for me to use my shout twice.<br>
<br>
63 base damage from spell that has no spec means that is varies alot. Not as much as it used too but i still get more consistant damage from Garrote.<br>
<br>
You make several references to how we perform with help. Like saying how effective we are fully buffed. How can you even try to compare that with someone who has no buffs? You can't, to do so does not make any sense at all. Do you realize what your saying here?<br>
<br>
Our big natural quickness advantage gives us a .5% chance to evade over other assassins. It also allows us to do less damage because we are attacking quicker.<br>
