As for my char, this is my first char and I just started playing EQ about a little over a month ago, so I'm clueless about most things.  Im a DE and I threw all my starting points into AGI and DEX, I assumed at the time that that would be useful.  I will also hit lvl 22 tonight.   I constantly get PKd by all classes, even lvl's much lower then me, and only twice have I fought them off cause I was majorly buffed and I think the other person was 4 lvls under me.  My main strategy is bag and zone.  I have never just started the attack either, so I guess I have always been at an initial disadvantage.  But who really wants to try and PK someone and then get whopped up on.  Gear and cash have been big problems for me so far.  From reading and getting PK'd so much, I know resistent gear is important, but that cost money and I only have 60 pp in the bank right now and couldnt risk losing the gear to PC's.  Money is starting to come in a little faster now, but that also mean Im facing higher levels each time too.  Hell, I was using Stilleto of the bloodclaw as my primary wep until lvl 20, then I bought a harpoon of the depths and just moved the stilleto to the other hand.  Alot of my cash so far has been dropped into the trade skills, im a lvl 135 blacksmith so I can make my own banded, and a 56 tailor hoping to make the money bags.  I started the trade skills mainly cause I thought that it would make me money, but that really hasn't been the case.  Also, my armour is all banded except for a split paw mask (+5 MR) and some +2 jewelery.  Any advice would be appreciated ( I just found out about evade yesterday), and I have a couple questions too.  My game name is Vilnayan, so feel free to wave at my corpse as u run by it.  Thanks in advance<br>
<br>
1) NODROP items: I could really use some of this, so my first response isn't to bag.  Is there any NODROP armour within my level range?  I read that Befallen is supposed to drop some prestine leather,  will this be my first option to go for and will I need to wait till 30 to try and get some.  Also, I have read that befallen is back to normal,  what does that mean ?<br>
<br>
2) Mask of deception: Will I have a resonable chance of looting this on my server?  I really dont know that many PC's, so it's really gonna have to be that a group is down there that will let me loot it.  Im already a DE, but I'm pretty sure this is nodrop and MR +7 which is what im looking for.  Please let me know if im wrong. <br>
<br>
3) Poisons: I made my first root poison and it worked great, the guy just gated though so I still owe him 4.  What is going to be the best and cheapest poison that I can farm that will be useful for PvP.  I just collect a stack of asp poison sacks.  So I am thinking blind will be good, but still kinda pricey.<br>
<br>
4) Guilds:  I have always declined joining guilds, but is that going to be my best option now.  Pk guilds seem to be the most willing to help if you join their guild. But will I be stereotyped as part of a PK guild at higher levels.  I dont want this to cause me any problems later on, like if I ever get a chance for my epic. <br>
<br>
5) Alts:  Should I just worry about leveling for now and assume that the PvP aspect is for the twinks.  Then only get involved after I am high enough to create an alt rogue. <br>
<br>
Thanks again, and sorry for the grammer mistakes         <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umordier.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mordier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/01 8:03:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advice 4 worst rogue on RZ, kinda long</span><hr size=1> Hmm, where to begin heh.<br>
<br>
First of all, the rogue's biggest advantage is surprise.  If you get the jump on someone you've got a great chance of victory.  If you get jumped, it's a heck of alot tougher to win.  You need to think like a rogue; hunt.  Hunt your prey.  There were times where I shadowed someone for over 20 minutes waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and b/c I didn't see the right situation I let them go.  It's the thrill of the hunt that is most exciting.  You sound like you've mainly been the hunted.  Become the hunter.<br>
<br>
Have confidence in yourself.  If you enter a fight being afraid that you're going to lose, you'll lose.  If you enter a fight thinking about what you're going to bag first, you'll lose.  Sounds cheesy, but it's true.<br>
<br>
Poison.  Learn it and live by it.  There are great poison guides here on the Safehouse.  Use them to learn the skill and then apply it to your battles.  It'll take a little while to get the hang of it, and you'll waste some time gathering components, but without it you'll always be a poor-man's rogue.<br>
<br>
Ok, to answer your specific questions:<br>
<br>
1)no drop items.  Well I only had two I think.  The burning rapier and the mask of deception.  The rapier is a great weapon, read up on the quest.  <br>
<br>
2)Mask of Deception.  This will be simple for you to get if you're a dark elf.  Just get a map of Guk (upper and lower) and sneak down there.  If there's a group at the spawn site just tell them you'd like to loot a mask.  It should be easy really, aside from the obvious mob danger.<br>
<br>
3)Poisons.  Root and snare are the two best, blind is also nice when used in the right place (it's great indoors).  The cheapest ones that are still valuable are the dot poison and weaken poison.  Weaken, if used on the right opponent is a great way to snare someone (their str goes down and they become encumbered).<br>
<br>
4)Guilds.  Dunno, I played on Vallon Zek<br>
<br>
5)If you make an alt, don't make a rogue.  Stick with what you have.<br>
<br>
  You'll hurt a little b/c you didn't put any points into strength, which is arguably the most important rogue stat, but it won't be a big deal.  Boost your str a bit with items and you'll be fine.  Get it up over 100.  Don't think about starting over, just use what you have to your advantage.  <br>
<br>
  That's it for now, hope it helps some.  Realize that alot of the people you're fighting have been playing this game for a long time.  Simple experience makes a big difference, so you'll just get better the more you play.<br>

<br>
I can't speak for other non-Zek servers, but on tunare, it's usually pretty easy to duel some bored people or organize a guild arena event, and you don't lose loot or money then. Not to mention it's much easier to get gear.<br>
<br>
Just saying maybe you'd like to try a blue server. I might be able to help you a bit if you like. I can't give advice on the zek servers tho, since i don't play on them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/8/01 5:16:58 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> There are reasons to be on a P v P server even if you are on the losing end.

I'd advise anyone new to EQ to play on a Zek server, period, and specifically SZ given the silly stuff going on on the others, immo healing still existing, pking stigmatized, etc.<br>

The whole experience of EQ is so much richer when there are zoning, wandering, superintelligent (Well...) mobs of all levels wandering through most zones in the game )<br>

Well, im kind of glad that I choose a pvp server.  It just adds a level of excitement sometimes.  I do get ganked alot, now it seems by groups more then just single players.  But overall I wouldnt switch to a blue server now.<br>
<br>
I was mainly looking for some advice that would help me in a pvp environment for a lower level then 40.  It seems like alot of the advice is mainly for the higher levels.  But now I found that some other site lets you search for items that are NODROP only and effect, so that will help me out allot.  It seems to me now that being a lower lvl first char that the key is really either being the hunted or the hunter.  If I am the hunted, I really dont have much of a chance.  But if I chose the situation to attack, then I have a decent shot to put up a good fight.<br>

<br>
I would advise getting Magic Resist gear ASAP, as a high MR will help you live longer (or get away easier) than any other resist. Items to look for: gold wolf's eye bracers (+7x2), silver wolf's eye necklace (+4, platinum is too expensive to risk at your lvl), bloodstained mantle (+3 str, +10 MR), dwarven ringmail tunic (+7 or 8 MR/FR/CR), runed bone fork (+10 MR/FR/CR) = total MR +46 with your base of 25 = 71 MR. Granted with 60pp in the bank you could probably only get the necklace and bs mantle for now, but these are easy enough to save up for. Don't worry about losing these items either as it is easy enough to set up a hotkey bank to quickly bag them if necessary.<br>
<br>
As far as guilds on RZ are concerned, there are many PK, anti-PK, and neutral guilds to be found. Invitations into many of them are not too hard to get and undoubtedly a guild to hunt with will provide you some protection from gankers. If you're worried about your reputation then don't join a self-proclaimed PK guild, and if you'd rather avoid most confrontations then look for a more neutral guild as anti-PK guilds tend to fight as much if not more than some PK guilds. Honestly though, having had characters in all 3 types, very few will truly remember you unless you are a &quot;hardcore&quot; PKer and go on daily killing sprees for several weeks. Everyone on RZ has killed other PCs from time to time whether in self-defense or just for kicks, and no one expects you to have a perfect reputation just to be viable in the 50+ game. Just as long as people get along with you, you should have no problems.<br>
<br>
As was stated earlier, get some experience on the attacking side of PvP. You'd be surprised how many people will run from you after a nice backstab followed by a flurry of hits that they weren't expecting. Look mainly for INT casters as targets early on, avoid melees til you get used to strafing and jousting unless you have a few blind poisons ready. Casters are easy to interrupt if you just keep beating on them, plus not all casters will spin fast enough to keep you from getting backstabs in, so you should have no trouble winning.<br>
<br>
Look my monk up if you need some more in-game pointers since he's near your lvl he could probably help the most.<br>

I suppose this is sorta pretty obvious, but I have seen lower rogues kick ass with the right weapons. As for armor, first off since you can make your own banded for cheap, I would suggest wearing it and not bagging it when fighting. AC can play a big part in not getting creamed by pets and other melees. You also won't have to spend your time bagging and can focus on the killing. But you may not want to take this advice since you might be getting killed a real lot and would have to be replacing the lost banded all the time. I just feel more confident when I have gear on when killing people, and unless you feel banded is too precious to lose, it can be a real benefit to not care about bagging.<br>
<br>
I won't try to give anymore advice because it probably won't help. I practically never pvp'ed at lower levels, so I don't have any hands on experience to tell about (I was past level 30 within the first 3 months of Rallos and the server was a little tamer back then).<br>

1) Just asking PvP doods at random for advice &quot;/who all ro 30 40&quot;  or even higher.  Im gettin Ganked - I love the class - Where can i get X.<br>
<br>
I sneak onto Rallos and ask Random 55 60 for advice - i kinda wanna start out on the best foot possible when in get into PvP.<br>
<br>
2)  Level Ferociosly as fast as you possible can.  Im coated in No Drop planar gear.  The only thing id be pissed someone could lewt is my FBSS.  Great Gear - most have resists - cant be lewted.<br>
<br>
3)  Look at your resources - Websites ect.  Go get ur stuff.  <br>
<br>
4)  Join a guild - Freelance seems to come with a bad cost in PvP.  <br>
<br>
I must admit being on a blue has been fun - but I really do wish i could hear the squeels of the Halflings and Gnome as im runnin past them.  My backstab button has been less than gratifying in that respect.<br>

wizards- root<br>
enchanters- root, all enc dots, spells that lower your str<br>

rangers-root and snare<br>
shadowknights- darkness(snare basicly)<br>
clerics- root<br>
shamans- root (pumice will not remove any shaman dots)<br>

There are a lot of twinked alts running around pking because verant is too stupid to put lvl limits on items on pvp servers as an untwinked rogue there isn't much you can do but avoid them or make a necromancer and pk them with hard to resist dots ). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=elegance>Elegance</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/15/01 12:06:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advice 4 worst rogue on RZ, kinda long</span><hr size=1> my advise? from a former de rogue on rallos? dump your de and make a barb right now. put points into sta to get it over 100 then dump the rest into str<br>
<br>
<br>
on rallos your stats really do matter since you cant always wear your gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
get a de mask as soon as you can.<br>
<br>
learn to tailor and wear patchwork everywhere you arent reasonalbly secure.<br>
<br>
get a militia tunic, a great easy nodrop item from freeport.<br>
<br>
hook up with gladiators of no remorse for a good low lvl anti pk guild, they have a higher lvl guild also called knights of no remorse<br>
<br>
if you need some help and advice ask paell if you see her on.<br>
