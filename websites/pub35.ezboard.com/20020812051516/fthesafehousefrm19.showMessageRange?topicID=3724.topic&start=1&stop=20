I posted it to the TL boards but forgot here.. sec while I cut and paste..<br><br>Nightshade Class report for July<br>Overview:<br>Low con for a melee class<br>Balance with other assassins<br>Major Bugs<br>Minor Bugs<br>Concerns<br><br>Introduction:<br>In order to try and focus on the big topics that really need to be addressed to help make shades more viable and balanced this report is kept short with only the big major problems discussed.<br><br>Low con for nightshades:<br>One of the problems with nightshades is our extreme lack of con. The only two races allowed for nightshades (elves and lurikeens) have to lowest con in the game at only 40 points. Even pure casters from other realms have a higher base con. At lvl 50 a nightshade that has even added 10 starting points to con to bring it to 50 only has ~750hp. As a melee class this is just way to low of a con. And add to the fact that shades are the only pure melee class that does not get a con increase as they level up. (Champs and rangers don’t either but are a hybrid and archer respectively)<br><br>In order to fix this about all that can be done is to give nightshades a level based buff in order to supplement their low con. While a conc style buff would be what most players would want a duration based buff might be more balanced.<br><br>Balance with other assassins:<br>Since assassin classes are so similar comparing them to each other is much easier then other classes. When compared to the other assassin classes nightshades are weaker then their other realm counterparts. While not nearly as weak as some whine they do need some sort of boost in their damage output. When compared to the extra spec points of infiltrators or the shadowblade’s use of 2h weapons and left axe the nightshades shout is too weak to balance them out. As the direct damage shout currently stands it adds damage roughly equal to 1 extra weapon swing every 20 seconds if it is not resisted.<br><br>There are various ways in which to help increase a nightshades damage output to bring them up to the other assassin classes. One easy way is to increase the base damage on shout. Another way which would help make nightshades more unique would be to perhaps give them a self only damage add buff. One other idea would be a level based bonus to poisons. This could result in around a 15-20% bonus at lvl 50.<br><br>Major Bugs:<br><br>AE dmg preventing stealthing<br>Currently if a member of your group is using AE it resets the nightshades combat timer keeping them from restealthing. This bug has been tested with PBAE and have seen reports it is also bugged with any form of AE. This is a big problem in RvR where a nightshade often breaks off attacking to restealth to make use of their PA attack or scout.<br><br>PA being blocked/evaded/parried<br>There is 1 of two bugs that is happening with PA in RvR. The hidden CS attacks (BS, BS2, and PA) are not supposed to be able to be blocked/evaded/parried. However there are instances where this is happening in RvR. The difference with these PA attempts is right as one Pas they become visible where as in a successful PA you don’t become visible until after the attack. Either Pas are bugged and can be blocked/parried/evaded or there is some other bug causing players to appear when they PA but it does not have them perform a PA.<br><br>Trying to determine the exact problem behind this bug is hard since it only happens when there is a block/evade/parry but no way to determine if it caused the PA to fail or another bug making you visible results in a normal attack which can be blocked/evaded/parried.<br><br>Stealth and sprinting<br>This was addresses and supposedly fixed but it is still a problem. When you are sprinting if you stealth you keep losing endurance as if you were still sprinting. If you try to stop sprinting you just get “Cannot sprint while stealthed” message as your endurance keeps going down.<br>Minor Bugs:<br>Poisons that are hotkeyed vanish from the hotbars after a player does a trade with another player.<br>Concerns:<br>The Dob spawn for the one time pierce drop is EXTREMELY rare. People have camped and killed all the spawns for days on end without getting Dob to spawn once. It is even worst then Albie spawn. Is there anyway this could be looked at?<br>The Viper realm ability cost 14points compared to the other 2 assassins unique skill (which cost 10) and is the only one that can be resisted making it completely useless at times.<br>The cost of poisons gets to be a problem at higher levels. When doing RvR or solo PvE it is normal to use 2 or 3 poisons per enemy. When each poison costs over 10sp each it becomes a big drain on cash. This is similar to what archers have with their arrows with the exception their costs were lowered and they can craft their own (not a problem when alchemy comes out)<br><br><br>I tried to cover just the big topics and throw in a few small things.  There are still issues for all 3 assassin classes  but I would first like to see us brought up in line with the other 2 classes. <p>Zedisa - Nightshade TL</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hansle>hansle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/14/02 8:15:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3724.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> plz don't give us more spells</span><hr size=1>  if the self buff lasts only 10 minutes you can keep it. i don't have the time to set up a kill and buff. if it could work like con buff and stay that would rock, but for the most part i'm not going to track someone for 15minutes then run off and buff only to take a chance on my losing my prey<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . what if we got a very nice bump in our evade skill, say 50% at lvl 50 this could be nice. i'm against the idea of using buffs to even us out, i much preferr passive skills, they always there when you need them <br><br>&quot;you do realize i'm here to kill you don't you?&quot;<br> hansle 41 ns pellinor<br> kykx 14 ns mordred  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/14/02 10:41:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3724.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: plz don't give us more spells</span><hr size=1> Self buffs are bad for Nightshades.
