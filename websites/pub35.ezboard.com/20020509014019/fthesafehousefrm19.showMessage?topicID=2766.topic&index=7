I'll leave the polls up and running for a while longer in case anyone else decides to vote.  Remember, some of the Mythic people stop by here, and they may see the results of the poll.

<br>
What 3D is doing is trying to head off the inevitable nerf bat that is already preparing to swing in the general direction of the assassin classes.<br>
<br>
It's like the video game industry - see all those warning labels?  It was do it themselves or have it enforced by a govt agency.  Guess which one is better for the game-makers? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Very recently a series of duels were done between a L50 infil and L50 warrior.  Both among the most experienced players of their classes in the game.<br>
<br>
The infil won 3/4 of all the duels.  That was when the warrior KNEW the infil was coming for him.  The fact is that right now a solo assassin can take out almost any class in the game - if they are solo.  That's not the way the class is designed.<br>
<br>
3D recognizes this, and has seen that the nerfbat is incoming.  He'd rather see some self-regulation done, with specific hits that are a bit controlled.<br>
<br>
The two areas that are overpowering assassins are PA and envenom.  Do you really want to see both those abilities denuded?  Or would you rather see some controlled actions taken to remove the specific issues that are creating overpowered assassins?<br>

<br>
It seems that most people don't see the whole picture as far as the rogue classes are concerned.  My personal opinion is that rogue classes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> overpowered in PvP, but similiarly underpowered in PvE.  If Mythic were to swing a nerf bat, I'd hope that they'd increase the PvE potential of rogues to compensate.<br>
<br>
Most people here can't look past wanting to be uber in PvP, and most of their whining is just ridiculous.  I liked the idea of some rogues being good with poison, some being good at critical strike, but both being effective.  Somewhere along the way, rogues were basically given the ability to easily max effectiveness in both of those, stealth, AND a weapon ability.  Unpopular as it makes me, I don't think that's right. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upeebs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peebs</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/13/02 3:36:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravnnevermoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravn Nevermoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 4:29:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2766.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How about a respec poll</span><hr size=1> I will say I have to agree with a stealth change, but don't with the envenom change. As it stands now, yes stealth should get a boost for those of us who have spec'ed higher than 40 in stealth. Increase stealth speed and increase DH ranges at intervals from 40 to 50 spec. All the other skills have bonuses right now, it's almost impossible to find the super SBs that run around wielding 2h swords. Do you really find it equal that I should see someone with a base spec of 36(50ish with rank/items) at the sametime they see me with a base spec of 50(65 with rank/items)? All the other skills get new abilities whether it be better spells or better melee styles, why shouldn't I receive the same because I've sacrificed my melee for stealth? As it is SBs have a whole skill, if not 2, they can neglect and still be able to hold their own. SBs don't have to train 2h skills or DW if they use a 2h sword. <br>
<br>
Also, something to point out would be what class was the assassin in those duels? I doubt very seriously it was a NS or infiltrator as I've never killed a warrior before except one time I got lucky on a thane. All the time, I've seen a couple SBs take down even level paladins on the palomides server. Please understand I'm not saying nerf SBs, but there is some serious distinction between NSs/infiltrator's damage on a PA and a SB's PA. <p>Ravn Nevermoor<Br>50 infiltrator of Aeonian Prophecy<Br> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravnnevermoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravn Nevermoor</A> at: 4/13/02 4:37:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=prudetristan>PrudeTristan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 4:32:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2766.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Reply</span><hr size=1> What I see as a problem is that infiltrators get 2.5 spec points.  This is such a huge advantage over other assasins that if there is a nerf to all assasin classes this needs to be addressed.  <br>
<br>
For 3D knight:  (Please read)<br>
<br>
I see you saying infiltrators get 2.5 because we get the 40  to 60 extra hp at 50, can use 2 handers, and get left axe styles.  <br>
<br>
People please correct me if I am wrong no high level shadowblades use a two hander except for the rare time there is a solo member of an enemy realm that can be one-shotted.  Maybe if they are oneshot wonder spec'd.  I really dont know because there are none on Tristan that I know off.  You seem to fixate on the two hand ability as something worthwhile.  Its situational please get over it.  If we could not use two-handers I really would not care.   At 50 two-handers are the fastest way to die to every class out there.  Our left axe styles requires training to a minimum of 34 for any decent styles and this is way above what sucessful nightshade and infiltrator spec points in cd or dw.<br>
<br>
 I understand what the above poster is saying.  I have a hard time seeing PA vs chain and envenom being so powerful vs a warrior.  Warriors usually has 1550 to 1700 hp it they cant comeback and kill a rogue the problem lies with the warrior not the rogue.  <br>
<br>
As far as switching in and out envenom items.  I dont care and personally would rather see mythic spend time elsewhere coding.  The envenom items in midgard are so good that I doubt anyone really cares if we can or can't switch out.  <br>
<br>
I dont see any nerfs coming if there were archer damage is still too high. (obviously another issue)  <br>

I'll gladly correct you here.  All the high level (40+) shadowblades that I've ever fought on Igraine use 2-handers.  They all do anywhere from 600-1000 per opening perforate artery as well.  The 2 handed Shadowblade is by far the most effective &quot;assassin&quot; in this game.<br>

Yes its neat to say I perf'd somebody for 800 but that wont be good enough after everyone has their epic armor.  If you are fighting with a somewhat responsive player they will respond to your PA with something.  If it takes you 4 to 5 seconds for the next swing you can be in big trouble.

By using stealth and abusing a design flaw, 3dknight beat Origen, the warrior team lead. He made &quot;dive bombing runs&quot;, he didn't fight. It took SEVERAL runs like this for him to be able to do it, and it was the ONLY way he could do it.<br>
<br>
3dknight does NOT play a substandard infiltrator, as stated by Kevin (who I'm now pretty suspicious is 3dknight's good buddy, the theurgist TL Morgan, who very much wants this assassin nerf) but an extreme character that went so far out of bounds that before his character was bumped, 3dknight had 10 in thrust at 39th level.....now he has 50. How is that? Why is that?<br>
<br>
3dknight somehow believes he knows best for all assassins (he stated he talked to infils on Pendragon, but we all confirmed that he doesn't and hasn't (that's every single last one that is of rvr level, even battleground). He says this is &quot;to give the casters a chance&quot;, even though they already have the tools to be nearly assassin proof. It was proven very simply by a tank how all the casters whining about assassins can stop 80%-90% of the PA 1-shot deaths, and probably 50% or more of the deaths they suffer to assassins altogether (which is the root of this problem), which is to have a tank guard them closely, with intercept ON. Exampe was given in a battle in 30-35 BG where a tank takes a PA by 2h wielding shadowblade that was intercepted on its way to a caster, and the tank still had time and health left to obliterate the now exposed shadowblade.<br>
<br>
Put in collision detection and 3dknight won't survive one pass with Origen. It was stealth and abusing a design flaw, plain and simple. A flea can kill an elephant if given enough time to chew on it.<br>
<br>
Fix the stealth key spamming, do fix the envenom bonus item problem, but leave PA alone (and all critical hits on CS styles, all styles) do not nerf stealth....and put in collision detection and give the tanks a lesson in the use of the tools they have to protect casters, i.e. guard, protect, and most of all intercept, and give the casters the brains to make sure the tanks do it.<br>
<br>
Run another test 3d, this time have Origen put protect, guard and intercept on Malady (45th level runemaster on Pendragon) and give it your best shot. Try and kill Malady at all. Then when you're done, try and kill Origen again 1v1 WITHOUT running through his body, i.e. you must turn away from him as if his body was solid....and he will shield stun you and chop you to pieces. It won't happen. <br>
<br>
[EDIT:  After checking the bio of &quot;Kevintest&quot; I'm now 100% positive it is Morgan, the Theurgist TL.  He supports 3dknight on the test boards on these issues, without ever having been on the other end.  I'm quite positive he posted here to support his good friend, 3dknight.]<br>

<br>
Didn't post the exact method of the kill because a) I figured if it got out, more people would do it on live, and a nerf would come that much faster, and b) it was posted on the TL-Dev boards only - and as such the details were privilaged info.  So if I posted such publicly I'd have my access removed...  Like Khel here is cruising for.<br>
<br>
3D's char has substandard envenom skill, which is why his character template is imperfect.  And if a weak infiltrator template can achieve a kill consistantly on a warrior, there's an issue.  And it's one Mythic WILL address.  Wouldn't it be better to suggest ways to address it rather than have them take the easiest fix?<br>
<br>
Collision detection is not going to come in - at least anytime soon.  So that &quot;solution&quot; - which it would be, more or less (although if you can PA then stun, you no longer need the run through) - is not going to happen.<br>
<br>
I've never advocated any specific change to any assassin class.  Never.  I've discussed areas where there are problems, but solutions regarding another class is more the province of that class's TL, not me.  I was also one of the loudest voices to get assassins FIXED last fall/early winter, too.  I have always worked for balance in this game, for all classes.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to figure out how to end this post on a high note.  =)  I'm very frustrated that Kheldar has brought private TL/dev info into this thread, and a bit frustrated that my motives are being questioned too.  Sigh...  Only reason I put the post up was that 3D's reasons are simple - he's trying to do his job: directing change to his class as best he can.  Discussing whether or not specific ideas he has are good ones is GREAT.  Blasting him for trying to talk to people about ideas when he's working to save his class is silly.<br>

There are far better ways than this to come up with fixes.  In my opinion, envenom needs to be fixed, stealth needs tweaks, SBs may need looked at for their damage caps, but using 3dknight's test with Origen is 'not the way' to look at CS critical hit damage.  If a mouse takes enough bites out of the cat he'll win.  Even with 3dknight's PA and run method, collision would solve it, and intercept on a caster would keep the caster from getting killed.  Deciding HE knows that removing the extremely rare already critical hits on CS styles is the best thing, is NOT correct.  Btw, I don't call 42 in envenom &quot;substandard&quot;, not by a long shot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=majin>Majin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/15/02 6:08:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2766.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reply</span><hr size=1> Mh, about this &quot;run technique&quot; abuse...i dont get - so you say if i run towards a target - or the target run towards me and i PA him its an abuse of a design flaw ?

My tentative thoughts (noting that I'm not the expert people with L50s are) are that yes, the evenom exploit (put on tons of env gear, put high poison on wpn, then take off gear and put on better combat gear) needs fixing.  In fact, I actually (ducks) question why envenom alone of all skills is given extra &quot;spells&quot; for +spec items and RP?  It's interesting to note that just like the envenom skill, many other skills also get no other bonus for +spec items - take paladin chants, for instance.  IMHO, either ALL spec lines of this nature need to get their new spells/effects like envenom does, or none do.  <br>
<br>
Not sure which it should be - with people already speccing based on env items giving new poisons, I'd suggest just give the other classes the same benefit, maybe.<br>
<br>
Nerfing stealth in any way would pretty much shut down both the minstrel and infiltrator - both of which (assuming stealth minstrel template) rely on stealth to get them &quot;up close and personal&quot; with their opponent.  You basically can't reduce stealth's effectiveness without really hurting those classes.<br>
<br>
Damage caps in general have to be set up so that the one-shot kill POSSIBILITY is removed.  I know that CS hits don't crit often (and it's mostly the 800 pt infil hits and 1000+ SB hits that get the bad PR and the blood boiling).  You know it.  But the player who gets hit ONE TIME by a hit like that does not.  He figures it will happen &quot;every time&quot;.  And he tells his friends, who tell their friends, etc.<br>
<br>
Fact is that one-shot kills (or kills that occur so fast that there is no time or chance to react in any way) between even cons are bad for the game.  They discourage people from trying to play, and reduce the level of skill by increasing the luck factor.<br>
<br>
Personally, my thought is that CS crits are so darn uncommon anyway that it really hurts the class exactly ZERO to remove 'em.  Leave standard CS damage alone.  But remove the wild, crazy, radical damage spikes.  From caster bolts too - they are just as bad.  One thousand point bolts should NEVER be happening.  My opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The only other solution is to base caster defense abilities off the high spikes of damage - which is what will likely happen otherwise.  Casters will be designed to survive 800pt CS +400pt poison strikes...  So unbuffed they'd need around 900-1000hp, or about 300 more than they get now, or maybe a bigger absorb buff.  That's a _bad_ solution though, really - because it bases the whole on the extreme hits, and thus reduces assassin effectiveness on the standard, everyday hits.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - casters are SUPPOSED to die to assassins, almost every fight.  And they do.  Usually so fast they don't have time to blink. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The loss vs assassins should stay - the &quot;can't blink&quot; should not.<br>
<br>
Which reminds me - yes, an assassin should die vs a tank, about as often as a caster dies to an assassin.  3D's best win % vs a L50 warrior should have been maybe 5-10%.  Not 75%.  Tanks are the &quot;predator&quot; class for assassins - and are supposed to kill them with GREAT consistancy, if they find them.  And yes, he used specialized tactics - but now that Khel has so kindly published them, so can everyone else.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   No, collision is not a solution, because it's an equine lich.  Unfortunately.<br>
<br>
And 42 env with items really IS low for an infiltrator now, Khel - or should be.  A better term for 3D's template would have been &quot;suboptimal&quot;, not &quot;substandard&quot; - since it was nowhere near an optimal template for the style of fighting he was doing.  Would have been much easier in those fights if he had gone to 50 env buffed.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you do the math - and assume that you are trying for a template that can &quot;kite-kill&quot; effectively - then the poison skill is actually even more important than the CS skill - and is VERY, VERY much more important than thrust.  51 buffed thrust and only 42 buffed envenom?  =P  Fifty buffed envenom is now optimal in general, btw - with the new poison buff, and the new Env items, that is NOT hard to get and VERY worth it.  IMHO.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
***  All of the above is the personal opinion of me as a player.  I have played every class in Albion to a decent level (mid+) during the course of the last 15 months of playing DAOC, so I have a decent basis on which to compare the way they play.  However - none of this should be construed as anything but the ramblings of someone bored at work.  They are ideas, and not official in any way.  I don't have a hidden agenda to demolish the Infiltrator - rather the contrary, because I enjoy playing the class.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
***  I am not &quot;sticking up&quot; for 3D's ideas, or posting against them.  I am suggesting that crucifying the guy for doing his best is probably pretty stupid.  And that flamefests directed at people who are asking for opinions and comments are pretty dumb too.  If a TL comes to the public boards (which they are never, ever required to do) to put out ideas and seek feedback, burning them at the stake is a surefire way to ensure that next time, they just make their suggestions to Mythic without asking for the comments.<br>

<br>
Thinking about this, none of 3D's suggestions actually fix the real problem, though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I certainly see where Khel is coming from in wishing for collisions.  That - or some other coding solution (better/faster /stick command, or ability to hit/cast on people who are &quot;inside&quot; you, maybe) - is going to be essential in fixing this, I think.  And collisions would be &quot;nice&quot; just in general.<br>
