You're comparing easy to get Kael plate armor for warriors with Vulak drops (atleast 3 of them).  Not only are those Vulak drops far far more rare, but they also drop from a mob that requires a raid of 60+ people (in VT gear most likely) to kill mobs for 3 hours to even get him to spawn, without wiping out once.  Not to mention you need to clear North ToV to even get a shot at the Ring of Vulak.<br>
<br>
On top of that, we've got like 7 level 60 monks in our guild (and I might add about 15 level 60 warriors...), there is NO WAY that any of those monks will ever get 3 Vulak drops.  In fact, even thinking of a monk getting that simply disgusts me.<br>
<br>
Compare that with getting West Wing armor which is doable with only a few groups.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't consider the other high ac items you listed to be ideal monk gear; better give it to casters, so they can reach 1000+ ac.  Gear I'm interested in has hp, lots of it. <p><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~hjohn/swilvsign.jpg" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uirontaail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irontaail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/12/02 10:03:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/sigs/iron.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Diplomacy</span><hr size=1> Zaask, <br>

I think that they are actually fairly well balanced, I may get shot for saying this on the monk boards, but I do feel that monks should be below Warriors in terms of defensive skills. Although I think that a better answer would be to adjust the class that's having the problem (warriors) as opposed to changing Monks who have settled into their nitch.<br>
<br>
An example of this MIGHT be to raise the Warrior Softcap from 1250ac to maybe 1400ac vs lowering Monks softcap from 1250ac to 1050ac. This as well as increasing maybe the length of hate from Taunt and increasing the actual hate from taunt .. MIGHT b a better solution imho. <br>
<br>
As far as AA skills for monks ... I think that some of the class AA skills for monks are fairly useless ... maybe an increase to skeak (either in terms of %) or better .. some way we could b better at CR / sneaking .. similar to the Ninja theory ... or even some form of Dim Mak (death touch) ... the martial art not the actual name .. such that it could take effect like certain posions.<br>
<br>
Other then more interesting AA class skills I think monks are fairly well balanced in terms of Def / Atk position ... as I mentionsed b4, Monks, Rogues and Warriors are PURE melee and as such should each have a def/atk &gt; hybrids, imho. Such that ...<br>
<br>
1 - Wars take damage best (best Def)<br>
2 - Rogues give damage best (best Off)<br>
3 - Monks are below Wars in Def, Monks are below Rogs in Atk<br>
4 - all Hybrids are below pure Melee in Atk/Def<br>
5 - Pallys and Sks are better at Def then other Hybrids<br>
6 - Rangers are better at atk then other melee<br>
7 - Bards are a tuff call ... would say above rangers, below Pally Sks in def, and below all in atk (hard call on bards)<br>
<br>
Obviously this is a personal viewpoint from playing the game since using Dorians Beta account ... and playing 3+ yrs. 8-) <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45917" TARGET=_blank> <IMG SRC="http://members.cox.net/gstg/ironsig.gif" BORDER=0> </A>

<br>
You're right, the Vulak drops aren't strickly fair, in as much as very few guilds work that ring.  However, even if we pull those 3 drops from consideration, I believe the rest of the items clearly show the tendency.  And I believe I could come up with drops from one of the other boss mobs that wouldn't be quite as good but would still be very good for those 3 we remove.<br>
<br>
NToV respawns on a 3 day cycle as I recall.  Which means without server resets or zone crashes you have 10 shots at the boss mobs a month.  In three months you have 30 shots.  Even if you're sharing NToV, thats a fair number of drops in three months.  And some guilds have been farming NToV for a year or more.<br>
<br>
You say that the Warrior drops can be farmed easier?  I agree.  However, once the Warrior/Paladin/Shadow Knights are outfitted in quested, what else in the way of upgrades for those slots drop in NToV?  I believe there are what, two Breastplates, Breastplate of superiority and Breastplate of Fiery Might, neither of which could be considered a substantial upgrade to the Warlord Breastplate.  Basically there are NO Warrior/Paladin/Shadow Knight only upgrades for those slots in NToV from the boss mobs.  Some of the all/all pieces would be slight upgrades but most are fairly equal to Warlords.  Which means that Monks (also Rangers and Rogues, but thats a different issue) are being outfitted in armor that is equal to Warlords.  Doesn't that strike you as messed up?  Monks being outfitted in armor that is almost identical, where it isn't better, than Warrior armor?<br>
<br>
Once you get out of NToV and move on to Luclin, this changes somewhat.  But the damage has been pretty well done by then.<br>
<br>
So feel free to tell me that the Warriors can be outfitted easier because their drops don't come off the boss mobs.  You're right.  But when they do move onto the boss mobs, where are the better pieces for Warriors?  Why should the Warrior quested legs be 45 ac and the ancient wyvern hide legs be 46 ac?  Where is the sense in that?  In Kunark what was the highest tunic a Monk could get?  15 AC?  And a cobalt BP was 45 AC wasn't it?  My how the world has changed.<br>

Hey if you're gonna find points where armor doesn't align how about looking Kunark class armor.  ALL melee got significant (and now cheap to buy) armor with right click spells on it, well, all except for... monks.  No, monks got armor from a level 30s dungeon which (as usual) has laughable stats for that level.  Then move on to Velious class armor...<br>
<br>
I didn't see any monks calling for nerfs to other classes when Kunark came out.  I didn't see any monks calling for nerfs to other classes when Velious came out.  Then Luclin hits and monks finally get some goodies and you would think monks had beem gettin uber exp on raids all this time from the reaction displayed.<br>

It's not just warriors who can use that armor. Cultural armor is useable by every plate class, and yes most of it is superior to the ToV/Kael Armor for said classes. Even Bards can use the armor you are thinking of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uglatius2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glatius2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/13/02 6:02:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Is that the best you can do?

Baton of royal stature, stave of shielding, one of the velium brawl sticks, oiled greaves, various other odds and ends, most of which I picked up while playing my Warrior.<br>

<br>
Basically a bunch of newb plate wearers saw monks tanking in velks (where the mobs are massively weak for level 60s) and cried nerf.<br>
<br>
Compared to a similarly equipped warrior a monk cannot tank casters effectively due to low hps/resists/no stun/no bash, they cannot tank real hard hitters effectively (like CT mobs), they cannot tank the mid to higher end raid mobs effectively, they have no  taunt, snare, defensive, root, fear, powerful self-heals, lifetap or any of the other tricks that the plate classes bring to tanking.  <br>
<br>
Because those abilities arent needed in velks, newbs saw monks tank and cried nerf.  Take the same monk tank to a real dungeon and see what you are talking about next time.<br>
<br>
No Group chooses a monk to tank CT no guild chooses a monk to tank over a plate class for its raids. This nerf make monks totally gimp to SKs and totally worse than rangers in every way.. and monks are a pure melee class too!<br>

<br>
After the changes:<br>

<br>
SK<br>
= 2nd best defensively <br>
4-5th best melee offense<br>
Lifetap<br>
FD<br>
Fear<br>
Snare<br>
Invis<br>
DA line<br>
DS<br>
Dots<br>
Duel and Solo better than monks<br>
<br>
<br>
Monk<br>
6th best defensively <br>
3rd best melee offense<br>
Mend (&lt; Lifetap)<br>
FD ( &gt; SK FD)<br>
Fear (0 range = have to be toe to toe (i.e. getting hit)))<br>
Poor AC and resist item selection and a weight limit<br>
Some better Discs<br>
<br>
<br>
How is a monk not a gimp class compared to SKs?  Why are most monks that are changeing class going to SKs?  Why are most SKs boasting how theya re going to basically replace monks roles after the change?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ranger<br>
&gt; monk defensively (more hps) AND  mitigation based (i.e. upgradable by AC gear)<br>
Best melee offense<br>
Heals (but weak ones)<br>
Fear (animals only.. but doesnt need to be toe to toeing mob to hit it)<br>
Snare<br>
Invis<br>
Buff others and self<br>
Nukes<br>
Archery<br>
SoW<br>
DS<br>
Solo and possibly duel better than monks<br>
<br>
<br>
Monk<br>
&lt; ranger defensively (less HPs) AND avoidance based (i.e. hard to upgrade)<br>
3rd best melee offense<br>
Mend (&gt; Ranger heals IMO)<br>
FD <br>
Fear (0 range = have to be toe to toe (i.e. getting hit)))<br>
Poor AC and resist item selection and a weight limit<br>

<br>
<br>
Basically monks are being cripppled to end up as a weak hybrid with 2 good skills rather than all their spells and relative combat strengths. <p><BR><I>In the wilds of Antonica, the forest <a href="http://www.odanuki.com/Gallery/article.htm">Tanuki</a> were renowned for their sneaky ways. </I><BR>

<br>
Offense~<br>
<br>
First off Monks have the best melee damage from the front, period. This isn't even disputable. Rogues have the best melee from behind. Rangers 'melee' ability is comparable to a warriors depending on what weapons the ranger and warrior are using - and whether or not the warrior is tanking. <br>
<br>
Ranger's ability to use archery is not even melee, its entirely different. As of right now archery is barely viable in high end encounters, and is only used by Rangers in my guild probably 30% of the time or so. So for perhaps 30% of the time Rangers are top damage dealers - and thats basically no 'boss' type mobs, unless its a rooted boss. <br>
<br>
SKs/Paladins are considerably farther behind monks - if you want to switch to an SK because they will be so much leeter than monks now...go for it. <br>
<br>
Defense<br>
Yeah SKs will be able to mitigate damage better, but hell shouldnt they? monks will still be able to avoid hits better though...I seriously doubt we see SKs becoming the main pullers if that's what you are so worried about.<br>
<br>
Rangers defense &gt; Monks? Well monks mitigation is being lowered and its rumored that Rangers defense is being raised to 240 on test, but i still doubt Rangers will tank better than Monks. As it stands, Chain classes should get hit for less than leather classes but chain classes should get hit more often. I imagine monks will still tank better than Rangers and Rogues - but that is yet to be seen BECAUSE IT ISN'T LIVE YET.<br>
<br>
And also for the most part, Rangers and Monks hitpoint differences are negligible.<br>
<br>
Pulling...<br>
<br>
Is this going to make a huge difference? Hell Necro's can pull Vex Thal now as it is...<br>

Who's to say exactly what these changes will mean? I'm guessing very little overall effect to the game. Monks<br>
probably won't be quicked as rampage tanks so quickly now, and it MAY effect their solo ability - but probably not too much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uetrexvista.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Etrexvista</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/13/02 10:38:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=76>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> you're kidding</span><hr size=1> A monk tank? you are kidding right?  I exps in UP and just for the hell of it I tried tanking a grantu on four pulls.  Well I tanked  'em, it's hit % was 88% and max hits for 199dmg.  I am a 60th monk, 1218 ac, 2400hps or 3.8k buff'd.  As far I as can see high end mobs just don't miss.  We can't tank, we don't have the hp's for it.  This is going to hurt the guilds cause the monks will be eaten alive when pulling.  First even when I switch off to all resist gear ie both earrings, bracelets and rings the mobs spells hit almost all the time.  And now, we are going to take more dmg pulling?  come on.<br>
I am not one to tank unless I have a death wish.  I have learned aggro control ie fd (which kills our dps).  I just pull mobs.  This VI change I hope doesn't hose my only ability remaining.<br>
As with most monks all I can do is wait and see.  I'm just glad I made an alt enchanter instead of a mage.<br>

<br>
Monks defensive abilities were based on them being able to avoid more blows than other melee classes, but mitigate less. The increased avoidance was implemented via code, but the lower mitigation was implemented by restricting the AC on the gear normal monks were planned to use.<br>
<br>
There exists however several high AC all/all, or all melee items. Those were few at the start, but they were highly sought after among monks (Azure sleeves anyone?). Since the Velious and higher expansions, the number of monk usable high ac items has increased alot.<br>
<br>
Technically, Verant should not have included monks as a class on all/all or all melee items and given monks a similar quest result or drop with lower AC but otherwise equivalent. In the same way, but to a lesser extent, the chain classes should have been given an equivalent with less AC than the plate classes get.<br>
<br>
Instead of removing monks from the usable classes on existing high ac gear, and replacing now unusable gear for all monks with some lower ac equivalents, Verant has chosen to use a coding difference to make the monk get less benefits from wearing these high AC items than plate classes. This allows them to still keep the gear monk wearable, and not change the effect of it for people of other classes that might be wearing it.<br>
<br>
What effect that coding difference will have on monks not wearing high AC items remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
As a bonus for Verant, this helps lower the impact of some silly designers putting in high AC monk only items, which was a really bad decision. Those items could have been fixed by changing the AC on the item, but that won't be needed now, since there is a more general fix done already.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Was this a needed change, at this stage of the game?<br>
<br>
I don't know. The other three changes implemented at the same time were all changes which enabled them to put content in PoP that would have been broken had those features remained unchanged. <br>
<br>
 - They beta tested a short duration fight, and found out it was trivial with manaburn.<br>
 - They beta tested a longer duration fight where mana conservation was an issue, and found it was trivial with mod rods.<br>
 - They beta tested the possibilities with increased warrior HP, and found it to give too much increase to the value of CH.<br>
<br>
One guess could be that they were planning to continue the trend with all/all items, and realized during beta testing that monks wearing those new PoP items could much easier than before reach the point of diminishing returns for AC versus many mobs (where that point is depends on the mobs ATK, the guy who tested the Krup knight above would to me seem like an indication that krup knight vs monk has a cap in the neighborhood of 1050, or possibly lower). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushamanixx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shamanixx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 351<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/13/02 8:04:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: you're kidding</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First off Monks have the best melee damage from the front, period.

This is mostly true until you start talking about level 60 rogues with Chaotic Stab. At which point, front/back becomes entirely moot. <br>

Depends on how you consider &quot;farther&quot;. SKs can keep their own hp up considerably better than a monk can, if you take Mend out of the equation, and if they're only taking the occasional blow, better. Lifetaps &gt; Mend.<br>

<br>
Dunno about that. Have a bad streak with the RNG, and you're mulch. An SK will probably have a good 1-2k hp on the monk if we're talking endgame type stuff, which is the entire reasoning behind this nerf.<br>

That's the amusing thing. It may well make us better at soloing if our avoidance goes up. <br>
<br>
The reason, though, that there's been so much outcry about this change/nerf/whatever is simply because a vocal minority has, once again, effected a major change in the game. Quite bluntly, Verant should STOP listening to the players, unless the numbers are in the thousands about a given issue. 1% of the game's population is NOT indicative of a &quot;problem&quot; with the other 99%.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udzenmercedmuir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DzenMercedMuir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/13/02 8:51:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=81>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Monk Changes</span><hr size=1> Changes are coming... I have resigned myself to the fact.<br>
<br>
I only ask we be given a reasonable balance with other melee and hybrid classes.<br>
<br>
Maintain our ability to pull.  (discipline changes if the nerf is significant)<br>
<br>
Make sure we are the second/third best melee class by a good margin. Rogue should be the only class ahead it seems to me.  Maybe ranger when archery is involved.  A sk or pally with spells(fury etc) and similar aa expenditure should not outdamage us.<br>
<br>
Make sure we are at worst the fourth best defensive melee class.  Behind Warrior/Paladin and maybe SK.<br>
<br>
I have been feeling for some time that the gap between ranger/pally/sk and pure melee is closing dramatically.  This seems less then best.  There was always some penalty for being a hybrid in the past.   I'm not so sure there is anymore.<br>
<br>
I would prefer you lower the stats on some items.  All/All or monk only as opposed to nerfing the base defense of a monk.  Just dont remove monk from the useable class on an item.  It would be hard to equip a few slots overnight with reasonable gear.<br>
<br>
While I may have passed that point in the game I think it would be a shame to hurt the pre 60 monks with casual gear.<br>
<br>
If this nerf is only targeted at the high end monk then institute a cap and tell us what it is.  We will complain less.  <br>
<br>
My rogue dinged 37 today... preparing for the nerf to be so bad I dont want to be a monk anymore.   I'm not sure I have the energy to level another class to 60+.  Please don't weaken or change the role of the one I love to a degree that I would consider finding an alternative.<br>

I'm level 58, have 2603hp and 1101ac unbuffed.  I can tank decently in exp groups (not in high level dungeons since I don't do that sort of thing) and I can solo dark blues with ease as long as they aren't tearing my tail off and beating me with it.  The only thing I'm worried about is that when this whole change takes place, what is the casual gamer, such as myself, going to do?  I understand the change was 'needed' in a way, but to drop our softcap to 1050 sounds kind of harsh.  I take hits pretty hard as it is, if I take hits for full I doubt I'll be of any use nor will I be able to efficiently solo (which I don't do too often anyways). <br>
<br>
I know I don't know what the high end game is about, nor will I ever.  It doesn't interest me, to say the least.  I prefer having fun with friends and, if needed, tank a mob that needs to be tanked while the group finishes off the main target.  If these changes do make that much of a difference, my personal use in groups will be flushed down the crapper and I'll be basically at square one again.  Maybe I should go back to the necro and just do my thing like I normally do, heh.<br>

<br>
Let me begin with stating my goal of my message as I posted as some people are thinking wrongly of me:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Unmistakable Voice of Reason:<br>
&quot;Note how Absor jumps into a thread started by a non-monk, basically agreeing with the change to a class fundamental and using logic which is completely fallacious. &quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My goal was to try to calm down monks that read the Verant message wrong. As maybe any guild we also were discussing the monk changes on our guild forum and I saw monks panicking. I reread Verants message to try to understand what was being said going ONLY with that message and my own experience (3 years of playing EQ). My messages goal was to try being objective in analysing what Verant said. <br>
<br>
If you want my opinion (as an EQ player, Shaman, Warrior, SK, Bard, Rogue, Wizard, Magician) about the monk change then I would say considering all that is talked about (yes I didn't form an opinion yet on the monk changes before I made the post) that the change of reducing the mitigation factor of the monks is not the solution to have monks tank less. Except from that my opinion is that monks didn't need a nerf and I'm not jealous when I see monks solo. I also don't mind monks abilities to tank a bit at raids as every melee class should be more or less able to protect other classes such as magicians/wizards etc.<br>
<br>
That Absor did reply to my message could well have been because it was stickied, and yes I also was flabbergasted it became stickied, but I thank the mod for it as this thread became a nice constructive debate about the monk changes. I just hope it wasn't only because my name &quot;Myka&quot; was familiar heehee. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Personally I read this as being that a monk post patch will take more damage overall (after avoidance and mitigation are factored) than the monk does now.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I read it like it was missing the 'and avoid damage' section. If it would have read &quot;they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage and avoid damage&quot; then I would also have read that both avoidance and mitigation was to be altered. Understand that I'm not English speaking from birth and I don't easily read information between lines when it's not in my own language (Dutch).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Zikoz:<br>

<br>
See above, I just made an analyse of the message made by Verant. As the thread grows we see first test results, we see others making good constructive replies about the items and average ac of monks. I refrained from my opinion if or not the nerf was justified, I did discuss/defend though the possibility of the Verant message being read wrong. So I didn't defend (and don't do) their decision. (PS: I hope this section is usefull as defending yourself due to possible flames isn't really constructive to the monk debate.)<br>

Long ago we did HoT (East ToV) as a guild for a week (one or two rounds every night and a couple of rounds in the weekend), and got over 15 BP's/tunics/robes -- not to mention the other armor.

Don't expect any sympathy from me.  Have you ever looked at the monk Velious armor, the Kunark armor (crescent armor I think), the Fear armor?  Most of those armors are inferior in every way, not just ac, but also on resists.<br>
<br>
It's like whining that the hard mobs in North don't drop anything for you, when you already got decent armor that can be done with a random pick up raid.  It takes quite a bit longer to be able to get into North as a guild (primal is almost a requirement, which requires quite a few ST keys).<br>

Yes, the armor is messed up (even casters can wear).  Is that a reason to nerf monks?  No, they're just trying to get something more than the pathetic 6 ac on their Skyshrine quested legs.<br>
<br>
We didn't ask to get armor with similair ac as a warrior; but if its handed to you, wouldn't you wear it?<br>

Fungi tunic is 21 ac, and it's not even monk only.  It's defaulted to monks often though, not just because of the regen, but also because it is the highest AC tunic Kunark had to offer for monks.<br>
The class specific armor monks get in Kunark is mid-level at best, and pales in every way in comparison with Cobalt.<br>

We did get some nice stuff in Velious, and for those few monks able to go to North ToV, it was even ridiculously nice, perhaps too much so, for most though, even Velious was hardly monk paradise.. compare that to the upgrades the other melees got. <p><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~hjohn/swilvsign.jpg" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umezu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mezu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/14/02 6:50:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wow, thanks...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ranger's ability to use archery is not even melee, its entirely different. As of right now archery is barely viable in high end encounters, and is only used by Rangers in my guild probably 30% of the time or so. So for perhaps 30% of the time Rangers are top damage dealers - and thats basically no 'boss' type mobs, unless its a rooted boss.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ah yes, this would be why the group with the ranger in it is getting all the xp on most of our raids.  I don't have a problem with it, as well, archery is quite superior to melee damage.<br>
<br>
I do however think that rangers should be getting the right amount of agro for that insane damage, although I wouldn't ever suggest it to VI and cry nerf.  The fact you have to get a load of AA for this ability, well, that's irrelevant really.  I'd gladly do 40 AA points to be able to outdamage a rogue by a large margin, even if it means I can only do it in 30% of the cases.<br>
