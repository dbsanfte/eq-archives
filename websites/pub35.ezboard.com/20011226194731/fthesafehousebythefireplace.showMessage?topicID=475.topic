When I started roleplaying more seriously, I discovered that &quot;Shadowsdirk&quot; was not a very elvish name, and since I didn't want to remake my character, I named him Adrecil, and now Shadowsdirk is his nickname. Hope ya like it, I had to scan this text, so excuse the weird spacing, and any punctuation errors or words left out. I could use feedback of any kind. Thanks! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> To those of you who fought at the Battle of Rivervale. I am sorry I could not make it. I left early under rather...well unusual circumstances to say the least. I wrote my events in an omniscient perspective, 'though I swear by the gods that these events actually happened. It's just my writing style. <br>
~Adrecil &quot;Shadowsdirk&quot; Spiritflame. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Shadowsdirk ran hurriedly through the beaten path of the Commonlands. The early<br>
morning<br>
sun glaring down on his sweaty face. The mask on his face was making it unbearably hot, 'though the dew hadn't melted off the grass. He stopped to look around. He had made<br>
many<br>
journeys to Nektulos, and this would not be his last- so he hoped. Adrecil Strayed from<br>
the<br>
path, taking a well used shortcut to Nektulos forest. He reached the familiar glade in no<br>
time, the trees were beginning to deaden, and the air was much colder. He looked quickly<br>
into the reflective metal of his bracer. Yes, his disguise looked prefect. No one would<br>
know his true identity. Still, he approached the glade with caution. He emerged from<br>
hiding, and a teir'dal warrior came into view, and approached the young scout.<br>
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; He began in a high form of common.<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Shadowsdirk said slowly, determined not to show his nervousness, &quot;I'm looking for<br>
Darmendrax, I would like to enroll in his army,&quot; Not an entirely true statement, thought<br>
Shadowsdirk. He was working for the Elders of Tunare, and was penning on spying on the<br>
army of the teir'dal.<br>
The warrior started to speak again, when a half elf lass came in from the direction of<br>
Freeport. Adrecil's heart leapt to it's throat. It was Tantita, an old acquaintance of his. The<br>
two had a bitter argument on the fate of the halflings, and had gone their separate ways.<br>
She had seen Shadowsdirk in his guise before, and would certainly recognize him.<br>
The scout cursed the gods under his breath. He would be lucky to get out alive. Tantita<br>
was obviously the weaker of the two, but about on par with Shadowsdirk. He began to<br>
think quickly, trying to find a way to prevent them from slaughtering him. Finally, an idea<br>
came.<br>
&quot;Tantita,&quot; the scout began in an intimidating voice, &quot;Our disagreement has much to do<br>
with<br>
this war, but is on a personal matter. I challenge you to a duel.&quot;<br>
The scout smiled evilly. Teir'dal custom prevented them from interfering with a duel. He<br>
was better at combat than Tantita, the fight would surety be his. She smiled back, and<br>
removed a blue vial from her purse, and drank it quickly.<br>
&quot;If you insist, monsieur, &quot; she said, drawing from her side a newly crafted serrated blade,<br>
and a tomahawk.<br>
<br>
Shadowsdirk bowed, and took a powerful swing with a harpoon. He had been aiming for<br>
her<br>
heart, but she had been quick to dodge, and the blow glanced off her left shoulder, denting<br>
her night black chestplate. He unsheathed his rapier, preparing to strike again, when she<br>
ran, taking off faster than a werewolf. The scout growled under his breath. So this is how<br>
she wanted to play, no matter, he could win over time.<br>
He finished the thought just as a arrow whistled by his head. He turned in anger, and<br>
started after her, but yet again, she was too fast. She shot arrow after arrow at him,<br>
while the scout could do nothing but chase futilely. He decided a different approach. As<br>
she took aim with another arrow, he dived into the bushes. Knowing she couldn't see him,<br>
he made his way around a large grouping of foliage, prepared to stab her from behind. If<br>
she was going to play dirty, so was he.<br>
He crept slowly behind her, he could hear her breathing heavily from inside her armor. He<br>
raised his spear high, and struck a powerful blow, piercing through the back of her armor.<br>
He smelt success as she cried out in anguish, but before he could finish her, she ran<br>
quickly away, then turned around, and shot the scout in the leg. He cried in pain and sank<br>
to his knees. Knowing he only had a certain amount of time until she nocked another<br>
arrow, he pulled the bloodied arrow head from his skin, and hobbled blindly after her,<br>
focusing his pain, and adrenaline on her. He ran far, and the plains turned to desert, and he<br>
found a tunnel. The tunnel was full of beings of many races, none of whom paid attention<br>
to him. He thought about giving up on finding Tantita when he heard her taunt carry from<br>
across the Commonlands, &quot;Come out Shadowsdirk. You can't hide forever. &quot;<br>
The comment felt like hot poison going through his veins, and his pride had been deeply<br>
hurt. He answered back in a voice that echoed across the desert.<br>
&quot;You accuse me of hiding? I'm more powerful than you Tantita. It is you who have been<br>
running. Come! Fight!&quot;<br>
His request was answered, though not in the manner he expected. She did emerge, but<br>
only<br>
to dash around him, keeping him wounded with her arrows. He chased her endlessly, and<br>
the sun was beginning to fall before she hit him twice more with her bow, once in the<br>
shoulder, and again in the chest. He fell to his knees once more, badly wounded. His<br>
vision<br>
blurred, but he could see her emerge from the woods once more. Tantita drew her sword<br>
once more, preparing to decapitate him. He looked up at her, and accepted his fate. His<br>
head fell to his chest, and he closed his eyes, awaiting the blow that would bring darkness<br>
upon him. However, the final blow never came. A bolt of flame shot through the sky,<br>
enveloping the scout, and pulling him through the ground.<br>
He blinked, and found his surroundings had changed entirely. He was now in a<br>
swelteringly hot building, made entirely of marble. If the scout had the ability to get up<br>
and look, he<br>
would have seen lava flow throughout the temple. A figure shot up through the lava, a<br>
hovered above Adrecil. The scout saw a dark figure, completely immolated in flame look<br>
at him through yellow slits.<br>
<br>
&quot;Adrecil.&quot; He began, his rumbling voice seemed to come from the temple himself, &quot;I ha<br>
saved you from your fate. When you looked into death itself, was Tunare there to help<br>
you? No, she shuns upon elves attacking elves. She has her petty morals, and was will<br>
to compromise the life of a fine scout. I've watched you for many years, your devotion<br>
sickened me. Now, it will change. For I, The Burning Prince come to you with a propose<br>
Pledge your allegiance to me, and I shall give you the power of redemption. Keep your<br>
alliance to Tuna re, and I will leave you here to rot in your own decaying flesh. Now,<br>
swear<br>
your allegiance to me!&quot;<br>
Shadowsdirk smiled grimly. His head bobbed, as he fought to stay conscious. He opened<br>
his<br>
mouth to speak, but coughed out blood. His eyes closed, and he fell, his head hitting the<br>
marble floor loudly.<br>
&quot;Heal him,&quot; The Burning Prince commanded. &quot;He has pledged his allegiance, thou<br>
the words could not cross his lips. I shall see to it that he gets his revenge.&quot;<br>
Solosek Ro made a vague motion with his hands, and flames swept up the rapier, still<br>
clasped tightly in the scout's hand. The blade of his rapier glowed brightly, then<br>
blackened.<br>
The burning prince spoke silently, though each of his devoted servants heard him as if<br>
was standing next to them, as far as they may have been from his plane. &quot;As you as my<br>
witness, Adrecil of Felwithe has been given the ability to be redeemed. Just like each<br>
every one of you. He shall wield the burning rapier as devotedly as all of you have. He I<br>
now a Rogue of Solosek Ro. My second gift to him shall be to bestow upon him a surname.<br>
This bastard of a half-elf never knew his family. You are his brothers, and I his father.<br>
Tunare has lost a scout more powerful than she knew, Adrecil Spiritflame.&quot;<br>
As he bestowed upon Shadowsdirk, his surname, a black insignia was burnt into the half-elf’s arm. The flaming arrow, the symbol of the Burning Prince will be with Shadowsdirk '’til the day he dies.<br>
