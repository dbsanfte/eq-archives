Nerfs or changes feel bad, but are Shadowblades worse off than All Assassins as you might say?<br>
<br>
Thrust Infiltrators face the exact same Assassin Vs Assassin penalties that Shadowblades have.<br>
<br>
Only Pierce Nightshades have it worse by having full Assassin Vs Assassin penalties to both leather types.<br>

Be rational and logical, nerfs and changes can suck.

I really don't think anyone is overreacting here, Elaa. The arguments are pretty logical so far.<br>

<br>
I was stressed out when people were freaking out about sbs and the nerfs.  I was then 43.<br>
<br>
I thought omg I have invested all my time in this character and they just destroyed it.  Look all these people are leaving the game.  Geeze I have to reroll again.  (I had a hunter that I got to 37 before they really did  destroy those).<br>
<br>
I am now a lvl 50 sb and having lots of fun.  Do I win every fight against Infs..No.  In fact I lose a few more than I win I think.  I attribute it to the fact that I only have like 75k in rps, I don't have a buff bot (I will get one if they aren't nerfed soon)  and I am still learning.<br>
<br>
Do I think things are entirely balanced among the rogues.  I honestly dont.  I think that steppin razor is absolutely right on his quest to get dragonfang switched to a second step off evade change move.  I think that infs have so many spec points that they get an advantage.  For example, if the new poisons are only lvl 50.  I can't use em.  Every Inf will get them and they are even better than lifebane.   <br>
<br>
I hope that mythic addresses these issues.  However, above all things I am having so much fun right now.  I go out in teams of rogues and we generally do fine.  I don't solo but then I rarely face a solo inf that is not uber buffbotted.<br>
<br>
So don't stress it so much.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the game.<br>

<br>
With this patch every Nightshade will be 30% better versus SB's due to armor resist changes going from 15% vulnm to 15% resist. Spec blades for a 15% bonus and you now have a 45% bonus versus SB's as a Blades NS.<br>
<br>
Every infiltrator will be 15% better due to armor changes going from 15% vuln to neutral. Spec Slash instead of thrust and you have a 30% bonus to SB's.<br>
<br>
You will say &quot;But now you have a bonus to scale and are neutral to other armors&quot;.  Sorry, this doesn't cut it. You, as NS and Infiltrators, always had the option of speccing a skill that gives you a bonus to Mid healers and Viking Classes. There is no way a SB can go toe to toe with a Hero or Armsman. I thought everyone said Assasssins were to hunt other Assassins, Casters, and Archers? Now we, as SB's, are out of the Assassin hunting game.<br>
<br>
Now to a major complaint all Nightshades have.  Nightshades are complaining that they start with races that have base 40 con and have a substantial lessened number of hit points then SB's. then I look at page one of this thread and see: <br>
<br>
&quot;My weapon skill tips 1150 with a certain Druid's buffs, my hitpoints go from 1096 to 1600. Whenever I can get them I do. <br>
<br>
<br>
Balor Gafdan Nightshade of Guinivere&quot;<br>
<br>
As a Norse SB starting with 70 con I have, with my epic armor and items, 127 con.  I have 1159 hitpoints.  I have 63 MORE HP  then Balor the Nightshade. Every Nightshade can get to his approximate con level. So where are these 300-400 HP's difference that Nightshades complain about?<br>
<br>
Where is my Shadowblade Uberness versus other Assassins that all these people complain about?  <br>
<br>
Left Ax was nerfed and now needs a load of spec points put into it to be a viable skill while in contrast NS/Inf get CD/DW where with 0 spec at level 50 they get a 37.5% boost to melee power.  <br>
<br>
The one shot coming unstealthed hurt Critblades a lot and Epic armor pretty much stopped one shots, although they still do occur infrequently.<br>
<br>
2 handed weapons get a 15% damage increase over 1 handed weapons. So if I use a 2 hander I will be an assassin to be feared by other Assassins? maybe for the perf , if you can get it in on another Assassin but with the evades that happen to slow swinging 2 handed weapons you are crazy to use one in an Assassin versus Assassin fight.<br>
<br>
Infiltrators 453 Spec points versus 40-50 Hp Increase? I just have shown up above that the HP difference between SB's (at least me and Balor) and NS are very negligable. Imagine how much less they are to Saracens and Britons who have 10 and 20 more con to start with then NS.<br>
<br>
Dragonfang? Quite a weapon skill. <br>
<br>
Viper and Vanish versus Shadowrun? Shadowrun is worthless compared to the other 2.<br>
<br>
Slash as the only weapon damage type available to SB's while the other Assassins can spec Thrust or Slash.<br>
<br>
Now the Armor Resists in this patch hammer SB's mercilessly while giving big boosts to NS and Infiltrators.<br>
<br>
So SB's don't have anything to complain about?<br>
<br>
On the contrary, we have quite a lot to complain about.<br>
<br>
Infiltrator&gt;NS&gt;&gt;SB with the new patch.<br>

&gt;&gt;&quot;Lets look at Facts Elaa-<br>
With this patch every Nightshade will be 30% better versus SB's due to armor resist changes going from 15% vulnm to 15% resist.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
What you are stating is not a fact, but an angle. It is a fact of every Nightshade as you say? Pierce Nightshades will have the same 15% penalty against your Shadowblade as the 15% penalty you have to the Nightshade.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, the ability for Shadowblades to Assassin hunt just got hosed, but the claims and false facts you state represent your feelings of the situation and not the actual situation at hand. Be careful when differentiating the two. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulupas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lupas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 8:29:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3849.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply</span><hr size=1> &quot;What you are stating is not a fact, but an angle.

Before we had a 15% bonus to NS leather armor. Now we have a 15% resist. 30% difference between the way things are now and the way they will be after this patch no matter how you try to hash it out.<br>
<br>
You only take a penalty by speccing pierce because you want to. You have the option and have always had the option of speccing blades and having the same bonus that SB's have with the current system. <br>
<br>
I still don't see SB's being able to spec anything but slash, which is worthless versus other Assassins in this patch.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubilesilhouette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bile Silhouette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 9:35:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3849.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply</span><hr size=1> ----<br>
&quot;Nerfs or changes feel bad, but are Shadowblades worse off than All Assassins as you might say?<br>
<br>
Thrust Infiltrators face the exact same Assassin Vs Assassin penalties that Shadowblades have.&quot;<br>
----<br>
<br>
Dragonfang pretty much owns everyone.  As well, inf's get the spec bonus and vanish comparitively and of course the much more spec friendly dw line.<br>
<br>
SB does take a hit against them now.  And thrust inf's were tough to kill already with that damn evade-stun.<br>
<br>
----<br>
&quot;Only Pierce Nightshades have it worse by having full Assassin Vs Assassin penalties to both leather types.&quot;<br>
----<br>
<br>
Nightshades in general needed an enhancement.  Not this BS.  STILL the nightshade gets a nice boost on the previous standing between them.  Resistant to the SB across the board.  Add the spec friendly CD line, a much easier evade stun and Viper.  <br>
<br>
----<br>
&quot;Be rational and logical, nerfs and changes can suck. Take a breather and don't blow thigns out of proportion like the title of this post.&quot;<br>
----<br>
<br>
Mythic doesn't respond to rational or logical.  They respond to the largest amount of the population yelling and screaming the loudest.<br>
<br>
Sb's were FINE.  Now they are a good deal less effective.  Agree?<br>
<br>
Lets go SB vs Assassin<br>
<br>
Thrust Infiltrator.  SB gets 15%<br>
Slash Infiltrator.  SB minus 15%<br>
Thrust Nightshade.  Even.<br>
Slash Nightshade. SB minus 30%<br>
<br>
So, the Shadowblades best shot at another assassin is the Thrust infiltrator, who by they way has the nine second evade stun.<br>
<br>
The second best choice is the Thrust nightshade who also has an evade stun.<br>
<br>
.... yes yes, 39 spec leftaxe is an evade stun but don't even start to compare the 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
OUCH.  Just looking at those numbers pains me.<br>

All Hib and Alb Assassi</span><hr size=1> While I do agree that NS needed a boost...the bumping Infs another step up the food chain is insane.<br>
<br>
<br>
When you kill all the SBs assassin hunting abilities our tanks are going to feel it.<br>
<br>
When your slash Inf takes out our SBs then your thrust Infs go to work on our chain wearing tanks you really think you arent going to hear it?<br>
<br>
Trust me....if this new armor setup goes through Infs will get hit BIG with the nerf bat.<br>
<br>
<br>
I care little for the 1 vs 1 aspect of this game...if I wanted to PVP i would have stayed with Diablo 2.  My main role in RVR is hunting down other stealthers who get the o so lovely bonus to Mid chain.  If this patch didnt come with respec it might not be so bad.  But you will see a heck of a lot of new Slash Infs and NS now.<br>
<br>
My job as a SB isnt to go after tanks (didnt mythic say they didnt want that?).<br>
<br>
If you want to balance the assassin world a bit more here are my proposals.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alb Leather - Vuln to Slash (the price you pay for DF and 2.5 spec points), Neutral to Thrust, Resistant to crush.<br>
<br>
Hib Leather - neutral to thrust, Vuln to crush, resistant to Slash<br>
<br>
Norse leather - Resistant to thrust, Vuln to crush, Neutral to Slash<br>
<br>
With this you get (assuming the propensity to respec to slash is as high as we all think it is):<br>
<br>
Slash Infs no change in dmg taken, 15% less dmg to SB<br>
Slash NS  now to 15% less dmg to SBs and take 30% less dmg from them.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to give the NS a boost but I'll be damned if DF and 2.5 spec points per lvl deserves one.<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont even understand why they even messed with leather in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaraxen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Araxen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 10:42:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3849.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ibiblio.org/linsearch/peng.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Inf&gt;NS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SB.

It's one big headache and SB's have been screwed the most out of this as they can only spec slash and only get 1 bonus to Scale and the other 2 bonuses are to our own realm's chain and leather. It seems like mythic wanted to make Midgard as a whole weak to slash but they seem to forget Shadowblade's can only Spec Slash and thus basically nerfing the class down even further and redefining their role in RvR once again I might add and that role isn't even clearly defined anymore. <br>
<br>
Heck if I wanted to kill tanks I would have made a caster or a tank. I liked my role of hunting other rogue's but that role has once again changed now. It kind of funny I originally made my SB to be a crictblade till that was nerfed I adapted and change to 5-spec(maybe zerker with bane with respec) so I could hunt down other rogue's but alas once again I(we) have to adapt one more time to what who the hell knows anymore. <br>

<br>
I feel like saying welcome to the whineboards.<br>
<br>
I hate to say this..but we are no longer solo assassins.  We either need a buffbot or a few other assassins to go around with.<br>
<br>
However,  we are still really strong in rvr.  If we play tactically we can be the difference between winning and losing a fight.  We can team in groups and take out incoming groups from the pks.  Yes groups of 3 or 4 or 5 can die to us.<br>
<br>
I have tried to take keeps against infs and nss and they have made it really hard.  I have done my best to make it hard on them too.<br>
<br>
As bad as all this is we are still one of the funnest and best rvr classes around.   Mythic is also trying really hard to make the game better and more ballanced.  That's not an easy job.<br>
<br>
It's just that we can't do it all solo so easily now.<br>
<br>
And that's going to be the trend.  At some point mythic will probably overdo it and at that point maybe we will work together and stand up and say &quot;Wait, what about us?&quot;   But if we sit there and pick on each other..it doesn't do us any good.<br>
<br>
Note:  I do not mean don't bring up concerns and discuss them honestly (both things that could help and could hurt your class).<br>
<br>
So lets go out and test this patch and see.<br>

<br>

<br>
1.  Perf artery with crush?  ugg  I guess it could be crush artery<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
2.  Will mythic make such broad changes to a class?  Maybe.  They certainly have in the past.<br>
<br>
and most important:<br>
<br>
3.  How does this mesh with other classes outside the assassin vs assasin realm. (edit read your reply on the other post and it looks ok)<br>
<br>
I think that in the best scenario both Elaa's solution or the solution presented here are a more balanced approach to the problem.  I think either solution is fair.  If the change presented here was implimented and tested out ok...then sbs and ns would certainly not be able to complain about the 2.5 spec.  If Elaa's changes were implimented then the 2.5 spec would need to be addressed in other ways.<br>
<br>
I just hope mythic gets this information and listens.<br>
