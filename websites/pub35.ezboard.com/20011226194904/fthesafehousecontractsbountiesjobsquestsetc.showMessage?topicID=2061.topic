Well, it looks like most of the concerns were covered with that last thing I posted. The dev. team is reading these threads too, and they are already starting to work on your suggestions. So I'll only address the ones that were not already covered with that last note I posted from the dev. team.<br>

&gt;&quot;3.I know it is a little late in the life of the game to change it but you might want to remember, chests full of loot can be fun. &quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
It sure can. Someone once proposed that we give monsters containers that they can drop that can only be opened by rogues. This might allow rogues to set up little shops in town where they open locks for adventurers, assuming that any adventurer would trust a rogue with their loot…<br>

&gt;&quot;Absor, your comment on evade skill has me really concerned. You emit you don't know much about rogue history. Well here is one fact about rogue history I will tell you about.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
Actually, I know a fair amount about rogues and their history. Don't forget, I've been playing this game for a long time. And what I don't know, I can find out very easily. I wouldn't worry about that. I've left your further exaggerations alone. All I wanted to tell you was, well, you were exaggerating.<br>

Hehe, I have no idea. I'll add it to the list, though…<br>

&gt;&quot;Wishlist: Report Backstabs like Crits. Give us something to impress our groups with. <br>
Of course if you do that there should also be an option to turn off all of those types of damage reporting to reduce battle spam.<br>
<br>
Assassinate: I've seen screenshots of level 60 rogues assassinating NPCs. I'm assuming they cannot assassinate anything they'd get Experience for at level 60 - that would be way over the top. However, I did note the message, and it can use some work. If possible, could it include the NPCs name instead of 'their Target'?&quot;&lt;<br>

&gt;&quot;7) This is just a crazy dream, but give rogues (and rangers) the ability to SET TRAPS. This would work as a pet that was completely immobile. And in PvP would make the sense/disarm traps skills useful. It would require careful thought as to how to make i balanced of course, but the important thing is that it would be really cool! Considering that these wouldnt move it wouldnt step on the toes of magicians and other pet classes.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
Well, with all the new trap stuff, I may as well add this to the list. But don't expect it. We'd have to develop a ton of new stuff to make this work.<br>

&gt;&quot;Sneak/Hide is canceled if you loot a mob (even if you get &quot;You can't loot this corpse&quot; message), loot your own corpse, or do a trade (PC or NPC). Yet the buttons not only DON'T ungrey, you also DON'T get the &quot;You stop hiding/sneaking&quot; message. You also still move at sneak speed and when you do hit the sneak or hide buttons again only THEN do they ungrey and THEN give you the message that you've stopped sneaking / hiding. Either stop these actions from breaking sneak/hide or ungrey the buttons and give us the message.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>

<br>
&gt;&quot;Yes I think you need to introduce some longer range, stackable throwing weapons.&quot;&lt;<br>

I can add it to the list.<br>

&gt;&quot;I find it funny that the people that are level 56+ that probably already have a Ragebringer, (judging by thier suggestions to nerf the quest)<br>
Are suggesting nerfing the quest.<br>
If you do nerf the quest as some of these people <br>
are suggesting, then please, remove the Ragebringers that these people who say the quest is &quot;too easy&quot; and make them do it the 'correct' way. <br>
Fair enough?&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
I'm sensing some hostility here… That's not good for a hedgehog, it'll make your spines fall out.<br>
<br>
I think it's a fair to ask that the quest be made a tad harder. It's probably one of the bests quests, though, since it is very roguish in nature. And, well, maybe if it's made significantly harder we could make it reward a new weapon (of greater value, if only because it looked different or something).<br>

&gt;&quot;1. Quest for souldbound lockpicks - many times rogues can get us into places no one else can but what happens when we all die.......summon corpse time or go buy more lockpicks and then you have 2 lockpicks...no reason for it heh....suggest you put in a quest for post 50 rogue to get souldbound lockpicks&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
Not really a 'balance' issue. But I'll add it to the list so that the team can see it.<br>

&gt;&quot;18. Crouch with apply poison similar to Bind Wound, so we don't need to stand after applying<br>
21. Hide/sneak overwriting invis/invis UD spells<br>
23. Pickpocket from a separate pocket then the dropable loot&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
18 and 21 I'll add to the list.<br>
<br>
And 23 works like it does for a reason. It's not a good idea to allow anyone access to a completely excuse-free and limitless source of money.<br>

&gt;&quot;1.) STOP allowing damage shields to cause damage when using thrown weapons! A throwing axe from 125 feet is still being affected by dmg shields. Those are some seriously long thorns and flames eminating from the target.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
That does seem odd from a realism standpoint. I'll add it to the list just in case it's not done that way for a balance reason.<br>

I'm sick of seeing Level 5's fully decked out in black and wielding spears.  It's sad.  Those items could have gone to a much more deserving rogue.  Instead, some lame lvl 50 warrior camped them, then made himself a twink rogue.<br>
<br>
And I think it IS a balance issue.  It makes the playing field a little bit more level when you are under 20.  I can't compete with the twinks because I don't have phat l33t lewts.  Given a choice, a group would take a twink rogue over an honest rogue.  (An honest rogue?  Oxymoron?)<br>

No drop may slow it down, but it won't prevent it.  In fact, it may bring more high level camping back to CT since they wouldn't be able to buy it. <p>Colvin - 30 <b>REDEEMED</b> dark elf rogue - Reapers of Fate - Tarew Marr<br>
