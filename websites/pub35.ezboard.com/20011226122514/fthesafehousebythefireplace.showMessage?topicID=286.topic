      Smirkingly the slaughter began. Or so the mercenarys below thought. Half a dozen elite men and women crept through the passageways of Highhold Keep, slinking towards their goal. Huth and his group was responsible for the opening of the main gate. Scree knew he would hear when Huth was succesful. Nearly a thousand troops stood on the other side awaiting his success. Scree doubted they would be quiet when it occured. From his newly gained drow vision, Scree saw the faint markings of heat left by a guards patrol. The few behind him hadn't noticed it because they were watching elsewhere while they trusted in Scree to lead them further. He made another hand-signal, this one longer in content and more complex. All five of his brothers and sisters grinned. This was the reason they followed him.<br>
<br>
     The guard they came upon, the one Scree had seen saw all 6 of them leaning up against the walls. Kayos twirled her daggers in a brief show of reflecting light, Aliia simply sharpened them upon the very walls around them. A new addition to Scree's group Essessin flashed a grin and moved to assault the guard, but feigned his attack and chuckled at the guard.  "Who goes their!?" the guard looked with worried eyes.  "I be Scree, and ye best summon yer lord for I dunnae know how long ye be livin much longer in this here hold if I dont speak with him immediately." The guard moved to run off and find his lord, the elves charming words finding immediate curiousity in the guard. Almost forgetting about the intruders the guard spun on his heels, sword still drawn. "Ummm... you'll have to come with me sir. Your friends as well." Scree chuckled and nodded to his troops to follow him.<br>
<br>
     Tunnels laced like a spiders web through the keep. Scree knew them well having spent an entire year here many years previous, but was still was amazed at their complexity. His companions were also experienced with the tunnels and even corrected the guard on several occasions. Shortly their trip was at an end and the tunnels emptied out into a small waiting room. Several sleepy-eyed officers were present having also been roused from their slumber. Screes brief passage to this room had obviously been noticed by quite a few people. The guard nodded to them and left to regain his patrol ground. A man obviously recently awoken stormed out from the door on his right and glared at all present. His stare instilled a brief spurt of fear in Scree's heart before he waved it away as nonsense. His five companions, however, were not so quick to wave this mans anger as a passing trivialty. "Who dares interupt my sleep? and at this ungodly hour as well!?"  Scree took a step forward from his band of rogues and bowed slightly to the lord of Highhold Keep. "I come only to warn you. If ye wished to die while sleeping ill leave now and let you do so in peace. . . " Scree purposely let his voice trail off, but smirked when he saw red crimson rise through the flustered lords face. "You dare...."<br>
"Yes he dares, and you damn well better listen." Chez another of Scree's band piped in.<br>
Scree chuckled and waved his man back. "I come to serve ye, and tis a matter were wasting time over."<br>
      The lord of Highhold was still enraged but managed to nod for Scree to continue.<br>
"Before your fortress lies an impressive force. One that you have ignored because of your walls, but for one you cannot ignore any longer. In moments the rest of my force will open the doors to your castle and a thousand such dark elf troops, " Scree paused and let his dark elf illusion fade, this drew gasps from several of the officers also in the room, " will storm in and slaughter you and everyone inside. You have though, an other possible outcome courtesy of my men and I...."<br>
The lord drew steel at the treacherous words, " I will slay you where you stand devil. I know and care little at the minor threat you speak of. No force can breach my walls, and my guard tower is well protected even from the likes of your treacherous little cutthroats."<br>
"You speak bold words my lord, but yet I sense a hint of doubt in your voice. The doubt is well placed. Summon the guard whom we let find us, ask him where he discovered us and then ask yourself again how secure your keep is from the likes of us 'cutthroats'." Scree said the last word with a viperous hiss and let his illusion resume its form over his face.  His five companions did the same, causing a scene that tremored the lord of Highhold. "I am impressed with your palor tricks, but I do not trust in your tricks. What exactly must i do to prevent my gates from opening?" The lord eyed the band curiously, Scree grinned in response almost immediately.  "We charge only a trifle sum for the prevention of the conquering of this little castle of yours. Although the threat outside still remains." Scree let that last fact linger a moment before continuing. "I believe I can solve all of your current problems, although the cost is much higher."<br>
"Name your cost and I will hear your plan then."<br>
"One hundred thousand gold pieces, or equivilant in jewels or such."<br>
The Lord of Highhold Keep tried to keep his laughter down to mere trickle of chuckiling but failed miserably. "You think this keep houses that much gold?"<br>
Scree nodded signalling he knew it was an obscene amount even for this man. "I do have another request . . . One even you might fufill."<br>
The lord's eyebrow raised considerably, "Oh do please tell me."<br>
"The man who leads the forces outside happens to hold an artifact of great intrinsic value, let me pillage their forces and I will assist you freely."<br>
Laughter filtered out from lords room in a great boom that made the five companions jump from their leaning position on the wall. "My interesting little friend you do indeed have a deal."<br>
Scree grinned and summoned the jewel that would halt his officer Huth's part of the plan.<br>
