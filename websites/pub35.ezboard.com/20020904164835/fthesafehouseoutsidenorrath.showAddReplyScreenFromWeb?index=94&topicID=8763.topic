<br>
I'm sorry, but you really are dense.  My last post - EVERYTHING that was in bold were statements I made in previous posts, not my most recent- I was quoting MYSELF because you had said you were too tired to do it.  Go ahead and page back if you'd like.  Words....top to bottom...left to right....you get the idea.<br>
<br>
The only conclusion I can draw from the fact you didn't even know that is exactly what I thought- you read what you want to read and discount the rest.  *shrug*  Kinda hard to discuss things that way because people, like myself, just have to keep repeating themselves over and over until the receiver finally grasps it.<br>
<br>
In that last quote you grabbed from me I will admit- the every single bit part was too much.  But it is her final decision on whether or not birth control is used, and that was my point even though it was a bit overstated.  Either way my point remains and you have yet to even address it, cause I kinda think you know I'm right (being a woman yourself, I'm assuming).<br>

<br>
My whole opinion on being pro-choice is not based on whether or not a fetus is a person.  It is based on the fact that the mother is.  People make mistakes, and while people should be responsible for their mistakes not everyone is.  Out lawing abortion will not make it go away.  Out lawing abortion will not make the world a better place.  <br>
<br>
Out lawing abortion will only drive it underground and make the practice unsafe.  More unwanted, and unloved children is not a good thing.  Making a woman who is in no way ready to be a mother bring a child in to the world and rasie it is not a good thing.  Keeping abortion legal IMO is the lesser of two evils, I prefer to have invasive surgical procedures regulated by the government.  Maybe some people feel differently about that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uforceofmotion1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Forceofmotion1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 2:53:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8763.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a</span><hr size=1> *sigh*  And I thought my fingers were going to get a break tonight.<br>

Nope, it sure isn't...and I DID voice it at the same time as LETTING you know how those words could be INTERPRETED; just so you would know how the statement was coming across to me.  Here...<br>

Actually, I did address your point in a post I made on 7/27...here's an excerpt:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   But creepiness notwithstanding, a man can decide to stop what he's doing at ANY given moment as well.  It's HIS decision whether or not to consummate the sexual encounter, now isn't it?  At ANY time before penetration he can stop and say to himself, &quot;Damn, what if she gets pregnant?

Actually, I DID read the other things you posted, and I didn't have a problem with them...that's why I didn't address them.  The only post I had an issue with, was the one which you now acknowledge was extreme in how it comes across, due to the wording you chose to utilize.<br>

Well, that would be the whole crux of the matter wouldn't it? Kind of like defending slavery, by saying that it doesn't matter whether the slave is a person, only whether they are owned by someone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uswipey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 7:21:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8763.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a</span><hr size=1> When I start my own religion, we're gonna be super-conservative.  None of this &quot;life starts at birth&quot;, &quot;Life starts at viability&quot; or even &quot;Life starts at conception&quot;.  Thats for those mamby-pamby bleeding hearts out there.<br>
<br>
Life starts at ovulation!  Any woman who ovulates without getting pregnant is guilty of murder!!<br>
<br>
What of the sperm, you ask?  If an egg is a life, isnt a sperm a life as well, given that they contain complementary genetic information?  NO!  Quite obviously, the spermatozoa are meant to compete with eachother by the designer, or else so many would not be released at once.  Eggs, on the other hand, face no comparable competition, and obviously each and every one is meant to be fertilized...<br>
<br>
Obviously it follows from this line of reasoning that, given that people randomly paired have serious problems conceiving (up to 25%, I hear) it follows that, in order to prevent the sin of murduring the unfertilized egg, women should be allowed as many husbands as it takes to keep them pregnant.  Given that men and women are born in roughtly equal numbers, men will need to be able to have as many wives as they can keep pregnant as well. (50 men, 50 women.  Say each woman requires 4 men on average, to stay pregnant.  Thats 200 men, where only 50 are available.  EAch of those 50 will have to do quadruple duty...)<br>
<br>
Yes...  yes!  Another tenet of my religion!  There can be no virtue without temptation!  Is a man virtuous if he doesnt commit sin, or is he virtuous because he freely resists the temptation to commit sin?  For example, Is a man admirable for not murduring anyone for the last 10 years if he has spent those 10 years stranded alone on a desert isle?  NO! And the logic carries to other sins as well!!  No man should have his opportunity to be virtuous curtailed by a lack of opportunity to sin.  Blue laws should all be repealed.  Drug laws as well.  Any law that makes a sin illegal, thus promoting virtue through the threat of temporal force, should be repealed.  The virtuous in our religion will be just fine....<br>

Your only arguement is that it's a person, you can't prove that assertion with 100% proof.  You have given no other reason outside of that single arguement to make abortion illegal.

None of my arguements rely on the assumption that a fetus is a person.  Read them again if you think they do.  I am not even arguing whether abortion is right or wrong.  I am saying it should remain LEGAL.  Do you understand the difference?  Do you assume that if abortions are made illegal tomorrow that will some how make them go away?  Do you somehow think the unwanted and unloved children are a good thing?  Stop looking at this from an emotional stand point and tell me logically how bringing a child into the world that noone wants is a good thing.

You can't murder terminally ill cancer patients?  People with AIDS?<br>

Also- I hate to break it to you but kids are dependent on adults for all of their basic needs and cannot survive without them for at least 3 years after they've been born.  So your angle there doesn't really hold water, unless you feel it's all right to murder three-year-olds.<br>
<br>
And as far as I'm concerned, a person = a homo sapien.  The fetus is most certainly homo sapien.  Just because it has not fully developed (which of course happens over the course of about 15 years if you want to get technical) or because it isn't self-sufficient (again- at least 4 years until that happens) doesn't mean it isn't the same species as you and I.

After the child leaves the womb it is not dependent on the mother.  I thought the difference between depending on a single particular individual and just being dependent on someone was so obvious I didn't need to mention it.  I guess people do sometimes need others to point out the obvious.  Once the baby has left the womb ANYONE can care for it, not just the mother.  Inside the womb there is only one person repsonsible for it's care, and that person should have a right to decide if they want to provide it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath>Logged Out</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
