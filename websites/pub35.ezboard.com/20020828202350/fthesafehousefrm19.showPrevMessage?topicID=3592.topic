I just want one change to start with. It's an easy one: dramatically higher spell damage, especially on my shout. If Nightshades are the caster assassins, give us some caster damage. <p><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 80%; font-family: Verdana">Jalena!

Well trust me I have already read your report Elaa (love reading all of them acutally).<br>
<br>
I brought up the spell varience issue to one of the spell guys at E3.  Supposedly it is supposed to be a zero spec spell line and thus effected in that patch a while back.  Unfortunately it appears that it has been set to some spec level.  He said he was going to check when he got back.  If I don't hear anything in a week I will PM him.  Anyway.. the spell varience thing should hopfully be fixed soon...  Now if we can just get the damage upped to a useful amount. <p>Zedisa - Nightshade TL</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/29/02 5:39:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NS report time comming up.. any new concerns?</span><hr size=1> Hit a yellow con Minstrel with it just a couple of hours ago for 11 damage, and 8 damage a few nights ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uosteon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Osteon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/29/02 6:21:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> stealth end burn</span><hr size=1> the burn of endurance while stealthed after sprinting has been a long time bug, and still very annoying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  im sure you knew about it, but it is something that should be fixed one of these days <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukreigmeister.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreigmeister</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 1:02:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Evades &amp; Parries</span><hr size=1> I have noticed a few things that i have found questionable recently. I'm not sure if they have been brought up here and I havn't seen them on the IGN boards either.<br>
<br>
1. Can an attack from stealth be parried or dodged? <br>
<br>
I have been told no many times but just last week while in Uppland a blue con berserker Evaded my PA. I reviewed the logs several times and i did not become unhidden until after my attack was evaded. I have also had my PA parried by mobs in PvE....I first noticed it on Siabra in the bog of cullen.<br>
<br>
2. Is there any work being done on mob/player locations being skewed?<br>
<br>
Several times recently I have been lined up in front of a player standing still and received a message like target not in view or in range. In all cases i was at least a step back from the player/mob. Since i am high CS spec this has caused some critical failures in PvE and PvP. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This can be really noticed on some NPC keep archers who cannot be meleed at all but can be cast upon.<br>
<br>
3. Why is there no +Stealth bonus's in the NS Epic armor?<br>
<br>
I've seen several screenshots posted and they list no +stealth bonus on any item of the epic armor. I have been able to find a bonus of +11 from non-armor slots. The items being 2 Bracers of Tracelessness, Shadow Crystal Orb, Band of Hidden Talent, Rogue Overlord Pendant, Pooka Lord's Mantle. The issue here being that the bracers, orb and band are all level 41 and below items and using them forces us to give up many possible bonus's of higher level items. Not using these items forces us to spend less skill points on melee skills in order to raise stealth to a usable level.<br>
<br>
4. Why is there no +stealth items in DF for NS?<br>
<br>
I have reviewed the items several times and not found one single +stealth item there but we can get a +5env jewel. While camping the albion DF port in i checked the items for infiltrators and found a couple +stealth items were for sale.<br>

<br>
alot of people from my original server (galahad) moved to hib lancelot, so far im level 33.75 and i have 2 days 16 hours played...i specced differently this time, right now i have 34 pierce 30 crit 17 cd 10 venom 8 stealth (autotrained) my damage output is higher than anyone elses i have goruped with melee  wise, by utilizing the lower level cd styles for detuant along with scorpion, and tuanting with bumblebee's sting i have had no problem controlling my aggro and being a more than useful puller for the group.<br>
<br>
my goal is to hit 50 with under 15 days played time.. which imo is more than fair for any class..granted i have a daily solid group..so possibly the only thing that is going to help us is give us abilities that are more gorup friendly...such as resist buffs, debuffs, or some sort of chant..but that isnt happpening.<br>
<br>
our styles are fine for dmg..the problem with most ns is that thier 2/3 wepspec max...so of course they arent going to do as much as someone with full spec...there isnt anything wrong with shades...we're far more gorup friendly than a inf or a sb... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utwitchblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twitchblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 5:03:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;we're far more gorup friendly than a inf or a sb... &quot;<br>

nightshade (me)<br>
enchanter<br>
warden<br>
champion (shield spec)<br>
utility xxx (doesnt matter)<br>
<br>
basicly we look for red/purp bafs, like i said i dont have alot of played time so it's not like i have stellar equip or anything liek that, for most of us our stuff is always blue/green with a piece or two orange..<br>
<br>
i pull all the time, yes a champion is good for pulling but they have other things they should be doing with thier mana, pierce styles use low end, and because of end regen i can afford to be the guy pulling adds off casters with shout, and then dropping my aggro to a tank with scorpion (detuant work wonders) i jsut use that style ot melee the mob and the tank takes it off quickly...<br>
<br>
infiltrators and sb's have no ranged to do that its all running melee to peel adds...they cant pull nearly as effeciently. they bring nothing to a group but dmg...thats all.<br>

 Bards also have noticed a REDUCTION in their DD shout and this morning put a thread up to collect logs to check this out. Since Bardic Shout DD is their main damage tool and Shades secondary ment to even things out with other assassins this bears watching.<br>

<br>
At least not 100%. Loosing that ability means that NS have to group in RvR, and while I am not against this, groups are hard to get. We are being forced to group, while groups aren't forced to take us. With the one shot there we had a better chance at getting a group to protect against a SB or Infil. Now, why do they need us, if a SB or Infil attacks they will die to the other members.<br>
<br>
How about making it like the unstealth while drawing your bow? Give it a chance based on stealth that you will remain stealthed. That way there is a chance that we will stay stealthed and get out of there alive.<br>
<br>
I do agree on the spell variance and increasing the damage a little. I also think that the CD base of 25% should be raised to 35%, but that's a personal opinion. This would increase our damage output, as well as the other CD users.<br>

<br>
Hahaha. SB's and INF unanimously agree we need help. A famous high level SB was recently quoted as saying he removes his buffs when he fights shades. You group everyday with a well balanced group. You have the luxury of being able to autotrain because you're shooting up in levels. You've got the luxury of being 50 in 15 days, so have neglected RvR stuff. A normal player will take much much much longer to reach 50 and much of that time will be struggling to find a group or soloing. Go try to solo. Go fight a yellow INF, SB, or pretty much anything in the BG and get a taste. NS damage output is gimped based on a ton of factors, the main being piercing vs armor type. Our shout for lack of a better word sucks. We have less HP than our counterparts. We get nothing for being weaker. Don't come on this thread saying there's &quot;nothing wrong w/ nightshades.&quot; If you don't see anything wrong with them, or feel that you're the one player who has the NS all figured out, GREAT. When you're 50 with epic armor maybe you might be qualified to make broad statement like that. This thread to to address issues with the class. Sorry for attacking you, just a little perturbed that you're feeding your &quot;I'm smarter than everyone else&quot; mentality to the NS issue thread. As I said if you've got it all figured out, share the wealth elsewhere. I know the other 99.9% of NS would love to hear how great we really could be if we just specced right, but not here. <br>

I'm a 31 NS. Im in a guild where everyone is 40+ so I can't even get a group with guildies. Soloing is something I would normally enjoy, but in this game it is a living hell. And I have no choice, I am forced to solo. And finding places to solo, things to hunt is becoming harder and harder. Now that the logs with the Dampwood Mites are all grey, I can't seem to find anyplace to solo where I don't get killed peroidically by a mob that pops on me or wanders in, while Im fighting another . And of course they don't do this at the beginning of a fight they wait till near the end when I am out of stamina and/or low hp and run slower. So I end up wasting about two hours out of every three.<br>
As for damage, well, I have all yellow armor and weapons, player made enchanted. I am currently 100% Piercing spec. And I have to stick to blues. Yellows are to iffy.<br>
I dont know what to ask for to fix this. More damage? Not likely. I think I would settle for a way to escape. Sprint sucks. Having a backup weapon with snare poison on it is no good. I am always so close to dead by the time I get it swapped out and administered that I still run as slow as the snared mob, or get killed by its huge attack radius.<br>
Now, since there are level 50 Nightshades out there, obviously levelling is possible. I just wonder if anyone has done it completely solo? Has anyone ever made to to lvl 40 solo the whole way? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 9:42:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Well even if divgaze is right... he is still basically saying there is only one way to spec a shade, which IMO, would be a sign of a problem.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utalchi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talchi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 9:50:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Fighting Infils and SBs</span><hr size=1> I have to say, and again I have a level 35 NS, that I can fight yellow con infils and sbs and win. But, its very close and I have to get the PA jump on them. If they get the PA jump on me, then I die, but they normally have 3/4 health, while I would only have 1/4 when I get the jump.<br>
<br>
My starts are as follows, I am going off of memory also. All are with items.<br>
<br>
Stealth 38<br>
Pierce 28<br>
Envenom 32<br>
CD 9<br>
CS 29<br>
<br>
Now, I also have a level 45 Warden, 38 Druid and 25 Ranger. What does that mean, means I have cash to give this guy. Buying and having awesome equipment, I use the jewel from DF the one with +5 envenom, makes a big difference. If I didn't have that, things would be much harder. I got about 4500rps in the level 30-35 bg with this guy, in a week. Now, the guild I am in is small, everyone is over level 42, so no groups with them, well very rarely. Spamming for 30-60 minutes in DF, CM looking for a group is not what I call fun. Flagging myself as LFG and killing blues in DF is not fun either.<br>
<br>
Now, I started a keen on Guinivere, without the financial funding, it's going to be much harder. The only advantage is there are a lot of keens and I can prob get a group.<br>
<br>
But, go to a server where there are few hibs, create a shade, even join a guild, but make sure its a small guild. See what it is like to try and level without Pling or without money. It's hard.<br>

My best Bard DD shout is lucky to hit 100 damage against most yellow cons due to body resist.  Your shout will be cold resist, which also means void/darkness resist.  People will be stacking up to the nines in cold resist.<br>
<br>
My DD shout is rated at 114, yours is 62, a little more then 1/2.  If I'm DD shouting for maybe 100-120, you'll prolly be hitting for around 50-60.  The damage for this shout should be upped.  Either that or more functionality added to your magic line.<br>

After all he has the perfect group to level himself with so he hasn't faced a lot of the problems nightshades do. I'd like to see him use his detaunt styles in RvR anyhow.<br>
<br>
Wait he'll just respec.. which wasn't even going to happen for most of the time the rest of us have played nightshades.<br>
<br>
Anyhow on the one-shot no longer stay hidden thing, while it being gone won't kill me, I'm more bothered by the principle.<br>
<br>
The give the reason for taking away something is that we didn't need anything more.. so shouldn't that have meant we should stay the same?<br>
<br>
It's like saying you don't need anymore soda cause you're glass is full, so I'm emptying your glass. That's the sense that makes.<br>
<br>
Also it has been said we'd be complete when disguise came.. but it's not coming so we'll never be complete?<br>
<br>
And in any case, when both Shadowblades and Inflitrators (our competetors) say that we are rather weak, that's gotta say something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 10:54:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3397.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fighting Infils and SBs</span><hr size=1> BTW, I meant to add pretty much the same thing Maiya and Stryfe said -- fixing the variance of the shout wont really help the Shade much.
