I remember it as though it was yesterday, for it was. <BR>  <BR> My fellow rogues who dabble in poison will not be surprised by the outcome, but for all you younger rogues who still doubt our power, bare witness. <BR>  <BR> So, here is the story. I was in Highpass Hold when I acquired the 20th level. I immediately went to train in the making of poison in Rivervale (Being a dark elf I am dubious there, but the roguish handshake -- sneakin behind to get what you want -- works well here). I returned and got to work on pottery in the Hold. Tis a very easy skill to learn, and being a more intelligent rogue I was a master within the hour. <BR>  <BR> Well as day turned to night I got bored of this tedious work, and decided to see what was doing with the orcs. I proceeded to the orcish area to inquire about a group. Upon arriving I was scolded by a paladin who did not approve of my kind (and the fact that I had stolen a named orc kill from her group earlier, but tis another tale). She obviously underestimated the power of the rogue, for she challenged me to a duel. Well, good thing I had been working on poisons all day. I took this time to apply some spider poison to my rapier, hide, sneak, and accept. Well she was bewildered, not seeing me anywhere. She glanced about confused but came to he senses when a sharp backstab gave her a new breathing hole in her lower ribcage. I then ran a couple yards away. She found it difficult to move since my poison had sapped at least 20 from her strength, causing her to become encumbered. The idiot she was, she dropped some loot until she could again move freely, and again gave chase, By this time I had hidden again and applied some snake poison, in order to get the DoT effect on her as well. I again snuck behind her and delivered a great thrust, thus injuring her greatly again and poisoning her. Since she had a nice DoT on her and about 40 strength (her being a mserable high elf) I took this time to engage in a bit of swordplay. twas an easy kill, and I took all her coin as well as the items she had dropped to chase me.  <BR>  <BR> Remember young rogues, spider and snake poison work wonders! <BR>  <BR> And to those who wish to underestimate our powers, BAH to you!  <BR>  <BR> --Sidenote--- In the final melee, she tried to lay on hands but in her haste layed hands on me. I thanked her kindly and proceeded to kill her. Newbies, ... <BR>  <BR>  <BR> PS this paladin was yellow to me, thus proving once again the superiority of dark elves over high elves. <BR>  <BR>  <p><h1>Delph  F'Elon</h1><br>

I was L19 and the wizard was L21, and i was in a full group, yet getting our kills stolen (before group damage was implemented) by a wizard that was L21 and @#%$ as well.  A few attempts at reasonable distribution of the kills yielded no result, so i did the trade window thing (which is a bannable offense, of course) just to use the &quot;well, i can do it because of the free for all rule) concept against him.  I of course reported myself for it, while he told me i was gonna get banned for it (i hope the gm's thought that was funny).  Eventually he challenged me to a duel, and on the grounds that it was a &quot;duel of honor&quot; (which he announced to the whole zone) I had to accept.  I told him we would both fight better if we were away from the chaos of the orc battles, so suggested we move to the wall (where the captain stands above surveying all...).  He challenged me with /duel and i, from a visible sitting position accepted the duel.  I did not even stand up...he paused, then proceeded to root me, which i was unable to resist.  He began with a power damage spell, after another pause ponder why i had sat back down if i was supposed to be dueling him, and was suddenly interrupted.  If his face could have had expression, it would have been worth anything to see.  He quickly began to run away with Captain Ashlan close behind, all the way to the zone...soon after i saw <BR>  <BR>  &quot;Salvadore has defeated so-and-so in a duel to the death, so-and-so has fled like a cowardly dog&quot; <BR>  <BR>   Thats all that could be expected from someone challenging a rogue to a duel for honor (which isnt to say that there is no honor amongst...you know the saying).  Of course, i never thought he would be enough of a fool to actually let me chose the place to fight, and his ignorance alone was the victor of the duel. <BR>  <BR> Salvadore Crow  <BR> Roguish wanderer Mithaniel Marr <BR> L36ish <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/utsalikr.showPublicProfile>Tsalikr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/4/00 11:58:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> LOL - both those are great.</span><hr size=1> I had a similar experience with a HE paladin in Cazic Thule. <BR>  <BR> He: 32nd level and wearing good armor and weapons <BR> Me: 2 SBDs, dwarven ringmail tunic, bi crown, etc. <BR>  <BR> He was basically being a jerk.  He'd stolen a kill from our group earlier, then joined our group. After a friend and I proceeded to die to link death, he made some assinine comment. <BR> I commented back on his pale face and he told me to shut up or he'd kill me.  I mentioned &quot;I'd wipe the floor with you, don't even think about it&quot; <BR>  <BR> He challenged me.  So, there we are in Cazic Thule Courtyard - dueling.  I'm kicking his ass. ;)  I keep running behind him and backstabing or just generally avoiding his swings.  He is trying to root me and stun me.  He actually does this a couple times, but when he gets me rooted he comes in close for melee. I still hit him hard then. I don't think my SBD went off once. =( <BR>  <BR> I got him down to within a backstab of death, while I was at 3 bubbles of life.  <BR> I missed my backstab and then our cleric, not knowing about the duel, healed him to full. <BR> After that, I had him down to about 3 bubbles or less of life while I was at 2.  Then a train showed up and we zoned.  <BR>  <BR> We're sitting outside and he says, &quot;What is your magic resistance?!&quot; <BR> &quot;47&quot; *grin* <BR>  <BR> He never talked back again. I surpassed him in levels. I think he is 33rd and I'm 35th and I saw him in Cazic and just grinned at him. he ran away. *cackle* <p>Tsalikr Darkfyre -

Got my revenge for him killing me before. What I do different? <BR>  <BR> 1 - DUH I bought a pumice stone. Root is a bitch, and this works wonders.  <BR>  <BR> 2 - Upped my magic resist. Bought a nice bloodstained mantle and dwarven ringmail tunic (nice getting this since I am a DE). Save magic up to 46. Almost bought some +7 save magic bracers from an enchanter, these could help too. <BR>  <BR> 3 - MOST importantly, ... I made the best caster killer poison, SWEET LATHYRIS! It is a dizziness poison, components found in everfrost. 2 ichors and a snake venom sack I think, in a lined vial with suspension. If the SOB is dizzy he can't cast!  <BR>  <BR> So that worked out nice, ... left me to wack and wack on him, and with lightning fast weapons he couldn't get a cast off when poison wore off. He got me with a few nukes near the end, but I wacked him good.  <BR>  <BR> I usually use dragoon dirk and PGT but for duels it is nice to whip out 2 piercers since both can be poisoned. For an extra whack on wizards put the diziness poison on primary, some DoT poison like snake on secondary. Wiz will have dizziness and half of his hitpoints downed over time. I just went the dizziness route. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/ukethaal.showPublicProfile>Kethaal</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/00 5:48:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another of my favorite duels</span><hr size=1> Was out in the Commons, grouped with a 22nd level Necromancer so that we could take all the orc spawns for belts, when he decides he wants his pet to duel me. I'm down 2 bub on life and his pet has full health, plus it's yellow to me.  <BR> &quot;What the heck.&quot; I say, being that he will call it off before it kills me.  <BR> So we start, this thing has a scythe, and was hitting the orcs pretty damn hard, so I was expecting to be hurt bad.  <BR> But, this pet can't seem to hit me! The Necro keeps saying &quot;Wow! This is going BAD!&quot;  <BR> After a while, I am down to a bubble of health, while the pet is very nearly dead. I call out a draw, because I don't want him to waste a scythe, but he destroys his pet.  <BR> I congradualate him, and he summons another pet to deal with the recently spawned orcs.  <BR> This pet, another yellow one, proceeds to jump me while I am sitting hidden.  <BR> I die, run back and retrieve my corpse.   <BR> All in all, a suprise and a good fight.  <BR>   <BR> The bummer is, the next duel, we decide he can use spells, I can't seem to resist spells from a caster 6 levels higher then me, regardless of my 47 magic resist, so I get engulfing darkness, heart flutter and fear cast on me, and his pet beats me up for a while, I take off after the Necro, but can't seem to be able to catch him at all.  <BR>   <BR> Quite a bummer that I had run off and was walking after a running Dark Elf. Doh!  <BR>  <BR> Plus I lost XP because the DoT killed me. Sigh. Another hour down the tubes. <BR> I've died 8 times since Friday, and have lost 16th 3 times.

Well applying snake was a failure, ... but I successfully applied rabid froth. However, when I hit him with it he resisted somehow. So looks like it was all up to me wits, ... <BR>  <BR> I was still hidden when I accepted, and the warrior knew I was trying to gwet off a backstab, so like any respecable warrior he biegins to run around like a little girl.

Well this blew my hide so I figured better get away from that exe axe.  <BR>  <BR> Proud to say during the course of the duel I was hit only twice with his axe, most the damage he did was from kicking me. I got off lotsa hits in between his axe swings. When my PGT proc'ed I went in for melee till it wore off.  <BR>  <BR> I was doing excellent, I had 2 bubs of health to his one and a half, and just as I land a backstab, who do I see but GUARD BOLTON!
