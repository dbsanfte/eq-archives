So anyway it was late and I could not get enough folks to come stomp them and put and end to it anyway. Then 30 or so albions came and watched anyhow and did nothing to the 5 mid players I saw there. At least I saw no hibs taking part tonight.<br>

<br>
its just a matter of how you feel about it. running around emain has been rp farming since the realm points were put in.emain is the easiest playground for people to kill each other for the most part. theres no strategic or realm value in killing someone in emain. <br>
<br>
as a general rule i find that the realm vs realm strategy is sorely lacking and has major problems. they might as well name realm points,player points. <br>
<br>
i agree with lisboa,that dueling should be in the game,as well as some type of guild warfare rules. for me,i think most rvr is pretty bland and doesnt really have alot of interest.<br>
<br>
if i could duel people in a 1 on 1 basis it would just give me another option to explore.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/10/02 2:07:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3138.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sorry</span><hr size=1> Well there's a difference between a fight where one side lets the other kill them for RPs and they then switch side and a fight where each opponent fights the best they can, using all of their skill and abilities to kill the other.

I am against it so then you are the one with the problem...its circluar logic.<br>
<br>
personally till tonight I gave to @#%$ about it...then I saw just how many folks were doing it and I realised that after 2 hours when I went back that yes they were all getting a distinct advantage over others that did not/would not duel.<br>
<br>
I am not talking about 8-20 folks doing this I am talking about 75-100 setting up several duels at once. That can only be farming for points to spend on abilitys.<br>
<br>
But sence every other post on this thread is in support of it I will just assume its the norm. But you are just blind if you think its harmless and does not effect active rvr players. <br>
<br>
Even if it is not die and then kill to farm rp, it is guaranteed res back to the hunting area for a lot faster turn over on points. That alone will make folks lots more realm points than normal fighting will.<br>
<br>
The point of this gme is supposed to be striving to get to 50, then along the way defending your realm. Through defending it you gain other additional perks...dueling just cheapens the whole reward system.<br>
<br>
They put posts up about the big earners and keep a running total of points for a reason...so there is yet another perk to it, bragging rights. These to mean nothing when the RP are earned with little real effort.<br>
<br>
<br>
Part of my initial problem was the shock of the scope of it, then I see several folks here defending it. So I have said all I am going to about it because its obvious I was in the miniority when I thought I was not. Apparently a lot of folks do not think it is lame and an exploit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utazi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tazi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/10/02 4:44:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3138.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Mythic has been known to stop dueling events in the past.

(Circular food chain)  Most people don't seem to understand this, and therefore we see rants on &quot;Why my class X can't kill your class Z&quot;.  Dueling ignores this foundation completely.  Yes, it also gives &quot;duelers&quot; the ability to attain RPs at an unnatural pace - which last I checked was an exploit (or atleast it is in relation to Money, Loot, Character Experience).  <br>
<br>
Lots of people blame it on the simple fact that a tank (just an example) can't just go out and solo in the frontier - honestly if I was a tank I'd probably feel the same way.  However if we look back at the abilities given to a tank, he obviously wasn't part of the &quot;natural selection&quot; for soloing in that environment... which is why I chose an Infiltrator.  Each class has a purpose in the frontier, dueling ignores this.<br>
<br>
All in all, I just think that it's unfortunate that people would rather get RPs in an unnatural fashion - via organized 1on1, instead of playing the massive-warfare game that this is.  When I started this game, I was hoping for an evolution of team-based online gaming.  In my opinion - Dueling is basically mindless Deathmatch.<br>
<br>
I don't participate in dueling, and I never will.<br>

Won't happen. because members of your realm would piss and moan about it. Why did you kill our sparring partners? waaaaaahhhhh!<br>
<br>
It is an exploit. Firstly, the sheer nature of it involves communication outside the game between enemy realms. That is not supposed to happen, and by doing it, you're going against that rule.<br>
<br>
Next onto the RPs. Giving out RPs at an unfair pace compared to those that are actually trying to keep your frontier safe. I could go duel people, probably wipe out about half of my opponents, raking in, oh I duno, 4k in a relatively short time. Or, I could go defend my realm as I did last night for 3 hours and end up with 200 RPs. (granted that is lower than normal)<br>
<br>
They should impliment the battle grounds, but you know what? It is too late. As when any cheat is involved, any way to get an edge over the people with higher.. standards, people take the easiest and most advantageous route. (The archer explosion)<br>
<br>
Opening a battle grounds would just be where to go when you didnt feel like waiting for the next 'set up' duel-a-thon.<br>

The gist of it was to my recolection was, &quot;Yes&quot; Dueling is against the TOS. Also  I think she said that basicly it was not something they could enforce. Also interupting duelers was not against the TOS and encouraged.<br>
<br>
You will get grief from players within your own realm if you interupt duels. Heck I have gotten grief for killing people on the way to duels. So basicly if you rvr at all, you might upset duelers. So really it doesn't matter what you do.<br>
<br>
I would suggest putting together a solid group and seeing how many you can take out. Most are unbuffed, sitting, out in the open, and ungrouped. One group can take out 20 duelers, and it is probably the most fun you will ever have in this game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubrandynaquilius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brandyn Aquilius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/23/02 1:11:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3138.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: is dueling cheating?</span><hr size=1> Dueling is no more cheating than is zerging in emain.  In fact, my understanding (as I have never participated in one) is that more often than not, the winner gets no RPs since their victim was just &quot;pwned&quot; by someone else three minutes ago.<br>
<br>
If a group is dueling in some far off corner and you are zerging Emain, or taking or defending a keep and getting RPs some other way, how are they gaining any advantage?  Also, for it to be considered cheating, it would have to be something that others don't have the ability to do and this is clearly not the case.  It's also NOT really illegal.<br>
<br>
When people stand and let an enemy beat them down, that's RP farming and cheating (though it's so mild that I don't really care).<br>
<br>
I think that dueling is more about fun than RP farming.  There have been a few times when I wanted to duel someone that I knew from the VN boards.  I didn't give a crap about RPs.  I didn't even think about it.  I just thought it would be fun to stand toe to toe with a known and respected enemy.<br>
<br>
I actually think this is a good topic for debate.  Why not try to DEBATE it?  Don't be mad because your opinion seems to be the minority.  Try to convince us.  That's what debate is about. <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uaach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/23/02 2:19:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3138.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: is dueling cheating?</span><hr size=1> I think Mythic are less heavy about it than they were, its not cheating exactly but its not exactly fair either (like jumping onto the roof of a keep and building a catapult isnt cheating but doing so in the wall is).<br>
<br>
Some classes just dont duel well and while this gives people an opportunity to shine where previously they were in the back ground its still exploiting a game mechanic.  it irritates me when half your realm is dueling there are not enough people to play with for keep taking (its dull if no one defends too). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uwilder345.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wilder345</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 3:24:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3138.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: is dueling cheating?</span><hr size=1> only spent 2 nights duelling in caledonia (35 bg) when things were slow.  we were instructed to back off when either party got down to 10% health and thats what happened every time but 2.  once i crit/poisoned someone to death by accident, and once i challenged a pre-nerf smite cleric to a deul to the death (really wanted free trip to bind-point,) and obviously lost.<br>
<br>
someone said in this game x kills y, which kills z, which kills x.  how do you know it works this way until you take your &quot;uber&quot; sb and go head to head w/ a palladin or a smite cleric.  these duels were in good fun, i learned a lot, and i didn't farm rp's.<br>
<br>
deulling for rp's is IMO cheating and definitely lame.  when those ppl w/ all their newly bought realm abilities meet those of us don't duel for rp's and don't have newly bought realm abilities the scales are definitely tipped in favor of the lamesters duelling for rp's.  if i saw ppl duelling for rp's i'd kill them if i could.<br>

I have dueled for up to 6 hrs before, and made a grand total of 3k RPs for it.   I have run around emain for 2 hrs, and made 12k.<br>
Bottom line is, duelers aren't TRYING to lose.  Each side is trying to win.  The only thing different about emain and dueling is numbers.<br>
Emain, it all comes down to who has more.  5 vs. 11.  11 wins 99% of the time.<br>
Dueling, it's just 1 on 1.   You can actually feel like you have fought hard and well, without standing mez'd or stunned for the whole fight.<br>
I think dueling is fun.  And I don't get upset with duel crashers.<br>
We all play the game, we all kill each other, we all win some, we all lose some.  Either way, we all get RPs. <p>~Jaeden~

I don't like it because it throws me right out of the game.  I ran into a duel.  I then killed someone (I didn't realize it was a duel and wiped the nearest caster out before I was gonna die..:P)  I get a tell..hey we're dueling.  <br>
<br>
I feel like it ruins the feel of the game.  I don't want to know my enemies except as people I kill or who kill me.  It kind of adds to the realistic feel for me.  I figure we're better off just fighting.<br>
<br>
Having said that if they added a duel featuer (that blocked heals/attacks from outside or to outside) as long as it wasn't exploitable I say fine.  It would have to be short lived in duration or just time out too hrm.<br>
