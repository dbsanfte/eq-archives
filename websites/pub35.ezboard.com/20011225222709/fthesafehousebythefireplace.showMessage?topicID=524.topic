<br>
<br>
I know not how things stand on your Norrath, but be warned: On Tallon Zek, racial tension runs high.  The world stands divided against itself.  I grew up in a small village known as Rivervale.  From an early age, I was drawn to the local saloon.  They always had an odd job or two that I could do for a little coin.  One day, I was approached by a shady hafling that I had often seen hanging out by Reebo Leefsway's farm.  He told me that I'd been watched, and that it was well known that I could keep a secret.  He handed me a note, and sent me to the saloon.  <br>
<br>
I had always known that even idyllic Rivervale had a darker, more sinister side.  Today, I was introduced to it in the person of Kelvin Deepocketts.  Kelvin was waiting for me on the top floor of the Fool's Gold.  He and I had a long talk, and he told me of his profession.  Eagerly, I listened to tales of wealth, easily had, skills difficult to master, but priceless when perfected.  Kelvin looked at me, and I found myself nodding.  He gave me a tunic that marked me to others of my brethren, and my first weapon.  I was somewhat awestruck.  I had never even held such a fine blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go, &quot; Kelvin said.  &quot;Go into the woods, and practice.  When you've made a little money, come see me again. You have much to learn.  Make good use of your time.....Scour.&quot;  I had heard that those of the secret society had two names.  One that everyone knew, and a nickname that marked them as surely as their tunic.  This was mine, apparently.  I turned to  take my leave, but his voice stopped me.  &quot;You do realize what you're getting into, don't you?  The consequences of your actions today will follow you all of your days...And should you betray our trust in you.....&quot;  His words chilled me.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can count on me sir.&quot;  I ran downstairs, amazed at my good fortune.  Never had I dreamed that I'd get to work the shadows.  I had to share the news with someone.  I went to my friend Reupy.  She and I often talked of little things, and had become quite good friends.  &quot;Hail, &quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Scour, &quot; she said.  &quot;Are you interested in some training?  I was stunned.  Never had I suspected her of being part of the town's guild.  Not only that, but she'd called me Scour.<br>
<br>
&quot;You already know then, &quot; I asked?<br>
&quot;Of course Scour.  Everybody knows.  Now about that training?&quot;  We talked for a bit, and she taught me the basics of combat.  Armed with this new knowledge, and the dagger in my hand, I ran through the tunnel to the Thicket.  I had only been out there a few times, and had never stayed long, because of the dangers.  Today though, was different.  I was here to make my mark.  To teach some of these creatures to fear the name of Scour.  Scour.  I liked it.  I found a Bixie.  I'd always hated them.  It's back was to me, and I attacked, giving no quarter, asking for none.  It was harder than I thought.  The damn thing kept stinging me, and it's skin was tough, almost a match for my blade.<br>
<br>
Stung, bleeding from a dozen wounds, I ripped the stinger from it's still warm body.  These I knew, were worth money.  I sat down to rest, and noticed a dead wolf off to the left.  I went over, and the pelt was still there.  It was ruined, but I also knew that I could sell even a ruined pelt in town.  I couldn't believe it.  Outside for less than an hour, and already I had made nearly 5 silver.  Looking up, I saw another bixie.  It was doing battle with a friend of mine from town.   I had heard that he had signed up to be a guard. &quot;Must be part of his training too, &quot;I thought.<br>
<br>
As I watched, he delivered a stunning overhand blow, crushing his adversary to the ground.  Without even pausing to take a breath, he was off, chasing after a wolf.  I looked at the bixie laying there.  Another stinger.  Should I?  I debated for a while.  One side telling me that had he wanted the stinger, he would have taken it.  The other side telling me it wasn't mine.  I didn't earn it.  <br>
<br>
Good sense lost.  As I was removing the stinger, I noticed that the corpse also had a honeycomb.  Almost a sliver just for that.  I already had to go back to town.  I had more than I could carry.  Back in town, I sold my stuff.  I couldn't believe it.  Over a gold.  I was back outside in no time.  I spent many, many hours in the forest near my home, killing all manner of animals.  I quickly learned which creatures had the most saleable parts, and continued my policy of checking ever corpse I found.  I Scoured the forest clean.<br>
<br>
After some nine seasons under the tutelage of Reupy and others, and having managed to bank away a fair amount of money, I decided to broaden my fighting abilities.  I decided that I would take up archery.  I went to see Rantho, and bought a bow.  I paid a little more than what I wanted to, but I was eager to have it. <br>
<br>
&quot;I need some arrows too,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't have those,&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;But you sell the bows.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bows, yes indeed.  Arrows?  Not a one.&quot;  I was dumbfounded.  How could the weapons dealer not have arrows?  I asked him where I could get some, and he said he didn't know.  I left the shop, fuming silently.  That smug grin when he overcharged me for the bow.  One of these days Rantho..... One of these days.<br>
<br>
<br>
I decided to go make a little money.  Once out in the forest, I began asking others if they knew where to get arrows.  I was told that Highpass Hold ran deep with them.  I pulled a tattered map from one of my packs.  &quot;Through the Kith, &quot; I thought.  Dangerous ground there, or so I had heard.  Stories of raging undead, able to kill with a single strike.  It was still light, so I decided to risk it.  I ran back to town to get supplies, and set my feet, all unknowingly, on the path to my future.<br>
<br>
In the daylight, the forest didn't seem all that scary.   Sure, it was vast, and there were all kinds of noises, most unfamiliar to me, but it didn't seem deadly.  In due time, I came to the stony entrance of the pass.  I was just strolling along, happy to be through the forest, and thinking of how much fun I'd be having with my new bow, so I was almost in the middle of the battle before I saw it.  Jolted from my reverie, I froze, falling back on training engrained through hours of practice.  Using tricks taught me by the guild, for all intents and purposes, I vanished.<br>
<br>
A group of well-seasoned combatants were doing war upon a band of the meanest looking orcs I had ever seen.  I'd killed not a few in my time, but when I looked at these, I saw red.  My blood on their dirty claws.  Staying silent, I moved around the fringes of the battle.  Once past the main combat, and out of danger, I began to look about.  This was my first trip to the Hold.  Jagged rocks, a thin layer of dirt.  The air was crisp, and smelled always of winter.  I rounded a large outcropping of rock, and to my surprise saw two dead orcs.<br>
<br>
Standing next to the bodies, I debated again.  This time, sense won out.  I desperately wanted to see what these giants carried, but did not want to die finding out.  Ahead I saw the entrance to the hold.  Crossing my fingers, I sprinted.  I was inside in less time than it takes to tell, and felt much safer for the walls around me.  I decided to sample the local beer, having heard that it was beyond compare.<br>
<br>
I made my way to the inn.  I approached the Mistress of the house, and she rebuked me.  Branded me Rogue, and evicted me from her shop,  I hadn't expected that.  I had no idea that there were those that would react to a simple choice of trade.  &quot;Well, I really only came for arrows.  The armorer is a man of the world, most likely a former soldier.  He will understand.&quot;  I stood in disbelief.  Not the armorer too.  How was I to get my arrows.  I was about to leave town, when I remembered a trick taught to me not that long ago. Ace had called it &quot;The Secret Handshake.&quot;   Using my ability to hide myself, I snuck back into the arms shop, and crept up behind the Mastersmith.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why Scour, I didn't see you there.  What can I do for you?&quot;  I was dumbfounded.  Not 5 minutes before, this same man had run me out of his shop, and now he was ready to commerce with me.  Thank you Ace.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd like some arrows please.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'd love to help you, but I don't have any.&quot;<br>
&quot;You don't have any?&quot;<br>
&quot;Not a one.&quot;  I left the shop, my footsteps heavy.  I was about to head back the &quot;vale, when a thought occurred to me.  Standing at the entrance to town, I shouted to the party I had passed before. &quot;Does anybody know where I can buy arrows?' I asked. A faint echo rolled back to me.<br>
&quot;Try Qeynos.&quot; Qeynos?  I'd heard of it of course, one of the major Human cities.  A thriving seaport.  Also a whole world away.  Out came the map again.  It would mean travelling a great distance, through some foreboding territory.  Perhaps it was not the best of ideas, but damnit I wanted my arrows!<br>
<br>
Nightfall found me at the Stone Bridge, gate way to Southern Karana.  Hugging the river, I made my way to the hills of Qeynos, and then into the city.  I strolled through the town, and found a man named Fletcher.  Had to be him.  Remembering this time, I snuck up behind him.  Wonder of wonders, he had arrows.  I ran to the bank.  Back at Fletcher's stand, I purchased all the arrows I could carry. My mission accomplished, I decided to seek some entertainment.I made my way to the Crow, and without even thinking, ordered a beer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure thing Scour.  Can I get you anything else?&quot;  He knew my name.  That could only mean one thing.  A little judicious snooping, and I was able to find my fellows in the city.  I asked for, and was given permission to stay the night in their safehouse.  Contented, and feeling truly safe for the first time in days, I made my camp.<br>
<br>
Rising early the next day, I decided to take a look about town.  This was, after all my first trip to the city.  As I moved through the streets, I began to notice something disturbing.  By two's and three's, many were doing battle inside the very walls of the city, and the guards made no move to intervene.  I watched in horror as a human was slain by a dark elf, in full view of an armored soldier.  Remembering that discretion is the better part of valor, I promptly hid myself.  I had given some thought to staying in the city, but now I was unsure.  I was in the central marketplace when it happened.  I felt a spellcaster target me.  Thank Bristlebane for protecting me.  I was unaffected by the spell, at least physically.  Mentally, it was quite a shock.  I had done nothing to this spellcaster, and yet he? she? it? had tried to kill me.<br>
<br>
That was enough to decide me.  I snuck through town, quitting the gate with none the wiser.  The journey home was mostly uneventful. My feet again trod the tunnel to my beloved Rivervale, and it was a more sober rogue that returned.  My first trip to the City had taught me a lesson about the world at large, and it was not the most pleasant one.  Wearily, I made my way home to sleep. <p>Scour
