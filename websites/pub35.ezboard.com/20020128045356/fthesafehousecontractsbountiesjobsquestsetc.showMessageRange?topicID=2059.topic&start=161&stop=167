  This struck me quite strongly recently.<br>
<br>
  I remember the shorter hate list, I remember it very very well.  With the shorter hate list, whether it had been 6 or 12, I was far more aggro against raid type mobs.  I hit fast, I did alot of damage, I took hits.  When the hate list was expanded, I never took hits again.  I have fought Dain, Yelinak, Klandicar, VS, and Trakanon with relative impunity as long as I moderated myself during the first few seconds of combat.<br>
<br>
  Impunity, I will sadly agree, is bad.  Or at least not the best, it does make it too easy.  I've told my guild for a few months now that rogues were gonna get the nerf stick, no joke.  Lately, I thought that the nerfstick was going to come in the form of the massive improvements on test for many classes.  Increasing the relative strength of all those classes in some way decreases ours.  I am certainly not against improving those classes, for the improvements will benefit my guild in innumerable ways.  It's fantastic and I love the changes.<br>
<br>
  But hear me, pray @#%$ listen... if you take us to &quot;between 2nd and 3rd on hate list&quot; than that means I will take *more aggro* than I did when the hate list was only 6 or so long.  To me that screams of a nerf, not only just of current evade functionality, but back to day one of implementation.<br>
<br>
  Back in the day of first implementation, I would say evade was perfection, to say the least.  Working and dealing with the 6 man hate list was *hard* on raids and it made my job harder... but taking us to the 2nd spot feels really bad.  The shorter hate list did make us more aggro and more responsible for our damage... it also let us evade off that list (not technically, but in function), hide out - camp out - cr.  Loosing that *fantastic* ability with the expanded hate list was offset by our improved ability to survive such encounters.<br>
<br>
  I don't want to be part of a contest on raids in seeing &quot;Which rogue can kill which rogue first.&quot;  I don't want to stand around with my thumb up my butt waiting for tanks to build aggro on mobs that quad for 650 with delay of an FS dagger (ie, pre-evade days).<br>
<br>
  I recall a screenshot... I believe it was on Afterlife's page.  It was a Chardok raid and there were no less than 6 rogues on the rump of a Royal.  I saw that and told my guild we need more rogues.  I took a look at that shot and was proud.  I was proud of what the lowley miserable slandered mana-sponge rogue had become after fixes finally came our way.  I don't want to loose that pride in our class... I don't want to explain to my guild that adding more rogues to our ranks would be bad because, &quot;If we get more rogues on raids, then the death loop will mean either I or they are just wasted space.&quot;<br>

<br>

<br>
Yeah in single group situations against none high melee mobs (I.e. over 150 per hit), 3 rogues ping ponging is okay. Not the most effecient way to do things, but it works.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> As for raids, if you rogues are on boss mob raids and dont have your HP's buffed to close to 10% of the Taunting tanks, then Find new Clerics/Shaman/Enchanters.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Um.. Forgive me if I don't understand this. If we get buffs to be within 10% of the taunting tanks class, then wouldn't it stand to reason that the taunting tanks class would also get those same buffs? <br>
<br>
Just as an example if we had 2/3 the hp of the taunting warrior, both UNBUFFED, and then both get fully buffed, that same ratio (more or less) will remain. And honestly, what makes warriors into tanks for the raids is, of course, /dis defensive. There really is /no/ comparison for rogues tanking uberencounters. Not to mention the ac, deffensive skills, etc etc etc. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> My @#%$, is there not enough to worry yourselfs about in this world, than the fact you may get hit a few more times. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Okay, why the hell is g0d considered a bad word? Not like I disagree or anything, I just find it hysterical. Anyway, yeah taking a few more hits in a normal group situation isn't /that/ bad I suppose. Makes you more of a mana liability because we can't tank nearly as good as classes that are meant to tank, but it's not a HUGE liability. But when those few rounds are 800+ double/quad hits, we're removed from combat which means we didn't contribute jack to the combat because we are DEAD. And even if the hits are 400, or 300, there are only so many we can take before we get snuffed. And if you have multiple rogues, they WILL be the first to die. And in a lot of encounters, they will die before CH ever gets off, and to be honest, CH shouldn't even be cast on a rogue in that situation as it's a waste of mana.<br>

I agree, some of you have been cool about it but others are getting too nasty torwards Kendrick himself. I think the best thing is to voice your experience and your opinion in some sort of intellegent way and then when/if it goes live, analize the results and basically go back to verant and say.. 'Duh.. We told you so.'<br>
<br>
And like that one person sad (sorry didn't cut n paste your name :P) Maybe if they leave it messed up for a month or two, it'll cut out a lot of those supertwinks.<br>
<br>
In reality I do believe they will see the flaws in this when testing, or hopefully so, and come to a middle ground.<br>

<br>
My biggest concern is the statement we are dropped to lowest aggro when many times for whatever reasons we aren't.<br>
It seems too that multiple evades do this because of how hard it is to get an aggroed mob off a caster. My BS,beg,disarm,pp,rude key wont do it. I have been in 3 plus rogue groups pre evade and it was fun. Especially when everyone was backing off sharing the damage. No I was never a level that NOT having evade got me killed.<br>
<br>
At raid level the 3 slot implementation will be horrid..<br>
<br>
I just had another thought. Is this a red herring that when actually put in place we see no effect of. EXCEPT that  we all discussed evade instead of talking about DOing the Work on making poisons stack and Do the work coding us to log in sneak/hide allways.<br>
