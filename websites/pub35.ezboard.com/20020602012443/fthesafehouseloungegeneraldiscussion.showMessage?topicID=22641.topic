My wife got into the game about 3 days after I started playing and everything was great until she had a mental breakdown (family related issues on her side).  She was in the hospital for about 2 months and when she came out, she just hasn't gotten back into it.   Sure she gets on and plays her characters for about an hour but the fun isn't there for her anymore she claims.  So there are times I've heard her tell her mom on the phone &quot;i'm lookin at the back of his head again&quot;.<br>
<br>
I dunno... guess I still enjoy the game as much now as when I started.<br>

After all, would &lt;insert family member here&gt; prefer I be out in a bar drinking myself silly?<br>
<br>
That said, RL should come first.  EQ should not encroach upon family/friend interaction.  Obviously everyone needs some relaxation time and EQ is a perfectly reasonable way to spend that time.  But skipping play time with your kid to go on a Kael raid isn't exactly cool.<br>

I used to live on my own, and EQ was a great escape.  I recently moved back home to help out since my mom had a stroke, then low and behold my lung had collapsed, so it all worked out for the best that I had moved home.  I am one of those people that play, and when I play I play hard.  <br>
<br>
I am a member of a top guild on my server, and there isn't much we haven't done.  Just this past year I have started to realize that EQ is more fun when taken in moderation.  For instance, set one day off a week to just spend with your family.  One day to spend with friends.  One day for TV. And so on.   For myself:<br>
<br>
Monday: Cleaning day<br>
Tuesday: Friends<br>
Wednesday: Guild, Guild raids<br>
Thursday: TV day<br>
Friday: Guild, Guild Raids<br>
Saturday: Mourning from 9am to 4pm guild, evening to 4-5am is friends.<br>
Sunday:  Just family.<br>
<br>
Since I've started doing this for the past year, I have not only noticed that my attitude in game as well as with family and friends has improved 10 fold.  I also found that EQ burnout when doing this is almost non-existant.<br>
<br>
Just thought I would share this with you, since it has improved my life/lifestyle so much.<br>

I know for me EQ has saved me thousands of dollars since I started playing it. <br>
Pre EQ: I would go out to clubs, spend tons on drinks and other recreational activities, taking dates out to nice dinners and getaways, pretty much always eating out cuz face it being single is boring when all alone in your apt. It all adds up to a lot from gasoline for the car to plane tickets and hotel rooms. $$$$$<br>
<br>
Present: I play EQ almost every night, cook dinner at home, go to family members house for dinner usually once every weekend, small things like a movie every now and again, skiing, sports events and concerts every once and a while. 2+ years of playing EQ got my finances in order enough to buy an Audi A4 Quatro cash and save up a substantial amount of money to put down on a house. <br>
Granted I'm still single and don't have the social life i once had, the day will come when EQ bores me enough to quit and I won't regret playing it for hours a day and the friends i have made in the game. And at that time i'll have a house to come home to that's all mine, a decent car that's all payed for, and friends and family that i have always had. Social life can wait for now, i'm having my kicks while i can...and when i get back into the dating scene it'll be nice to not have to bring dates home to some one bedroom apt and be more stable then I was. <br>
Looking back 2 years ago, I was living almost paycheck to paycheck, spending crazy amounts of money on nuggs(heh i have smoked no more than 5 times in 2 years where it was once easily 5 times in 1 day), making late payments on all my bills, and not being able to save more than $200 in any given month. Now I almost debt free(still have those damn student loans grrrr) Have 401k, Mutual fund, health insurance, a *gasp* retirement plan, been promoted twice at work and quit smoking cigarettes. <br>
I'll be 29 in April and I can't be happier with where my life is headed now than from where it was going before EQ which was nowhere. <br>
Heh this almost sounds like a comercial or something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukaibutsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaibutsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/6/02 3:47:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22641.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> Heh!<br>

Everquest.  Can't pay your bills?  Tired of calls from creditors?  Well, just buy our game, and your troubles will be answered!<br>
<br>
Hehe!  Very nice!<br>
<br>
Btw, grats Keddo!  That is excellent that you have pulled out of a financial rut and have made a total 180 like that.  That is really cool.  I always say EQ is an excellent form of cheap entertainment.  Thank you for proving me right!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
My playing times was pretty close to that. 11am to 2am, yes, you are reading that correctly, 15 hours/day was normal for me.<br>
<br>
But I realized that, after all is said and done, EverQuest will only be here until it dies, and Family will be around forever.<br>
<br>
So now, even if it's just spending time in the Living Room not talking to my dad, or driving around doing literally nothing with my mom, or just hanging out reading books with my brother, it's far more important to me than EverQuest.<br>
<br>
Nowdays, I play less than 5 hours a week. I only go on Hate raids for my guild, and sort of protect my guildie's twinks when they try their solo run to make sure they enjoy their solo experience as much as I have. (12 solo runs to date)<br>
<br>
I haven't lost my in-game friends. <br>
<br>
So, just so ya guys know, even if it's just sitting in your room watching TV, it means a lot to your family just being in the same room with them, ya know? Many of you are children who live with your parents still, but when I lived with my parents, I knew that just my precense brightened their days because they thought I wanted to spend time with them, when it was only Patch day.<br>
<br>
I encourage you guys to play less, it really helps, ya know? Sure, EQ is better than watching TV, but.. just be nice to your parents or those living with you. I assure you that you wont regret it, I know I don't.<br>
<br>
Someone said it was better than going to the bar and getting drunk. Just so you know- I wish I could do that. I'd give all my money for your chances. Technology is coming soon for me, soon I will be able to hear, albeit it's current $90,000 price tag, in a year or so I'll be able to hear. Just understand that even if it's just going to the bar, many are envious of you for simply being able to do that.<br>
<br>
My opportunities in life have been destroyed by something that was not my choice, so it pisses me off to no end when others destroy their own chances by choice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uneurosezzeshadowblayze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neurosezze Shadowblayze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 6:32:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22641.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> for the past month i havent gone to school...here is what i do...<br>

I live by my self,  was playing too much EQ at times, not going to school like i should...<br>
Then i get called into the army, and now i CANT play as much EQ as i used too, and it feels good...<br>
And when im on leave i spend more time with friends..<br>
Now i play very little EQ, but a lot of DAoC, cause i have 4 RL friends playing, and 4 other i know of playing, that way we get a lot of real life communication (use Tlf. as WoN =) <br>
Only bummer is that a girl that i like hate me for playing EQ that little =)  she enjoyed coming over and pretending to be &quot;that princess&quot; (firiona vie) =)  well...  the bad rogue i am, i guess i still have to do what FV tells me.....  *grin*<br>
Anyway, Smash a hammer into ur harddrive if u got problems with EQ, and order a new one from a SLOW mail ordering firma...  That way you have to do RL stuff hehehehe<br>
Bah  im rambeling on....<br>
