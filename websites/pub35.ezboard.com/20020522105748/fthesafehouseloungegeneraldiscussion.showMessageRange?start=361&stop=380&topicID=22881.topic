Verant even while they were working on Luclin.  That is an entirely different team that is working closely in conjunction with Lucas Arts..  While it certainly looks like it will be an awesome game, I don't think it will directly compete with EQ.  The reason being is simple, Star Wars is sci-fi and EQ is fantasy.  Those who prefer fantasy won't care that Star Wars' graphics are better, or that you can be a Jedi, or that you can fly a spaceship.  They will continue to play EQ or some other fantasy based game.<br>
<br>
The only current MMORPG that Star Wars will compete directly with is AO.  And from what I've heard of Star Wars I'm thinking it will win (although that's a toss up.. some people might prefer AO..)  Now certainly just as there were probably some people who left EQ for AO there will be those moving on to Star Wars.. cause some people don't have a preference or they prefer sci-fi or just because they are really intense Star Wars fans (who can't wait to become Jedi).<br>
<br>
The thing is that the multitude of MMORPGs out there has proven that there is room for all MMORPGs..  These companies wouldn't be doing this if they didn't feel they could make money at it.  Now certainly the market hasn't been saturated enough yet for the fall-outs to start, but even then UO, EQ, AC, AO, and DAoC have pretty much shown that there's still room at the table.  Will Star Wars or Shadowbane or Horizons or whatever comes next be the straw that breaks the camel's back?  Possibly, but the saying &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot; still holds true.. <br>
<br>
And what about an EQ2?  Well it's possible but not very probable..  Just look at UO.. it was pretty much the game that opened up the MMORPG market..  it's still going strong even with EQ, AC, AO, and DAoC as competition.  They had started work on UO2 but then dumped the project and instead came out with Blackthorne's Revenge - an expansion to the original game (they call it 3D but I think it's still the 3/4 isometric view thing that I hate).  Why?  Because they felt it would take too much money to make the new game and it wasn't really worth it.  So instead they found out a way to do almost the same thing as an expansion.<br>
<br>
Do I think Verant might do the same thing with EQ?  Well anything is possible..  but I think the real question is what is feasible or makes the best business sense.  In this case at this time it doesn't make real good sense for Verant to get rid of EQ.. Star Wars will almost certainly make them some money so it's not like they have to be in a hurry about it as suggested by some others..  And they've already shown they can continue to add to the game.<br>
<br>
The fact that EQ is still basically the same game will always remain a fact.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.  Just because some of those at higher levels who have run out of stuff to kill get bored doesn't mean that the game is broke.. It just means that maybe you should have enjoyed the ride more than worrying about getting to the top so fast.  Just the number of people who have played this game for more than a year proves that Verant has done something right.  (certainly they're not perfect but the numbers don't lie)  In many ways EQ is somewhat simplistic compared to how the other games work (especially when dealing with skills, etc.) but for many that's what makes EQ more enjoyable.  <br>
<br>
Hmm, well I'm starting to ramble now so I'll cut this short cause I think I'm a little off topic now..  hehe  <p><table><tr><td><table><tr align=center><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=5);font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;font-size:'12pt'"><font color=#FFFF99>Vargus Wolvendrac</font></td></tr><tr align=center><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=3);font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;font-size:'10pt'"><font color=#FFFF99>Barbarian Warrior</font></td></tr><tr align=center><td style="font-family:garamond;font-weight:bold;font-size:'10pt'"><font color=green><I>Crystalline Dragons of Xegony</I></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><table></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvendric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vendric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 9:51:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22881.topic&index=363>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My head hurts</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I remember when I first started playing EQ back when it originally started I used to use the map that came with the game to get around norrath. I used to plan my routes and say &quot;Cool, can't wait to visit the Rujarkian Hills and Lake Neriuss.&quot; Unfortunately those zones as well as many others on that map didn't exist yet and still don't.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Keep in mind that not all places on the map are actual individual zones, they are, rather, locations IN an existing zone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Looking at the new revamped deities page on the main EQ website, all of the deities are said to be ruler of some plane (rallos zek - plane of power, solusek ro - plane of sun, bertoxxulous - plane of disease, etc), I started thinking &quot;wouldn't it be so cool if all of these zones existed, massive raiding parties taking on each of the gods&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm betting that's exactly what we're about to get.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Looking at that same page I noticed one conflict. It says that Veeshan is the god of the plane of sky. When most other websites say that the current plane of air in the game is supposedly her realm. The deities page says that Xegony is ruler of the plane of air. But as we all know there are no gods in that plane anyways.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Okay, the only confusion here is the way they named the zone in game. It actually uses both Sky and Air. You see &quot;Plane of Sky&quot; when you zone in, and the zone file name, and name of zone for people in it if you're outside of it, is airplane. Basically, whoever worked on this zone was screwed in the head. Veeshan rules Sky, which is the zone in game, and Xegony rules Air, which is an elemental plane. I'd like to point out, not one single elemental plane is in game at all. Veeshan isn't in Plane of Sky becouse they don't want her killed, period....well at least they didn't when the zone was put in game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lastly, the sleeper. The story of the sleeper is that he currently is not meant to be killed. When released he exacts revenge on the first brood before taking off to take on veeshan herself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Him being &quot;not meant to be killed&quot; isn't part of the story, it's a game mechanic to prevent you from ruining the back-plot of the entire game. His release is leading up to something, we just haven't been told yet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> * All of those missing zones on the old maps of Norrath will be implemented, most will be low-mid level zones for the beginner players<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
With a name like Planes of Power you honestly expect the old world to get enhanced?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> * All of the planes listed on the deities page will be implemented, of course all of these will be for the advanced professional everquest players.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, actually that's what the name directly implies...at least the elemental planes themselves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> * Xegony will be placed in the current plane of air as its ruler.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sure she will, in the new plane of air. The one in game is the plane of sky, poorly misnamed, and the home of Veeshan, not Xegony. Veeshan, I'd like to remind you, also will not fit into any zone in game. Those huge valleys in west wastes? Her claws did that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> * The sleeper will return but this time after despawning after causing havoc around velious will either spawn immediately or within a short amount of time on the plane of sky and take on the mother of all wurms, Veeshan. At this point I'm not sure how VI will want to take the story. Will Kerafym appear and begin to lay waste to the entire plane of sky, destroying veeshan, causing norrath to self-destruct, a server crash and executing command &quot;format c:&quot; on all servers (lol jk). Probably what will happen is that Kerafym will spawn in the plane of sky, within 24 hours of despawning on velious, only if veeshan is not up. Kerafym will be killable at this point, pissed that his rival Veeshan is not around to be slayed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Whatever happens between Veeshan and Kerafyrm, don't expect to ever see it happen. It's going to happen behind the scenes, out of player reach, and we're simply going to find out through second hand info. Veeshan is one god I never expect to see rendered in polygonal glory.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If the new expansion is anything like I have described above, it should be rockin! Unfortunately I can't see it coming out at least for another year or two <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Probably will be released this December if my guess is right. Perhaps earlier but the christmas shopping frenzy is a great time to sell a new expansion. Velious and Luclin both were released for Christmas, I wouldn't expect this expansion to be any different in that regard. And, no, I seriously doubt the expansion will be released &quot;anything like&quot; what you described above.<br>

I've been playing the game for a very long time but never really got to deep into the history, legends etc of the game but the more and more I read about it the more and more I want to know more. <br>
<br>
-- Edit --<br>
"Factual" stuff, not what a perticular person thinks it is etc.  I'm looking for information based form quest, GMs, Verant, etc.  For one, what's the story line behind Fiery Defender?  I mean I did the quest and all, but I still don't know the story line.  - I guess I get that for following a stupid guild instead of doing the actual quest eh?<br>

Can't wait for the lithograph of that one to come out!!  <br>
<br>
The painting that is being referred to as a cover piece has a filename of POPcover.jpg (I just verified this on www.keithparkinson.com - says it is only a section of the full painting he is currently working on) and is the one with Firiona and an Ogre standing near some lava while Firiona is casting a spell.  You also have the Planes of Power sites registered to Sony and accessible through the station..  Then there's the screenshot from the Verant employee's desk and the mention that something big is in the works for high levels.. and a statement that we'd find out Friday..  All of these things, including the picture with Solusek Ro, definately point to a new expansion involving at least some of the Planes not currently in the game (first guess being Planes of Earth, Fire, Water, and Air)..  <br>
<br>
I think that's what most people's thinking in this thread is and what the info so far points most logically to.

Or people saying that EQ2 wasn't in development, or Verant isn't taking their previous experience to make the next EQ2.  While SWG will be different, it is definitely the result of all their work on EQ, and if they decided to make a new EQ then there it is, all done under the guise of a new MMORPG.  I am sure that PoP is not a duplication of that SWG effort, and would lend to the idea that its an expansion.  Yada yada.<br>
