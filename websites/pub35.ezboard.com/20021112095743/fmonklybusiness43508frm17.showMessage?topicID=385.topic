<br>
From what I hear, monks were the way they were pre-patch for at least 2 years or more, so it's no wonder many of the 2+ year old monks were very shocked and hurt by this, after becoming so accustomed to their class, and their role in game.<br>
<br>
So now what I ask, if they'll nerf monks like they have done, and do a straight nerf, not taking bits from here, and putting them somewhere else, just removing bits period....  Who's to say they won't do the same to another class?<br>
<br>
I'm an admitted alt-o-holic, I love trying all the different classes out, but where's my sense of assurance that I won't get attached to a class, just to be nerfed after putting months and months, literally weeks of played time into this class, setting myself up for another huge disappointment?<br>
<br>
What assurance do we have that, for the most part, the game is now &quot;balanced&quot; and another insanely controversial nerf for another class isn't in store in the future?<br>
<br>
This is just very unsettling to me, I just made a Beastlord, gonna try him out, where's my assurance I don't get to lvl 50 or something, and just start to really go full force to get to the ever glorious lvl 60 (soon to be 65 apparently) just for Verant to find they've made another blunder, and to nerf this character I've come to enjoy so much?<br>
<br>
I personally feel that as a paying customer, and with the time-sink involved with this game, we'd deserve some kind of &quot;future scope&quot; on what they have planned for other classes, hoping to avoid mistakenly getting attached to the &quot;doomed class&quot;.  I know I'm possibly over-dramaticizing these things, but EQ is so insanely addictive, it's hard not to get attached to a character you've made, and be proud of them, then when you get one of your nuts cut off, it's hard to say &quot;oh well, I won't miss it too much anyway&quot;. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uskewert.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skewert</A> at: 10/17/02 12:55:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unogem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nogem</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/17/02 1:14:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=385.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Feeling uneasy about starting any new chars now?</span><hr size=1> I'm only responding to the &quot;Who's to say they won't do the same to another class?&quot; thing as a rogue. My gear is 'ok' for my level. No where near end-game of course. With saying that maybe I havent seen all there is as far as my potential, but I've seen enough to make an few obsevations. <br>
<br>
In all honesty I dont see a nerf coming my way. Then again I suppose monks didnt see it coming either. As far as being a rogue...what could they really do to me? They cant change my defensive, my god. I'd be a damn int caster then. Doing something to my offense is working backwards(Wich I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> hope</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they'd relize...hope.). There really is nothing else to me. Closest thing I've had to a nerf is the AC on luclin mobs. Who knows maybe down the line they'll shit thier pants over rogue evasion. Who's to say?<br>
<br>
I dont want to try and pretend to be a non-monk expert on monks, but just from friends in my guild and out of this change was simply wrong. After you've lived a life for so long to come and have a major part of it (exp game specificaly) is horrible. Coming from a class, who for the most part, is unable to solo past lvl 20...maybe it wont be so bad in the end. God forbid, you'll have to go lfg instead of going to FG and soloing. Welcome to my life.<br>
<br>
PS: Remmber any view on monks I've made is for the majority in reference to the exp/leveling side of the game. I may have commented on raid/pulling, but I would be lost on that subject.<br>

<br>
this aside, yes you obviously arent a vet player, because monks have been slowly falling ever since kunark came out......right WHEN kunark came out a huge influx of ikky monks were made, obviously (fyi human > lizard ;) so they were nice enough to wait a few months after kunark to let the monks fall, using the iksar monk as a marketing ploy as they always do (look at beasties? what other class can level that fast? just wait, theyll get the shaft)<br>
<br>
the answer to your question is that no class is safe from being nerfed, because nerfing and changing around classes and altering the game is one way that verant keeps interest in it.......i mean look now, 10,000 warriors just got more interested in their class and rogues sure as hell are beaming with smiles, in fact they have been ever since late kunark/velious (just wait, theyll get the shaft, but they had a really hard shaft in the beginning, so VI needs to wait until everyones 'forgotten' that rogues did less dmg then warriors because backstab didnt even work)........<br>
<br>
the only way you can choose a class that you want to be able to solo with regardless of their nerfing (now i know im sticking my foot in my ass but oh well, its held true so far for the most part) is by picking a druid or a necro ;)<br>
<br>
in all honestly those are the only 2 classes that have always been able to solo regardless.......and no its not always been easy, but due to the nature of their class, they are able to 'bend' the way the game works and eventually they can kill things without too much risk and/or too much loss.........so progress for them, solo, has always been achievable......if this changes, their classes will be entirely broken, because the only reason they can solo is also the only reason they bring any benefit whatsoever (albeit, small) to a group......so choosing one of these 2 is a rather safe bet as far as choosing a class that will be solo capable........<br>
shaman is also a soloer now.......but wasnt exactly so forever<br>
<br>
if any of you say mage is a capable soloer or wizard, yer a noob, you havent been around long......but ill agree with you anyway because as the game is now, these 2 classes are also solo capable (but mage sucks pre-epic and pre-50......so i wouldnt bother really).........there was a point in time where melee's were solo capable.....and thats where monks shone, because back then, they still did enough damage to kill things faster then they could do enough serious damage back to the monk........and having a fungi or a regen along with mend to regain those (very limited amount of) HPs, made monk a solo practical class.......i believe VI didnt like that concept......they dont like when their players are happy, when they are able to solo if they cant find a group........VI just loves and rellishes in the amount of time ppl waste in 'getting exp groups' in order to get exp (hell it was impossible to get exp past 40 before kunark without a full group in guk or solb).......because they know that the time wasted to get the groups and get everything together and get situated far overweighs the amount of exp bonus gained in groups......and this all relates to more time wasted playing EQ which they think is the ultimate reason they retain their players........<br>
<br>
if any of you have played daoc or shadowbane beta, theres a really simple concept to those games that make them superior. (although i dont leave eq for daoc because SB is too close and i dont want to learn 2 new games in the span of half a year) that concept is that players will want to try out MANY of the different classes and play styles that they can imagine......that having more then 1 main would eventually be the wish of most players, if it was just possible......but in EQ its not.......<br>
99% of EQ players have tried more the 1 class, and have enjoyed more then 1 class equally, but have had to take 1 as their main......verant thinks that when this person is 'done' with their main.....having gotten all the loot, having gotten all the exp (funny how they added aa xp for yet another thing to 'achieve', and effectively level from 1 to 60 again), having done all the raids, verant thinks that these people will quit......fucking amazing that most of them stick behind and, despite the enourmous amount of work involved, most of them even start up a different class.......<br>
verant will never fucking get it will they.......<br>
and we'll all just keep paying......<br>
<br>
until shadowbane arrives anyway ;) <p><HR>

<br>
56 Halfling/Rogue (2 blues from 57, my &quot;main&quot; losing interest atm though)<br>
<br>
51 Halfling/Druid (have lost all interest for the most part, just cuz of their lack of a role in the high end game)<br>
<br>
49 Barb/Rogue (retired, he was a barb, I made a halfling instead)<br>
<br>
48 Iksar/Monk (this is actually my third monk, 2nd on this server, first one I got to 28, lost interest, second I got to 38 on another server, lost interest, and finally I chose to really go gung ho with one, and they nerf me.... so for the time being, I've lost interest again)<br>
<br>
40 Ogre/War (Warriors are boring, they'd have to get some new upgrades/abilites that are fun for me to ever go back I think)<br>
<br>
36 Gnome/Necro (I'm partial to solo classes, for the most part, and this fits right in with what I like to do, get on whenever I want, start exp'ng when &quot;I&quot; chose, not when 5 other people decide I'm fit to join their group)<br>
<br>
27 Half-Elf/Bard (My 2nd newest creation, I love the fact they have spell-type abilites, but use zero mana for most all of them, and I love running super fast hehe, and they can solo quite well)<br>
<br>
9 Ogre/Beastlord (Made a wee bit before the patch, put almost all my lvl 48 monks gear on him, he's fairly twinked, looking forward to trying out my pet, etc, seems like it might be fun, again, they're said to be a very powerful solo class)<br>
<br>
Just to prove I'm an alt-o-holic =)  I've deleted a 24 mage, 16 wiz, 16 bard, 28 monk, and a 12 wiz from this server too hehe, to make room for new toons =)<br>
<br>
This is just on Brell Serilis, I have a 22 Ranger on Test - 15 druid, 29 necro, 38 monk on Tholuxe, and a 16 necro on Bristlebane.<br>
<br>
So I've tried many many classes, and I finally fall in love with the monk again, and so this was just a huge let down for me, and gives me less desire to get another alt to 50+.  I loved my rogue for a long time, but I guess cuz exp is crawling at his level I've lost interest a bit, for now anyway. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uskewert.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skewert</A> at: 10/17/02 2:27:31 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=385.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=385.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=385.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.emailToFriend?topicID=385.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.threadControl?topicID=385.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=385.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=385.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17>Monk Change</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
