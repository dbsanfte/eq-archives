Every once in a while it looked around, making sure it was alone, but continued to stand still. I watched from my sitting point, a platform half sunk in the sand, but made no move to attack or catch its attention. Some days I liked to fight, this was not one of them.<br>
   <br>
The barbarian a few feet away from me had a different idea. As soon as he saw it stood up, and pulled out a giant long sword and scowled. He was big, but I was sure he even doubted his own skill in taking the lone undead by himself. He turned to a halfling sitting near, probably meditating.<br>
   &quot;Halfling, you know magics?&quot; he half grunted.<br>
   <br>
The halfling stood up and smirked at him, &quot;Magics of nature, tall one, that i do.&quot;<br>
   <br>
&quot;Good&quot;, he said. &quot;I'd like to destroy that undead, and maybe i need your help. He look tough. I tough but he look tough, too.&quot;<br>
   <br>
I smiled to myself at the barbarian as the halfling replied, &quot; fair enough,&quot; and immediately began to cast a spell. I wasn't sure what he cast but it caught the attention of the undead minion and he started to advance toward the caster, albiet a bit more slowly than i would have expected. In fact, very slowly.<br>
   <br>
The barbarian looked puzzled &quot;what you do&quot;<br>
   &quot; I snared him. He will come at me slow. I can run fast and cast a fire spell on him, run some more, and cast another fire spell on him until he's dead. All i really need you for is to make sure he doesn't catch me by suprise. You may stand here.&quot;<br>
   <br>
I nearly laughed aloud as i knew exactly what the reply of the tall warrior would be. He roared with laughter.<br>
   <br>
&quot; Aaaahaha. Funny halfling!&quot; He proceeded to run full speed at the closing undead and swung his sword in a humongous arc. The undead turned his attention to the looming man and tried to parry the attack with his right arm. The sword cut nearly clean through, but the minion was quick and struck at the barbarian with his left. The blow landed on his face, and the warrior was momentarily stunned.<br>
   <br>
&quot;fool,&quot; the halfling muttered, and cast his fire spell on the adversary. The lack of intelligence in undead creatures showed as he took notice of this new hurt and ran, slowly, at the druid. The warrior recovered and ran after, all the while hacking with his sword as the creature kept running, intent on the person who had casted such a burning spell on him. He was destroyed not to long after, chopped to bits.<br>
  <br>
&quot;Idiot&quot;, the halfling cried &quot;listen to those more intelligent than you. I know that's a long list, but it might save your life sometime you blithering fool.&quot;<br>
   <br>
The barbarian stared dumbfounded for a quick second, and then shoved the little man into the sand. That's when the rest of the undead chose to attack.<br>
   <br>
One chose me to fight, jumping on my back as i sat on the platform that many used to rest while travelling through the desert of Northern Ro. Another assaulted the tall warrior, and two attacked the fallen halfling, perhaps because he was already in a compromisable position, perhaps because they had seen his spell of fire.<br>
   <br>
The spellcaster was quick to react, snaring one and running away, letting the second hit him a few times, as it was not slowed. That was all i saw before I jumped up throwing the undead i was assaulted by off of me. I spun around pulling two daggers from loops in my belt and struck at the minion before he could recover. My attacks were quick but did little damage to my foe and he used this as an advantage, taking hits on purpose and using that to get some hits on me. We exchanged blows for a long while as I heard the results from the battle the barbarian was having. He was grunting more then his assaulter. <br>
   <br>
A flash of fire half blinded us all, but hit the undead attacking me forcing him to stop, momentarily shocked and more than slightly hurt. It also caused the creature to forget about me and lumber towards the caster of fire, which was good as I was still halfblinded. I then heard a serene sound and turned quickly to watch as a blue light surrounded the barbarian. He had been healed. This renewed his efforts, apparently, as he blocked the next attacks from his foe with ease and grabbed the him by his throat throttling until the head fell off. I marveled at the sheer strength of the Tall Men for a second before i heard a cry to my right and saw the halfling desperately fending off attacks from the mummy he had pulled off of me. The caster was out of mana. I quickly threw three shurikens in rapid succesion before sprinting to the scene, faster than the stumbling and still hurt barbarian. My left blade sunk into the undeads back forcing a cry i had never heard before and wished never to hear again. He turned to me and i looked into the empty sockets where eyes used to be, but now were lit only by an otherwordly faint blue fire. And i was scared. I most likely would have been dead had not the head that held those fires been cut completely off by the sword of the warrior, who had caught up.<br>
   <br>
I came to my senses, saw the headless body at in my feet, and two burned corpses of the undead in the distance who i assumed the halfling had taken care of before he came to help us. The three of us looked at eachother, said not a word, and walked off in different directions: Me to East Freeport, the halfling towards the Oasis of Marr, and the warrior in the direction of the tunnel to the Commons.<br>
<br>
                             <br>
<br>
   My name was Ruem. I was a member of the Unseen Circle of Hands of Qeynos but had been sent to Freeport to help our borthers in the Coalition of Tradefolk. I for one had no idea what I was to do or how I could help, but nobody argued with Hanns.<br>
   <br>
I was Human, as most of The Circle are and was caught unaware by the sheer numbers of other races found in Freeport. Qeynos housed mostly humans, half elves, and barbarians, but Freeport was home to many of all race, even Dark Elves...<br>
   <br>
When I had arrived at Freeport a month ago, even the guildmaster herself seemed unaware of what my purpose here was, and the note from Hanns to her apparently did not clear it up much. So, i spent most of my time exploring the commonlands or the Deserts of Ro and doing small errands between the different sectors of Freeport. <br>
   <br>
The battle with the undead minions replayed dozens of times in my head as i walked towards the city. It was the fiercest I had ever had; the battles with the considerably weak gnolls of Blackburrow were nothing compared to the... fear i felt with those undead. Fear. Not a good feeling for a person in my position to have, and i usually did not fear much. I was regarded as almost a hero among Qeynos Citizens for my valiance against the Darkpaw Clan, even as i was known to be a member of the 'lowly and corrupt' Circle, but apparently some things could still irk me. Two stood foremost in my mind. Dark Elves, and now, Undead.<br>
   <br>
I pushed back the brown hair from my similarly colored eyes as i near the port city, wondering what benign task she would have for me next. I longed to return to Qeynos. I did not trust anyone here.<br>

<br>
<br>
I stood in the room that Elisi Nasin used to control all the apsects of the Coalition of Tradefolk. It was nothing spectacular, just a normal room with a few desks and chairs, and a few piles of paper. I sat on the floor against the wall across from the guildmaster herself as she quietly conversed with her halfling bodyguard as she almost absentmindedly jotted tidbits down on a piece of paper.<br>
<br>
I arrived earlier that day and recounted to her my battle with the undead. She showed no feeling and I'm pretty sure Gren, the halfling sneered at me, as if the battle was childsplay. I did not like him. <br>
<br>
Elisi had told me she had a task for me, one more important than the trivial errands i had been running for the past month, and told me to sit and wait on the other side of the room, which was what i was still doing.<br>
<br>
I nearly fell asleep to the barely audible murmerings of the two in the room and the sometimes rising shouts of the two rogues who seemed to always stand outside of the guildhall room, like guards. They were drunk again. <br>
<br>
&quot;How do you feel about going into Nektulos, Ruem,&quot; the question was Elisi's.<br>
<br>
I controlled my voice well, suprising myself, &quot;Not a problem.&quot; It was a lie. Of all places she could have sent me, Nektulos, home of the dark elves was the worse, next to maybe Befallen, where i knew my newfound fear lived, the undead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; she smiled. A smile from her was not a smile of kindness. She was a cold human with brown hair and brown eyes that showed no softness or compassion at all. Never had i looked upon a female as i had her. She was harder and more dangerous then most men i knew. &quot;That is where i need you to go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both her and the halfling stared at me, apparently expecting me to ask why. I didnt, and she continued, &quot; I have a message for the halflings who have set up camps there.&quot;<br>
<br>
I accidentaly let a look of suprise cross my face and she smiled again, &quot; Yes, they have camps there. I and many others here suspect its to have a clever way of breaking into more trade in the Commons, but they insist it's to keep watch on the Inkies. This they back up by the fact that there aren't many rogues there, and that the operation was set up by the mayor and not the Deeppockets.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gren sneered, as if the name 'Deeppockets' made him sick and continued where Elisi left off, &quot; a while ago, they sent a messenger to us asking to send some of our men to help them out in a battle they suspected that they would have with the Dark Boys themselves. Apparently some of their scouts captured a young inky rogue and forced him to spit out some very dangerous information. Not only were the dark elves aware of the camps, they planned to annihalate them soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gren stopped and Elisi continued, which struck as comical, nearly causing me to make the very dangerous move of laughing at them. &quot;They would pay us for our men and our time, as we are the closest people that they can ask for help that they think they can trust. The paladins sure as hell wouldn't as they trust nobody who isn't one of them. The militia is too busy trying to keep control of the people of Freeport and nobody else gives a damn. The message you carry will name our price and describe to Arski, the head rogue of the camps, exactly how many men we can spare.&quot;<br>
<br>
They stared at me some more, and this time i didn't have any idea what they expected me to say or do. Elisi spoke again, &quot; You will leave tonight, for the attack is expected soon, though probably delayed a bit, since the Dark Elves will most likely notice the loss of one of their own and fear he fell into the hands of the Half pints.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this i stood up, and took a folded and sealed peice of paper from Gren's outstretched hand. He smiled at me, &quot;Dont fear them, young Ruem. The Dark elves are weaker than they look, and they look pretty damn weak.&quot; I wondered briefly if he knew i was scared of them or was just taunting me like the little jerk that he was. I then bowed before Elisi and turned away to walk out the door.  <br>
<br>
I was going to Nektulos that night.<br>

I'll think about the 'inkies' thing. I'd never use it in actual narrative, but i figured a person might use it in dialogue. I hear it used quite a lot on Povar.<br>
<br>
But wouldnt other races have some sort of detrimental word for them, and if so, what would it be?<br>

If you think about it, this is suppose to be a fantasy world and as at a older time, I don’t think most people were very fluent in reading and writing in those days so would a normal human or ogre of normal intellect know that a dark elf looks the same color as ink, hehe. Kind of makes you think. I would almost go as far to say that an ogre would just call a halfling a snack, lol. Think about how the race lives inside of EQ, and make observations on how another race would perceive them. I myself have always used the term Drow for DE, but that came from the D&amp;D and Forgotten Realms times, but I like how Salvatore used it in his stories. <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/Valdarious/Val.jpg"><BR>Valdarious Clandestri<BR>Wood Elf Rogue of 25 Shadows<BR>Solusek Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/ukorotana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Korotana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/4/00 3:42:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A story - Issue #3</span><hr size=1> A voice called out my name before I got far from the west freeport gates.<br>
<br>
I turned and saw Nestral T'Gazc, the dark elf woman who worked for Elisi. I hadn't talked to her much, blaming my natural fear for her kind, but she never seemed cruel and actually smiled more than anyone I'd met in the Coalition.<br>
<br>
She walked up to me and said, &quot;You do know how to get there don't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
It struck me odd that not only did she know of my mission, but cared enough to ask if i knew what i was doing. So i didnt answer. <br>
<br>
She smiled at me, &quot;You fear me, dont you? Us. I can tell..you dont talk much, but less to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stayed silent as she continued, &quot;Kind of an odd feeling to have for someone in your line of work, isnt it? Esepcially if you hide it so poorly. Most, if they are afraid, dont let others notice it as easily as i have yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
I grimaced and chose that time to reply, &quot; I did not know fear before dark elves. Hiding it is more cowardly than having the fear itself. I'd rather destroy it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded and waved her hand towards the wall of the city, &quot;This wall, as you probably know by now, ends where than a tiny mountain range starts off. Follow that and you can't miss an opening that leads directly into the forest of nektulos. As for the camps themselves, Elisi failed in mentioning that they were all positioned on the foothills. Don't fret too much about that part, if you walk in that general direction, the halflings will probably find you themselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded, myself, still wondering at her... kindness. She shrugged as if she knew what I was thinking, &quot;Don't be so close-minded Ruem. Good luck.&quot; She walked away.<br>
<br>
The only thing that went through my mind as i followed the mountains she directed me to was why my fear started in the first place. I recounted the whole event as I did every night when i tried to sleep.<br>
<br>
It happened 3 years ago, when i was 16. I was living in Qeynos and had just started working for the Circle, unknown to my parents. We were visiting our friends, the Sayers, who had a home and shop in the Hills, halfway between the city and a tiny Druid settling known as Surefall Glade. On the second night of our stay, a band of dark elves attacked, killing both of my parents before the Sayers could call for help from a druid they knew, Cros Treewind, who frequently patrolled the area. He defeated the drow easily. I was only injured in the scuffle, when I leaped onto onto one of their backs in an uncontrollable rage after i woke up to my mother screaming as a crooked scimitar beheaded her.<br>
<br>
I didn't cry. I didn't even vow revenge. I sat in a corner, jerking my head around in pure fear at every sound for the rest of my stay there while the Sayers tried to figure out what to do with me. I eventually got a little control of my fear and went to live permantly with Hanns and the rest of the circle.<br>
<br>
The sight of the opening that Nestral told about brought me out of my thoughts. I walked up to where the mountain stopped and a miniature valley led into and area where i could just barely make out a few trees. It was nighttime, but where i stared into appeared even darker than where i was standing, as if an eternal mist covered the forest. <br>
<br>
I walked on.<br>
<br>

<br>
I stopped where the small valley ended and the clearing opened into the dark, misty forest. My night sight had always been subpar, but in this place it was next to useless. I looked down and could barely make out a road before kneeling and touching the gravel to make sure. I then went along the right mountain cluster and saw that where they flattened out into the forest itself ended quite abruptly. Backtracking back to the left I observed that that range ended in more of a foothill formation, and decided that was where i should look. Or at least where i should wander until the halflings found me, like Nestra said.<br>
<br>
I turned quickly to get a picture of what the trees looked like at the opening of my escape from this forest and saw a Dark Elf standing there, not 10 feet away. I couldnt make out any exact detail, but could tell he was drow by the lithe outline of his body and the chalk white hair clearly visible even through the darkness. He stood taut, arms upraised slightly holding what I could make out as too long dirks reflecting the light of the night moon.<br>
<br>
By this time i too had my daggers drawn and stood almost in the same ready position as he did, and at that time i knew that we were both aware of our odd... kinship. We were both rogues. For five long minutes we stared at eachother, me working to hold back my fear while watching him intently. I had no idea what he was thinking.. whether the fact that we both had some of the same purposes in life would mean anything or if he would kill me soleley for being human and in his forest. <br>
<br>
But his daggers lowered. It was almost unnoticable in my terrible sight, but i caught it as he lowerd his arms slightly. I then lowered mine as well, the same exact amount in the same exact time. Again, almost imperceptably i saw him nod. We both then turned simultaneously walking opposite ways, our backs to eachother.<br>
<br>
I walked on in my chosen direction uneventfully for the next ten minutes avoiding the wildlife, which consisted mainly of wolves and black bears. Once or twice i caught the eerie light of a Will o Wisp passing through, on a mission nobody would ever know.<br>
<br>
Once again, my poor sight failed me, as i nearly walked right into a wall of 6 spears pointed at me. I stopped and quickly held my hends up showing no daggers, for i saw the tiny faces of the halflings behind the spears. They were obviously rogues, for even in the darkness, i would have heard someone less skilled then me. In the distance, behind the wall of spears, a ball lit up in the hand of another halfling who i assumed to be a druid, lighting the place well enough for me to see.<br>
<br>
I spoke, &quot;I am Ruem, a messenger from The Coalition of Tradefolk. I bring a note to Arski from Elisi herself.&quot;<br>
<br>
The spearwall stood, and i imppressively noted in the new light that it wasnt six halflings, but three holding two spears each. The druid spoke, &quot;Well met Ruem. I am Sardigo, druid leader of the Camps in Nektulos. Drop the spears, boys, we've been expecting a reply from her.&quot;<br>
<br>
I nearly laughed as the fierce faces of the spearwielders turned instantly into smiling fat ones before they all proceeded to welcome me by patting me on the back. <br>
<br>
After my initiation, Sardigo said, &quot;come,&quot; and walked off in the direction i had been heading before i was stopped. The halflings trailed behind me, noisier than they had come upon me, obviously feeling quite safe in the forest of their fiercest adversaries. <br>
<br>
In another minute we came upon a campfire surrouned by about 10 halflings, every single one of them seeming to be talking at the same time. Upon our arrival, the halflings who had accompanied me joined in on this, and i nearly had to cover my ears at the racket. Another halfling rose out of the ones who sat around the fire and walked up to me, and i saw as he came closer that was actually quite tall for his race and had a very jolly looking, round face. He didn't say a word but motioned for me to follow with a huge smile as he walked past me. <br>
<br>
I followed as he led me to a reasonably more quiet but still light enough area and he spoke, &quot;My name is Arski. Sardigo told me you bear a message from the Coalition?&quot; <br>
<br>
I wondered briefly how he knew that, for i hadnt seen them converse, but just nodded and pulled the folded letter out of a pocket on the inside of my tunic. Arski took it and proceeded to sat on the ground, crosslegged, to read it. He read by moving his lips which annoyed me so I turned away, watching the halflings around the fire in the distance. Apparently one had pulled out some sort of instrument and the rest were dancing with eachother as he played it. I shook my head in amazement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great, isnt it,&quot; Arski spoke from behind me. &quot;How well the different factions and classes of halflings get along. We have clerics, druids, warriors, and even rogues here, me included. &quot;<br>
<br>
I turned towards him a little as he continued, &quot;yes, even rogues. Halflings are a naturally peaceful race, messenger. Nothing like you humans, who kill eachother over such silly matters as politics and trade routes.&quot; He than smiled the biggest smile i have ever seen, as if he new that statement might make me mad but wanted to make it seem really innocent. I only nodded.<br>
<br>
Arski shrugged, pulled out a blank piece of paper from his own pockets, a quill, and a tiny vial which i assumed to have ink in it. He continued talking, &quot;We came here to keep an eye on the dark elves, after a disturbing incident in which some of our young were attacked in our own Misty Thicket. Apparently, your leader is certain that we mean to cut into her Commons Market.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shes not my leader.&quot;<br>
<br>
He glanced up briefly,&quot; Yeah. From Qeynos than? That makes more sense.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wanted to stay quiet, but wondered about that statement. &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
He again looked up with a ludicrously innocent looking face, &quot;why what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why does that make more sense, halfling.&quot;<br>
<br>
He frowned, and went back to his writing, &quot;My name is Arski. It makes more sense, Messenger, because you are considerably nicer than other messengers from Elisi or just other people we knew to be in the Coalition. You try to act tough, but their is a softer aura around you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I had no idea what to think of that, and for a moment considered being raging furious. But if it's one thing i learned that night, its really hard to stay mad at halflings. He didnt notice my conflicting emotions and continued, &quot;I worry about them sometimes, messenger.. the Coalition. Used to be days when people called rogues were mainly just people who were more mischevious or more funloving than others, while maybe finding an extra money purse or gold ring laying around in the process. But this Coalition, and even your own Circle seem to be not having so much fun anymore. Elisi would do anything to keep her trade area secure. Anything. I fear that many under her command, and maybe even her herself, do not serve or even believe in our beloved Masked God.&quot;<br>
<br>
This struck me as ridiculous and i spoke, &quot;halfling, your not making sense. Only these Drowish rogues would ever dare to worship Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
The halfling was done writing, folded his letter back up and handed it to me, &quot;My reply to Elisi. Be safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
I looked at him for a second before turning around to walk way, but he spoke again. &quot;How did you know i meant Innoruuk?&quot;<br>
<br>
I faltered for a brief second before i continued walking.<br>

As for the fear problem he has it should be apparent that would be one of main struggles. A rogue with a fear like that isnt a very good rogue. He also said he doesnt want to hide from it, but would rather destroy it....<br>

I dont get the 'Darren' thing, elaborate further.. /whistle.<br>

While taking time to explore my new home, the base of the Coalition, i stumbled into an area partially hidden by boxes and crates, and completely unnoticable by a anyone who was just doing normal business in the area. My curiosity was arisen and i poked around, at the walls mostly, since hidden walls were a favorite craft of both the Coalition and the Circle. Upon finding a trick wall i entered another room, but this one was more of an... altar.  It was a place of worship, full of warped statues and rolled up prayer scrolls. I knew immediately that it was not a room devoted to Bristlebane and backed away. Fearful of my discovery, i snuck back to explore a different area. <br>
<br>
Rogues are taught never to completely trust anyone, but it was still existant. From that day forward, i regarded Elisi in a new light. Not fear, but complete distrust. One of the only things that provided a small kinship among rogues is the following of the same god, and i soon suspected that nearly everyone in the Coalition of Tradefolk followed the same as Elisi. The idea that it was Innoruuk was only an idea; a guess. Arski's words strengthened that assumption.<br>
<br>
Amidst my thoughts, i traveled back to Freeport uneventfully, meeting niether drow or anyone else on the way. Upon my return to our hideout on the docks, i found that both Elisi and Gren were still awake, and still in the same room that i had left. It was almost sunrise when I arrived.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back so soon?&quot; Elisi said, when seeing me,&quot;I'da thought that you would spend the night with the halflings for safety.&quot;<br>
<br>
I shrugged and fished out the reply from Arski to give to her. Gren looked on quietly as she opened to note up and read it. A frown appeared on her face when she first started and only got deeper as she continued. I found myself wondering why she let such an emotion show so easily. <br>
<br>
When apparently she had finished, Elisi took another sheet of paper and started another note. This was all done in silence, nobody looking at eachother, nobody showing any sign of thought, other than the Guildleader's previous frown. <br>
<br>
The note was obviously short, for she finished quite quickly and handed it to me, folded, and said, &quot;I want you to be the deliverer again. Don't leave now, get some sleep and then go back to nektulos a little after noon. Deliver it quickly and come back as soon as you can, if possible, sooner than you did just now. We need to get the men ready, and you will be one to fight in the battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We are helping them, then,&quot; i said, more of an assertion than a question.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Ruem,&quot; Gren finally spoke up.<br>
<br>
I looked at him, a bit puzzled.<br>
<br>
Elisi continued in place of Gren, &quot;We were willing to help them in spite of our suspicions about the trading in the commons. But our amount set for the cost of men was not only not met, but he replied that he would give only less. He also requested more men. On top of that, three of our spies returned while you were gone. They reported several occasions of members of the Deeppockets starting trades in the Commons and in North Ro directly undermining the hold we have in those areas, which can only be linked the camps that are present in Nektulos.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stayed silent, but began to understand where she was getting at.<br>
<br>
Gren cut in, &quot;The dark ones, we believe, will not attack the halfling camps anytime soon. The loss of their scout is too great a risk. So we will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even though i suspected what they would say, i could not control the look of shock the briefly crossed my face. Elisi spoke, &quot;Suprised? Arski has long not respected the hold that we have here, or respected me as the Rogue leader of this area. We cannot afford to lose any trade and he has tried to trick us for the last time with not agreeing to our prices for the men. So we will solve many problems by killing them all, and maybe even earn a shaky ceasefire among the drowish rogues.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was still in a bit of shock, but my thoughts turned towards Gren. This halfling was not only not mad at the imminent destructin of his own, but I suspected that he helped plan it. I sneered at him.<br>
<br>
He caught the sneer, and before i could even finish it, jumped on my chest knocking me over onto the wooden floor. My back hit hard, pushing the wind out of my lungs. I gasped for breath and strained my neck carefully, struggling to get up, but bracing against the two daggers that Gren had pulled to my throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quit moving, you fool, before i end you,&quot; he spat, &quot;I will not explain myself to such a lowling like you, but niether will i have you sneering at me. I have my motives, and if you wish to live, you will do as you are told without trying to throw in your opinions on the matter. Understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded without letting any emotion show. I did not fear him. But fighting him now would serve no purpose and wouldn't bide to well with the dozens of other rogues around who followed his lead. He got off of my chest, allowing me to move. I picked up the fallen reply to Arski, before getting up, bowing slightly to Elisi, and leaving.<br>
<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
After Ruem left, the halfling spat on the ground where the human had lay seconds earlier.<br>
<br>
&quot;you shouldnt have let the anger get to you, Gren.&quot;<br>
<br>
Green Frikniller peered at the speaker,&quot;I dont care. He's no man to judge me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Since when have you cared who judges you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It may not seem like it, lass, but the slaying of a dozen or so of my own kinsmen is not something i take lightly. I proposed it only to protect our business here and to teach the Deeppockets a long needed lesson. It does not mean i want the Coalition to kill every halfling they come upon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elisi only nodded, as the halfling continued, &quot;But this Ruem troubles me. He seems to have a... conscience. Seems to me he doesnt agree too much with what he have planned.&quot;<br>
<br>
The leader of the Coalition of Tradesfolk smiled, one that chilled even Gren's soul,&quot; Do not worry about him. He was sent here to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gren raised his eyebrows in slight suprise before Elisi spoke on, &quot;Hanns did not specifically say so in his note that he sent upon Ruems arrival here. But he did say that the young man had become quite a hero in Qeynos for his deeds in blackburrow, and that he was becoming quite an opiniated young man with a bright future. Ive known Hanns for many years, long before we were both leaders of our own Rogue guilds. And I know what he means by this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gren nodded, beginning to understand and Elisi went on, &quot;Any rogue who is becoming a hero in his respective city will either adhere to this heroism by leaving his rogue life and therefore holding too many secrets, or will use it to try to gain rank. The fact that Hanns thinks Ruem is becoming opiniated shows his fears of this happening.<br>
So, knowing that any death to a near-hero like that too close to his home city will result in too much suspicion, he sent him here to be killed. Any in Qeynos who learn of Ruem's death will just write it off as one of the dangers of traveling afar. As for us sending him to the battle that will happen in Nektulos, either he will help destroy the halflings, or die in the process. Either way, he'll be aiding our cause. If not, i'll send him on an errand to Ro, with an assassin following.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gren smiled.<br>
