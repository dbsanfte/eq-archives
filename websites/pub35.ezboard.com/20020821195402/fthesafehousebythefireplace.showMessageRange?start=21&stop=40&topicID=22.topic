I am the kind of person that can get quite bored, especially while waiting on someone to gate in to the teleport spot in Gfay.  So, I start attacking everything in sight...a couple of bats and skeles and stuff bare handed. After chasing down most of the mobs I climb up the outside of one of the pillars at the Wizard Teleport spot.  I am down some hit points but for some reason I just jump off the top of the pillar.  I fall to the bottom and lay there...going down to half a bar of purple being left before I start regaining hit points.  As I regain Hit Points and almost become conscious, one of the decaying skeletons comes back and starts attacking me....for like 5 minutes, just as I was getting conscious, the skeleton would actually hit me for 1 or 2 points and I would go unconscious again.  During this whole cycle, 3 of the mobs came back to beat on me as I would get lucky and kill one when I come conscious before the other mob hits me.  To this day I have no idea how I lived, but after well over 30 minutes of being under 10 hit points, I finally was able to sit down in safety and regain some HPs.  To make a long story short...my wizard friend, who I was meeting there,  was medding right in front of me with his back turned...I was literally one screen from him and he never saw me.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server2.ezboard.com:8080/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sloren>sloren</A></span><br><font color=#FF0000>(8/19/99 12:56:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boydshotrods.com/images/sloren.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My near death exp.</span><hr size=1> Saw some good ones but can anyone explain this. <BR> I was on my way to qeynos, in the kerranas, when i see someone training a griffawn.

I drop, but only for a moment, an dim back up, swinging again. It connects and i fall, watching my life fade before my eyes, The necro behind me imbues his life to me, i swing, the other caster hits it, the crawler hits me and im down again, up again. down again.

No such luck D'vinn spouts something about killing all woodelves and backstabs me for 47 and stabs me twice.  I make a mad dash for the safety of Faydark with him hitting me in the back from time to time on the way. In the tunnel he stabs me in the leg and I start to limp. As I approach the zone line I am slowing to a crawl, I know there is no way I will make it in time but I keep crawling anyway... D'vinn hits me a final time and I fall, I figure oh well I died again. But no I'm not dead only KOed and whats more rapidly sliding along the ground... *Loading Please Wait*  WOOOO HOOOO! I'm alive and lying on the ground in the (relative) safety of the Faydark woods! <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Perhaps another time I'll relate the story of how I earned my 13th rank by ridding Norath of Emperor Crush.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server2.ezboard.com:8080/useans.showPublicProfile>SeanS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/99 9:57:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cheating death</span><hr size=1> While playing a newbie gnome wizard I had gotten into a brawl with two kobolds.

I love to group with rogues though. On Quellious there is a rogue called Winestab (!!!)...He is now lvl 23 I think. At llvl 14, we used to group a lot for the dervs in WCommons. By god, the little guy will be prancing around the dervs and backstabbing them all the time..!!! <BR>  <BR> Anyway, my closest exp with the death thing was at lvl 17 in a full group in Befallen. We had 2 paladins, me a monk, and 3 casters. Hmm..I am tanking this evil thing which was basically wiping the floor with me when we hav two more of its pals join in. The casters blast the new monsters, while I was holding our first guuest. I Mend, fight on..The monster gets a dual weild/double attack in (Sigh..4 hits of 25 each or so!). I am unconscious and bleeding to death, Tada, I feel a &quot;healing &quot; touch. WOW. I am up and hitting it again..The casters are OOM. The monster ignores the paladins and comes for me! Very soon, I am unconscious again!$#$#$#e. Again, the second paladin uses lay hands on me! We finally killed the baddy. <BR>  <BR> And, this is the great part..That was the first time I had grouped with those paladins..!!

One of us died, one of us came through without a scratch, but Eiche and I were torn up pretty bad.  I zoned with about 20hp, but Eiche zoned, and was knocked unconscious on the other side.  The fact that it let him zone and then knocked him out isn't the crazy part.  He zoned and was dropped in the middle of Greater Faydark, still knocked out, and finally wondered his way out to the POD lift.  He's not the only person this happened to either. There was another fighting in CB at the same time, but when he zoned, he dropped in the same spot, but was inflicted with damage form the fall.

Everytime that situation happens, I wonder how much life I actually have left on the other side, because for some reason they seem to hit you some extra bits after you've left.  Well, that time I should've been dead, because SPLASH, into the drink of Dagnor's Cauldron I was, somewhere, I swear, inside the ground, at least it looked that way, with a few HP left.  Well, I got myself to the NPC camp and rested, my paladin friend resting over at the Unrest entrance with the other victims. <BR>  <BR> Other time was when I was trying to take out DVinn with barely any help.  Pushed it very, quite very to the limit and zoned.  Appeared somewhere under Kelethin, with a few HP left, just like before.  Well, I stayed there and worked on my bind wounds, a new talent I thought was time to raise, when I hear this crunch.  Someone of high level fell out of Kelethin and landed right behind me but had a few hit points left.  More skill raising for me. <p>Evanar
