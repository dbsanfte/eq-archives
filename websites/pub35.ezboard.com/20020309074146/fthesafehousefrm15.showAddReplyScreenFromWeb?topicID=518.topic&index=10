<br>
On the dmg shield post by tetrian let me make a few points.  First off your post on the dmg shields was utterly inaccurate dmg shields are as it stands almost useless vs high dmg 2h weapons and very strong vs fast one handers even without shaman ds potions.  DS are quite strong and useful as they are even without the ds potions that thankfully most casters are too cheap too use atm.  As a rogue I MUST pumice casters with dmg shields or I WILL kill myself on the dmg shield allready.  That in itself says they are strong as they are.  Think about the average hit by a 1h weapon vs the dmg shield dmg taken and then take in consideration the amount of dmg required to kill a druid who can chloroblast themselves.  You may not have had enough experience to test this in your DUELS since you are on a NON PVP SERVER but its really not hard math.<br>
<br>
-Highest druid dmg shield is 38 counting both the ac + ds + the pure ds which stack.  This Ds does 25 in pvp due to pvp reduction.<br>
<br>
-Pretend the average hit of a given melee is 40 with a 1h weapon (this isn't unreasonable considering you can hit for one with your offhand and for 11 with mainhand even at 60 and this IS an average)<br>
<br>
That means that for every 40 dmg the melee takes 25 dmg 63% of the dmg that he dishes out.<br>
<br>
Now pretend the druid has 1600hp buffed.  Now suppose he uses chloroblast on himself 4 times at a cost of 700 manna. he will heal 1712 hp.  Meaning the melee has to dish out 3312hp and take 2086 dmg.<br>
<br>
Effectively speaking in other words duel wielding melees allready have to pumice and dmg shields are allready strong and don't need to be doubled with a potion.  <br>
<br>
Now you might at this point argue that dmg shields are too weak vs heavy hitting 2h weapons but Id agrue that you can't make them strong vs 2h weapons without making them too strong vs duel wielders.<br>
<br>
You might then argue that if a good pvper has to pumice off dmg shields anyway what does it matter if they are stronger? Because you have to hit them for a while just to interupt casting while you work on getting dmg shields off and the dmg you take during that time period is signifigant allready without shaman potions.<br>
<br>
<br>
LEVITATE<br>
<br>
Perhaps someone didn't notice I suggested making lev like scale of wolf OR improving pumice.  I have no problem trying to get levitate off but without golem wands sometimes its almost a ridiculous thing trying to get lev off before they kill me or I have to run.  Also note levitate is a pretty low lvl spell in most cases making golem wands NOT an option at all lvls and not even an option in nearly all fights at high lvls.  I admit that making it like scale of wolf would probably be bad as you suggested but a faster casting pumice would solve this issue as well without taking away your ability.<br>
<br>
I would like to note something here that may be of interest regarding the nature of pvp combat.  Most fights on rallos zek in my experience don't end in one parties death.  Most of the time I escape death even when losing and the same can be said of my oponents (except for those gimp naked casters).  What often follows is repeated engagements until one party dies (and even after that sometimes) or until someones friends show up.  This fact makes golem wands although sweet when you use them not a factor in most pvp fights.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next &quot;hill bug-it affects casters to when some melee runs over a hill and we lose him because we can't see where he was going.&quot; Even more reason to fix it huh?<br>
<br>
Next &quot;melee range bug-try turning off autoattack when you're out of range and then turning it back on when you catch up to someone, some people refer to this as jousting.&quot; /nod thats what happens when 2 people rush at eachother trying to hit eachother.  What happens when someone is trying to get away is you get a string of msgs telling you that you are too far away followed by a hit or 2 every once in a long while.<br>
<br>
PET KITING<br>
<br>
Lets define this better... <br>
<br>
Strategy A - running around with the pet hitting you between their attemts to cast<br>
<br>
Strategy B - not casting and instead running around in circles while the pet by itself wears down the melees hp knowing that the melee can't touch you and waiting for the melee to get low so you can finish him off.<br>
  A is ok B is not.  B is in fact exceedingly lame.  Fixing the melee range bug so that the melee can hit the caster while hes moving in the same way the casters pet can hit the melee while the melee is moving would solve this. This would put the casters pet and the PC on equal footing and would force the caster to use strategy A something that all non gimps allready do imo.  If its not possible to fix the melee range bug then the same result could be obtained by giving pets reduced dmg output on melees who are a) moving and b) not snared.  Not as fair as just fixing the melee range bug I admit but it would put pc and pet on equal footing...<br>
<br>
LINE OF SIGHT<br>
<br>
&quot;Line of Sight-only abused by gimps. Blue servers would love it if you couldn't use line of sight for heals to. Would make ToV take twice as many people hehe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me first make 3 points clear...<br>
<br>
A) On RZ all pks abuse line of sight as well as many many many others.<br>
<br>
B) Verant has the ability to choose on a spell by spell basis if a spell requires los.  You will easily note how all bolt spells for example require los no matter the target.  There is absolutely no reason in my opinion making all nuke spells los only would have ANY effect on heals.<br>
<br>
C) 6.1 second nukes suck in pvp except as opening moves.  As a wizard spells that are used would be lures (4.5 seconds) and draughts (3 seconds) soon to be 4 and 2.7 seconds for those with the quick dd skill. I suggest you back up a few steps and start casting as he sticks his head around the corner.<br>
<br>
One last counter argument.  You say your a wiz trying to kill a warrior in a dungeon.  Lets say instead your a warrior trying to kill a wiz in the open.  The situation is reversed is it not? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/23/01 1:20:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hehehe</span><hr size=1> Upon reconsidering the DS issue I decided that use of DS potions is a rare thing for the same reason that golem wands are rarely used.  That being that they are expensive and most fights do not even result in death for your oponent anyway meaning I might as well zone let em waste their 30pp potion and fight again.<br>
<br>
Both wands and ds potions are probably overpowering when used in some situations but the fact that they are used in only a fraction of pvp combat means they basicly add flavor to pvp rather than screwing it up.<br>
<br>
If either became as common as pumice the effect would be negative but neither is and both might as well remain as they are.<br>
<br>
On the other  hand trivializing the effect of damage shields is still wrong and comments like &quot;making hitting autoattack against a caster not meaning instant win anymore :P&quot; are also blatently wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
