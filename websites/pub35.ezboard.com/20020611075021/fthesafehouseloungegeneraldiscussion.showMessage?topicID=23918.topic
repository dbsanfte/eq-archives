If you expect to be dueling 40th level newbs (and how they retain their ignorance to that level is beyond me), be sure to stock up on some fun poisons, like spine break or some other paralyzing stuff.<br><br>If you haven't done it in the pass, switch camera views around some when you are fighting and evade to see the effect. Your opponent should still have a lock on you, but visually you will disappear. If you have sow and you tie sneak to the evade function, you virtually are hidden. Just back away so his swings don't break your hiding.<br><br>There are some good pvp guides floating around. Essentially expect your opponent to quick buff himself or from his group, as well as finding the nearest wall he can find to put his back to. If he's smart, he'll find a thick wall since you can usually backstab through if he's up against it.<br><br>Rogues lack buffing ability but in a prolonged fight, we can outdamage a warrior type 1on1. They fear the hidden backstab initially and the up close quick circling (if you have mastered the mouse look function). Use a bow at distance if he is doing the back to wall thing. Be sure to have a set of dueling arrows built for range to yank him to you. Then get in close and go to town. If he's using a 2h weap, you can probably time it so you slip in close to get a few hits, pull back and watch him miss his swing and then rush in for a few more, but I would personally just try and stay on his back. Mobs get the benefit of auto-tracking, but twitchy human players should be no problem.<br><br>This isn't the guide to dueling, just a taste of options available to you should you find yourself in a hormone stockpiled zone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/29/02 2:46:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23918.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: respect</span><hr size=1> A succesful evade will remove you fromt the target window, unless player has See Invis up.  o See Invis and you can avoid damage while waiting for those perfect BS shots.<br><br>Keep pumice or Golem wand handy to get rid of snare or to clear pesky damage shields, which rack up fast due to your low delay weapons.<br><br>Poisons are great when they stick, but since you will only have one opportunity at the beggining of the fight to use them, they cannot be relied upon.<br><br>Rogues can be very deadly opponents.

When I still played on Lanys T'Vyl, I had a rogue ( about 40 at the time) leveling up in Dreadlands.  A /ooc conversation got started, a really arrogant Iksar warrior started bashing rogues for some reason.  My equipment was average for my level... nothing great, his was about equivelent.<br>     Since I wanted to silence the fool, I challenged him to a duel.  He eventually accepted, and I immedietly hid ( I had no poisons on me unfortunatetly).... and when I disappeared, this warrior started freaking out.<br>     He started shouting stuff like ' WTF! YOU'RE CHEATING! How the hell did you disappear?<br>     At this point, I was out of my seat laughing on the floor, as was the rest of this zone I suppose.  After some 'hints', he finally figured out rogues could invis themselves.  I chased him around for a bit.... I'd uninvis, he'd come up to me, then I'd reapply it, swing around and BS.

It takes quite a bit of practice and a good ISP, but it is quite possible to joust with backstab. Once you get it down you can out-joust any warrior.

Not wanting to turn down a challenge I took him on naked, he never even got me to half health, I obliterated him, then of course tried to loot his corpse to no avail.  Then he challenged me again, and with equipment this time, I whooped him even worse, he was running all around the zone trying to find someplace to heal.  He actually accused me of cheating at one point when I feared him with Instill Doubt, it was a riot, at the end of it all he ended up giving me a Sarnak Emblazened Tabard as a reward!
