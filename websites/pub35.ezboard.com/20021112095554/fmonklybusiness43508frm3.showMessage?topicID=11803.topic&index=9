An email I received today. Names removed as I assume the person wishes to remain anonymous.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
I am a moderately equipped 60 monk from test. I have 2800 hp and 1200 ac unbuffed. I have tested a few encounters after the patch on test.<br>
<br>
I'd like to point out that there was no discernable difference in damage taken(solo) over time from the mobs. I did notice that:<br>
<br>
1. I was taking a lot less hits<br>
<br>
2. When I was getting hit, it would be near to full, or full damage.<br>
<br>
I tried this out on some mobs that were just above light blue con and I actually fared better against them. I pulled some of halls of testing tonight as well. The mobs there hit me quite a bit, as I expected because of there level and attack rating but still seeming to get less, but for damage.<br>
<br>
All in all, I believe this so-called nerf actually helped the soloing monks while slightly diminishing the uber monk tank.<br>

<br>
Ergo, I think that the fungi won't become a useless item, nor will monk soloing be diminished- it'll just be somewhat more random. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulaoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand High Poobah</span><br>  Posts: 2277<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/02 7:41:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11803.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> !</span><hr size=1> Think of it this way.<br>
<br>
  If our ability to take hits is going to be reduced, then AC doesn't matter as much as it used to on items.<br>
<br>
 Hence, HP takes a huge boost in it's relevance, and it was already my top stat.<br>
<br>
  Hence, the regen on the Fungi Tunic, given that we're going to be hit anyways, is going to be of a benefit ASSUMING that we last longer than X between heals, where X is the number of ticks it'd take us to regen the HP we loose by going with a Fungi.<br>
<br>
  Lets take an Icicle Tunic for example.  If grouped, and you're being healed for arguments dake by CH, then you need to last roughly 4 ticks between CH's to regen the 80 HP an Icicle Tunic gives you.<br>
<br>
  It's still as useful as it ever was.  More so in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wubao>Wubao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1630<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/02 9:27:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11803.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hence, the regen on the Fungi Tunic, given that we're going to be hit anyways, is going to be of a benefit &quot;<br>

If you can regen more HPs between a CHeal using a fungi than you can have wearing your highest/best other chest slot, then the fungi is the better item in 98% of cases.  The only other times are when added resists, or the added HPs, would prove more useful (when pulling very hard-hitting mobs for example).  The same principle applies for soling - if you regen more over the course of a fight than the HP on your other chest slot item, the fungi will be the superior choice.  Total HPs are irrelevant to the effectiveness of a fungi at any given level.  Sure, if you have higher total HPs, it will take longer to regen you to full, but that's no reason to give up the advantages a fungi provides. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wubao>Wubao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1631<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/10/02 11:16:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11803.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well, let's use soloing as the example</span><hr size=1> Since the fungi is primarily used for soloing, let's look at soloing.<br>
<br>
The GOAL of soloing as a monk: as much XP as fast as possible<br>
<br>
What Fungi brings to the table: Regeneration, decreasing downtime, and allowing you a larger amount of VIRTUAL hit points per fight. Very powerful effect, no doubt.<br>
<br>
What AC brings to the table: Less damage taken over the course of the battle. Unfortunately, this all out of whack once you get past the 40s.<br>
<br>
What DPS brings to the table: Dead mobs. Usually a good thing, since at level 55, handing in Crushbone belts isn't the most efficient way to level.<br>
<br>
What Haste brings to the table: Dead mobs FASTER.<br>
<br>
What HPs bring to the table: You lasting longer, so you can take on more mobs over a shorter period of time or tougher mobs in general.<br>
<br>
Most monks can't take on yellow cons past a certain point of twinkage. So it ends up being dark blue cons.<br>
<br>
Hit points are really good for taking on these dark blue cons, obviously.<br>
<br>
BUT, let's say you can kill say 3 dark blue cons (possibly Sonic Bats as they're a monk favorite) in a row with 1,700 hps before stopping to bandage, and regen up to full.<br>
<br>
Now say you have 2,000 hps when you do this.<br>
<br>
You may be able to squeeze another mob in. You may not depending on the RNG.<br>
<br>
But, your downtime is longer, becauase you've 300 more hps to regen.<br>
<br>
Less EFFICIENT.<br>
<br>
Not less powerful. Not less useful. Less EFFICIENT.<br>
<br>
That's all I was saying.<br>
<br>
Fungi's obviously still the single most powerful item a monk can have for any sort of activity. And the fact that there really aren't many chest items out there with better AC ... it remains end game for a lot of people.<br>
<br>
But, when you start to pile the HPs on, which is what a lot of monks are talking about doing, you do give yourself more time sitting on ye ole butt.<br>
<br>
That's all. Not that big a deal really.<br>

To use your example, if a monk has 1700 hps and kills 3 bats in a row, he has to regen up for a certain amount of time.  If we then give him 2000 hps, if he kills 3 bats in a row, his downtime does not change, since he's taken the same amount of damage.  Giving him more hps doesn't make him somehow take more damage - he'll just have 300 extra hps left at the end.  Thus I would disagree that more hps make you less efficient...they just make you less likely to die to some unforeseen circumstance.<br>
Now if the 2000-hp monk kills FOUR bats in a row...well he'll have longer to regen up, but then he will have gotten more xp before he had to rest.  I can't see how more hps are less efficient for soloing. <p><a href="http://www.deadlyvirtues.com/" target="_blank">

At 4300hp, a critical mend is a 2150pt self heal to me, if I had 3000 hp, it would only be 1500. That's a large difference, that's the sort of difference that adds to the number of mobs you can solo without stopping. Somewhere between 500 and 800 hp is what I can expect to dump into solo'ing a VL spider.<br>

  I'm afraid you're missing the point.<br>
<br>
  HP are important, yes.  Regen, however, can be more important than HP if a fight lasts long enough for a character to regen more than 125 HP, which is the most HP I've seen attached to a chestpeice to date.<br>
<br>
  Given this, any fight that lasts longer than 4 ticks (about a minute assuming my recollection of a tick as 15 seconds is correct) and a Fungi is going to regen more HP than a Tunic with 125 HP and the same AC / Stats otherwise will give you.<br>
<br>

My DPS really sucks now and I am starting to see value in STR also. I dueled a friend the other day that is a STR monk (180 str I think) he was using Fist of Rock/SoS + schw and STR gear(Robe of the lost circle has chest peice) he was 52 and I was 54 neither of us have epic yet....And he owned me.

People constantly say &quot;but, I have a cleric in my group (always), and so I don't need the regen&quot;. But even if you do, they may be healing someone else, or be dead, or OOM, or OOR. I can assure you that a Fungi is absolutly invaluable in these situations. Add in MEND, First Aid AA skill, and I often need no healing on a raid at all.<br>

Fungi is NOT a solo'ing only item. In a long fight, where I get riposted every now and then, get turned on every now and then, get AoE damage, Fungi is a live saver.<br>

Add in MEND on a long fight as well, and I'm often the one left standing when everyone else has slowly been &quot;eaten&quot; away bit by bit.<br>

Go and camp a Fungi yourself. Exp is reasonable, camp can be done with 4 very good people, or 6 reasonable people.  I did for my first one at a similar level to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulizzardlee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lizzardlee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 630<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/14/02 8:08:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11803.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok</span><hr size=1> Thats an idea. I could sell the one I got now, upgrade some slots get my epic and get to 55 or so then snag a bunch of guildies and friends and camp in OS for awhile.

Just a question of holding the camp is all.  <p>54 Disciple of Cazic Thule - <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=87708">Lizzardlee Blitzfizt</a><br>

<br>
I've been walking around with the 15hp/tic dot now for long enough. Every free minute I have will be spent farming cash to replace my fungi (It was a loaner /sniff), especially since I had to give away my durn whistling cryosilk robe this weekend (/mourn and Yay! at the same time). I'd camp it, but the rest of my guild is 60, and juggers &gt;&gt;&gt; shrooms for xp.<br>
<br>
So if anyone on Rodcet wants to get rid of their 'worthless' fungi for cheap, give Kwaid a /tell and I'm sure we can work something out. =P<br>
<br>
P.S. Are there any monk wearable arms with a chain graphic? Working on my 'human ranger in banded' look now that I've lost my 'old school human wizzie' look. =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucurscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>curscale</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 743<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/14/02 4:16:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11803.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thumb-1.image.altavista.com/image/15837144 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Errm</span><hr size=1> Bone armplates/legplates are all/all, but they suck. <p><A HREF="http://brunching.com/toys/cyborger.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.brunching.com/cybimages/C/cyb-CURSCALE.gif" WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=150 ALT="Cybernetic Upgraded Replicant Skilled in Ceaseless Assassination and Logical Exploration" BORDER=0></A>

Don't kick camping a Fungi.<br>
<br>
Reward vs time vs risk.<br>
<br>
Reward = a Fungi.<br>
<br>
Reward = reasonable exp (not the best, but pretty good).<br>
<br>
Risk = little if you know what your doing. Once the camp is broken it's piss easy.<br>
<br>
Time = Can be a long time now with the drop rate nerf. However, not as long as Raster. ;-)<br>
<br>
A 100K item (well, thats the price of Fungi's on 7th hammer), whilst getting reasonable exp, in a reasonably safe camp.<br>
<br>
And if you have trouble getting casters to go, do what I did way back when. Tell them you will spend half the camp time at Juggs getting spells for them, half at King. (although Juggs is a harder camp than King imo).<br>
<br>
If I needed another Fungi (which I dont.. have 2 now), no way would I spend 100K on one when all it needs is a few peope's help in an exp spot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=11803.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=11803.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11803.topic&index=19><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.emailToFriend?topicID=11803.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.threadControl?topicID=11803.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11803.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11803.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3>Monk Equipment</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
