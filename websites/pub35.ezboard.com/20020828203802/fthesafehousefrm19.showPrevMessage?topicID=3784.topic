It seemed, though, that there was never an associated link to the source material.  So I searched...and searched...  It shouldn't have taken me so long, but I finally found SOMETHING that seemed to have reliable information.<br>
<br>
First, some highlights:<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
New Classes and Races<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
Hibernia:<br>
Animist - a mage with plant based abilities, DD's and plant pets<br>
Valewalker - animist/melee hybrid, can spec in Scythe, wear cloth armor (may be changed to leather ala Friars)<br>
Sylvan - A new player race of tree men. They are tall and have spiky hair and rough bark like skin.<br>
<br>
Albion: <br>
Necromancer - cleric in chain, can spec in slash, summons pets<br>
Reaver - necro/melee hybrid, damage chants (like an anti-paladin)<br>
Inconnu - The new player race described as &quot;albino goblins&quot;. Thank god we didn't get stuck with dumb whitey race number five.<br>
<br>
Midgard:<br>
Bonedancer - necro/shaman caster class<br>
Savage - monk, spec in hand to hand, uses weapons like claws, brass knuckles, etc<br>
Valkyn - A new player race that look like taller, longer limbed versions of the Planet of the Apes guys.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
SPELLCRAFTING<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
Spellcrafted items will be able to increase stats, skills, resistances, hit points, power, and magic bonuses. SC'ers will also have the ability to enchant items using the /enchant command, much like the NPC enchanters do now. This ability will cost a small amount of coin when performed by the crafter. Items will be able to have up to 4 SC'ed gems placed in them. The most expensive gem to make is around 21gp. SC will be able to raise the quality of an item up to 5pts, so it will be possible to have weapons and armor that are 105% quality. Here is an example of a SC recipe.<br>
<br>
Imperfect Fire Essence Gem (Str +10) Cost to make=2gp 85sp 60cp<br>
-Imperfect Pal Gem(material 5)<br>
-17 magic dusts, Essence of Life<br>
-5 tempers, Draconic Fire<br>
This gem could be placed in any weapon with a vessel capacity of 7 or greater.<br>
<br>
The number of SC recipes is about the same as Albion armor recipes, so there are A LOT. It will be possible to make lvl 10 gems with up to +21% resist bonuses (holy cow!). Jewelcrafting will be added at a later date which will allow the imbuing of bracers, necklaces, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
ALCHEMY<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
Items crafted with Alchemy include dyes, poisons, magic potions/poisons, charged spells, procs, and particle effects. The number of Alchemy products that can be added to an item is limited only by your pocketbook, so its conceivable to add a proc to every piece of a suit of armor (can you say &quot;Full Suit of reactive DD armor for RvR&quot;) or a proc, particle effect and charged spell to a weapon. Magic potions will always be lower than the effects of a same level buff, for example, you won't be able to buy potions that are better than your friar or clerics normal buffs. By around 530 alchemy you will be able to make all store bought poisons. <br>
<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Apparently, it all came from information presented at the Roundtable in D.C.  There is other information including bits about the new zones, improved grapics, and some other &quot;stuff&quot; so go check it out.<br>

<br>
Saw this line up above.  If 530 alchemy will allow you to make Lifebane.  Will there be no better poisons? or are there improvements to the envenom skill on the way?  I'm also curious, if 530 alchemy = lifebane.  Will you need a spec of over 50 env to use poisons that are say around the 1000 skill point lvl to make.....  I would really like this.  it would make people think about how high they want to spec in ENV, instead of &quot;how low can I spec and still use lifebane.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.<br>
<br>
And thanks Brandyn for finding this info... i've seen it before but some others might not have.<br>

<br>
There will be new poisons, some are supposed to be made from rare components dropped by the big nasty mobs, no confirmation yet on what env skill these would take.<br>
<br>
Any piece of armor of the same ql and type can hold the same lvl of enchantment (ie gloves hold just as much as chest).<br>
<br>
Shields are considered weapons, not armor, for all enchantment purposes.  <br>
<br>
The only other info I know on poisons related to the Alchemy skill is &quot;Poisons will use the standard poisons up through the 530 mark&quot; - that's a direct quote from Ian.<br>

You took the words right out of my mouth...err keyboard...whatever.<br>
<br>
This seems to imply that higher level poisons will be above 530.  Or maybe there will be NO poisons above 530.  If the former is true, then we are going to have a lot of interesting discussions on new templates.<br>

<br>
from the info you posted looks like its going to be more likely to be implimented in the expansion. although i have heard the aug 1st date for spellcrafting on pendragon.<br>
<br>
the only real problem i have with alchemy,is to make useful items the mindset that you have to do drudge work,ie basically run out and kill mobs,to farm components.<br>
<br>
poisons in eq were like this,and they were basically a waste of time due to this problem. i remember running through kunark to get components for debuffs for our epic hunts. was a total pain to do.<br>
<br>
adding alchemy is fine,making it so that to get the items you have to hunt mobs,unless you get say 100-200 per mob,its going to be a total bust.<br>
<br>

from: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.petget.com/roundtable.html">www.petget.com/roundtable.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Items crafted with Alchemy include dyes, poisons, magic potions/poisons, charged spells, procs, and particle effects. &quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I think that poisons and dies will be the low level stuff Potions will be slightly higher and charces and procs will be the highest so.<br>
<br>
I just hope they make some endurance and health regen potions available. <p>----------<BR>

Nevermind.. found it. Mages get spell crafting and Assassains and Hybrids get Alchemy.<br>

<br>
As for how special things remain, although Alchemy is very affordable initially (basically up through the current poisons), the prices climb towards the end.  High end Procs and Reverse Procs (especially things like Bladeturn), and Particle effects won't be cheap and not everyone will want to dump that much money on them.<br>
