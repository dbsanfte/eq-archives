I was wondering why this happened, and i came up with a  hypothesis and ran a couple basic tests.<br><br>I figgured that if you zoned with less life than how much total hps your gear adds, then the server thinks you die, and you loose all of your buffs. Heres what i came up with:<br><br>I have 905 hps completely naked and UNBUFFED.<br><br>I have 1590 hps with all my items on and UNBUFFED.<br><br>So, this means i have +685 hps on all my items, including +hps, and +STA.<br><br>Just adding up the +hps bonuses on all of my items (no STA bonuses) i have +520.<br><br>So, 685 hps (total +hps with +STA bonus) - 540 (actual +hps value) = +145 hp from +STA.<br><br>I got completely naked (so i had 905 hps), and nuked myself down to 96 hps, and I zoned with ONLY the Jboots buff up. I DID NOT loose the buff.<br><br>I put on all of my gear (so i had 1590 hps), and nuked myself down to 62 hps, and I zoned with ONLY the Jboots buff up. I DID loose the buff.<br><br>Now this would make it seem that my hypothesis was correct, but one thing really confuses me, on the second test (the test with my gear on), before i zoned i had 62 hps, and after i zoned i had around 550 hps, so that means i gained about 500 hps somehow from zoning. My hypothesis to why this happens is that maybe the server considers you as dead, and then when you zone, it re-adds the life from your +hps gear. My total +hps from items, again, is +685 (from +hps, and +STA), and just the hps value (without +STA bonuses) is +520. So my hypothesis is that the server adds JUST the +hps (not STA bonus) to your life when you zone with life that is BELOW your total +hps value from items.<br><br>I know this is kind of confusing, but i hope i wrote it in a way where you can understand. I was hoping to get a discussion going on this, and possibly you guys could run some tests of your own.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulemacdushae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lemac Dushae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/24/02 1:38:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23447.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loosing buffs when you zone low on life - TEST + HYPOTHE</span><hr size=1> <br>The zone/hp bug is simply if you zone with less HP than your +HP gear gives you, you loose all your buffs.<br><br>That's about it. <p>-- <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7436" target="_blank">Lemac Dushae</a>, Guild Leader for the <a href="http://pub51.ezboard.com/bcourtofjesters" target="_blank">Court of Jesters</a><BR>53rd Season Rake<BR>Fennin Ro<BR><img src="http://node-02.advancenet.net/~ryu/secrethandshake.JPG" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujayrodjunteau.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jayrod junteau</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/24/02 1:41:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23447.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loosing buffs when you zone low on life - TEST + HYPOTHE</span><hr size=1> well if the server believes that you are dead while zoning. because mobs can still beat up on you after you zone.

Meaning, first things first, you load up naked, with the current amount of HPS you had when you zoned. So if you have 1500 hps with equip, 1000 without, and you had 10 hps when you zoned, the server says you have -490 hps. Then it adds your equipment, but, seeing as it thought you were dead when you zoned, you lose all your buffs, and get transported sometimes to the safe spot. <p>Nenjin Darkeyes<BR>56th lvl Blackguard Xegony<BR>"Dont open your eyes, you wont like what you see.

My nukes turn attack off as I have them hot-keyed, so I have yet to have this happen with my Mage. <p><BR>Sykes Liason<BR>Guild Leader, Order of the Light<BR>Tunare</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/24/02 2:40:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23447.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loosing buffs when you zone low on life - TEST + HYPOTHE</span><hr size=1> interesting bout attack off.  good to know the bug is getting some daylight.  we zoned out of CT once with someone with a strong poison tick on them.  they died cause they were at safe point would have lived if they had been with the group.  just yesterday i zoned from the grey into mons.  i did notice the gain in hp that time.  <p><table width="350" border="0" bgcolor="#51260B"><tr bgcolor="#924614"><td width="125"><div align="center"><img src="http://www.geraldfield.com/nadinesplace/muppetquiz/oldguys.jpg" width="125" height="108"></div></td><td width="177" bgcolor="#924614"><p align="center"><b><font size="3" color="#381A07">You are Statler or Waldorf!</font></b><font color="#381A07"><br><font size="2">You don't like dealing with most people, preferring to ridicule other people along with your equally misanthropic friend.</font></font></p></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#51260B"><td colspan="2"><div align="center"><font size="1"><b><a href="http://www.geraldfield.com/cgi-bin/unofficial/quizzes/sfesurvey.cgi?whatmuppetareyou" target="_blank"><font color="#C26A30">Take the <i>What Muppet Are You?</i> Quiz!</font></a></b></font></div></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uevertorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evertorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/24/02 3:08:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23447.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/pmelvin14/safehousepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loosing buffs when you zone low on life - TEST + HYPOTHE</span><hr size=1> /sigh<br>This topic comes up about once ever 1-3 weeks.<br>Thank god I book marked the URL.<br><br>Again, this is a bug.

Any time you zone with damage into those HP you appear to lose all buffs. As a ranger, this buff loss problem never once happened to me proir to the addition of the &quot;Strength of Nature&quot; spell being added. Those 75hp fall into that first catagory, and I've noticed this buff loss issue happen when zoning that low.<br><br>I disagree with the &quot;the mob hit you after the LOADING PLEASE WAIT thus resulting in your death&quot; theory. I've had it happen without any mobs around, simply being ported after having manastoned too far.<br><br>To test, duel someone while standing next to a zone line... Let them get you down to single digit hp, then zone. Do this once totally unbuffed (in terms of added hp.. use SoW, resist whatever, haste, etc to know if any buffs were lost.)  Do this a second time with a shielding style spell as a HP buff (and toss on a few &quot;junk buffs&quot; so you can see if you lost everything.) Repeat again with a second catagory buff (reso, hero, skin like anything-but-wood.)  To verify is +hp gear factors in, can repeat this test with and without +hp gear.<br><br>(skin like wood falls into first group, a shielding style buff... i suppose it was &quot;too good&quot; of a heal for lower characters.)<br><br><br>I wouldn't totally rule out +hp gear, but leveling my monk I never noticed it occur and I'd had probably 200-250hp in items. (+stam might be the problem though)<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugabus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gabus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/25/02 6:01:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23447.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loosing buffs when you zone low on life - TEST + HYPOTHE</span><hr size=1> When I put my hitsmode boxes up, Now everytime I zone I get a you are hit message for -2 probably about 4 times...
