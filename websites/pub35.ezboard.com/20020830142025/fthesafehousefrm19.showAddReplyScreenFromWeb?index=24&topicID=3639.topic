<br>
I play multiple SBs on multiple shards.<br>
<br>
Some important factors:<br>
<br>
2.5 spec points for Infs doesn't become a factor until say 40+ lvl (this is pretty basic math, so it should be self evident).  So all you people out there who are less than level say 40-something, I'm sorry, but you don't have the real picture.  Points make a big difference near end-game where multipliers of level make BIG points difference.<br>
<br>
2-Handed weapons are very nice in low levels, but harder to use in higher levels.  When you got more sneaky/experienced enemies running through you to blow your CD (enemy not in view), then that's a show stopper when you need that dmg &amp; stun to finish them off.  I'm sure that there are skilled/experienced 2H users out there, but they are the exception and I suspect that they are not fighting very skilled Infs/NS...<br>
<br>
Lower level Infs and NS on MLF are of such poor skill it's silly.  I rolled an SB on MLF cause it's busy during my timezone and the BGs are just a joke (ya, I know BGs are for n00bs, but it is just sad how useless these people were).<br>
<br>
Anyways, I know it'll be unpopular, but I'm of the oppinion that if there's gonna be no disguise skills/spells, then:<br>
<br>
Leave SBs with 2H (even though we don't use it), leave LA dmg where it is but change moves that require &quot;you parry&quot; to &quot;you evade&quot; (except lvl 50 move, make it back-facing or something... evade happens too often). Give them 2*lvl HitPoints. Leave Medium stun on second chain from LA move<br>
<br>
Let Infs spec slash or thrust, back up a bit in skill points to say 2.3 (it makes a difference in end-game cause that's were all the points are and they don't need DW up very high to be good).  For the Love of God replace the Long Stun of DragonFang for something else -- bad enough that it's an evade-based move (which high-level Infs do 50% of the time), that can be stacked, and is on reaction-damage-table-level-50 move... but Long Stun too?!?  Fukn Crack Smokers in the styles team... HELLLOOOOO?!?<br>
<br>
Let NS spec slash or pierce, Give them 1*lvl HitPoints (they are just too fragile those elves and luri), give them a natural +1 to Envenom (means say +37 points in end-game cause they need to spend one less point).  Change Diamondback move so that second move in chain stuns (or replace stun with bleed)... not sure if they need more, I've never played one, but there are some pretty successful ones out there, so can't be all bad.<br>
<br>
Anything wrong with the above?  I know a bunch of level 50 chain-wearing tanks getting their arse handed to them (after having been kicked around the countryside for a while) in toe-to-toe fights (no crit, no poison) with Infs... as an SB I wouldn't dream of attacking a tank unless I had Crit, Poison, AND he's SITTING!<br>

<br>
We are now on the same hitpoint table as skalds, a tank class. There is no way that Mythic will raise us higher than that.<br>
<br>
This makes the HP problem one of Con. Personally I think the +3 Dex, +2 Qui, +1 Str every 3 levels needs to be changed for SBs to +2 Str, +2 Dex, +1 Qui, +1 Con, but this wont happen because no class gets points over 4 stats, despite it still being 6 points every 3 levels.<br>
<br>
My next alternative is: Str +3, Dex +2, Con +1, but this wont happen either, so lets ask for:<br>
<br>
Dex +3, Str +2, Con +1.<br>
<br>
(Hmm, + Dex, how totally unuseful to a 2H CritBlade, &quot;you evede&quot;, &quot;you ignore the evade style as you wont hit in time anyway&quot;).<br>
<br>
