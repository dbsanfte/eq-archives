The growth of damage per level for left axe users was doubled. The person who was making that change was looking over all the styles, and realized the style called doublefrost was set at the wrong level. The style required no opening move, but had its base damage set at the same level as a style that DID require an opening move. This, combined with the left axe upgrade, would have made doublefrost absolutely obscene at the higher levels. So, he made a small fix. He didn't cut it down to the level of the other no-opener styles, but he did reduce its damage a smidge. <br><br>But what is a smidge? Well, the difference is about 3% down only when one's left axe is specced to 34 and no higher. <br><br>He tested this over, and over, and over. Spent an afternoon on it with some other testers. At spec levels 44+, it actually does 3% more damage than before. This was a controlled test, with the only thing changing being the code. He ran tests with old code, and then with new code, and compared them. <br><br>There just simply ISN'T a 50% reduction. I posted about it on the Herald, on the Vault, and invited people to send me their logs. Beserkers in my play guild also checked it out for me. Not one person has sent a damage log with any kind of proof they took a 50% damage cut in doublefrost damage. One person, ONE, sent a log showing about a 20% damage cut - but his first test was against a player wearing armor he got bonuses on (and was higher level than), and his second test was against a higher level player than he was wearing armor he got penalties for. <br><br>So why the ruckus? <br><br>Well, that was a problem. When someone first asked me about the change to doublefrost, I looked confused and said &quot;we didn't change it, it must be a bug.&quot; This is because the change was not in the patch notes, nor was it discussed with anyone. Internal problem, now hopefully corrected. But my original statement about it being bugged went everywhere. If you'd been a fly on the wall at Mythic in the last two weeks, you would have been one seriously amused insect.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morinn>Morinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/02 1:41:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3492.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Well all the TL logs I have seen posted show a lot more than a 3% reduction.<br><br>And frankly info like that impress me more than vague responces from a spin dr. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulisboa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lisboa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/02 1:43:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3492.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> More people need to cancel.

If testers say it is only 3% then it is only 3%.  Do you realize that there are some other things that could be affecting your damage besides the nerf bat??  It could be that more and more of the people that you fight are getting realm abilities that reduce damage like Aug Con.  It could be that buffs were improved.  There are so many variables in this game that the ONLY way to test damage is to do it on the test server where you can control all of the variables.  Most of the testing done by players is just add hock and only marginally accurate... like the example Sunraven gave.<br><br>For those yelling quit, do what you have to do.  I personally think it is blown way, way, way out of proportion, I know it sux to get nerfed but geez and I am sorry it happened but either quit or move past it.<br><br>Do you realize that at least in the upper level BGs no one was going except archers and assassins because of Double Frost and archers?  Do you realize that now after the nerf bat lots and lots of people go?  Do you realize that more people are going to stay and play than the few who leave in the SB and archer community?  Big picture... it was the right call.  I agree that it should have been posted up front but it was a mistake... let them up.  The fact is it has had a positive effect on the game play and the larger community.<br><br>Do you remember the post a while back about the SZ that was owning people in Darkness Falls?  Do you remember how everyone was talking about how uber they were?  Well, uber sux when it isn't you.<br><br>Check the patch notes, they are raising SB Left Axe again just to let you guys know they still love you.<br><br>If you really feel so put upon, try playing a NS for a while... and stop calling the testers liers... it is annoying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthebumble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheBumble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/02 2:26:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3492.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> maybe not lying</span><hr size=1> They might not be intentionally lying, but they are wrong.

Personally, I'll side with the players everytime.<br><br>If the damage was only a 3% reduction, WCS, then the Mid SB's and Zerkers should still &quot;unbeatable&quot; as we have heard so many infils in the past complain about.  Obviously, this is not the case.  If it were, infils would still be crying and getting &quot;owned.&quot;  If you have just sliver of rationality, you'll realize that the furious efforts of the infil community to justify the recent SB nerf testifies in brilliant technocolor that they are no longer dissatisfied with DF damage output, a ridiculous scenario if the damage was truly -3% WCS.<br><br>Add to that extensive logs in the Berzerker and SB communities, the testimony of so many players, and the long established history of the MMORPG PR department.  Taking a &quot;3% reduction&quot; at face value is nothing less than the compromise of one's intellectual integrity, assuming one has that to begin with.<br><br>I mean, come on.

Ppl are simply not playing their mains as much (on alternates) and there are more players in the game now days of that age than recently before.<br><br>Statement LA users were able to do more damage with a regular 2 H weapon (tested at non styled) than with their LA Styles, patch (stated increase)=(patch test=10% reduction stated).  Yes I'm sure that there are still alot of baby-assassins who can kill with ease in the battle grounds but the BG's and real end game RvR are of two totaly different calibur.
