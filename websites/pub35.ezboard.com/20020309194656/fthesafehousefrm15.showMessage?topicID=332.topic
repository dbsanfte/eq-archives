Yes - this is the greirage we all know and hate.  The imfamous leader of darkenbane - banned.  Since he is the leader, darkenbane was disbanded.  This has resulted in the majority of the members quitting the game.<br>
<br>
As much as i don't like the things they've done to me - they've been around for longer than i've been playing everquest.  They make the server what it is.  Without pk's, rallos zek is just a stupid blue server.  <br>
<br>
A day after this happens, we find out that(within the week) major pvp changes will be happening.  There will be absolutely <b>NO</b> petitioning for pvp related incidents allowed.  This means, no banning for corpse camping, killing in the bank, exp killing or ANYTHING.  <br>
<br>
This all aside, darkenbane was disbanded for something verant isnt even enforcing anymore in a few days.  I don't know how much enthusiasm i have for pvp anymore.  It sounds to me like they're basicly trying to get rid of all non-sullon pvp servers.<br>
*sigh*<br>
<br>
<br>
Below is the complete post on PvP changes taken from the darkenbane web site..<br>
<b><i><br>
PVP News from Minneapolis Fan Faire <br>
<br>
NOTE: All of this information is from my notes during the pvp discussion SIG <br>
at the Fan Faire and may or may not be Lady Daegarmo's exact words or <br>
meaning. Take special care that some of the more important rule changes <br>
are not yet in effect and violating existing policy can still get you banned <br>
until the new rules are officially announced. <br>
<br>
First, general news: <br>
<br>
There were approximately 1200 attendees (according to the hotel staff). <br>
Nine folks from Rallos, 25 or so from TZ and an unknown number (at least to <br>
me) from VZ. The RZ and TZ teams combined to do the "real life quest." <br>
<br>
ALL ZEKS (RZ/TZ/VZ) <br>
<br>
* In approximately one week, pvp "rules" will be as on Sullon Zek. <br>
In other words, there are no rules with respect to PVP. Standard <br>
blue server rules apply and sexual/racial harassment will not be <br>
tolerated. Everything else (training/bind point camping/exp killing, <br>
etc) will be completely legal. No pvp related petitions will be <br>
handled by the CS staff. The standard blue server type problems <br>
such as lost corpses, bugs, lost items, etc will still be handled. <br>
<br>
* showeq is actively being pursued to be "fixed" <br>
<br>
* Classes are being re-examined for viability in a pvp environment. <br>
LD specifically mentioned rangers as being one of the classes that <br>
is woeful in pvp. <br>
<br>
* LD is pushing for the return of egg shaped pumice on vendors for <br>
approx 200P each. <br>
<br>
* It was noted that Harm Touch and Lay Hands are on the same spell <br>
function with opposite effects so there's no way to give LH back <br>
to paladins on death while restricting the same recycle on HT. <br>
<br>
<br>
PVP Race War Servers (TZ/VZ) <br>
<br>
* Cross teaming is coming to an end. Teams (see later notes) will be <br>
LOCKED DOWN. There will be no ability to crossteam at all. No <br>
grouping, guilding, buffing, etc with non-team members. This <br>
lockdown is probably 60 days out. <br>
<br>
* The lockdown will entail a guild wipe. All guilds will be deleted <br>
and must be reformed. There will be extra staff for the first few <br>
days after the wipe to assist in this endeavor. <br>
<br>
* It is highly likely that common (the language) will be removed from <br>
the racewar servers for general communication use (ie, public <br>
channels). Training in non-team languages will also receive very <br>
low caps. <br>
<br>
* Strong possibility of adding a long (40 or so hours) quest to change <br>
your team. Certain classes/races would not be allowed to join certain <br>
teams (such as a Paladin joining the evil team). <br>
<br>
* TZ likely to be changed to a 2 team server (Good vs Evil). <br>
<br>
* VZ may be changed to a 3 team server. <br>
<br>
* statistics that are interesting: 45% of the players on TZ are evil <br>
races. 39-40% on VZ are darkies. A mere 13% of TZ is shorty and 95% <br>
of the epic weapons on these servers have been obtained by cross- <br>
teaming guilds. <br>
<br>
* It is not part of the Vision to allow a 1 time team change without <br>
the previously mentioned quest. <br>
<br>
Rallos Zek News: <br>
<br>
* Rallos will always remain coin + 1 item loot. <br>
<br>
* Code for rain spells is currently being changed to not effect your pet <br>
or your immediate group. <br>
<br>
* Big item is the player enforced pvp rules mentioned above. <br>
<br>
Other PVP News: <br>
<br>
* Sullon Zek will be live within 3 weeks. <br>
<br>
* There's discussion about adding a new Guildwar server with no "teams" <br>
but lockdowns based on your guild. Sounds like a very interesting <br>
extension/refinement of what RZ currently is. <br>
<br>
* On Sullon, the new summon corpse mechanism for good races will be <br>
obtained via a quest which likely involves PVP/crests of fallen <br>
opponents. <br>
<br>
That's all I took notes on. This was the first time I met LD and I was <br>
impressed by his enthusiasm for PVP. I certainly don't agree with everything <br>
he proposes or campaigns for but it's nice having a pvp advocate at <br>
Verant. My thanks for the time and patience. <br>

Plain and simple.</span><hr size=1> This list of changes can't possibly be real.<br>
<br>
Especially the &quot;team-changing&quot; quest.<br>
<br>
In order to change teams, you would have to change race.  They've already explicitly said there will *NOT* be a quest to change diety any time soon.  Seems to me race would be an even bigger issue.<br>
<br>
Lets say you're a dark elf cleric and want to join the elf team.  So you quest to change your race to a high elf.<br>
<br>
Guess what.  Your Innoruuk worshipping High elf ass is KOS by default to everyone in Kelethin and Felwithe.  The only Cleric guild you could theoretically train in would then be the dwarf guild, but you are KOS to all the guards on the way there.<br>
<br>
Also, what happens to all your stat points?  Do you get extra CHA for being a high elf and lose some DEX for no longer being DE?  If not does this mean Ogre warriors can change to gnome warriors and keep all their STR?  <br>
<br>
Also, the Lay Hands/HT BS:  You can look at em in the spdat file and clearly see they are 2 completely separate spells.  Actually 3 spells - NPCs have their own special version of Harm Touch.<br>
<br>
<br>
Doesn't take too long to figure out... the changes listed are made up.<br>

Firstly, when the first rumours about the SZ ruleset started circulation there were loads of people posting &quot;Verant would never make a server like that so it's all made up&quot; and look what happened there. I wouldn't jump to conclusions so fast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Secondly it says 'switch teams' not 'change race'.

As a Shank though I'm extremely excited to see this stuff happen.  I was getting burned out on the immortal healing and stuff, but now I have something to look forward to.  <br>
<br>
Regarding the guild wipes, I think they're serious here and it makes sense...in most cases.  Unfortunately one of the best guilds on Vallon Zek, <Order of the Black Rose>, falls into that catigory.  It's an all rogue guild, any race, and truly one of the best and oldest on the server.  It's sad b/c the exploits of x-teaming don't apply to OBR.<br>

Plain and simple.</span><hr size=1> There is *one* part of this that actually is based in fact.  The ironic part is its the part people have been questioning.<br>
<br>
Absor already stated in the official EQ boards last week that Tallon and/or Vallon will most likely get hard-coded teams in the near future, and that when this happens, any cross-teaming guilds WILL be disbanded and have to reform (as just one team).<br>
<br>
The guy who made up this list of changes no doubt read that just to have a little truth in the mix to hide all the BS.  People already asked about the possibility of selecting other dieties or changing to them in order to have race/class combo independent of team on Sullon and Absor said flat out its not gonna happen.  <br>
<br>
There will never be a quest to change team.  Thats ridiculous.  If you could then your guild would be cross-teamed after you completed the quest and would get automatically disbanded.<br>
<br>
As for the things that came true from the &quot;Rumours about the the SZ ruleset&quot;, the parts of it that came true were ALREADY KNOWN FROM THE LUM THE MAD INTERVIEW WITH ABSOR.  Which made it pretty funny when people were saying those parts were BS.<br>
<br>
