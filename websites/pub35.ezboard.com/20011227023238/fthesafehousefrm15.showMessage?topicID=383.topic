I come from a blue server.  Before all you &quot;true PvPers&quot; start with the comments, let me preface this post by telling you to kiss my little yellow ass (see left).<br>
<br>
So, I finally got to put some play time in on Sullon.  First impression?  I don't think I'll be leaving this server any time soon.  It's a blast.<br>
<br>
I started a Human Enchanter following Rodcet.  That started me in Qeynos and on the Good team.  I knew Good was going to have it rough in terms of numbers, but I really wanted to play on the underdog team.  I also wanted to be able to hunt in Black Burrow again and romp around my old playground of Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
While I got to start in Qeynos and be on the Good team, like I wanted, I soon learned that it's going to be a little while before I get to hunt in Black Burrow and zip around Qeynos Hills avoiding Tovax and dodging Rabid Grizzies.<br>
<br>
I level up to 5 pretty quickly.  I must say, I love that feeling you get when you scrape together the Gold and Silver to buy your spells.  One by one I managed to pick up my first and forth level spells.  I still (at level eight) don't have them all but every time I buy one, I'm totally satisfied.  It's like playing back during the release with 50 times more content, a stable connection and a few less bugs.<br>
<br>
@#%$, I would be wandering around North Qeynos and hear the /shouts from people saying the Queen was out.  Took me a few seconds to realize that it was the bug Queen in the newbie area.  I remember that bitch.  She killed me like 80 times when I was a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Newbie</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> newbie (as opposed to a PvP newbie).  Ahh, the memories.<br>
<br>
Well, I wandered out into Qeynos Hills.  Only a few bubbles from level 6 and that line that everybody else but me seemed to be confident to cross.<br>
<br>
Let me digress now to mention that the Good team is TOTALLY outnumbered.  Whereas before when I conned people and saw the &quot;threateningly&quot; report, I didn't pay attention... I now saw enemies eyeing me suspiciously.  They're everywhere.  On occasion, I'd see &quot;ally&quot;.  But it was rare and usually a blur (as they ran past me, fearful to stop).<br>
<br>
I felt like a human on the Planet of the Apes.<br>
<br>
Well, after a few more kills I managed to ding into PvP territory.  I immediately did what I've now patented as, the super spin.  It's where you whirl around to do a quick &quot;check six&quot; to make sure you have no bogies on your tail (sorry folks, I'm a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hitechcreations.com">fighter pilot</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> at heart).  I didn't notice anyone, so I did a few quick kills to get a small buffer and ran into town to sell some stuff.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://gaming.wlvrn.com/ss/ohboy.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I head out to kill some more bats in Qeynos Hills.  I end up dawdling around though... looking for beetles to kill for the eyes.  Over a Silver per eye is a killing for me.  Over the next half hour, my guard goes down as I get more relaxed.<br>
<br>
On my way back to zone into Qeynos, I notice a bunch of people sitting near the zone line.  I approach and take a look.  I guess it was just curiosity.  They conned white and apprehensive and I wanted to see what they were up to.<br>
<br>
Well, as I'm standing there, I'm rooted.  Then this Mage and Warrior (Rogue, Warrior... some kind of melee) start ripping me up.  I manage to get off a Color Flux which stuns them all for a bit.  As I try to mez the melee, he breaks free just in time to interrupt my attempt.  Many fizzles and interrupts later, I'm dead.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   &quot; DAMN YOU!  Damn you all to hell! &quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> -Heston<br>
<br>
My first time being wacked PvP.  My heart is pumping.  I end up back in the Qeynos newbie area, re-mem my spells and head back out... WAAAAY to the right as to avoid zoning into them.  Ready to fight, I pop into Qeynos Hills.  They're gone though, and slowly the adrenaline seeps away as I gather up the confidence to loot my corpse and zip off to the flanks near the zone to pick up some bats.  I re-ding on my first bat... seems they knocked me back to level 5 on that kill.  Anyway, I kill some bats for the next hour... this time avoiding ALL even conning bad guys.<br>
<br>
After I'm loaded up, I head back to bank a few more copper.  I gate back to the newbie area.  Gate at level 6 takes up like 75% of your mana.  So, PvP newbie that I am, I take off anyway towards the Qeynos Hills zone.  Zap!  I'm rooted.  I spin around and see a Mage (I think it was a Mage at least) off in the distance behind me.  WHAM!  He hits me with a DD spell.  I try and get a mez off on him, but it fizzles and I don't have any mana after that.  I'm stuck.  WHAM!, another DD hits me.  Finally the root breaks and I zip off to the zone.  A foot from it, a last DD hits me and I die.<br>
<br>
That brings me to my PvP rule.  I generally, won't <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>start</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> a fight unless one of the following conditions are met:<br>
<br>
1. You've attacked me for no reason and killed me in the past.<br>
2. You're killing a friend of mine.<br>
3. You've been ganking people in the zone for no reason and this is a chance to teach you a lesson.<br>
4. I'm in *really* bad mood.<br>
<br>
Those three go in the #1 category and therefore, are KOS to me until I settle the tab up.  Welcome to notes.txt!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   [Sat Jun 30 17:56:06 2001] Tokar<br>
[Sat Jun 30 17:56:30 2001] Fawlty</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I forgot to write down the name of that third dude who killed me... but I sure won't forget to write 'em down from now on.<br>
<br>
At this point, I meet my first even con Ally in the bank.  His name is Kwaichang and he's a really good dude.  Kwai gives me a Polar Bear skin so that I can head to Everfrost and have a cloak made.  I thank him profusely, say my goodbye, bank all my crap and head off to make the trip to Everfrost.<br>
<br>
Evidently, Everfrost is the only Good held area in Antonica.  Since earlier, I had made the run to Greater Faydark and seen the &quot;Good&quot; held territory there... I opted to get my ass to Everfrost and make it my new home and think about doing my hunting in Black Burrow later.<br>
<br>
Everfrost doesn't disappoint.  For the most part, it is held by the Good team.  I have to say, I was totally relieved to make it there and be amongst friends.  Occasionally, a Neutral PvP-level player would stroll through, but for the most part, we left them alone unless they attacked us.<br>
<br>
Well, I hook up with a group and start to hunt.  After a while, I meet up with a higher level player named Animon.  Another stand up dude.  He gave me a bind, showed me a good newbie quest and suggested that I show all newbie Goods the way as he has shown me.  Sounded very &quot;Obi-Wan like&quot;, so he went on my friends list right away.<br>
<br>
So, to cut this story short(er), I engaged in my first group Vs. group PvP encounter.  That ended in a draw as the higher level enemy kept running away to either the guards or some other anti-PvP NPC when our lower level superior number finally whittled them down.  Regardless, it was fun.<br>
<br>
I got to meet Wix (Pumpkin, Neutral Shaman) for the first time.  Nice dude also.  We got to talking and later in the day, he couldn't resist waxing me as I was running from some Mammoths that were trained on my group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   [Sun Jul 01 16:25:17 2001] Pumpkin</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Bastage.  I'll get you one of these days!<br>
<br>
At the end of Sunday, I finally managed to hit level 8.  I'm broke as hell though, still using my newbie dagger and robe and with none of my level 8 spells.<br>
<br>
I never got my first PvP kill.  My spells before 8 are simply not offensively oriented.  But now that changes and as soon as I can afford blind, root, nuke and cancel magic spells -- I'll finally be able to hold my own.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that was my first experience on Sullon Zek.  I am having an absolute BLAST (no pun inte...) and I've got that &quot;I can't wait to get home from work and try this or that&quot; feeling again.  Such fun.<br>

There are enough Goods to keep the area under control, yet lots of PvP opportunities when a group of Neutrals come in looking for trouble.<br>
<br>
A great area to learn the ropes.<br>
<br>
My only problem thus far has been money.  Black Burrow would be my natural turn to, but it's held by Neutrals.  Although, they'd prolly leave me alone for a while, it's just a matter of time before a group decides that my presence is not needed in their area.<br>
<br>
Once that happens, everyone jumps in for the gank.  They're like ants.<br>
<br>
In the post I mention a trip over to Greater Faydark.  I decided to make the trip there because I heard that the Good team was populating and controlling that area and Crushbone.  That trip was really interesting.  I made the journey with not much of a problem.  I did it at level 5 to see what the control zones were.<br>
<br>
Once you hit the Karanas, it's dangerous for Goods.  There are Neutrals and Evils everywhere out in the hinter lands, they like to gank, and gank a lot.<br>
<br>
Highpass was pretty much empty.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you, Kithcor at night when you're a level 5 Human is NOT a fun experience.  Even after knowing the zone from the numerous epic General practice raids, I was pretty jacked when I got through untouched.<br>
<br>
The Commons are totally Evil.  You could see them just ITCHING to kick my ass while I ran past them.  I can only liken it to putting a hungry polar bear in a cage that's in the middle of the baby seal tank at the zoo.<br>
<br>
I won't be visiting that area any time soon without either some serious backup or a friggin' SEAL platoon.<br>
<br>
Butcherblock is totally Neutral owned.  It's also really, really loud and obnoxious.  I got out of there as fast as I could.  The Skeleton chessboard is defiantly out of the question for a good while.  I suspect that if the Goods and Neutrals don't form some sort of understood alliance against the Evils, this zone will become one hellova hot spot.  It's a gank team's heaven.<br>
<br>
Greater Faydark is... a nightmare.  Imagine Faymart x4.  Now if you're from a blue server, add PvP to the mix and it's more akin to East Harlem (you're Bruce Willis).  It's FILLED with this hodgepodge of Neutrals and Goods.  It's also very easy to not have good SA (situational awareness) in here.  I was invis'd near the Crushbone entrance just listening to the chatter and talking with Pumpkin... deciding if I should get bound or port back to Qeynos and I saw several people get pick pocketed, ganked and generally fooked with.<br>
<br>
Crushbone or no Crushbone, I ported out of there after about a half hour.<br>

Tash, Color Flux, Mez.  Back off and get away.<br>
<br>
Like I said, until level 8 I have no offensive spells that do any damage.<br>
<br>
At 8 I get a bunch of spells that could really rain havoc down on a melee character.  Root and Blind are quick and easy ways to rule melee.  Coming from the perspective of one, I HATE these spells when they land.<br>
<br>
I have a regular partner (a druid).  As far as I'm concerned a DRU/ENC tag team should be one of the best mixed PvP/PvE combos in the game.<br>

I mezzed a Neutral who was popping new level 6 players.  I went up to his face, /danced, /rude and then backed off and kept him mezzed for a little bit.  He gathered quite a nice crowd too before one of the pissed off newbies took a swing at him and broke my work of art.<br>

We heard a group of Neutrals was corpse camping and generally messing with people.  Most of the higher levels had enough and decided to teach them a lesson.<br>
<br>
Lesson number one.  Guards don't equal safety.  After training the guard away, we bum rushed them.  Unfortunatly for the poor dude in the below linked screenshot, all his team mates took off leaving him to the wrath of the mob.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, he didn't last long.  Soon after this, his friends were found and... dispatched.<br>
