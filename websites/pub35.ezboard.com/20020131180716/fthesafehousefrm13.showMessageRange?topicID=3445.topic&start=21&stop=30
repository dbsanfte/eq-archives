Being a ranger I was able to track what few interesting or different mobs there are in there.<br>
<br>
Lhurgoz the Decayed is a named razor-fungus before the chasm, in a dead end. I believe his spot is fixed, with a placeholder. Blue to 60, wasn't overly hard, easy with one 57-60 group.  Hit for 236 max. Dropped a 10/21 120dd poker for us.<br>
<br>
The Burrow Beast is red to 60, huuuuuge worm, untargetable and indifferent. He is in the cave on the opposite side of the fake bridge over the chasm. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~ajleak/eq/burrower.jpg">members.ozemail.com.au/~a...rrower.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Elder Thought Horrors are yellow to 60, immune to slow, hit for 600 max and have a ton of HPs. They are very deep, in behind The Burrow Beast. We had no defensive warrior and not even a cleric.. hehe not quite possible.<br>
<br>
The red to 60 human npc (can't recall name) you can reach by taking all left turns. He seems to have a quest for deepspore shrooms. These shrooms are uncommon spawns on any shroom spot, but we have never had one drop a thing. They are just slightly harder than normal shrooms.<br>
<br>
Thought Horror Guards and Thought Horror Evocers are not mezzable, kill em first or root em. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We always go left, right, right, to get to the chasm. Can anyone confirm that taking the very first right leads to the chasm too?<br>

Can anyone confirm that past the elders is where the overfiend is supposed to be? I've taken a group in that far twice to the first elder, killed it ok with one group but then there are more elders and it just isnt realistic for a single group to clear them.<br>
<br>
As for deepspore mushrooms they do spawn in various places and they've always had atleast 1 deepspore for us, although we had no idea the guy wanted 4, we gave him 2 and he did not respond at all. the spores also are no rent unfortunately.<br>
<br>
We killed the deranged underbulk twice.  First time he had a massive underbulk shell, a 35ac 6wis/int 15hp/mana paladin/sk shield/cloak, the second time he only had a spell, although one that no one had seen drop, the componentless levitate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubraidfreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>braidfreak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/15/01 12:00:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3445.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: THE DEEP</span><hr size=1> we went right from the first juncture and mostly stayed right till we hit the chasm.  the chasm has a bunch of sidewalk looking ciff ledges like the on in katta that leads up to the top level). a lot of the ledges come to a dead end.  we ended up leving down to the bottom of the chasm (were no MOBs in there) and then working our way to a cave on the other side.<br>
<br>
everything got harder once we started heading down that cave.  it'sfull of ancient shriekers and all sorts of thought horrors and horror guards that hit in the 200s.  then as ou get really far back, there's about 8 elder thought horrors that con yellow to 60.  we had three groups and had no problems with them (shaman died on like our 5th elder), although it wouldn't have been pretty if we had 2 at the same time.  we got one 58 ranger spells off one of them and that's it.  <br>
<br>
i think if we had kept going, we would have run into the overfiend.  track has a very short range in this zone.  you can also push up against a lot of the cave walls and see the caves around you and what's in them.<br>
<br>
i don't know if i'll be able to drag my guild there again since they were dissappointed we didn't get anything worth noting in our 3 hour raid there.<br>
<br>
also, a lot of stuff sees both invis as well as rogue sneak, so CR will need to be done via summon corpse if you have a whipeout deep inside. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufeynanthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FeynantheWizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/15/01 1:58:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3445.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: THE DEEP</span><hr size=1> A group of 6 of us from my guild went down there, with our levels ranging from 57-60. After an hour or so our druid had to leave for an emergency, but the other 5 of us were feeling good and decided we could keep going.<br>
<br>
It was very risky, it was tough with the 6 of us (no ench or bard and the 59 cleric was the alt of the 60 shaman, who was pulling for us). So with 5 of us you can imagine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We went right at the beginning, and continued to go right everytime I believe, until once we went left and ran into a dead end. We back-tracked and went right instead of the left we took before. Ended up and the thought horrers or something like that (looks like the overfiend).<br>
We killed a few, but then we came to the evokers and tried to pull them. Got about 3 or 4 thought horrers with just 5 of us and no ench lol. We managed to kill one and almost kill a second, but I evaced because everyone was at or below half health lol.<br>
<br>
Great zone, was a real &quot;trail blazing&quot; feeling because its a maze and so big. Also there are a lot of choices and skill is needed in that zone (well at least with 5 people hehe) so it made it much more realisitc, and therefore more fun.<br>
<br>

There were about 6-7 Elders on track other than the one we were fighting. Tracking is pretty limited there not due to range per se, but all the tunnels twist, turn, circle so your actual linear progression through the zone is very slow, more things come into range tediously slow.<br>
<br>
On the 'other' side of the chasm there are two tunnels. Taking the one closest to the fake bridge (middle of chasm) will get you to the Elders/Overfiend fastest. Take the first right turn and go passed The Burrower Beast.<br>
<br>
Elder Thought Horrors (level 61-62) are an enormous leap in difficulty. At least the first one is an easy single pull.<br>
<br>
BTW, I don't think FD pulling is very helpful here, its just too slow. We had a bard lulling and it worked very well. Most thought horrors are in groups of 4, getting 1-2 per pull is a great way to keep the pace up. 4 at a time could get hairy for 1 group. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustaticbb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>staticbb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/19/01 11:11:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3445.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: THE DEEP</span><hr size=1> i was standing out side the zone and i was like wow.. i wonder whats in there! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uliquidated.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liquidated</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/20/01 9:48:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3445.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Upgraded mob damage</span><hr size=1> we were using this zone to exp a bit and the 10/18 patch changed that lol.<br>
<br>
The standard lawn trash mobs (e.g. shrooms, outcasts, razors etc) now hit from over 220 max, making single group forays much more difficult.<br>
<br>
I'd imagine this was to discourage aoe groups (back to kunark with you!=) but multi mobs pulls are pretty ugly now.<br>
<br>
Honestly, the exp mod seemed to get bumped up as well such that the exp per kill is significantly higher but it's kind of a shame that yet another &quot;broken group&quot; (Anything that breaks from the tried and true Healer, Tank, Slower/mezzer combo) friendly zone poofed =/<br>
<br>
<br>
Back to fungal for those post raid exp groups I guess<br>

Was able to solo pull these all but 1 set 2. I had another 53 monk work with me and was able to dbl fd tag split them after 4 attempts , trick is to  keep the standard mobs behind ya cleared about 10 min repop or less on them. Roughly 20 min timer on thought horror elders.  Keep your group moving either forward or a few steps back. Adds here equal certain death. Maybe A 60 monk could single pull the 2 but I'm inclined to agree that these are social mobs. However they have very low agro radius and even shorter memory. No need to q out here. Thought horrors elders hit for 600 max proc torpors insects(some). We used a main tank def disc to hold agro. When everyone did what was needed we had maybe 1 or 2 deaths tops and those occured when it enraged. We had 3-4 groups 2 clerics 1 57 1 60 1 tank 57 1 sk 57 3 monk 52 53 59 2 rogues 60 55. Rest were caster druid no sha for quite awhile and only 1 chanter.  We killed like 20 thought horrors elders i would guess got 6 spells , Overfiend had been killed day before( We would have struggled with him with the limited melee/levels we had at the time imo but with strong tactics could be done. Btw these mobs are immune to slows , a bit later we cothed in some extra tanks made a huge difference in downtime by rotating main tank with fresh def disc. Great place to hone up on agro management skills. Mistakes here means you better run to shadowhaven and buy coffins if you don't get a cleric camped or have a nec to rez that deep. Btw only time my 52 monk died was when the ranger roamed and trained mobs to us almost creating a wipeout. Man I just love people like that :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3445.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3615.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3557.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3445.topic&index=30><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3445.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=3445.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3445.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3445.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
