I when from 200-250 in about ... 4 hours. <br><br>Now keep im mind i did this with 90 Wisdom, 88 Charisma and 219 Dex. I did start with a 75ish Wisdom and that made CONSIDERABLE diference in how many combines=skill ups i would get so it a MUST to have hight int-wis. <br><br>I started out with 4.5 K.. I then followed the recipe and bought 2 stacks of Vials 2 stacks of Constriction- 4 stacks of Creepy Ive.  <br>I would combine till all the constriction ran out then sell these back. On an avarage i was getting 1 to 2 silver more every time which of course added up after a while.<br>I think the total price was around 11pp per combine .. and i was selling them for 14pp back so its a good 2pp or so profit per poison. Now of course you will burn some when you start but towards the end you are actuly making back some of that pp. <br><br>When i was finished i had poison making 250 and 3899pp meaning i really only spent a little over 6oopp from 200 to 250 which is SUPER cheaper then working with stanos :)  <br><br> Well there you go my 2 coppers :P  <br><br><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138165> Neijek Domisilva </a><br>Beloved of Velondra Domisilva<br>Proud Assasin of Bristlebane<br>Grandmaster Toxiologist for Phoenix Crusaders </center><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uneijek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neijek</A> at: 7/23/02 11:16:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvaslin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaslin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Safehouse Admin</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 1:45:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2361.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqcaster.com/images/vaslin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poison Making From 200-250 </span><hr size=1> Nice write-up.

You can save 6pp per vial if you are willing to just spend an evening here and there farming zombie skins in Unrest.<br><br>If you are making Spirit of Sloth (better to start closer to 200, but what the heck give it a shot) When you buy/sell Creeper Ivy &amp; Ethereal Suspension - make sure your charisma is at least 110. <br><br>If you make your vials and buy/sell with CHA gear, you should be able get 14pp 3g per potion sold back to the vendor and end up with a net profit (after raw costs) of about 7pp per potion. There are also the +3% mod items from Jagged Pine you might want to check out.<br><br>Honestly, with your skill level I think you will fail miserably on Mind Melt. It has a very high fail rate even at 230 skill. Spirit of Sloth is much easier to make. They both show trivial &gt;250, but that does not mean they are equal. Collect supplies for MM and wait until you are at least around 230-250 before you waste your components attempting it. Once you reach that level, then make it and recoup your costs by selling it.<br><br>Harlowe ~*<br>60 Assassin<br>Grandmaster Poison Making <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uharlowerogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HarloweRogue</A> at: 8/12/02 11:38:55 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showPrevMessage?topicID=2361.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showNextMessage?topicID=2361.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2361.topic&index=10><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.emailToFriend?topicID=2361.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.threadControl?topicID=2361.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2361.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2361.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory>Laboratory</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
