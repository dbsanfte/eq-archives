<br>
'Its good soil' he thought rubbing the loam with his hand, smiling to himself.  'rich. . .  it'd grow many things.'<br>
<br>
Thoughts drifting back as the earth filtered though his fingers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was mid summer.  The heat beat down on the farm.  But the rains of spring had been kind, and the crops were well.  Munz and I were getting ready to head out into the fields.  To help dad as best we could.  He was already out there.  Having started long before the sun crested the hills<br>
<br>
"Why don't you boys go fishing today."  She said. Well she didn't have to ask twice.  We grabbed our poles and ran.  I stopped just outside the door.  Munz stopped when he realized I wasn't running, just ahead of me.  Running back inside, I grabbed dad's pole. <br>
<br>
Mom smiled.  A shimmer of something crossing her face . . . saddness. . .  as I ran back by.  Tousling my hair.<br>
<br>
We ran and ran and ran.  Out into the fields calling "DAAADD!  DDAAD??!"  We finally found him.  He was hacking away at on old tree stump.  It had been there since. . . well . . . it had always been there.  The only blemish on the otherwise pristine and bountiful fields.  His heavy axe planted deep into a root.  <br>
<br>
Th strong oaken handle polished smooth from use.  Blade gleaming in the sun.  He kept his tools well.  Sharp and clean.<br>
<br>
It was strong, and heavy.  Bigger than most he'd seen.  But dad was no small man.  He wielded it easily.  As if he had always held it.  As if it was part of him<br>
<br>
Swinging effortlessly though the air in a great silver arch.<br>
<br>
It seemed a natural extension of him.  The shaft becoming his arm.<br>
<br>
The blade becoming the hand.<br>
<br>
Reaching down into the wood.  <br>
<br>
Molding it to his liking.  <br>
<br>
When he swung it, it wasn't an aimless hack.  No . . . it was more some how. . .<br>
<br>
Panting hard . . . pushing breathless words from my lips.  "Dad . . . come fishing. . . Mom . . . mom said its OK."<br>
<br>
Munz echoed me, "Yea, come . . . please."<br>
<br>
He was a good man . . . true to his word.  He'd not touched a drop of spirits in 7 months.  Even when mom offered him his favorite ale on the anniversary of their handfisting. <br>
<br>
Ohh he'd been angry.  But over the normal things.  Broken window.  Willful boys.  And though he'd raised his voice, he had never raised a hand.  <br>
<br>
Yet other things in him had changed too.   He seemed . . .seemed less alive.  Less interested in his family.  <br>
<br>
Dad was a wonderful provider.  And those years had been some of the most prosperous the family had seen.  <br>
<br>
But dad was . . . well he wasn't there.  <br>
<br>
Most days, he was up before the dawn, working the fields.  Walking the rows of corn.  Bailing the hay. <br>
<br>
Munz and I would help.  Not like we had a choice.  But it wasn't like it used to be.  Gone was the teaching, the moments where we were shown how life works.  Why things grew.  And why they didn't.<br>
<br>
He would stay out in the fields long after the day was done.  Often missing dinner altogether.<br>
<br>
He looked at us silently. . . his eyes fixed on Munz . . . looking deep into his face.  Then on me.  GODS!  The weight of his stare.  Hard eyes. . .resolute . . . crystal clear focus and purpose.   <br>
<br>
Softening . . . a smile, well almost a smile, crept on his face.  He stepped forward, leaving his axe embedded in the stump.  Taking my chin in his hand.  Munz's in the other.  <br>
<br>
Staring at us a long moment.<br>
<br>
"I've got to finish this boys."  My eyes sank almost as fast as my heart.  I felt his pole being drawn from my hands.  "But leave my pole here.  I'll catch up to you once I finish up."  My glance darted up.  So did Munz's.<br>
<br>
I could have leaped all the way to the moon.<br>
<br>
"Now go on!"  He turned us around by the shoulders and smacked our butts.  We were running before his hand whapped us.  "And leave a few for me!!"<br>
<br>
The fishing was great . . . We dug worms in our favorite spot.   And pulled in enough trout to feed an army.  <br>
<br>
But the day stretched on . . . and he never came.<br>
<br>
Afternoon be came evening.  The sun finally sinking below the horizon.  We'd given up fishing long ago.  The night sky glittering with stars.  The moon riding high, slipping in and out of the clouds.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the bank of the stream.  Neither wanting to go.  Because he might just be coming now . . . and we can still fish . . . and he wouldn't forget, we left his pole ya know.<br>
<br>
"He's not coming Munz." I muttered<br>
<br>
"IS TOO!" he retorted<br>
<br>
". . . come-on.  Lets go home."<br>
<br>
"NO.  HE'LL COME AND YOU'LL SEE."  Munz all but shouted.<br>
<br>
"I'm gonna go.  I'm hungry."<br>
<br>
He didn't reply.  <br>
<br>
The walk was seemingly endless.  I wasn't heading home though.  It was the stump I was looking for.  It was still there.  Marring the earth.  Seeming much bigger and much more twisted than before.  <br>
<br>
Cancerous.  <br>
<br>
Leaching life from the field.<br>
<br>
The axe was gone.  He would never leave it in the field.  It had a special place in his shed.  As did all his things.  It hung on the left wall.  The blade covered with an oiled leather sheath.  No he wouldn't do that with any of his important stuff.<br>
<br>
A root seemed to have been twisted upward.  Deep clean axe marks showing the battle it had fought.  <br>
<br>
I grabbed it.  Pulling and twisting hard.  <br>
<br>
The ancient wood biting into my hand, but I didn't care.  This thing took my father from me. <br>
<br>
Growling with fury and frustration . . . it refused to budge. . . anger building at the ugly thing.  <br>
<br>
Kicking . . . shouting . . . yanking . . .  howling. . . <br>
<br>
It crackled and groaned in agony.  With a great lurch it came free.  Sending me toppling to the ground.  Landing on something . . . hard and slim.<br>
<br>
Rolling over . . . his pole. . . <br>
<br>
Blinking . . . he left. . .here . . .standing up in disgust . . .stomping on it.  Beating it with the wretched root.  The pole bowed and splinted.  <br>
<br>
Tears streaming down my face<br>
<br>
Kicking the pieces.<br>
<br>
Shouting out into the night.<br>
<br>
Stalking home.<br>
<br>
A candle flickered in the window.<br>
<br>
Mom opened the door.  Picking me up in her arms. . . whispering to me.  Unintelligible words of comfort. . .  her native tongue.  I melted in her embrace.<br>
<br>
Carrying me to bed.<br>
<br>
" . . .Munz coming?" mom whispered.  The bed next to mine was empty. . . shaking my head.  <br>
<br>
Her soft hand to my cheek.  <br>
<br>
Warm lips to my forehead.  <br>
<br>
Sleep pulling me under.<br>
<br>
Munz was there in the morning.  <br>
<br>
Dad wasn't.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The last bit of soil fell through his fingers  The rogue stood up . . .  continuing down the path he was on.<br>
