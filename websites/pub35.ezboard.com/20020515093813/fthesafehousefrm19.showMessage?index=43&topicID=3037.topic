<br>
My stats.. <br>
Dorf<br>
44 axe<br>
44 parry <br>
44 left axe  (at the time i got to 44 the 50 left axe style was based off if someone parried you so i did not go for 50 and stuck to 44 for the icy briliance chain)<br>
<br>
First i think double frost WILL be affected... from what i can tell the herald post is talking about the % your damage goes up for your left axe styles for each point invested in left axe.<br>
(like say for discussion it went up 1 % per point now it will go up 2%)<br>
<br>
Second everyone is talking about doublefrost and comeback and neglecting the left axe backstab... Snowsquall ..it is devestating and for a shadowserker with half a brain taking left axe to 44 for icy brilliance is a no brainer... i have SQ/IB on my main RvR hotbar for when noobies start running.. and spam the snowsquall / Icy Briliance combo. with this proposed patch that combo alone will prolly be enough to finish off most players.<br>
<br>
Now to anwer the hibernia with the screenshot( that i didnt look at btw) was your party /sticking one person .. i can not count the times our healers get a whole group mezzed with one spell simply because they are forgeting the first rule of PvP spread out and keep moving... doing this eliminates most of the mezz the whole group with one spell type deal.<br>
<br>
Second... Hibernia is one of the biggest hypocrits when it comes to mez / stun.. you have an anal amount of mezzers / crowd controllers.. hell a group with 2 bards can generally wipe any other realms groups without breaking a sweat.<br>
<br>
Third... logging out due to frustrations.. been there done that but you learn nothing this way... get back out there and try different tactics....<br>
<br>
<br>
Now on to complaints about midgard again.. guess what ... our healers have NO OFFENSIVE SPELLS AND GROUP HEAL IS A GOD DAMN INSTANT!  so take that into consideration when you piss and moan about our healers... most high RP healers i know are solo artists that spec evenly among the lines so they can PvP solo.<br>
<br>
Clerics get smite paladins can res and tank effectivly sorcerers can charm EVEN CON PETS.. hell 1 -1 vs a sorcerer what chance does a friggin serker stand? NONE .. if the sorc has half a brain he friggin roots serker then debuffs then sends in pet and nukes a few times and runs if serker gets close...<br>
<br>
Bards have endurance regen.. speed song .. friggin good offence and if they not doing good in PvP then they need to practice different tactics...<br>
<br>
Midgard has been getting nerfed since the first week the game was out so quit bitching now that they finnally giving us some love.<br>

Most of this thread is shock that a very strong spec line was improved further (especially considering its counterparts are in need of serious improvement), not that anyone cares about Midgard &quot;getting love&quot; in particular.<br>
<br>
What do bards or healers or clerics have to do with this?  I could refute each of your arguments but it's totally off-topic.  Take that My Realm Needs Love and Yours is Overpowered trash to the !$@* vnboards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucharbonez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>charbonez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/2/02 12:15:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3037.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch Notes 1.50D</span><hr size=1> Why has the safehouse turned into a &quot;nerf everyone else&quot; atmosphere?<br>
<br>
LA gets a bug fixed. (it was labeled a bug wasn't it?) Polearmsmen get a style change. Heals cancel mez. <br>
<br>
Why don't we take away all armor, weapons, and magic. Lets also limit all the races to &quot;humanoid&quot; with the same stats. I hate to tell you this, but if you want variety, be prepared to have some combinations rise up on top. Balance and variety do not mesh well together. The more variety, the more complex the balance equation becomes. <br>
<br>
The balance of dominance in EQ shifted. The same will happen in DAOC and any other MMORPG. Who here also remembers how weak (understatement) rogues were the first month of EQ? Who remembers the giant influx of rogue twinks later on? Hell, rogues in DAOC have gone through the same thing but on a shorter time cycle. Some of you oldschool rogues from EQ's begining should be happy with how fast you recieved your fixes compared to how Verant handled it.<br>
<br>
How quickly memories fade. Maybe if we quit complaining every time someone else gets something and focus our energies on bringing up deficiences in need of fixing within our own classes, then we'll find each class helping each other a bit more. Basically the &quot;you stand by me and I'll watch your back&quot; syndrome. Kinda like this board used to be.<br>
<br>
It's realm vs realm, not PvP. Each and every class will not be balanced with their percieved counterparts from the other realms. Each realm will hopefully be nearly balanced with each other. That's all I expected when I read RvR. <br>
<br>
The LA change affected 2 classes. The polearm change affected 1 class. The heal/mez ...well...those affected everyone in their respective realms. (Seems it will do more harm than good, but I'll have to wait and see testing results.)<br>
<br>
Hopefully the realm balance will even out and the classes that need help will get their turn. <br>
<br>
Sorry, It's just sad that a once so close board has turned into the vault.  I've always enjoyed the debates on this board. It would be nice to see them return.

In the game of DAoC, there is a complete set of tools that gets divided up between all the various classes of the three realms.  Look at it this way, first you've got the essential tools that you can't level without.  There's a few basic things that you just can't survive without in either PvE or RvR, things like healing, rezzing, tanking, damage dealing, and crowd control.  All three realms need these basics to make it through PvE, and they're the foundation of good RvR (note, this doesn't mean one-on-one PvP).<br>
<br>
Then you throw in some spice into that.  This would include things like Sorcerers being able to charm a permanent yellow con pet, Bards having the only group endurance regen, Magicians getting a baseline stun in their Light line, and Healers getting the only instant ranged AE CC spells in the game.  This is where the real diversity in the game starts, you look at the three hybrid tanks from the realms, and while they perform more or less the same job, they're all very different.  Take paladins, thanes, and champions, and they're all more or less equal, with paladins being a little worse off for not having any ranged capability, but getting rez to make up for it.  Look at the three singing classes (Minstrels, Bards, and Skalds) for the realms, and you can see the same set of basic tools, but with a very different feel for all three, given that they come from three different base classes.  This is pretty cool, and it's the idea that I think DAoC is built around.<br>
<br>
You just have to look at all the classes in all the realms as being tools which have to be balanced as a whole.  For the most part, things are pretty well-balanced.  These essential tools are spread out among a large variety of classes, so that no one class has a huge advantage in the number of tools at their disposal.  This is where Clerics and Healers are a bit broken, for example.  They're both primary healing classes for their realms, and consequently, a whopping big pain in the ass to kill.  But on top of that incredible toughness, they've got a huge array of tools at their disposal that can bail them out of most situations.  In the case of the cleric, to complement their healing power, they get a pretty nice array of self-buffs, and defensive spells, along with some very powerful DD's.<br>
<br>
But to say that Healers get no Offensive abilities is, well, hilarious.  Unless by no offense you mean a convenient way to rack up solo RP's, which I'd agree with, but does *NOT* mean they have no offensive ability.  Just because an ability doesn't do damage doesn't mean it's not offensive.  The ability to stun a player of another realm for 11 seconds (the other realms only get 9 seconds max) is more likely to be used offensively than it is defensively, to keep a target immobile and docile while your buddies beat on it.  This is not even mentioning the fact that Healers get the only castable ranged AE stun in the game, and it has the same range as the robe-wearer DD spells.  The fact that the Healer instant CC spells are on a timer is equally irrelevant, because in most cases after a battle, even when you win, you'll spend at least a few minutes of your time rezzing your fallen, rebuffing, reorganizing, and planning your next move.  Writing off the ability to always win in quickdraw mez situations as useless because of a timer is way too dismissive.  That instant cast is available in at least two-thirds of fights, not to mention that it's not even necessary in most battles.<br>
<br>
But getting back to the original topic here, you have to look at each realm in terms of the tools it gets that the others don't, and how they can best be exploited to take advantage of a situation.  This will likely change a bit with 1.50, but I can't think of another ability in RvR that's as completely devastating as an uninterruptible, instant-cast ranged spell that completely immobilizes a large number of enemy forces, and at a range that's equal to that of most DD casters.  Sure, there are imbalances between assassins of the different realms, and everyone has the grass-is-always-greener syndrome, but there is only one realm who has a class that's both next to impossible to kill, and that can completely shut down all resistance through the use of its CC spells.<br>
<br>
Looking at assassins, they themselves are the tools.  The whole point of assassins is to take out the other realms' ranged attackers before they have a chance to use their abilities.  If they can do other things like help in keep assaults and find other assassins, great, but their primarily designed to kill casters and archers before they're seen, and get away if they can.  One realm has assassins that are better able to do their jobs because of their inherent melee advantages (2h weapons and very powerful LA styles), so one realm has a distinct advantage in taking out the other realms' ranged attackers and getting away, to come back and kill more as soon as it's safe to do so.  Balancing assassins isn't just a matter of PvP balance, it's a matter of RvR balance because it potentially puts the other realms' casters at a significant disadvantage.  That being, they're more likely to end up dead a lot quicker than the others.<br>
