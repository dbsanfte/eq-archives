<br>
I need a ground spawn (mandala sketch) from the East Wing of Howling Stones. My brother has a 55 DE Rogue. <br>
<br>
Does anyone know the answer (or any advice) to the following questions please?<br>
<br>
1) Is the Mandala sketch NO DROP?<br>
<br>
2) What are the odds of him reaching the ground spawn without aggroing anything?<br>
<br>
3) What size force could reach the East wing and clear to the ground spawn? Could a 55 Ench, 55 Wiz, 53 Cleric, 56 War get there fighting?<br>
<br>
4) Could my 56 War go in invis and get far enough before getting aggro that he could go defensive and run to loot the ground spawn?<br>
<br>
5) Is the ground spawn beyond a door for which we will need a key or can my bro pick that? His skill is maxed for level 55.<br>
<br>
6) Does being Kindly in the OT Outpost mean you are non-KOS to any of the mobs in HS?<br>
<br>
7) Does an illusion earth elemental potion cause you to go non-KOS in HS. (It causes you to go no-KOS to the Outpost if you are normally KOS there.<br>
<br>
We are all loath to screw up our Outpost faction, but maybe I can persuade them to fight in if it is the only way.<br>
<br>
Any advice would be welcome.<br>

I'll answer the ones I might know:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) What are the odds of him reaching the ground spawn without aggroing anything?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Better than average. Part of it depends on how fast he moves, and just some raw luck. When you get seen, it's usually an ooze. But if he gets seen, he's as good as dead unless he has an instant gate potion - there's very few places to run, and usually too many harmtouches to make it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3) What size force could reach the East wing and clear to the ground spawn? Could a 55 Ench, 55 Wiz, 53 Cleric, 56 War get there fighting?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope.  That group might do ok in the south wing, but in the east wing it's going to be rough going. Now I have no idea where this ground spawn is - if it's early in the wing, then maybe. But if it's farther in, I don't think you have the power. <br>
<br>
Also there's the issue of all the locked doors, since you didn't mention the rogue. You'd have to clear each wing for keys.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 4) Could my 56 War go in invis and get far enough before getting aggro that he could go defensive and run to loot the ground spawn?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
HS is a healthy mix of undead and regular mobs. If one set doesn't see you, the other will. To get to the east wing you'd have to go through the south wing, and deep in, and you need a lockpicker. Virtually no chance this would work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 5) Is the ground spawn beyond a door for which we will need a key or can my bro pick that? His skill is maxed for level 55.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't know where the ground spawn is but I can almost guarantee you'll face locked doors. The rogue will be able to pick them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 6) Does being Kindly in the OT Outpost mean you are non-KOS to any of the mobs in HS?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No. They're not friendly folk.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 7) Does an illusion earth elemental potion cause you to go non-KOS in HS. (It causes you to go no-KOS to the Outpost if you are normally KOS there.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No idea. But I doubt it.<br>

I will try and find out how deep the ground spawn is. So far it looks like the best bet will be a stealth mission. Maybe we can put him in with big cleric buffs, talisman and a rune, then rez him out if he gets aggro or if he succeeds. It worked for him in Hate when he was getting his own ground spawn. Umm actually it worked the second time after a Hate raid rezzed the first attempt.<br>

It sits on the back left coffin as you come in the coffin room in East Wing.<br>
<br>
2) A rogue could sneak there if careful, but I don't think the quest that it's for has any reward for a rogue *Grin*<br>
<br>
3) Your group, if they are respectable players, could get there. It would even be fun. HS is a blast.<br>
<br>
4) No. Too many potential HTs. No is wrong I guess. Maybe. You'd have to gimp to east and hope there's not a lot of Sep/Undertakers on the way. Gimping to east is cheesy by the way. Once you are at east door, there's about 25 mobs between you and the thing you want to pick up. A lot of those have a chance to spawn as a mob with 700-800 HT and some others cast ice comet/rend/conflag. So training isn't so smart *grin*<br>
<br>
5) The right way to get to East is through South and the South door is locked. You need a rogue to pick it unless you want to do North then West before South. The East wing where the quest item is is trapped. You can gimp over the trap in a couple ways, but it's cheesy.<br>
<br>
6) No, I don't think so. I'm not sure though.<br>
<br>
7) No idea, but I'd bet not<br>
<br>
I will would wager that fighting to the coffin room in East wing, fighting through south and killing every mob in the way on the shortest path, would bottom your OT faction or at least get you really close to it. I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but that's my experience. I had my faction reset putting my OT faction back and it was bottomed out the next time I went to HS.<br>

<br>
How do I 'gimp' to the East wing? I thought gimping was like 6 wizzie mana burn heh.<br>
<br>
I wonder what the odds are on my brother going in with his 55 rogue at the same time as I go in with my warrior. Then both of us heading to the East wing door, then he opens it and I continue alone, running when aggroed, and just try and loot the mandala before I die. With Aego my war has about 4500 HP, add rune V and I could take 3 or 4 HT's and still keep going. Maybe if I knew exactly where the spawn was, I could make it. But I guess not.<br>
<br>
Maybe I will post on eqvault asking if a HS group on the Eci server will let me tag along to loot that item. I was trying not to bother my guild as my Warrior is not my main, was hoping to do it with just friends, but they are not all going to go for losing Outpost factions as we all play dark races.<br>
<br>

The issue is that the stairs facing east wing are actually fake. You have to do the whole South wing to usually get there if you dont gimp it.<br>
<br>
Small races have a &quot;VERY&quot; hard time making that gimp run by the way.<br>

That's from memory and in ascii so it probably sucks! You start where the two Golems are. That's East Wing ledge. You need to get to the coffin room where the Q is. You have a lot of mobs to train through and a lot of them can potentially have Harm touches. Only taking 3 or 4 would be lucky. I would guess 6-8 would be normal and 10+ would be abnormal but possible.<br>

have the rogue check the stage room as well as the coffin room then move through whichever has no live mobs in it. at the top of that map is a hallway that is reletively safe to recast ivu in the right corner (right above the coffin room). you may agro a roamer or two but they are easily timed if you dont suck. then the warrior can just ivu into the room and pick up his thing.<br>
its takes some coordination and your people must must follow directions or it ends in sc, but this is how i got less-than-perfect groups to drussel many times.<br>
i only say take the entire group if there is indeed a live mob up that needs killing. if the rogue has skills he can scout ahead of time, usually nothing live is up past the first 3 golems and the warrior can go by himself with an ivu.<br>
you can also go through south this way but there are lots of live stuffs there and it takes a long time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upiniuldar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pini Uldar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/02 10:28:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11694.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mobs that see invis in HS (to East Wing)</span><hr size=1> Mandala sketch is for the Remember Garzicor dragon faction quest in Skyshrine.<br>
