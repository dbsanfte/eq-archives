Cloak of Truth</span><hr size=1> Since I can't log on without being harassed by gobs of people about the Cloak of Truth quest (thanks Trike! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) here it is, most of which people have figured out, but not all ^_^<br><br>In the lower part of Katta Castle zone there is a pub, inside on the right is a table at which a cleric named Abrogast and a warrior named Miller are standing. If you hail Abrogast, he ask if you wish to know about The Truth.<br><br>First, he gives you a can of holy water to splash on the face of a city leader who resides in<br>the city's main castle, located in the eastern part of the zone (surrounded by shrubs)<br>saying he is really a vampire (I didnt write down his name but it's in the quest dialogue. If you do this, the man simply laughs and says you spilled your water and gives you some of his. When you return this water to Abrogast he acusses the man of being protected by powerful magiks.<br><br>The only one powerful enough to be protecting him is a level 63+ enchanter in the city named Nathyn Illuminous, though this person's true identity, he claims, is Tsaph Katta. To prove this, you must have a rogue (not sure on skill needed, greater than 100, I used 200) open the a door in the home of Nathyn, (small castle structure, high nothern part of the zone, due north from the ramp exit from the lower area) where there is a book sitting on a table. Warning a mid-level vampire spawns when you open the door, should be no problem if you're doing this quest though. Returning this book to Abrogast yeilds no information -  Nathyn is too smart to leave such evidence lying around.<br><br>At this point Abrogast tells you the biggest secret yet - Norrath is an illusion. I quote:<br>&quot;That large blue orb that hangs in the Luclin sky from time to time is nothing more than an<br>overgrown comet. What appear to be land masses and other geological features are<br>actually powerful illusions cast upon the comet by Tsaph Katta imself so that panic does<br>not spread amongst the ignorant masses. I am not one to spread conjecture, but it is<br>possible that Katta's astronomers have discovered that the comet is hurling slowly toward<br>Luclin and will destroy all life on the planet, so you can see why he would keep the truth<br>about the [Exodus] from his journal.&quot;<br><br>In your SoL manual you can read up on the Exodus. He now sends you to prove that the<br>Exodus never took place. To prove this you must travel to the greatest Library known to<br>Luclin - the great library in the casters guild of Shadow Haven. You will see, there is little<br>information to prove the Exodus happened. Talk to a librarian (not necissary to complete<br>the quest) and she will tell you that an annoying gnome named Peqi checked out the only<br>book they have on the Exodus.<br><br>I spent many hours looking for Peqi in Shadow Haven. Finally, 2 minutes before<br>the servers came down &quot;Peqi Soandso begins to cast a spell.&quot; I finally found him but only<br>enough time to have a short dialoge. He is an extremely stuborn gnome who does not<br>want to give up his book - he says ONLY over his dead body. To find him, walk across the<br>bridge heading away from the library/caster/monk guild. Right as you step off the bridge,<br>turn right, walk foward, and open the second door on your right -- Peqi spawns infront of<br>the flower pot. Appears to be around 24 hrs spawn time. This is the quest bottleneck.<br><br>Peqi has little HP and hits for almost nothing though he is blue at level 60. He drops the book on the Exodus, and does not give a faction hit of any kind. Once you have the book, place it in the wrappings Abrogast provided and return it to him.<br><br>As he examines the book he leaves you thorougly convinced the book is not a forgery, and that he has been wrong all this time. But still, he wishes one more chance to prove these things to you, and if you do, he will give you a powerful cloak given to him by Suma himself. You must find 2 &quot;Akuel xi ans Vius&quot; and return them in another container. These items can be found on &quot;The Protector&quot; as well as other cloaked-figure looking NPC's in Ashevka zone, off of Maiden's.<br><br>Upon returning this to him, he and his friend Miller have an argument about how you were not supposed to make it back alive. But ok, they'll give you the item they promised, just come with them to the bank. At the bank they take out the item (which is in 2 seperate pieces) but also their weapons. They now inform you that they are going to keep their cloak - @#%$ off basically - and they walk back to the bar. <br><br>The fight with them is pretty easy, one is a 49 cleric, the other a 47 warrior. A 60 cleric and 60 war can handle it easily. Loot the small black necklace off of Abrogast and the heavy drape off of Miller. Combine the necklace with the drape and receieve your reward: Cloak of Truth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usergex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sergex </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/12/01 4:40:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3484.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok, Ok...

That large blue orb that hangs in the Luclin sky from time to time is nothing more than an overgrown comet. What appear to be land masses and other geological features are in actuality powerful illusions cast upon the comet by Tsaph Katta himself so that panic does not spread amongst the ignorant masses. I am not one to spread conjecture, but it is possible that Katta's astronomers have discovered that the comet is hurtling slowly toward Luclin and will destroy all life on the planet, so you can see why he would want to keep the truth about the [Exodus] from his journal.<br>[Tue Dec 11 20:40:15 2001] You say, 'what exodus?'<br>[Tue Dec 11 20:40:15 2001] Arbogast says 'The Exodus is the single biggest lie propagated onto the people of Katta Castellum in the known history of the intelligent races.

It seems that everyone was so taken off guard by the sudden change of scenery that no one bothered to keep any written record of the time. First they had to figure out where they were and once they did there was so much disagreement as to what they should be doing- try to get home, stay where they were and settle in or put some distance between them and Seru should he and his people try to follow, which, of course they did. All this lead to the formations of three of the four major cities here on Luclin, all with... oh listen to me go on, sorry.

It was clearly planted there by Tsaph Katta. Look at this, umm... handwriting! Yes, look at this handwriting. I have clearly underestimated his penchant for skullduggery.' Arbogast, completely sure of himself once again, leans in and speaks softly to you, 'Now that you have witnessed these clear, undeniable truths for yourself, how would you like to go on a bit of an expedition for us?'<br>[Tue Dec 11 23:04:40 2001] Your faction standing with The Truth got better.<br>[Tue Dec 11 23:04:40 2001] You gain experience!!<br><br>Arbogast gives you black wrappings (again, 2 slot nodrop).<br><br>[Tue Dec 11 23:04:57 2001] You say, 'what expedition?'<br>[Tue Dec 11 23:04:57 2001] Arbogast says 'Ahhh, excellent...

Cloak of Truth</span><hr size=1> Silly Corinus.<br><br>I have to share my experience with this quest, as it was one of the closest and best times I've had in ages.<br><br>Starts out with me logging on around noon EST with my rogue and my 54th cleric (dark elf, and kos in Katta).  I run to Shadow Haven, wanting to get to Peqi before some guild decides to perma camp him for the next week.  A little over 7 hours later, and there's one dead gnome, and I loot the book.<br><br>I run off to Katta, and buff my rogue hoping to solo the mob behind the door, when lo and behold I run into a cleric friend of mine working on the quest, and stuck at the locked door.  (Hi Corinus.)  So, I help him out, and he helps me out.  I then do the book turn in step, and now have to get the parts from Akheva.<br><br>So, a quick check on my friends list, and a bunch from a larger guild are in Akheva at the moment, so I run out there, and hang out for a bit,a nd one of them hands me two Akuel xi ans Vius.  Combine them in the pouch, and I start the run back to Katta while trying to round up some guildmates for the final fight.  Most of the guild was on a general raid, but I got a 55 monk and 56 bard.  We all get out to Katta, and I buff them with the cleric, and we decide to try without a healer, since he's kos.  Didn't work too well, mezzed Miller (the warrior) first, and went after Abrogast since we wanted the healer dead.  With no real way to stop the cheals, things weren't looking too good, so we decided we had nothing to lose, and pulled them all the way to zone to fight where the cleric was.  We get Abrogast dead, and cleric is lom, so bard keeps Miller mezzed while twisting in mana regen.  Then, much to our surprise, the wandering Legionnaire got a bit close, and aggroed the cleric, and the bard.  Both zoned, and the monk and I were left alone to fight Miller.  Both of us used our riposte Discs, and he used his mend, I died, but thought ahead and had bound right there.  Cleric zoned back in in time to heal up the monk, but was still low mana.  Bard got back in, remezzed Miller, I looted my weapons, and we let the cleric get to 40 mana.  After that, Miller died quick, and I finished the quest.  Was really close, especially with the rediculous zone times now.  I'm glad I have everything turned off on the cleric, or he may not have zoned quick enough.  But, he now has his cloak.  =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3484.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3484.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3484.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3484.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3484.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=3484.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=3484.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=3484.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3484.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=3484.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.threadControl?topicID=3484.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3484.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3484.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.8.5.3<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
