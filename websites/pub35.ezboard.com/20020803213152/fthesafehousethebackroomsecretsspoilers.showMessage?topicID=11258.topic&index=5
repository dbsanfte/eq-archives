So it wasn't a mega rune of any kind. What we did see was that we had it shoved into a wall and when the MA backed him up out of the wall his health started to plummet as usual. I'd suspect it has to do with a collision problem wth zone geometry that's making hte mob reset completely and continuously. I know Ventani gets frequently jammed into the gate down there, it may just be a matter of not pushing mobs into walls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uramasith1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ramasith1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 12:28:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11258.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ventani - Repost</span><hr size=1> thats because some newbie guards (i.e nro freeport guards) were given buffs because people always killed them, and they are their to protect noobs... so that is normal <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=teferi01>Teferi01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/6/02 12:42:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11258.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> VP Wurm</span><hr size=1> We have fought two wurms in VP lately that have done this.
