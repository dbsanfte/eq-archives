<br>
which is a red herring. There is no need to restrict the discussion to &quot;pure&quot; when discussing class balance. When melee were balanced a short while ago that balancing affected all melee (both hybrid and pure). Think whatever you like but its clear that VI at least considered those 2 sub-groups together when they balanced them. <br>

I hate to say it, but I guess I really do want the last word. That, or you just outright making yourself look silly would work too. So far though, you've managed to make comments that taken out of context all seem to make sense.<br>
I'm sorry for your lack of reading comprehension. It is entirely likely that I should have written my points so that a 5 year old could understand them. Arguably, unless you are either an enchanter/cleric and maybe a shaman, upper level groups would prefer not to have you there. Hell, I'd love to have 1 War 1 Ench 1 Cleric and 3 Rogues in a group. Your points were in fact quite concise and well architectured. Your argument was sound and you made a wonderful point. What you did do however, is make assumptions based upon things that I said and create your argument about that, which flaws it. <br>
IF you actually read my argument through the thread I never actually said that I didn't like the change. I actually like what it does for my raiding experience. I dont have any serious interest in levelling any character back up again in the near future, so I could give a rats arse about my argument myself. It means piddly to me. If I were to level another character it would be a caster. I was merely making the point to demonstate that there was more than one aspect to balancing a class than what you have illustrated or is being illustrated by the vocal part of the caster community. It was an attempt to make a bit of an open minded argument for why people could be arguing this change as being overpowering. In doing so, I was hoping to incite some of you whiney people to riot, which seems to have worked quite marvelously. The only regret I have is that I don't have the willpower to quit poking fun at you guys.<br>
Lol, I was gonna go over the best solo tactics for the classes I've had experience with, but more than likely they are already in some guide somewhere. It would really just be taking aware from something I can poke fun at you guys about later.<br>
I guess bottom line is that most classes have some sort of role on high end encounters. There may not be room for as many casters as melee in most of the high end stuff and if you aren't one of the chosen few in your guild you may not be wanted. At the same time, Wizards are very much enjoyed for that finishing boom to keep mobs from gating/CH'ing/whatever. Really, the classes that have the easiest times soloing through most of their lives, have the hardest times finding groups/having a role on a raid thats not some sort of support capacity. I guess the reality is, that every class has something that they are exceptionally good at and is needed in some way. If you don't like what your current class does, you could always ditch it and start a new one. In the end, all that this upgrade will do is create a reason for melee to get another set of upgrades to themselves, so I cant complain to terribly much as I enjoy me Rogue far more than the necro.<br>
<br>
You know.. this set of arguments popping up is almost as funny as when necro's got their pets nerfed. OMG were we overpowered before that. Would the average necro have admitted that at the time? Hell no, we had something taken away from us and most tried to fight tooth and nail to get it back. All you guys are doing now is trying to fight to keep something that you were given that gives you more power I understand it for the most part. Honestly, I hope the insta cast pets from Test make it live. Talk about an upgrade for Necro/Mages... <br>
<br>
IadarPovar,<br>
Unfortunately, I cant seem to get into the game from work.. Stupid firewalls. Otherwise I'd have little reason to poke around on te boards. I do have to admit that I'm quite jealous of all the day players though. Also, I agree that any class technically can solo, its just that some do it easier with less monetary drain than others. Chanters are also the bomb for solo, Jboots+Charm = Own. Mana to kill ratio for chanters is better than any other class, well except for classes that dont cast :P<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Holy Cow. That was probably the most convoluted argument I think I've written yet. The previous ones are also hard to follow but this one takes the cake. I really should write these into notepad first..<br>

Because it simply isn't true.  A caster's DPS is affected not one whit by a +100 mana item.<br>
<br>
A rogue using a Locustlure instead of a Dagger* is definitely doing more damage.  Not to mention the help from the proc.<br>

That particular comment was made to reference the argument about twink weapons. It was mostly in jest anyway though. Melee have pretty much the ame access to HP stuff as casters have mana. I suppose there could be an argument that some of the melee stuff has an AC trade off when getting those hp, but now that Cazic loot is droppable I don't know that that argument could be made anymore. AFAIK, for those keeping score at home, when doing the HP trade off, I believe the current accepted number for the warrior community is that 10HP=1AC.<br>
As far as locustlure, its one of the only slow items rogue twinks would have access to. I haven't seen many Rogue twinks wandering around with Willsapper's and I believe the slow component on LL is better than that of the wavecrasher. Rogues still have access to poisons for slow, but that would require people to actually invest time in building their posion skill which I don't see too many rogues do, although they should.(In the event those reading don't play a Rogue, Rogues get a better slow using poisons than any of the available weapon slows they have access to. But, It gets expensive.) As LL has a decent ratio, it is a nice addition to a rogues solo kit for the slow component and then swap it with a better ratio weapon.<br>

Hence me saying that I should really put them in a text doc first and cut and paste. Of course it could just be that I'm a bit off anyway. <br>
Here was the jist of the argument, a paraphrasing..<br>
There is more to balancing casters than simply looking at<br>
A: Twinks<br>
B: High End Game<br>
C: Grouping/Soloing<br>
<br>
If casters truly wanted twinks balanced, then they should have asked for weapons/armor to have useable level minimums like some of the new things from Umbral etc.. <br>
<br>
In the high end game, Well, you'll get a big shrug from me on this one. I think the Crit Nukes for Wizards was a step in the right direction. Mages/Necro should have better control over pets without a Disc. and upped resistances which they are already looking into. The classes I really have an issue claiming balance for raid level encounters are Cleric/Shaman/Druid/Enchanters because their role in the high end encounters seem to be relatively limited. I dont believe that the mage armor changes really help them much either. Outside of the clerics cast time which has been nerfed for CH.<br>
<br>
As far as Grouping/Soloing, I only attempeted to illustrate one part of the argument here because it was a component everyone was ignoring. Pre 50 players that weren't twinks. I am not a member of this community, but I do attempt to look at most arguments from all sides and argue for the underdog. I still believe my arguments are valid for that argument, but as I said earlier, I was mostly looking to get a rise out of people.<br>
<br>

<br>
Second, DPS is only critical on high-end MOBs with dragon regen.  Therefore, +mana items on twinks DO own.  The ability to get off one more nuke can make the diff between dead critter and dead me.  God knows I've twinked my share of sub-30 caster gimps.<br>
<br>
Third, giving mages the ability to summon no-rent items that increase caster efficiency != caster balancing.<br>
<br>
Fourth, anyone who thinks mages suck for soloing clearly smokes large quantities of crack.  Pet + DS + nukes = lots of dead stuff.  Mages are able to solo yellows WELL past.

<br>
If you want to use an example of a good mage soloer just right clicking boots of bladecalling(drops from a level 65 mob who quads for 700) then I'll give you the example of a level 59 war with only one piece of warlords and a fungi soloing the stone spider room and the other ldcs through half of level 59.<br>
<br>
My 43 war has some guardian armor, an fbss, jarsath trident, and centi short sword, all in all a pretty cheap twink compared to what some of the blue servers have seen.  I do just fine soloing low blues, binding wounds to half, and going right back out and killing another blue. I have no regen items, no dragon haste, no cobalt or equivalent armor, I'm just a cheaply twinked warrior who can constantly kills blue mobs as long as I have bandages.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uremarkab1e.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remarkab1e</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 10:49:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: density...</span><hr size=1> Rokey dokey, /FunPoking on<br>

You burn an entire mana bar every time you fight a mob. Holy crap man. I have no idea mages used a mana bar to kill one mob. Based on the 20 minutes it takes you to regen your mana I'd say that either you have more +mana items than anyone else on the face of the planet, or you never put a point into meditate. I can't decide which. I guess if you have a normal meditate skill that means that mages really can't solo, because the gear you have that would put you at the mana required to med for 20 mins can't be all that common.<br>

I don't recall anyone referring to boots of bladecalling being required for mages to solo. Last I checked, I knew several mages that soloed quite quickly from 53-59 without them. Mebbe they just had mad skillz. Although you do have a valid point with manafree nukes being another advantage to caster classes. Thanks for reminding me of that one. Just out of curiousity, are you actually saying that at 59, the warrior can outsolo you in the stone spider room?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umasteen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Masteen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 10:57:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> High level melee's can only solo very low blues/light blues.

Epicure, if you're having to med after every MOB, you're doing something wrong.  Why would you have to run after nuking?  Doesn't your earth pet root?  If you DS the pet, nuke a couple times once it hits half, I always out-damage my pet.  Since he's rooting the critter, I get to sit on my butt and med while it dies.  I think that either you are on drugs or just a @#%$ mage, because I go 5-6 fights between med breaks... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uambnesiavos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ambnesia VoS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 11:51:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=125>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> ds damage isnt attributed to the mage.  their earth pets root gets resisted quite a bit from what i hear, any mob that is &quot;around their lvl&quot; will be very red to their pet.  he probably has to med so much because he has to nuke a mob for half its life to gain full exp.  i do agree though 20 mins is an exageration.  i think mages do need an upgrade badly.<br>

IMO if the 1 second cast time on pets goes live, I'll A) Love it for my necro and B) think that its overpowering. Letting them do 20% more damage 20% faster really isn't all that needed. All in all, if a mage is intelligent about their class I love having them in an XP group. Same for necros. They do awesome damage. Anyone who thinks they can't either hasn't grouped with a good necro/mage or are themselves are newbie necro/mage. Necro/Mages can be newbies way through their 50's<br>
On a side note:<br>
When Pet casters fight things approx their level, they generally use more than one pet so that they can control the pets damage output. The new pet is the one they have to outdamage. Hence the chaincasting strategy people sometimes talk about. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uremarkab1e.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remarkab1e</A> at: 4/2/02 1:01:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uambnesiavos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ambnesia VoS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 1:37:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=127>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> so thats 400 mana right there for a new earth pet, plus another 250 to buff it.  then he still has to outdamage it which while he doesnt have to do half damage he still has to throw in a few nukes.  i guess i do see how they could run oom every other fight if thats how they have to do it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uremarkab1e.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remarkab1e</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 3:01:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> They would, generically speaking, be medding during the time their pet was fighting.

Also of note is that the fire pet does quite well in these circumstances as the have their own shield saving on that buff. Casting burnout is useful but not required for the damage depening on the fight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uambnesiavos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ambnesia VoS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 3:20:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=129>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> hmm didnt think about the ds yeah thats extra mana too.  and if he is using the fire pet for the innate ds then that explains why he has to run around when he starts nuking.  he just made a new pet, and pets dont generate alot of aggro anyway.  and 500 or so mana is a good chunk regardless of your lvl, especially for a class with no real form of mana regen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uremarkab1e.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remarkab1e</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 3:52:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> /cough /pet taunt on /cough distance aggro management /cough<br>

Or since we are talking about 56+ people we can go out on a limb and preted they have an epic pet. Or farther out, we could also say that they aren't too worried about the half xp thing and just let the pet kill light blues for them with minimal nuking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxbrujeriax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xBRUJERIAx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 4:01:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=131>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> Yep, casters get mana free nukes and melees get caster free heals and regen  courtesy of armor effects.  <br>

For AOE groups, everyone in the group has to be on the ball otherwise you're screwed.  There are very few 50+ xp dungeons where a &quot;normal&quot; group can't deal with having a couple of morons in the group and do just fine.  This is going by the predominance of seb/kc/velks/chardok groups.  The world would be a better place if more dungeons were similar to Howling Stones.<br>
<br>
Yep, lots of mages solo quite a bit from 1-60.  Here's a little piece of info you don't know though, those mages won't level at the same xp rate per hour as a mage in a decent group will.  Bards, wizards, necros, and a few insanely twinked monks are the only classes that can honestly say they can level faster soloing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uremarkab1e.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remarkab1e</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/3/02 9:33:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10400.topic&index=132>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my point exactly...</span><hr size=1> Actually, I never said that th Solo casters level faster outside a good group. But I agree with you that groups are generally faster. Although, you also have to component of setup time when you are getting the group vs immeadiate gratification of solo. Depending on the timeframe a player is online solo can be faster xp. I generally am online for longer than 2 hours at a time, but, if I know I wont be, its a heck of a lot easier to play a twink or solo class. Fear kiters own pre 45ish XP wise and Quad kiters own it after the fact. AE owns all basically, but thats another matter entirely and takes a moderately intelligent group of people that are aware of each other to do correctly. Also Bards slow down a bit now that that stupid arse mana component is there for the charms.. bastages.. Have to mix fear kiting or Chants in while recharging mana.<br>
