<br>
The Way Out: Prologue.<br>
<br>
Imagine if you will a cool Autumn morning; the darkish coolness of that morning in a forest older than time. A stone bridge painted in the patina of ages, usually guarded by four stalwart Teir'Dal in armor, but empty - empty that is except for a knot of corpses.<br>
<br>
One is a woman; her face is twisted in hate and terror, the midnight skin greyish in death. The second lies face down, fingers clutching at the marbled flagstones in denial, his skin also indigo-grey. The last is pale and almost serene, though something of surprise lingers in his still countenance. His own hands grip the knife which is still hilt-deep in his breast.<br>
<br>
Now picture the living members of this scene; most are indecernable, a knot of black-clad shadow. A few stand out: a gnome, green-robed and gnarled, his head bowed in sorrow. A tall man with a painted face, his arms around a leather-clad elven woman as they both look on the corpses with expressionless features. And at the last, one other elf who kneels beside the third body, her face a caricature in dry-eyed grief.<br>
<br>
This one lifts bloody hands and wraps them around the hands and hilt, and tugs the knife free. She lets the knife fall, and holds the dead hands to her face a moment before placing them at the dead man's sides. Then she gets up and looks at the nervous shadowy audience, their shifting and whispering making them seem like a flock of uneasy ghosts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its over,&quot; she says softly, and begins to move, the ghosts clearing her path away from the bridge with alacrity that could either be respect or fear.<br>
<br>
From a great distance, his vision enhanced magically, the red-robed magician watches. &quot;But no, my little rogue, how very wrong you are. It merely begins.&quot;<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Merri stared at the jug of mead in front of her, as though it contained all the combined world's wisdom - which, if you listed to drunken old Fraser, down at the end of the bar,  it just might - but pushed it aside. Her head swam enough, her chest tight and seeming unwilling to breathe, her stomach throbbed with nervous knots. Mead would only increase those displeasureable feelings unless she all but drowned herself in it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drowned...&quot; she murmured softly, slowly turning the green glass vessel in her hands and watching the tawny liquor inside slosh in little wavelets. &quot;Hey Scon -&quot;<br>
<br>
The barkeep looked up, an eyebrow lifted. His elven customer hadn't had a drink in the three hours she'd sat quietly at the end of the bar, but her voice wavered unsteadily. &quot;Aye Merri? Somethin' wrong wit' the mead?&quot;<br>
<br>
The elf shook her head, and pushed the bottle aside again. &quot;Not at all, Scon; just wanted to know. Anyone ever drowned out there in the Nest?&quot; She paused a moment, looking back at her distorted reflection in the green glass bottle. &quot;Must be an interesting way to die, drowning...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye. Many a gnoll. Th' 'ccasional orc. One 'r two unwary foreigners, though most take the Gwen; and none o' our own folk in living memory. Why d'ya ask?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Just wondered what it would be like. To drown, I mean..&quot;<br>
<br>
Scon McDaniel regarded the tiny (in comparison) being who perched at the end of his bar with a barbarian's typically frank appraisal. She had hair of sunny blonde, eyes like a clear winter sky when you look straight up. Her petite body held no spare flesh, only muscles and lines of use. Her face looked as though it should smile ... but it wasn't. The only time Scon had seen her smile, she had been taking her dagger out of an Orc Trooper's spine. The smile had faded quickly when she realised the beast's bones had notched her blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's no' pleasant at all. A man's lungs fill up with water, and he strangles. I've seen faces of them as drowned, they aren't peaceful.&quot; Scon polished a pewter tankard with his apron and set it up next to her bottle of mead.<br>
<br>
Merri regarded him a long moment, then tipped the bottle out into the tankard and lifted it to her lips. &quot;If thats how it is, Scon, then I'm drowning on dry land. Better get me another mead.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;ooc&gt; prelude ends, story begins. first chapter coming soon. Hope you'll look for it. &lt;ooc&gt;<br>

A fist, cold and mailed with ice, that's how the wind seemed. The cold was poisonous enough on its own, a seeping chill that tied her catlike muscles in rigid knots, without the wind that tore at her eyes and hair and burned her lungs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn you, Grehan. Get yourself lost and killed out here in this frozen hell, next time. Don't get me involved in whatever passes for intrigue among you, just bloody die!&quot; The words were bitter but meaningless. Grehan trudged a few feet behind her, and wouldn't have heard her over the howling wind, but wouldn't have cared if he had. Merri knew that. She winced as the wind blew her hood against her cheek, for the fur of her hood-lining was frosted around the edges in a fringe of tiny icicles. Despite the double-thickness mittens, her hands were numbing faster than her elven circulation could prevent. <br>
<br>
Merri cursed colorfully and reached into her tunic for the silver flask she kept there. Her body heat had kept it warmer than she'd hoped, and the liquor inside was fire which sprang instantly through her veins. <br>
The flask was snatched out of her hands after only a swallow of the warm ginesh. <br>
<br>
Grehan stared at her, iceblue eyes hard, looking too much like the frozen river they had followed doggedly through this near-blizzard. &quot;No more,&quot; he rasped, the cold obviously no easier for him than for Merri. &quot;More than enough to warm you and it will kill you out here, drive the moisture out of you and kill you.&quot; He took a single sip for himself and handed back the flask, waiting until she nodded before he released it.<br>
<br>
Scowling, Merribelle slid the flask back into her tunic, wincing slightly at the chill even that brief moment in the open had imparted to the metal. The curved flask sat comfortably against her breast, the inner layer of fur on her tunic cushioning it from movement. Resolutely lacing the tunic up till it caught uncomfortably under her chin, she turned one final glare on her companion and moved on, digging her feet into the frozen water angrily.<br>
<br>
A fine thing this, wasn't it? Merribelle, rogue of middle rank, called &quot;Stealshearts&quot; by those who knew her. Used to a warm taproom and sunlit fields, or even black caverns and bloody fights. And where was she? Why, trudging down a river in the middle of Everfrost, freezing slowly and getting angrier by the moment. And for what purpose?<br>
<br>
To find something that didn't exist, if you listened to those who should know. Chasing a phantom through a howling blizzard with noone but an apprentice rogue at her back and nothing but a flask of Ginesh to keep her from becoming a block of this same wretched ice she was walking on. Seething with frustration and rage, and not realising it was keeping her warmer, she swore again, in Barbarian so Grehan could not mistake her ire.<br>
<br>
Grehan knew her temper, and knew that when they finally reached the Nest again she'd be livid. The next poor fool in McDaniels who got drunk enough to be curious what elf women kissed like would probably be missing both ears and both hands come morning.  Merri was close to a legend in Scon's tavern, but every night someone had a wee bit much and forgot why. <br>
<br>
Grehan could only hope that tonight the liquor would get the better of her, and that he and Scatha could carry her up to her bed and lock the door to save some poor nitwit from carstration or worse. In the meantime he just had to cope with a string of invective icier than the wind, and comfort himself that by morning she'd have forgiven him this fool's errand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remind me again, Grehan, just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> why</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I'm out here?&quot; he heard her shout, and sighed. Perhaps it would not be the morning, after all. <br>
<br>
*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*<br>
<br>
&quot;T'is not a man yer lookin' fer, lad&quot; the old woman had said, her grin nearly toothless as she smiled at him. &quot;T'is a woman, an' a legend at that. Aeron was a legend when I was birthed, an' she no more than 18. But what else could y' expect from a lass whose name in the old tongue means <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Goddess of Slaughter</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But surely she's dead now, old mother, if she was a woman already when you were born?&quot; Grehan had looked skeptical, and the woman turned to look at Merri with eyes that were faded emeralds, like emeralds under ice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, lad, some of us have the power t' live beyond the means of others. I've been naught all m' life but a wife an' mother, worthy and fine though they be. But those o' spirit who lift dagger fer true cause can live way beyond the times of the rest of us. Ask yer elfish friend, there. Her people live decades to my years. No, lad, Aeron lives yet, and she's out there. Much like Karg and his ilk, she wanders the snow, keepin’ her wits and wiles sharp, keepin’ back the rage that’s her birthright an’ curse.” Again the old woman’s eyes flicked to Merri where she sat, and for the first time spoke directly to her. “You know that rage, don’ ye, elf-lass? Aye, ye do. An old woman can see it – and so will Aeron.”<br>
<br>
The door flung open, the old woman’s hut suddenly chill with the influx of icy air, and Cappi McTarnigal stood in the door with two others at his back. Merri looked up at them, unimpressed, while Grehan stumbled to his feet, knocking the stool over that had supported him.<br>
<br>
“Keep yer peace, old woman. Fillin’ the lad’s head with snowblind fantasies, and tellin’ mead-talk to strangers.” Cappi scowled at Merribelle openly, distrusting both her foreign blood and her status as a rogue. “Ye’ve been told before ter keep yer mouth shut. Now I’ll tell y’ again: Aeron Aodann is dead and buried, an’ the stories you spout deader still. There is no point to yer senile ramblings.”<br>
<br>
The old woman looked up at McTarnigal, and laughed, a horrid empty sound which was not humor. “Still ‘feared of the White Rose, Cappi? Still watchin’ yer back for the old legends ter take back what ye and yer kindred buried? Hah, but y’ know an ol’ woman has naught ter fear, an’ no reason to stop tellin’ “stories” ter young folk… why should the great McTarnigal care, eh? Unless there were truth in the tales?” Still cackling, the old woman looked across at Merribelle.<br>
<br>
“Ye see, elf-lass, Aeron Aodann was Lady of the Halas rogues, they called her the White Rose, as all her students are called now. She wielded two daggers made of runed white metal, with roses ‘grained into their hilts, and a fightin’ fury as makes the wolf-wild pale in comparison. McTarnigal’s grandfather was her second, wasn’t he Cappi? Right up ‘till the time she took off ter fight the dark folk an’ he took over –“<br>
<br>
“Silence!” McTarnigal growled, his expression so deeply angry that Merri almost missed the uncertainty in his eyes. “Grehan, yer late f’r patrol duty. An’ I think yer foreign wench will be missin’ her stool at the tavern.” <br>
<br>
Grehan scuttled out, glancing apologetically at Merri for the insult. The old woman watched him go, calmly, then fastened her old hand clawlike on McTarnigal’s wrist as he turned to follow. “Yer a fool ter stop me talkin’ of it, Cappi. Y’ll only make the boy want it worse… but yer already too late to hush him, fer he’s seen Aeron Aodann, and she’s seen him. Naught ye can do now but wait. The White Rose returns, Cappi. Wait for her to come back…”<br>
<br>
*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*<br>
<br>
Grehan gritted his teeth as a blast of especially cold air hit him, almost pushing him back down the bank to the frozen river he and Merri had just left. Digging his spiked boots deeper into the icy ground and leaning on the haft of his spear, he hauled himself up the steep incline after Merri, whose catlike agility had her up the bank much quicker than he. Keeping his head down, he almost collided with the elf, who stood stock still on the very edge of the embankment.<br>
<br>
“Merri?” He peered off into the distance, off into the swirling whiteness that held the wood-elf’s gaze, but could see nothing but the twisting billows of snow and wind. He squinted, trying to sharpen his gaze, but it didn’t help. <br>
<br>
Merribelle watched the figure only she could see move inorexably out of the blizzard towards her, slow and determined, inevitable as a tide. The wind didn’t seem to bother whoever it was. As the shape came closer Merri could make out some details: the thick silver fur of wolf-pelt protruding from the hood which rimmed features still indistinct, the deliberate silence and majesty of the stride despite the spiked heavy boots. <br>
<br>
Grehan lifted a hand to Merri’s arm, now seeing the outline of the figure approaching, and his barbarian features were pale against his clanmark’s blue spiral. Merri ignored him and stepped forwards, catching sight of the face within the hood. A woman of Grehan’s own people, no clan-mark or battle paint. Lovely, with ice-blue eyes and hair like sunset-touched gold. And riding the belt around the woman’s hips, two white daggers, with roses carved into them.<br>
<br>
“Aeron Aodann” Grehan whispered, clenching his fingers, numb as they were, tighter around shaft of his spear. This was who he’d come out here to find, spurred on by his grandmother’s tales. But Aeron wasn’t looking at him, but at the elf who stood implacably before her.<br>
<br>
Merribelle watched the woman come up to them, her countenance unreadable. Then without taking her eyes off Aeron’s face, she bowed slightly, a measure of respect. Aeron nodded back, then flicked a glance at Grehan before smiling down at the elf-rogue again.<br>
<br>
“I’ve been waiting for you both. Come. There is much to tell.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;ooc&gt; my bad. Sorry this has taken so long. Insert “real life sucks” excuse here. Ever wondered how life can go from relatively comfortable to out of control in the space of an hour with no warning? No promises on the next chapter but hoping to have it completed in a few days. &lt;ooc&gt;<br>

Hence, no excuses. Only my sincere apologies for not posting this before. On with the story. &lt;ooc&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Merribelle's feet kicked up little puffs of snow, blizzards in miniature over the valleys of her footprints. Grehan watched them in fascination as his friend and mentor paced before him in the unending whiteness.<br>
<br>
Ahead of her strode a legend, a lost heroine, a ghost - perhaps truly one, seeing her feet left no marks in the powder of fresh snow. Aeron Aodann; the foremother of all that the White Rose now was and the catalyst for all that it would be.<br>
<br>
Grehan's beard looked grey through it's frosting of ice-crystals and he brushed at it nervously, struggling through snow a foot thick after the two women. If Aeron left no mark of her passage, and Merri's inch-deep prints filled quickly with snow, his own marks were obvious and unsubtle, stretching out behind him in the frozen landscape. What had history and heroism to do with him? He was only a novice, a scout, a whelp in Cappi McTarnigal's words. He stumbled, and Merri, without looking reached back her hand to help him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not far now,&quot; Aeron said from ahead of them. Merribelle's usually inscrutable countenance showed something like relief, and Grehan knew that had his cheeks not been stiff with cold he would have been smiling. <br>
<br>
Merri hauled Grehan to his feet with a strength that was a constant surprise to him, her light frame concealing more power than many of his comrades. She had pushed the fur of her hood back, and the gilt-smoothness of her long hair, frosted with ice-crystals, glinted in the fading light, adding to the contradiction; he knew there was little fragility in her. <br>
<br>
As they struggled through the snow, Grehan dwelled on that incongruity. One would not think this tiny creature to have the strength she did. Hearing her laugh, one would not notice the hardness of her will. Looking at her impish-pretty face you'd never guess the things that wracked the soul. He'd known her for more than a year, seen her in all moods, hunted with her, held her when she woke up screaming at middlenight. But whether he really knew her? He could not answer. Why she had followed him out here and why he now followed her on into the deepening dark, that question too was unanswered. Perhaps Aeron Aodann could tell him.<br>
<br>
His introspection ended when Aeron took his arm and led him to a low opening in the cliff-face they had followed for a mile. Shielded by low, hardy evergreens and blizzard-scarred rocks, he had to stoop almost to his knees to enter, though Merribelle followed him in merely bending her head. The cavern was black before him, and Grehan had to trust to the woman clutching his arm; his elf-friend was not so hampered by the darkness. They walked some little way and turned a corner, the passage narrowed, and then Grehan saw firelight ahead of him.<br>
<br>
Suddenly tired and hungry and lost, he could have wept when his guide led him to the fireplace and bade him sit.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The cavern was smallish, but had a high ceiling, to Merri’s relief. The smoke-stained gray rock of the wall showed many years of fires, the packed dirt floor and rustic though comfortable furniture spoke time and effort to make the place habitable. And Aeron Aodann stood in the middle of the cavern, her face as expressionless as a statue’s and at the same time alive with energy. Merri looked at the woman with curiosity she could not conceal. Grehan, on the other hand, stood still at the door, as though unable to come any closer to his hostess.<br>
<br>
When the barbarian woman finally spoke, her voice was warm with emotion, and if Grehan had been surprised before he was now awestruck, for Aeron was crying. “You have no notion how glad I am to have you both here at last,” she said softly, her voice creating muted echoes in the cavern. “My time alone has not been in vain but it has been lonely; and now, for a time at least, I have the company of two after my own heart.” The tall woman turned towards the crackling hearth, and two low stools that stood near it. “Take your rest, Merribelle, Grehan. I’ll bring food and mead, and when you are warm and fed I will tell you why you both are here.”<br>
<br>
As though sleepwalking, Grehan shuffled to a stool and sat down, staring deep into the flickering fireplace. Merri watched her host work swiftly in the corner nearest the fireplace for a moment before succumbing to the lure of warmth. Propping her toes on the very hearthstones, and lifting numb fingers to the radiance, she stared at her hands as the color returned to them, noting the thin cris-cross line of scars she’d earned earlier that summer on the Tundra. Her grin fought its way out through a face still stiff with cold, and the wolfish gleam in her eyes caught firelight; the orc that had drawn his scimitar across her hand had squealed quite satisfactorily when her dagger tore through the veins around his heart.<br>
<br>
As suddenly as the remembrance came to her, she was sickened by it. She had never truly enjoyed killing; of course there was the exhilaration of battle, the singing in her blood as she blurred through combat like a whirlwind of blades, the thrill of danger and victory. Only once before that orc had opened her hand from wrist to ring-finger she had ever felt the need to exact pain in return for pain. She pushed the memory of Machil's blood seeping over her fingertips back down before that unholy joy could take hold again, bringing with it the memories of what came after...<br>
<br>
Aeron nudged her consideration away from the threadfine line of scarring by placing a mug in the hand and a bowl in her lap.  Merri nodded thanks. &quot;You know what my first opinion of mead was, Grehan?&quot; Merri said lightly, looking down at the fire-warmed tankard brimming with tawny liquor. &quot;That here truly was the drink of Bristlebane himself... for only my tricksome lord could turn honey to something so sour.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grehan's appreciation for the humor was tempered by his nerves, for across the open hearth from the young Barbarian sat a living legend, and he attempted to hide his nerves in draining his own flagon. But the deep, honeyed chuckle of the White Rose surprised him.<br>
<br>
Aeron's eyes were alight with humor when Merri looked up at her. &quot;I see you have little trouble drinking it now, however, Merribelle...&quot;<br>
<br>
The feir'dal grinned and sipped the warmed liquor. &quot;Now how could one of Bristlebane's daughters let him get away with a trick like that? I love mead to spite him, of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again the deep, rich laugh rang out through the small cavern, and the woodelven rogue smiled, and drained half the mug of honeywine without stopping to consider its strength. Aeron grinned down at her, and gestured at the bowl. “Better eat some of that stew, Merribelle Stealshearts, to ballast you.” Grehan could not talk but could easily eat, and he smiled, already halfway through his meal and obviously enjoying it. As they ate, Aeron drew up a third seat to the fireplace, and placed it where she could best see her guest’s faces. Grehan was obviously forgetting his discomfort in the food, but Merri, the elf-girl, was watching her equally, her eyes hooded, flicking back and forth from the bowl to her face.<br>
<br>
Warm, fed and safe from the howling blizzard outside, she seemed at ease, even relaxed, but Grehan, whose own nerves were wound tighter than lute strings, could see she was no such thing. The tankard was on the floor next to her boot – in easy reach of the blades hidden in those black scaled articles - and her eyes remained hard and reflective in the firelight.  Something had Merri's senses on edge, and he would be wise to keep his head.<br>
<br>
Aeron Aodann was not blind to the readiness in her foreign guest. Sighing with reluctance, she put her own flagon down and looked earnestly across the fireplace at Merri, whose air of relaxation suddenly dissipated. &quot;Your instincts are excellent, Merri, but the threat I carry is in the future, not to you here and now. If you will listen with patience I will try to explain. Please, relax. Lay down your weapons and make yourself comfortable; your lives are as sacred here as though the Tribunal themselves had brought you. As my guests I would die myself before letting harm come to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A threat is a threat, Aeron Aodann. That it comes in the morning or tonight before the fire cools is no excuse to close my eyes to it now... but I will hear you, that much at least is owed you for your hospitality.&quot; <br>
<br>
Aeron nodded and sighed, as though she could expect little more. “I’ve been alone in this place for a lifetime of my people, my friends. I am no threat to any one by my own will, not even to the disloyal who rule my kin in Halas. I doubt I could take rein again over my guild, for I have been in isolation too long to expect or deal with what they are capable of. However, the stories that are told carry part of the truth: the White Rose is to return to Halas.”<br>
<br>
Grehan’s eyes widened and his lips pressed together in a grim line. “McTarnigal will not tolerate yer return, lady. He runs Halas, or nearly, with his iron grip on th’ information the scouts bring in, and the trade he… organizes with the guilds in Qeynos and Highkeep…”<br>
<br>
“I am aware of the knife my lieutenant’s grandson holds to the throat of the Council, dear one.” <br>
<br>
“Then how?  And if ya’ll forgive the askin’, Why?”<br>
<br>
Aeron’s eyes were on the fireplace, the shadows of her hair hiding her expression, and she paused a long moment before answering. “When I was lady of the guild, we had but two motives: the will of the Tribunal through stealth, and the will of the Tribunal through slaughter. Our skills were for the good of all, and our place was clear and honored among our people. I remember it well that a young one might say they wished to join our ranks openly and the approval of their kin would be instant.” Grehan frowned, remembering his own family’s reluctance, and how his age-mates mocked him as a coward and weakling and fool. Aeron went on; “Even among the other races, the purpose of our kind is diluted slowly as the years pass. The honored Scouts of Kelethin meet repudiation from many of their own, as do the children of Brell. The Humans dismiss their rogue-kin entirely, and the dark ones themselves view the Ebon Hand as mere tools, unworthy to be kept past the doing of their task.”<br>
<br>
“But yet, the power of the many shadowed guilds across Antonica grows daily; but not for the work we were meant to complete! No, they grow fat on thievery, on murder and power and blood. Their numbers swell daily with those whose hearts hold greed and not honor, and the corruption has not left the Tribunal’s children untouched. Cappi McTarnigal is a blind fool, an unwitting pawn in the tide which has caught us all up.”<br>
<br>
The hiss of her breath and the clatter of stool, bowl and tankard broke Merri’s silence as she rose abruptly. “Pawn? Are not we all pawns, Aeron Aodann? I have been a pawn for as long as I’ve lived, and here you seek to put me back into play, in yet another game. Whose hand on the pieces this time, White Rose?”<br>
<br>
“Merri, calm, please! Aeron did not say that you had any role – “ Grehan started, but Aeron silenced him with a soft word.<br>
<br>
“Merri is right, kinsman; why bring you both here if you had no part to play in the game? Only in one thing is she wrong: before she had no choice. A pawn she was indeed, blind and moved by many hands and never at her own will. But in this game she must choose to play, and if she does, she may yet be a queen.”<br>
<br>
“Or I may choose to kick over the table” hissed the feir’dal. Snatching up her cloak and Grehan’s spear, she fled out into the storm.<br>
<br>
“Let her go,” Aeron said softly when Grehan rose to bring her back. “She will come to no harm.”<br>
<br>
Grehan stared down the narrow passageway to the tundra and shook his head. “I don’t understand, lady. You say you return to Halas. How does that change what the guilds have become? And why must Merri hold any part of that?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing is so complex that a knife can’t find it’s heart, Grehan, not even the heart of that corruption my guild has become. Merribelle will be my knife.&quot;<br>
<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
Outside in the bitter cold, the storm was dying; its last gasps of force the dying breaths of its violence. Still, it was cold enough that the hot angry tears froze on Merri's cheeks, and she shivered in the deep fur of the cloak as she paced, irresolute, on the edge of the tundra.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was free here..&quot; she whispered softly, the wind stealing the words before she could hear them. &quot;I thought I was free. But now someone else wants to use me, use my skills, and something in me<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  wants</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be of use. Mad Lord! Am I insane too?&quot;<br>
<br>
The dying tempest was not listening; almost noone was - and none that would help. Hauling herself up from her knees with the spear to lean on, Merribelle Stealshearts walked achingly back to the cavern, the warmth, and the game.<br>
<br>
The ice elemental, it's rudimentary eyes being used by its master, followed as close as it dared to the entrance, then dissolved into crystals, just like the snow. The one who used its eyes rose from concealment on a hill a mile distant. He tightened the sorcerous cape about him, instinctively, for it did not allow the cold to touch him. Then, with a whispered word, his form seemed to dissolve also, only to reform back in Felwithe, beside the roaring warmth of a fireplace.<br>
<br>
