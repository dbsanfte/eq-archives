<br>
Wizards, have magic/fire/cold base spells.  I dont think an untwinked rogue at 25 can get good enough resists to make the wizard go oom.  Doesnt need root, uses lag/shadowstep.  <br>
<br>
Necro doesnt even need a pet, damage shield and lifetap and lifetap dot, rogue is toast.  <br>
<br>
Mage, with a pet, rogue doesnt stand a chance, without...going to need alot of FR/MR.  <br>
<br>
Enchanter, so many options to kill someone, rogue wont be hard.<br>
<br>
Shadowknight, dots, melee and harmtouch ouch<br>
<br>
Pallys, with all the heals and loh, you are going to have to beat him twice.<br>
<br>
rangers, snare/root/dots/melee/bows/heals great pvp melee class dont see a rogue winning that.<br>
<br>
Monk and warriors..a rogues best chance, use lag, strafe, joust.<br>
<br>
Shamans/druids with sow, they will kite you around, dots and damage shields.<br>
<br>
clerics.. ton of MR and you could be them, just going to be awhile with all their heals.<br>

&quot;A rogue at 25ish, shouldn't win a 1 one 1 duel against any class. If they do win, then the person that lost needs to quit.&quot; <br>

Yeah, this is total bullshite. I know many OBR who have beaten every class at times, at all levels. I'm sure the Shanks have too, as well as most other PvP rogues. Granted the finger wigglers can be very tough at low 20's. They are by no means impossible to beat, even when skilled.<br>

With your resistances up, Pumice ready, and hopefully a body of water near, you should be able to hammer a caster of your same level.  The lower your resists, the more damgae you will take, the more your movement will be restricted, the faster you will die.<br>

I have taken on two necros at the same time, killed one, ran off, bandaged to half, came back and killed the other one. The key is being ready. I always carry around cure disease and poison potions and pumice or the rod from CT if i can score one.<br>
<br>
Rogues are great for 1 on 1. One class i worry about are SK's. They are super mean if they get a darkness on you and with the new HT changes they can take almost all my hp's. I dont worry about getting rooted too much with a MR of 98, 'cept if the person is 8 levels above me. Resists just dont mean nothing then.<br>
<br>
Another class i dont like are Druids with their damage shields. i pretty much take as much damage as i give, not cool at all. No use pumicing because the mana cost and cast time on their shields is so low not worth the pumice.<br>
<br>
Anyway, i love sneaking into dark territory and pking a dark in front of a whole group. one root poison means death for alot of classes, even shammy.<br>

Give me any good pvp class at lvl 25 vs a lvl 25 rogue.  Head or 20 paces, and I'll win.  YOu can put in all these if pumics or that, whatever.  Skills only, rogues are not knowen for pvp, especially at lvl 25, I'm not talking about when you get double backstab, he asked lvl 25.  Neither are warriors, I know.<br>
<br>
I'm not insulting rogues by saying they are not for pvp, this whole game isnt for pvp, live with it, and face it.<br>
<br>
All pvp battles are different, I said Duel.  Equally skilled and prepared people fighting eachother.<br>
<br>
I've had extensive pvp experience, here are some of the classes I have pvped with:<br>
1-55 warrior<br>
friends account shaman/enchanter been on and off of them 35-50<br>
1-26 necro<br>
1-12 wiz<br>
1-18 rogue<br>
1-54 druid<br>
<br>
So, any rogue that wants to come to Lake of ill Omen, and fight my necro, give me a tell, I'll be happy to send you back to Fironia Vie.<br>
<br>
And I never said it wasn't possible, I even listed the classes which I think rogues have the best chance at beating.  And I /applaud all rogues and warriors on pvp server for what they have to deal with, I am one of them.<br>

On PvP the fight is rarely between two equal levels, and almost never at equal levels of preparedness.  For a meaningful prediction of outcome class, level, equipment, circumstances, and the person behind the screen all have to be taken into account, in no particular order (except level first).  <br>
<br>
While I'd agree with most of what Bomban said in theory (assuming he meant even-cons) lets just shift the discussion a little.  Lets say the rogue is lvl 27, equipped with SBD, high resists, low delay weapons, a nice bow and plenty of arrows, sow potions, snare poison and pumice. Lets also say the fight takes place in an enclosed area like the Qeynos arena.  Starting to get the picture?  You don't even have to be twinked, if you spend your time working on equipment rather than leveling, you can get pretty tough for your level.  <br>
<br>
As a caster, if you cant get the movement advantage or invulnerability you are going to have some trouble getting yer spell off.  If you don't have the right ones memmed then Marr help ya.  Not sure when necros get an invulnerability spell, wizards can use shadowstep to advantage etc.  A pet is going to give a rogue fits, but if that SBD goes off ...<br>

And please, don't throw out the necro crock. Necro's owning people have extremely little to do with skills, they are simply overpowered. I was reading through Vaslin's eqcaster one time on the necro section and honestly, ever few seconds I was like "Dang, I didn't know they could do that!" So don't think you'r all big and bad just because you play an overpowered class.<br>

<br>
If a druid has his damage shield and SoW burried under a bunch of buffs, its almost a losing battle (Well, if you have sow potions, Jboots, or snare poison, SoW isn't too big a deal), but that damage shield hurts.  Otherwise, he has no chance to kill me, and if I have snare or SBD procs, he's done for.<br>
<br>
Shaman are a little tougher too.  They have decent AC (making spells harder to interrupt), and Spirit of Cheatah *grumbles at Wotan* and gate to get away.<br>
<br>
SKs- High AC, High damage weapons, Darkness, Shadowstep.  These guys are tough to chop down if you don't have good MR and aren't good at avoiding their weapon swings.  Also, I generally bail after I get HTed, hehe.<br>
<br>
Necros- They usually aren't a worry to me anymore, unless they get the jump on me and root/snare me.  Pet can be annoying if you're going for the kill.  They usually will just Shadowstep and gate on me though. *grumbles about shadowstep being unbalancing in PvP*<br>
<br>
Wizzards- If they manage to root you, you're pretty much done unless you have great Fire and cold resists.  A couple good shots from these guys hurts.  Though, like other pure casters, will go down quick if you can stay on them.  Shadowstep sucks though when you're going for the kill.<br>
<br>
I've attacked and killed plenty of red/yellow cons in my day.  Its all about getting the jump and being properly equipped and prepared though. <p><b>Ceescrit Bossalini</b><BR>

Now, I play on a blue server, but I'm not picky about making people debuff before a duel.  I find them, I fight them, may the best duelist win.  Admittedly, I tend to lose against buffed, petted, fm mages about my level, but that's a weakness I intend to work on. ;)<br>
<br>
Be prepared.  As Majestyk said, AC is just another resist - I'd balance towards AC and MR as &quot;default&quot; resists as MR covers all the root/darkness spells and mobility is king.  Get a golem wand if you can (you're a mite low to pick one up yourself, admittedly), or a pumice if you can't.  Carry potions - SoW, cures, damage shield.<br>
<br>
From my personal experience, though...<br>
Clerics are popcorn.  Bards are basically impossible unless they handicap themselves.  Petted mages are tough (or maybe it's just that all the ones I've fought have JBoots and I don't?).  Necros aren't too bad, but they can kill you after you kill them.  Shamen are an interesting mix (nice buffs, decent AC) and have some nice pvp abilities but I don't lose to them too often.  Wizzes are easy.  Ranger have nasty DS and SoW, but take care of that and it's not too bad.  Warriors are easy unless they're smart *and* skilled - a high delay weapon and jousting can be quite annoying.  Druids always try to kite - dispell their SoW and they're SOL.  Enchanters can be tough unless you get the jump on them - they basically need to Tash to get things to stick.  Pallies are like warriors, except with more hits.  Haven't fought a similarly levelled SK yet. <p><style type="text/css">

Bah, not any more, since the &quot;selo's Bug fix&quot;.  Just hit them with snare poison, and they're toast.<br>
<br>
Oh, and a good archery skill is also key.  Especially vs. a Druid, Bard, or anyone that is damage shielded or that can out run your throwing range easily.  Try to get the lowest delay bow (compound darkwood 19/41 150 range) for me, and just bow kite the around until their Damage shield wears off. <p><b>Ceescrit Bossalini</b><BR>

<br>
<br>
(Assuming even levels at 55 or within 2 levels)<br>
Warriors die<br>
Rangers die<br>
Paladins die<br>
Druids are a pain but they die<br>
Shamans dont have a hope<br>
Necros = too freaking easy<br>
Wizards = depends on channeling, usually die fast<br>
Mages = a pain, gotta have golems wands and be able to ID<br>
Clerics die<br>
Monks it usually comes down to who has a) Tranq proc b)double backstab<br>
Sk's with Harmtouch up and disc ready are very very very lethal, Its a matter of luck either way I think<br>
<br>
Basically a rogue can take down any other class if done right. Your gonna lose 1/10 fights no mattet what,tks Verant and random number generators.<br>

Someday I might get my ass in gear and post my pvp kills screenshots.<br>

There are more elves there than I've seen in any one place at any one time so I've had alot of practice with various classes recently.  I have not come close to losing a fight against a pure caster, not once.  In fact I took down three casters and a ranger by myself a couple weeks ago while Wotan looked on.<br>
<br>
Hybrids pose the largest problem for me usually, particularly SKs and druids (I'd imagine shaman do to but I don't fight against them that often).<br>
<br>
Pure melee are fun to fight and win or lose I feel like I've learned something usually.<br>
<br>
The key, as someone else said, is being prepared.  If I'm prepared for the fight, especially with a poison ready, I stand a very large chance of coming out on top.<br>
<br>
Resistances, after preparation, are the second key to winning a battle.<br>

I'm tired of reading all these threads that have people saying rogues will loose.  I bet most of the people who say that are twink rogues! blahah dats right i said it! bring out joo main.<br>
<br>
Challenge me on povar with any class (cept bards, maybe shamans..fug off) of the same level that I am...and I garuantee you that me and my roguish woopassity will come out alive.  Yes, maybe I am a little confident in saying that...but after so many beat downs, what else can be said?<br>
<br>
It's all in the player, equipment and connection....being a rogue just gives you the edge.
