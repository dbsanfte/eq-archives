In high levels places are too crowded.... Sebilis and KC e.g.<br><br>Reasons for 1:<br>People know that they can find a group in LoiO so they stay there because travelling IS an issue in low levels. I don't know who started to hunt in these sucky zones, but now we have to take it as it is.<br><br>Reasons for 2:<br>Loot is one reason for Sebi or KC... you find really useable loot there and you can get exp quite easy.<br><br>Solutions for 1:<br>take away some midlevel Dungeons... make najena or paw or nurga high level zones..... keep one or two midlevel dungeons NEAR these zones, so that peeps can take a change of pace. Put BETTER loot in the dungeon zones so that there is a motivation to hunt.<br><br>Solution for 2:<br>REVAMP all the zones.... make the loot in SolB or Guk better. What about risk vs reward? What is the point in going to the hole? Loot sucks there. What is so difficult in changing the drop tables? After this we will start seeing groups down there again. And travelling is not such a big issue. People may even go away from the boring pulling-to-one-spot-from-one-spawn tactics and make some dungeon crawling.<br><br>Make one or two zones VERY difficult for one group, but make a better exp modifier for the zone.... Some zones are 3 years old they NEED a change. <br><br>Do you have any other thoughts on this? Play game designer... what would you change? How do we get the midlevel crowd in one or 2 places? How do we make zones with nice risk vs. reward? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uviantedouxcauseur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VianteDouxCauseur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/3/02 5:32:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23581.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Revamp the zones</span><hr size=1> I think there need to be some server splits rather then more high level zones.<br><br>Sebilis, Charisis, Chardok, New Cazic Thule, Fungus Grove, Umbral, Ahkeva, The Grey, Ssra, etc...There are enough high level zones.

EQ doesnt really reward those that explore new places to them, and in fact punishes them for it.. exploration = death, exp loss, and time loss. Maybe if there was some kind of incentive for a group to pick up and move, they would go. I know when I was in the 40's and would be in a rockin group, id say &quot;lets go over to CoM and clean house!&quot; ... and the sound of crickets and tumbleweeds would roll by. Despite the fact we had a druid that could port us there, melees could bind there, there was awesome loot and exp, and we could be there by ourselves, and in no more than 10 mins. I think if the death penalty wasnt so stiff..we might see people spread out more. <br><br>What if some zones were earmarked as non-exp loss areas? That might increase the safety aspect of the zone, and not toss out the whole economy by upgrading loot, or sending the farmers scurrying there. Or, if a blue mob or lower kills you, you lose exp, but death to red mob or yellow is a lower penalty or none at all. (Since that thing outclassed you, and you have learned to stay away from it) I mean sure... ther could (and would) be s'ploiting, but I think that would balance the risk/reward aspect of it.<br><br>All too often Verant looks at the reward part of an encounter to make a change. Perhaps looking at risk would solve a whole other issue. People hunt in DL and LoIO cause it is safe. Make other areas as safe or safer, and people will move around abit.<br><br> <p><Br><center> Magelo Profiles </center> <center> <a target="new" href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=139779">Gabus Copperdrachon</a> | <a target="new" href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=139811">Niccollo</a> </center>   <br> <center> <a target="new" href="immortalpower.org">Immortal Power</a> </center>   <center> Rodcet Nife </center> <BR><center> Reality is for those who cannot handle fantasy. </center> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usnarkystabwell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snarky Stabwell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/3/02 8:05:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23581.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Revamp the zones</span><hr size=1> It's a low risk vs high exp/loot reward in many of those zones that are crowded.

So quite often once you got into the mid 20s, South Karana was the place to go.  Why?  Because almost no one hunted the dungeons.<br><br>Why did no one hunt the dungeons?  Because dungeon hunting is a difficult endeavor, one not suited to everyone.  Particularly when you are fairly new to the game and haven't figured out all the ins and outs yet.  Who really wants to spend 30 minutes on CR because the druid didn't understand that snare is needed for EVERY mob?<br><br>So people went to LOIO.  It was easier.  Mistakes were easier to escape from.  If push comes to shove, if you keep sow up you have a run for the zone.  Much safer than most dungeons.  So if someone makes a few mistakes, its much easier to deal with.<br><br>LOIO has a natural progression, LOIO, FM, OT, DL, KC.  Most of which are outdoor zones.  And are therefore easier.  Once people move into KC, all hell breaks out.  Basically because all those lessons they should have learned at lower level dungeons?  They never learned them.  Now some hard lessons are required.  And it tends to be painful to everyone around them. =P<br><br>Now, Verant has tried to address this with their new rezzes and succors.  The idea is, if people can avoid nasty 30 or 40 minute CRs by having these tools available to them, maybe they'll go to these dungeons again.  Some of which are very good.<br><br>I would purpose this counter though.  One of the reasons people don't go to mid-level dungeons is still risk versus reward.  Most of the dungeons have significant numbers of caster type mobs.  These invariably more dangerous.  So trading off many of the caster mobs for melee mobs would make the zones more attractive.  Also the pathing in many of the dungeons is just horrible.  If a mob is agroed and because you backed up 2 feet to get it to follow you, it therefore wanders completely around a larger room agroing 10 other mobs, this is bad.  Fixing pathing issues would make these places more attractive.  And finally, most of them no longer have items that are significantly attractive to players.  So a loot table revamp might be in order.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uslyydaugg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyy Daugg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/3/02 10:29:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23581.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Revamp the zones</span><hr size=1> &quot;And finally, most of them no longer have items that are significantly attractive to players.

Alot of you have hit the nail right on the head.  Safety and security!  Everyone wants to hunt in a &quot;safe&quot; area, with a place to run to.  I just recently started a Rogue and have been reading these posts to try and get up to speed.  And I'll admit I am still very timid as far as what I'll do with him.  My main is a lvl 51 Iksar Shadow Knight.  The reason I chose an SK is their ability to solo.  I personally only hunted &quot;out doors&quot; from lvl 1-10 in Field of Bone.  Once I hit Kurn's tower (great 10-20exp, and now completely unused) I decided this is what I play this game for.  The adventure of exploring a dungeon and the risk factor involved that made me not go &quot;AFK Biobreak&quot; &quot;getting a drink&quot; &quot;letting the dog out&quot; etc. etc..  You didn't want to move from your comp, you had to be alert at all times.  When exp dried up in Kurns, I did spend 5-6 lvls in LOIO grinding out some exp.  <br><br>Then it was off to Dalnir!!  I'd been hearing so much about this zone and how much fun it was.  (This is back when Fighting Batons were all the rage, and Lumpy was camped 24/7)  Leaving Dalnir after lvl 37ish, I headed to Kaesora.  Talk about a sweet sweet zone.  VERY difficult, and great exp there too.  Again, a zone that holds your attention and gets the heart rate up.  <br><br>After spending time in Kaesora it was off to many other zones, Sol B, Nurga, Droga, City of Mist etc etc.  <br><br>Seems like everyone just wants the ho hum experience of LOIO, OT, DL, KC.  How very very boring, yet its so easy for them.  So why change?  Why go explore?  To much time is spent obsessing over &quot;I can't wait to get to X level.&quot;  Thats why I have created my Rogue.  Hopefully I'll be able to get other guild members together and go back and hunt these zones with full groups and be able to enjoy them.<br><br>And the point about learning things at lower levels is dead on.  In the Plane of Hate the other day, and I felt like I was in a dungeon with a bunch of people who wanted to pull X mob to X safe spot over and over.  No one understood tactics of the fight, people STILL didn't know how to assist, no one understood tag pulling, was a total mess and we had three complete wipe outs.  Maybe if they did something OTHER than...  Pull to FD or BD in LOIO, Pull to Ledge, Pull to North Wall, they'd have a clue what they are doing.  I know I may sound bitter, but I believe the hours of CRs and solo time in dangerous places taught me well.  I wish some of the people who are more worried about their twinks, spent more time learning the game and zone, then the stats of this weapon or that weapon in the auction zone.<br><br>So in conclusion: I think they need to do what they did to Cazic Thule to alot of the other zones.  Make people RE Learn the game and zones based on new mobs and levels.  You'd see alot more people exploring and moving around.  Land some named Dragons in LOIO and watch those /ooc and /shout bandits scatter!!!  <br><br>Sorry if I offended or upset anyone with this long drawn out post, just wanted to share some ideas and feelings.  And again, I'm new to the boards, hope to be of some help if I can!<br><br>Be Safe!<br>Merdarr<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uparticleboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>particleboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/10/02 2:13:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23581.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rewards</span><hr size=1> /sigh, theres always one who has to accuse people of not being &quot;adventurous&quot; by hunting in DL (etc).  In doing so they completely miss the point of why people do that.

I'd have a pretty long wait to find a group there.<br><br>The problem is that group structure is too rigid, people have no efficient way of finding groups across zones and people have wildly varying amounts of time that they can play.  This means a zone has to reach a critical mass of people before it becomes a good pickup zone.  This success brings in more people and if the game designers weren't careful the zone gets overcrowded.  I'm really hoping Verant's zone and game designers have picked up on this.<br><br>What I'd like to see from EQ2 is:<br><br>1. Abilities more spread around.  The &quot;enchanter abomination&quot; mistake should never be repeated (they have too many crucial abilities and often a virtually monopoly thereof);<br><br>2. A larger role for generalists in the mid to high end game; and<br><br>3. Much larger zones that can support many more people (a zone should really be able to support 100+ people comfortably as a criterion of success).<br><br>Luclin made me a bit nervous.  The zones are pretty but they're much smaller than many Kunark and Velious zones (that higher polycount doesn't come for free).  Small zones are (imho) a mistake.<br> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163097">Hagin Netherblade</a><br>&lt;<a href="http://www.thunder.at">Thunder</a>&gt;<br>59th level Barbarian Blackguard<br>Innoruuk Server</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=23581.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=23581.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=23581.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=23581.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23581.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=23581.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=23581.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23581.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23581.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion>Main Lounge</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
