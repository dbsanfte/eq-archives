Especially if the campaign is evil-themed.  Players make a great deal out of playing *really* Lawful Good characters...how is that different from playing a REALLY chaotic evil character?<br>
<br>
The fact is that any person, PC or NPC, that creates THAT much havoc is going to attract attention and, therefore, trouble - and each threat he eliminates will ensure cumulatively more dangerous and numerous threats in succession.  A party of adventurers might decide to track down this fellow, because of all the deaths in the village - then, if they are slain, a powerful connection of at least one of the members is going to take a serious interest in it, and hire a more experienced party with a mage with divination spells in it....and if THAT party should get wiped out, lots of people will become interested....basically, pursuing that sort of path will probably end in a very messy death for your character at the hands of an extremely powerful party that happens to have the proverbial 'bullet with your name on it'.  And that's only if the GM decides to stick totally to logical moves and realistic character power limitations.<br>
<br>
Personally, though, I'm wondering (a) how you managed to avoid rolling a 1 or other critical failure in all the time you were killing the several dozen/hundred people in the village, (b) exactly what version of D&amp;D you're playing that allows 100% hidden/moving silently (even in 3rd ed you'd max out at +30, even with magical items - which is still not good enough to save you from a natural 20 on a spot or a poor roll).  It sounds more than anything like your DM wasn't running you through your paces correctly. <p><b> -- Veteran Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br> -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic<br> -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend<br> -- Requiem of Souls<br> -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br></b><i>"Once, in the old west, a gentleman shot a professional gunfighter in the back.

Or is there a rule somewhere stating that bonuses mustn't be higher than +30?

<br>
As for the idea that a chaotic evil player eventually meets his end at the hands of a powerful party, well, I don't think thats nessecarily the case.<br>
<br>
After all, isn't that what happens to good parties.  The GM throws stronger and stronger enemies at them.  But the players are getting stronger too.  Your expected to be fighting things that will be a challange to you.  Is it a foregone conclusion that eventually the enemies sent against the players will eventually overwhelm the party?  No.  Cause that would be unfair to the players.<br>
<br>
Basically, do I think people would come after the evil rogue, yes.  Do I think he should have no chance of escaping or overcoming those who come after him?  no. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umatheren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matheren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/02 4:43:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> our GMs would do one of three things, depending on who was running the game:<br>

gm #2, the now-marine in japan - &quot;you kill the village, and find a couple holy avengers, and a well that acts as a gigantic bag of holding that you can pretty much find any weapon you want in as long as you can think it up.&quot;<br>
<br>
gm #3, the one we don't like - &quot;oh yeah, that six year old you were sneaking up on is a level 25 fighter. you're dead. I don't care if it's impossible and makes no sense, you're dead because I'm having a competition with you.&quot;<br>

No divine presence, no avatars, no extra-planar minions. Just having the divination spells work would put some serious hurt on the village-slayer.<br>
<br>
As to why those orcs dont get in trouble if they raid a village, who says they dont?  The local lord rounds up his posse and heads out to conduct a reprisal raid on one of their villages.  Sometimes thsee things escalate into a wars too.  The other thing is that orcs dont raid &quot;safe&quot; areas. If the village is on the marches and gets wiped, thats just the way it works in the borderlands.  If a village deep in the interior does, that draws a lot more attention.<br>
<br>
Now, I havent looked at 3rd edition, but judging from previous editions, ONE high level warrior can face down hundreds of regular soldier level foes in open battle.  He can likely kill every soldier who gets close enough to hit him before that soldier has time to swing more than once.  The soldiers need a 20 to hit.  Hence, 20 soldiers will get one hit before theyre all killed.  the hit will do 1d8, or 4.5 hp.  400 soldiers will get 20 hits, doing 90 HP to the warrior.  And it would take a pretty wimpy 18 warrior to have less than 90 hp.  This is assuming the 400 soldiers somehow manage to maintain morale too.<br>
<br>
I cant think of any (good) fiction where one man can face 400 in an open field and win.  Why would anyone maintain armies in such a world?<br>

Anyway. Lawfuls, good or evil, tend to work and play well with others.  Chaotics dont.  The good Chaotics at least have their heart in the right place so others tend to be forgiving with them.  Evil Chaotics just tend to make enemies and live short exciting lives (emphasis on short) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/02 7:51:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=29>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.succubus.de/smallcross.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> Wouldn't happen in 3rd edition.<br>

Take a horde of low levels (a dozen or maybe 2) and they'll kill the highlevel for sure.<br>
How? They'd swarm him and try to tackle, grap, disarm or pin him and once he is held by at least one or 2 people others would move in and finish him off with a coup-de-grace.<br>

Sure, it's hard for them to grap/hold him, but at least one will manage before all are dead. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukintire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kintire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/02 8:53:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> Chaotic Evil people tend to crash and burn.

Almost NOBODY is willing to rush an armed opponent.  Because everybody knows in the back of their mind, that the first person who tries to grab him is dead.  Period.  And as such, most aren't willing to be that first person.  Even if they know that the mob will win if they do it, they aren't willing to throw thier own life away to accomplish that goal.<br>
<br>
Yes, in 3rd edition, its the most logical plan of action, from a gameplay standpoint.  However, from a logic and roleplaying standpoint, unless you are dealing with fanatics or an actual frenzied mob it shouldn't go down like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/16/02 1:24:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> Plus, whirlwind attack feat is great for mobs cause your melee attacks hit everyone in 5 feet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukintire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kintire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/16/02 2:16:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> Yes, thats all very well Darkangel, but REALISTICALLY, no warrior, however skilled, can defeat 400 opponents at once either.

Coordinated attacks and exhaustion on the part of the Elk.  The guys in front distract and fight defensively (dodge/block/parry) while the guys on the flanks and rear &quot;go for the hamstrings&quot;<br>
<br>
As I recall, the bonus for being behind an alert opponent is only +2 in D&amp;D, and you avoid any AC gained by the shield.  I think there are skills that allow the defender to negate the behind bonus too, arent there?<br>
<br>
Another interesting concept, which was worked into the rolemaster system's tables, and is in EQ (or so we're told) is that one's Defence is a combination of Avoidance and Mitigation of damage.  D&amp;D lumps these together in a single stat (AC). Really it should be pretty easy to hit a man in Full Plate, though, shouldnt it?  Hitting him hard enough, or in a soft enough spot to do damage is another story though.  But if your aim isnt to immediately do damage, but instead to modify or control the target's movement, that roll to hit should be about as easy as hitting an unarmored man, easier even if the target's armor encumbers him.<br>
<br>
But I guess it isnt heroic to have the protagonist pulled down by a mob of ants, so such rules dont make for a good RPG <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ullabaktharr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llabak Tharr</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/16/02 7:15:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=38>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> With great cleave feat (which allows an extra attack if you one-shot an opponent), and attacks of opportunity, it is entirely reasonable for even a level 10 fighter to kill any number of 1hd monsters.  <br>

All my experience with AD&D has been with player constructed scenarios.  I played in a few scenarios were 6 chararcters stood ground against a hundred orcs or gnolls.<br>
<br>
If I were to Master a similar situation, I'd take into account the bodies piling up  and the blood soaking the ground.  Not suddenly spring it on the players.  Just a "you notice the ground getting squishy" or "three gnolls are climbing over the four foot high pile of their kins bodies to your north while six more are running around the eastern side of the pile.<br>
<br>
Also, sooner or later, one or two of them will attempt to grapple.  I haven't looked at 3rd edition rules but, grappling is a whole different animal from melee.<br>
<br>
Back to the original post.  Yes a chaotic evil character, with a history of viciousness, might decide to lay waste to an entire village.  And yes, such an action would have consequences.  What those consequences would be are always at the descrection of the most powerful god in the campaign, the GM.<br>
<br>
GM's always have to strive to balance the game.  Too hard or too vendictive, the GM will lose players to frustration.  Too easy or too generous, the GM will lose players to lack of interest.<br>
<br>
Some of the best times my players had was during the end of my first period as a GM (called it DM at the time).  I would keep them alive if possible by playing a little loose with the unconcious/bleeding/banageing rules.  This would mean an extended period of rest while a comatose player recovered and maybe the loss of a consitution point.<br>
<br>
But, for players that had been running characters in the twenties and had aquired great amounts of loot, the thrill of just surviving in a new campaign was truly exciting for them.<br>
<br>
That's the great thing about being Game Master.  It's seeing the result of your skill at constructing and running the campaign in the faces of those who are experiencing it thru their own imaginations.  Kinda like being an author and a storyteller, I guess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaowyth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caowyth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/16/02 2:48:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Caowyth/fullsize/gir4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> In our system, to add a bit more threat to some combats, we invoked the following rule:<br>
