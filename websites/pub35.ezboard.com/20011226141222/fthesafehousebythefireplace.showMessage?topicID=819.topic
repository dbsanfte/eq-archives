<br>
/ooc Well, I have been reading many of the posts in this forum for a few months now and I find myself captivated by many of the stories.  I would like to acknowledge Koz 2 (Kaibatsu), and Minz especially, although all the stories here have made an impact upon me.  I am motivated to not just take for my own pleasure from these posts anymore and I sincerly wish to share myself with all of you.  I hope you like what you read and if you don't that is fine too.  Mostly, I am interested in constructive criticism of any kind so that I may sharpen my skill. <br>
<br>
This first chapter was quickly thrown together (by my own standards) and while I have a strong idea of where I am going and where I want it to eventually end up.  Much of it still is brewing in my brain.  I hope you enjoy!The Rogue Re-Awakened To The Light<br>
<br>
Chapter 1<br>
<br>
Lars was warm, despite the snowfall and biting wind of the moonless night. He had just a little triple-spiced rum to last him the night out in the tundra of The Great Divide as he and Drak planned their assault on the next roaming Frost Giant Scout who came looking for them. They were in trouble and they knew it. The Giants had cut them off from heading back to Thurgadin in safety that night.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<br>
Much had happened that day. The Coldain Dwarves were none to excited to see more “Outlanders” entering their stronghold that morning. Lars and Drak were greeted with apprehension as they passed behind the waterfall and greeted the guards before entering the city. They continued on into the heart of the city and soon found their way to the exchange. They each were able to get some of the needed supplies they had gone through the past weeks on their journey to this odd land, but almost choked at the prices these merchants gouged them for. Lars knew it would be simpler, and far cheaper, to just help himself to what they needed but the potential attention that might give them would undermine their mission and they would need to rely on Thurgadin as being home for at least the next week or so.<br>
<br>
It was mid-morning and they had time on their hands. “Let's find some libations to pass the time while we wait for your friends Drak,” proposed Lars. “That way we can warm ourselves and make our plans.” Drak nodded her approval without a word and they made their way to the nearest pub.<br>
<br>
Lars wanted to save the rum he had ‘borrowed’ from the Gnomes in the Ice Clad region for hunting later. Those gnomes, who fancied themselves pirates, sure amused him as he set foot off of the Icebreaker just a few short days ago. Despite their serious attempts to sound like seasoned and hardened pirates, he knew better and within minutes, they warmed up with enthusiasm to the travelers. It was a good first impression of this mysterious continent called Velious.<br>
<br>
Although the dwarves of Thurgadin and their wares did intrigue Lars, the meager dwellings and shops he had seen so far, did not impress him. He made a mental note of the shops he would have to come back and visit before they made their last departure from the city in hopefully a week. Soon, they found the pub and entered. Once again, he was not impressed by the size of the area but it seemed cozy enough despite the ice walls. They easily were able to find a table in a back corner so they could have a clear line of sight of the door and all the patrons, and still have some privacy. Ever since they entered the city, he was quite aware of Drak’s uneasiness. He knew that cities made her uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
“When is this Datokk fellow supposed to arrive?” he asked under his breath, while impatiently waiting for service. Without taking her attention away from the room, Drak replied, “The courier indicated this evening or the next. Patience Lars, all will happen soon enough if you let it.” Her reply had a cold tone but that was nothing new to him. Drak could never be counted on for happy tones and smiles when in new and strange areas, but they did occasionally happen when with Lars.<br>
<br>
They both saw the dwarf come out of the back room with some food and spirits and walk to the other side of the room to a table of Barbarian warriors who were engaged in endless laughter and head-butting. As the barkeep kept dispensed with their order, he ignored their gestures of pretending to use his head as place to set their mugs. He happily accepted their coins and turned to go back to where he came. When he turned, his eyes met with Lars’ smile and gesture to come over, but the dwarf turned his eyes away as if he had not seen Lars, and continued back to where he came. The barkeep had almost disappeared but not before Lars took a platinum piece from his pouch and snapped it between his finger and thumb sending it gliding, with wicked speed. The coin gleamed through the air and rang as it bounced off the back of the dwarf’s head and then rang again as it dropped to the floor. The barbarians paused in their belching contest and looked over with keen interest at what had just happened, wondering what would transpire next.<br>
<br>
The barkeep flinched and grabbed his head turning quickly around and glaring at Lars and Drak. Lars announced, “Look here, my good Coldain proprietor, don’t ignore me and my friend. We are quite thirsty and hungry! You may keep that coin and more if you would be so polite as to recognize us and serve us!” With that, the dwarf picked up the coin, dropped it into his apron and stomped over to the table. The barbarians broke out laughing and returned to their games and boasts.<br>
<br>
The barkeep took their order of ulthok steak and drinks in silence. Lars was feeling generous, despite the bad service. “My friend and I are weary travelers and will require shelter for the week. Can you arrange that for us? You may have another platinum for your trouble.”<br>
<br>
“Aye, give me half and hour and I will make the arrangements on your behalf,” spoke the dwarf in somewhat broken common tongue. The dwarf’s spirits seemed to be on the rise.<br>
<br>
“Excellent!” exclaimed Lars. “Here, take this and thank you.” As Lars reached to give the coin to the Coldain, his other hand, with a graceful and unseen fluid motion, retrieved the first coin from the barkeep’s apron.<br>
<br>
“Thank you!” the dwarf politely replied with a trace of a smile on his face. He hurried off and soon returned with their drinks and food. “I will make those arrangements for you now.”<br>
<br>
Turning to Drak, Lars said “Yeah, yeah, I know. Patience, blah, blah, blah. So lets talk about our time here. Does this Datokk know the land well? Can he be trusted? I know clerics are good sorts but you don’t see that many casters that are Dark Elves, like yourself, but who practice ‘life-bearing’ qualities if you know I mean. And tell me more about these ‘Awakened Light’ folks you have recently aligned yourself with.”<br>
<br>
Drakkulla sipped from her wine and surprised him with a smile. “If you trust me, and I know that you do after all we have been through, then you must trust Datokk and the rest of the ‘Awakened Light’. I would not associate myself with idiots, present company excluded,” she joked. “They have been instrumental in helping me in my endeavors much like you have been and continue to be. Imagine an odd group of races and professionals, who have united globally with the intention of furthering each other’s pursuits without prejudice, distrust, or political gain. Of course, I had my doubts as you can imagine. It is naturally hard for a necromancer like myself to trust anyone without hate and malice but I have seen the light and perhaps you should too, Larsonany.”<br>
<br>
Lars hated to be addressed by his formal name and he knew that Drak knew it too. “Bah! Sounds like a cult if you ask me. I trust you Drak. But you earned my trust despite the polar extremes of our races’ beliefs and history. I will continue to trust you and your intelligence but know that it is my nature to be cautious and look out for myself above all others. It has been the only way I have survived and will continue to survive in my profession. So are you sure that this special spell you need can be gotten from these shardwurms? Have you even seen one? A shardwurm I mean.”<br>
<br>
“No, I have not seen one for this is my first trip to this frigid land. You know that! I have researched their lore and seen sketches of them. And of course, this season, I learned of the spells they posses from my friends in Awakened Light. I am convinced that this trip will be the next stepping-stone in my quest for eternity. Why don’t you scout around Thurgadin for information for a while I collect my thoughts. As soon as that pale dwarf comes back with our lodgings, I need to retire for an hour and meditate.”<br>
<br>
No sooner did Drak finish her words and her wine, the barkeep scurried up to their table with their keys and directions to their rooms. Lars thanked him, stood up, turned to Drak and said, “Well, I am sure we are in for a good time Drak. Don’t forget, the money you have paid me is appreciated but I have thirst for some of the bounty this land has to offer and I wish to take advantage of that whenever our time allows. I will make friends with these barbarians and see if I can get up to speed on current events around here. I should also pay a visit to the rogue guild here and give my respects. I will see you in an hour.” Drak nodded, got up and left the room.<br>
<br>
Lars called the barkeep over and told him to bring a round of drinks to the barbarians’ table and tipped him well. This time, he let the dwarf leave without taking back some of his profits. Lars, un-hooded himself and turned on his unusually high charisma as he strode up to the barbarians. As he sat down, uninvited, he was greeted with frowns from these gigantic men. But Lars had good timing as always, for just a moment later, the barkeep dropped off a round of drinks and said, “Here ya go lads, complements from your new pointy eared friend.” With that the Dwarf disappeared again and the warriors belched their delight at this half-elf’s generosity.<br>
<br>
Half and hour later, Lars was on his way to the rogue guild having learned much from his drunken new friends and made himself 50 platinum pieces richer from teaching them his ‘hand is quicker than the eye’ bar tricks. Although, he doubt they really learned anything. He laughed to himself at how pleased they were betting on which mug the berry was under and always losing. He would have to visit them again during his stay in town if he had time.<br>
<br>
The best information he got from them was how to raise his regard to the Coldain dwarves. This was particularly important to him for he wanted to have better trade dealings with the dwarves if he was going to be based out of this fortress. It really was quite simple to grasp actually. No wonder, the barbarians did well around here. Dwarves and Giants hate each other. No surprise there. All that was required was to go kill some giants and the dwarves would look amiable upon him. Since they would be waiting for Datokk, Lars felt that it would be a good idea to hunt some giants. Of course, he would need to get Drak’s buy-in because her special powers would make all the difference in staying alive.<br>
<br>
He entered the guild, and greeted the rogue leader in the traditional ‘rogues cant’ speech. Lars was quite surprised how easy, and out in the open, it was to find this place. ‘Nothing like the rogue guild in Freeport,’ he thought. One thing Lars really appreciated and respected was that there really was honor among thieves and despite never being in Velious before, nor dealing with the Coldain before, he was accepted by this little fellow of the same profession with courtesy. The meeting was quick and Lars was soon on his way to find Drak. Since he was not performing any type of contract, in the area, he simply wanted to announce himself. This, by no means is a required act, but it was a respectful action to perform and could not hurt. Now if he were here on contract, he would be duty bound to register himself with the leader announcing his target, his sponsor, and himself as deliverer of the contract. This information was never disclosed as a matter of public record of course, but it allowed the local guild leader to be aware of the matter and provide independent confirmation if it were ever needed.<br>
<br>
Lars finally found Drak, right where she said she would be, meditating in a deathly trance on her bed. He picked her lock with agility and silence and then crept in and sat on the floor across from her while she continued to fuel herself. After a few minutes, he could not bear waiting anymore and he cleared his throat to announce his presence to her. She blinked her eyes and saw him sitting, grinning at her. “Someday, I will get used to your unique skills Lars,” she chuckled.<br>
<br>
Lars laughed out loud. That was one of his favorite things to do and he was glad for he knew it pleased his lord, Bristlebane. &quot;Well, at least I did not find you with one of your bony pets in some embarrassing moment like last year in Kunark!&quot; he chuckled. He would never let her live that one down. He was also happy that she did not turn him into a flaming pile of bones for bringing that old story up again. Inside, he was struggling to not burst out laughing even more than he had. She just sat there and rolled her eyes at him while he had his fun. She knew deep inside that it really was funny, and that Lars' mistake was understandable for someone not familiar with the arcane powers of a necromancer. Drak had been meditating in Lich form with her bones entwined and writhing with her pet's bones, when Lars came upon them. In Lars' mind it made sense, a solo necro woman does have needs and who better than some summoned skeleton that she could tell to get lost anytime she wished. Quite a perfect arrangement, he thought. Drak only ingrained the joke deeper into Lars' mind by trying to explain the real situation.<br>
<br>
After a few playful jabs back and forth, Lars reported to her what he found out from the barbarians and expressed his idea about a little afternoon frost giant hunting until the evening. While the idea did not excite her, she saw the logic in it. Drak knew that it would be advantageous to be a bit more on the favorable side of the Coldain. She agreed.<br>
<br>
Another half hour later, they had equipped themselves to spend several hours out in the elements. They had also gotten information on the areas to avoid, which is exactly where they were interested in going. As luck would have it, a good area to find wandering Frost Giants was close, near their route into the Great Divide that they took early that morning. As they left Thurgadin, they acknowledged the guards on the way out who peered at them just as apprehensively as when they had arrived that morning. Lars was happy, that they would soon turn that around. But then again, who would not be cautious of the pair of them.<br>
<br>
Lars, a Rogue his whole life, had experienced much prejudice and was quite used to the stares and un-willingness of merchants and townsfolk to accept him, much less sell to him. But, at least a fair skinned half elf was not attacked on sight very often for just being a Rogue.<br>
<br>
Drak was used to far worse treatment however. Very few, understandably so, had any desire to be in the company of a Dark Elf and even fewer still cared for one that was a Necromancer. That suited her just fine because she never ventured to highly populated areas unless she had serious business that absolutely required her presence. That is how Lars came to know Drakkulla Vampqueen years before.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<br>
Lars, who often traveled as a mercenary though out the continent of Antonica, happened upon Drak and her skeleton companion in The Feerot one day. While cloaked in the shadows, he watched in disgust and wonder as she sucked the life force from unsuspecting wandering young Frogloks until they passed out almost on the edge of death. Once she had a few ‘unhealthy specimens’ collected, she had her pet carry them as they journeyed away.<br>
<br>
Lars thought that he knew most of the local inhabitants in the area but this one was new to him. ‘Perhaps, this is worth some investigation’ he thought to himself, ‘There could be profit in it’. While keeping safety in the shadows, he followed from a distance so as to not be seen while using his cloak to keep his form hazy. An hour later, she and her companion disappeared behind a large fallen tree on the side of a steep hill. Lars was quite intrigued now. He knew of Dark Elves occasionally traveling through the area to do business with the Ogres and Trolls but he knew not of any that had taken up residence in the area.<br>
<br>
As dusk began to settle in the already dark obscure land of the Feerot, Lars’ curiosity was getting the best of him. He had every right to fear the power of this hateful deliverer of death and darkness. He was also no stranger to dealing with darker forces and had much experience performing contracts and assorted bad deeds for them even though he was not a follower of Innoruk. Lars retreated to an out of sight area behind a mass of trees and pulled out of his pack a mask he always had with him, and only seldom wore. Just moments later he emerged from the trees in the form of a Dark Elf with all the benefits of that race and began sneaking up to the hidden entrance. ‘Thank Bristlebane for allowing me the luxury of this illusion’ he thought to himself. ‘If I am discovered, I will have a far better chance of dealing with it in this guise.’<br>
<br>
Carefully, he inspected the log and the false wall that covered the entrance to the tunnel into the hill and with quick agility disarmed the warning trap that would announce an intruder’s presence. Suddenly, he thought that he must have failed disarming the trap. Inside the entrance he heard a loud crash and the shrill barking of orders from what could only be a female Dark Elf. For a moment, Lars froze from the clamor inside trying to decide his options. With one hand wrapping his cloak around him and the other resting on the hilt of his dagger, he sprang away to a couple of trees nearby and crouched in the thorny bushes.<br>
<br>
The din inside continued but now he could hear clearly the undeniable panic of a young Froglok coming his direction from inside the tunnel entrance while being chased by the cackling skeleton. Lars laughed silently to himself as he heard the comedy of sounds; “Fluuuurp” yelled the Froglok as he scampered closer to the tunnel entrance with its flat wet feet. “Fluuuuurg!” Flop flap, flop flap, flop flap. As expected, the young amphibian humanoid emerged from the entrance and was escaping for its life. Lars considered the moment as the denizen passed by his tree. Flop flap, flop flap, flop flap. He knew the skeleton and its master would soon emerge also and he made his snap decision.<br>
<br>
Now, several yards past him, he jumped from the shadow drawing a throwing dagger and launched it at the panicked beast. His deftness and aim were true as the dagger cut through the thick air catching the Froglok in the back of its knee and penetrating through till it shattered the kneecap from the inside out. “Flurrrrrrp?!?!” screamed his target. Flop, snap, and thud! The vile little creature just lay quiet and frozen knowing that it would never escape. It lost its will. Lars strode up and picked it up by the back of the neck and turned around hoping his hasty plan would work.<br>
<br>
It worked, as he timed and expected. The Necromancer stood at the entrance silently watching his actions. As Lars turned around, he feigned surprise with an evil grin at the appearance of the woman and her pet. In Dark Elf tongue he spoke to her. “Hail, what do I see before me but a servant of Innoruk, such as I. My apologies m’lady for I obviously have interfered with your sport without prior knowledge of it.” He knew that his guttural accent was perfect and hoped it was laced with enough hate to be believable.<br>
<br>
She considered him with a long gaze. This gaze was none like any other he had experienced. Lars suddenly felt nervous and unsure of himself as if she could see right through his illusion. He felt himself become tense and his mind acutely examined every bit of how he must present himself. Like going through a checklist, he became aware of his posture, his eyes, his hands and the hate he knew he must pretend to feel if he were to be perceived a true follower of Innoruk. He knew he had to be convincing or else he would give himself away and the potential of that result frightened him. ‘I may have been to hasty with my plan’, he thought. ‘I should have let the Froglok continue running and avoid this whole confrontation.’ Without backing off from her gaze, he reached inside himself and mustered up the discipline he knew he had mastered. In moments he melted his fear and doubt and stood fearless in her gaze.<br>
<br>
Seemingly satisfied now, she then swiftly turned on her pet, who was starring off, stupidly entertained by a nearby snake in the bushes. And, with a swift slap to the back of its skull, she yelled, “You careless sack of bones! What good are you! Be gone to the hell in which you came!” With a coordinated wave of her hands, the skeleton exploded into a fiery heap of bones. Turning back to Lars now, she grimaced in contempt. “Yes, it is quite convenient that you happened by when you did, or else I would have just killed the wretched thing myself,” she said. “My experiment was ruined anyway from my clumsy assistant who will no longer serve me”. She peered again at him for a moment “Quite convenient indeed. What is your business in The Feerot?”<br>
<br>
He grimaced back at her. “I could ask the same of you. But, I learned long ago not to question the ways of Dark Elf women who live in Isolation so far away from our homeland with only skeletons as companions.” Lars knew he would find out all he wanted to know soon enough, for this was the real way people of her kind spoke to each other. His statement would eventually lead her to divulge her work in time.<br>
<br>
“I am traveling to the deserts and then North to our great city. I have spent the last weeks in the hills of Qeynos, fulfilling an obligation for my current employer. I must be moving on soon, as I am delayed as it is. What would you have me do with your trophy?” he snarled with a grin.<br>
<br>
He could see the intrigue of his cryptic answer stirring her thoughts. Lars was quite skilled in the art of trickery and deception. He also learned in his younger days, while training, that the key to a good believable lie was to tell almost the truth. The closer the lie was to the truth, the more believable it would be. The fact of the matter was that he had just completed an assassination contract in Qeynos Hills. He did not question the wealthy human in Freeport about the reason because he did not care. The money was good although not good enough, considering the target was not as easy to find as promised. In the end, the traveling Barbarian merchant died just like any other. In astonishment and fear.<br>
<br>
“Oh that? Bah, I have no need for it now! This day has been a waste. You may do with it, as you will,” she exclaimed with a curious and impatient look.<br>
<br>
Lars knew he was still being tested. He looked at her in false delight. While he had no love of frogloks, he also would just pass them by normally and only steal from them if he suspected them of having anything of value. He had no compunction about killing but normally only did it if there was suitable purpose involving profit. In this case, he thought there might be or else he would not be in this position to begin with. For a moment longer he let the delight lay on his face while looking at her eyes in an unblinking gaze. Still holding the young creature in the air with his left hand, he deftly drew his dagger from the hilt and slit its throat in a quick jagged motion never taking his eyes from hers. While the froglok convulsed and gurgled for air, he giggled and then tossed it against a nearby tree, breaking its back. There it lay, helpless and bleeding out. The air around the embankment filled with the pungent smell of its blood and the last gasping sounds of its windpipe.<br>
<br>
“I feel refreshed now. Thank you for sharing your sport with me. Might you have some ale or other spirit to share with me before I depart?” he asked with more of a tone of expectancy than a question.<br>
<br>
