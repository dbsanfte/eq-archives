You can preach day in and day out about how its not unbalancing, and how its a &quot;nice change&quot;, and how you're right and I'm wrong, but when it comes down to it *I* have the 1 and a half+ years of PvP experience and *YOU* do not.  You can talk about how &quot;theoretically&quot; something should happen, and &quot;theoretically&quot; how a rogue could get killed using this.  I can tell you that already with sneak and hide in the high end game rogues have @#%$ me up, thank @#%$ I can still use my bow to find them...when I'm lucky enough to have it equipped in a pvp.<br>
<br>
@#%$ @#%$, you might as well start arguing to me about how Malo isn't overpowered in PvP, &quot;but i t hsa a cats tyme a nd yuo cna intrupt it&quot;.  Don't even get me started on THAT issue.  So I invite every non-red rogue on this thread to kindly go somewhere else because your opinions and views on the issue hold about nil weight with me, and rightly so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udovewhispersilk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dove Whispersilk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/01 4:53:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2325.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue abilities to change with Next patch.</span><hr size=1> level 1-50 rogues really do need this though.<br>

It will totally destroy any jousting strategy you ever had, and possibly make it to where you *can't* fight back against necro's and SK's (and we all know those 2 classes need help in the pvp area).<br>
<br>
In a one on one situation using the current ruleset, from levels 1 to 60 between a rogue and a warrior is pretty simple.  If its a good warrior, he will slap on a 2 hander and get the most out of a round.  If its a good rogue, he will sneak/hide when the warrior runs past him and then sneak around his back to get a backstab.  Before I got my perma-see invis item (read: level 60), Rogues would seriously screw me up with the sneak hide.  Just IMAGINE what they could do to me if they were erased from my target everytime we went by each other.  I would get *no* hits in due to not having a target to GET hits in.<br>
<br>
If you, as a red rogue, cannot see how overpowering this would be to YOU, then you need to take a step back and quit your rogue.  Everyone likes changes that benefit their class, and they will find a plethora of reasons as to why it isn't overpowering, but in actuality the reasons they listed are too stupid to even work.<br>
<br>
I'm also curious as to who your Shank character is, maybe we grouped with each other at some point in time? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujamesvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JamesVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/01 8:10:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2325.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ah Hell</span><hr size=1> &quot;Get a clue and realize by lvl 12, most int casters have invis and see invis already.&quot;<br>

&quot;If ya think ppl walk around on the pvp server with 500 pp and dont have see invis up, ya show your obvious bluebie roots.&quot;<br>
-I believe in carrying around in excess of 250+pp now that item loot is out, and I got my first see invis item at level 60.<br>
<br>
&quot;And yes if by chance some rog and war happen to be all alone and meet for a one on one battle(rarely if ever happens, with 2 mins a backup force will come running)&quot;<br>
-?  Do you actually play on a pvp server on a day to day basis?  Where have you been?<br>
<br>
&quot;A war wll be at a disadvantage, but who gives a damn?&quot;<br>
-Me, the warrior, but I have faced disadvantages before and spit in its face.  This is complete and total power over another class.  Imagine an instant casting, unresistable snare.  Sorta like that in terms of &quot;disadvantage&quot;.<br>

&quot;If I face a mage with a earth pet, im at a major disadvantage, thats life.&quot;<br>

&quot;Certain classes will have advantage over others and you need to react and make a desicion.&quot;<br>

&quot;Thats life on a pvp server, it isnt some @#%$ you can whine about and get it patched.&quot;<br>

Just to clarify for you, a rogue can only evade (hide) successfully when they are completely still.  So there would be no running past you and hitting hide.  That wouldn't work...<br>
<br>
For this reason I don't think it is unbalancing against another melee.  Against a caster, perhaps slightly.  But hey, more power to us...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't have much experience in PvP, but I know my way around Hide.  I know how long it takes to stop and Hide...<br>
<br>
How would a rogue hitting hide every time he swings (and appears) beat a warrior?  Any smart warrior, when they see the rogue has hidden, would just leave the area.  It is incredibly hard to get a BS in on someone while sneaking.  If the warrior is simply standing there, yes the rogue could beat him using this tactic:  BS, rehide, sneak around, BS, rehide, etc.  But anyone who is even remotely moving around would take literally hours for this method to work.  Or here's an idea: keep auto-attack on so that every time the rogue takes a stab at ya he is automatically targeted and smacked around a bit?<br>
<br>
Anyways, what I'm saying is that a rogue using this tactic ain't unbalanced, he's just boring.<br>
<br>
Nimm<br>
<br>
Edit:  One thing that would be interesting is something I have never tried/experienced:  Do PC's affect a rogue similarly as MOBs?  In other words, does a rogue get knocked back when getting wailed on by another PC?  Cause if this is true, hiding would be even more difficult... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unimmbull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimmbull</A> at: 6/26/01 8:51:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uogor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ogor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/01 10:56:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2325.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I cant belive Kendrick got credit for this post.</span><hr size=1> I just amazed that I've read on two different major eq news sites that kendrick annouced it.

<br>
You can Hide/Sneak behind someone, Backstab, rehide instantly and repeat.  Primarily I am more concerned about how overpowering this tactic will be at 55+ levels as the Rogue is BSing double 300s+ easy, sneaking faster, and with Jboots or SoW their is VERY little risk.<br>
<br>
Also with Invis doing this, this opens up SKs and Necros (Circlet of Shadows), any plate class (Incardine BP), and Rogues (PoA Mask) to have an incrediably powerful method of basically reeming people by being able to untarget yourself at will.  NONE of these items are overpowering in PoE, but with the proposed PvP change extremely powerful (class defining items as far as PvP is concerned).<br>
<br>
My bet is Verant will just nerf these items instead of actually fixing the fact that the ability to untarget yourself from others is extremely powerful.  <br>
<br>
I DO actually think you should be able to untarget yourself, but it should be on some sort of timer.  Pure melee classes specifically really could use something like this.  The current proposal just sounds way to easy to abuse and further favors melee classes with decent resists over casters at high levels. <br>

People PvP as little as possible as-is, and when you DO manage to get around to PvPing now-adays (read: coin-loot only), they generally last 30+ minutes (as an average, melee vs. melee...I could see taking 10-15 min).  Everybody on the server already knows which dungeons you are and are not supposed to enter, and those dungeons are blue straight down to the core.  The only PvP you get is the offchance that someone may try to enter that dungeon late at night.  Yes, it may come as a big surprise, but we, &quot;teh l33t peekayers&quot; do not PvP unless we go out and seek it, and about 2% of the population does that, and 99.9% of that 2% is below level 30 (speaking as a day to day basis, I often find myself on a raid group to Karnor's Castle every once in a blue moon).<br>
<br>
Something like this would just totally kill any pvp contact I had with a rogue, what little of it I *do* have.  What I wish for is for them to stop screwing around with PvP balancing, it was pretty damn balanced until they screwed around with Harmtouch, and then later resist debuffs (not so much anything else as much as Malo is, you will fear the unresistable -70 to all resists). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucoraan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coraan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/01 1:11:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2325.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/classes/c_rogue.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ah Hell</span><hr size=1> JamesVZ, I have played on tallon Zek since it started, and some of your statements are way off base, imho.<br>
<br>
JamesVZ - "In a one on one situation using the current ruleset, from levels 1 to 60 between a rogue and a warrior is pretty simple. If its a good warrior, he will slap on a 2 hander and get the most out of a round. If its a good rogue, he will sneak/hide when the warrior runs past him and then sneak around his back to get a backstab. Before I got my perma-see invis item (read: level 60), Rogues would seriously screw me up with the sneak hide. Just IMAGINE what they could do to me if they were erased from my target everytime we went by each other. I would get *no* hits in due to not having a target to GET hits in."<br>
<br>
What red server are you talking about? A warrior vs a rogue, just them two fighting it out for an entire fight? sounds like a duel to me. That does not happen on a red server. Why? Both of those classes are group dependent, so you will rarely find and engage them alone. Oh, but sure, they are, say, traveling through DL, planning on meeting their friends at the rings. and you (a warrior) find them and engage them.. (because warriors go solo PK raiding sooo often.)<br>
<br>
But let us entertain your situation. Ok, so the warrior and rogue are fighting, and the warior is getting beat... hmm what happens? Maybe the warrior runs off when the rogue hides/sneaks... and yells to the zone that he needs help (if he is in a zone his team controlls ).. or maybe his guildmates arrive, seeing how the moment the fight started, he alerted to them he was getting Pked and where. <br>
<br>
A rogue who is sneaking cannot catch a warrior who is running away. Hell atleast in this match-up you can get away.. a warrior against some other, one on one, you might as well start planning your corpse run. <br>
<br>
Of course, another thing the warrior can do is retarget on the rogue, that is if the warrior has see invis. Of course you are saying a warrior cannot get a see invis item until level 60...<br>
What? Ever heard of the Bracer of the hidden? Or the necklace that comes out of droga/mines of Nurga area? My ranger had a bracer at 35. seventy-percent of the warrios I know have one. and if you are not uber enough to kill sarnacks in LOIO, I see them auctioned all the time.<br>
<br>
Later on you made another reference to see invis, in your response to other posters...<br>
<br>
poster - "Get a clue and realize by lvl 12, most int casters have invis and see invis already."<br>
James VZ - I played a caster 1 through 60, and a warrior 1 through 60, I can count on my hand the number of times I thought See Invis was a necessary buff for pvp.<br>
<br>
poster - "If ya think ppl walk around on the pvp server with 500 pp and dont have see invis up, ya show your obvious bluebie roots."<br>
JamesVZ - "I believe in carrying around in excess of 250+pp now that item loot is out, and I got my first see invis item at level 60."<br>
<br>
What? I really doubt you play on a PvP server. See invis is almost always up, unless you are deep into a dungeon, or well within the safe lands of your team. If you are in hostile lands, you will always have it if it is available. It is kinda like checking who is in the zone  ALL the time. Hell I use my bracer of the hidden ot see invis the groups because it is faster, and it is a MUST buff.<br>
<br>
And I don't carry that much change. why? It is heavy. Of course you are a warrior and can surely carry more. But the only reason why people on the high end carry a lot of coin is because they get a lot of coin from mobs at higher levels, and it adds up faster. Not sure what your point is about this..<br>
<br>
Poster - ""And yes if by chance some rog and war happen to be all alone and meet for a one on one battle(rarely if ever happens, with 2 mins a backup force will come running)"<br>
JamesVZ -"? Do you actually play on a pvp server on a day to day basis? Where have you been?"<br>
<br>
Unless you are solo PKing in a zone like OOT, yes there will be back-up in about 2 minutes. Unless you keep it to yourself that you are in a fight, and don't tell your group/guild/zone. But of course your adversary just did... and the only reason backup might not come, is that he doesnt need any to drop you solo. On a PvP server, it is rare for someone not to just wander into your fight to begin with.<br>
And I am not even taking into account MOBs.<br>
<br>
Poster - "A war wll be at a disadvantage, but who gives a damn?"<br>
JamesVZ "-Me, the warrior, but I have faced disadvantages before and spit in its face. This is complete and total power over another class. Imagine an instant casting, unresistable snare. Sorta like that in terms of "disadvantage".<br>
<br>
No it is nothing like that. Your comparison is way off. With an unresistable snare, you cant get away, and you die. With rogues having this power, you can still always turn tale and run. That is , unless, he hs jboots, and you still do not (I have a feeling you havnt gotten even those yet).<br>
<br>
poster - ""Like was said before, this aint lvl 50 RB land, this is lvl 12 giant snake fang lande, please try to remeber how that was is you havent experinced it in awhile."<br>
JamesVZ "-When I was using a giant snake fang, I was level 34."<br>
<br>
Well, seeing how you carry all your plat when you are out PKing, I can understand why you couldnt afford a better wep.<br>
<br>
poster - ""The second a rogue enters the zone with a rep for stealing, belive me the shouts will go up<br>
"Hey that mofo thief soandso is here"<br>
Ppl will make sure they atleast one of thier group members will have see invis."<br>
JamesVZ "-Riiiiight."<br>
<br>
If you have spent anytime whatsoever on a pvp server, you know about shouts going up in a zone saying a pk raiding group is there" and hell ya, see invis is passsed out, MR gear is put on, PvP buffs are tossed out, and mobs are not pulled till the situation is assesed.<br>
<br>
Sorry to go off on this tangent, but I really didnt like the PvP server world to be so misrepresented. <br>

-Most of my encounters take place as a solo battle.  I very rarely PvP in a group, but often I do find myself PvPing against a small group of maybe 2 or 3.  Classes being group dependent has @#%$ to do with it, fungi tunic + 207 bind wound skill and I'm ready to go again in under a minute.<br>
<br>
&quot;But let us entertain your situation. Ok, so the warrior and rogue are fighting, and the warior is getting beat... hmm what happens?

-I'm not saying that at all.  I am saying that *I* got my perma-seeinvis item at level 60.  Many people I know at level 60 *still* don't have a perma-seeinvis item.  Go ask Nanak why he doesn't have his.<br>
<br>
&quot;What? I really doubt you play on a PvP server. See invis is almost always up, unless you are deep into a dungeon, or well within the safe lands of your team.

Hell I use my bracer of the hidden ot see invis the groups because it is faster, and it is a MUST buff.&quot;<br>

&quot;And I don't carry that much change. why? It is heavy. Of course you are a warrior and can surely carry more. But the only reason why people on the high end carry a lot of coin is because they get a lot of coin from mobs at higher levels, and it adds up faster.

On a PvP server, it is rare for someone not to just wander into your fight to begin with.&quot;<br>
-Yes it is, I know that on Vallon Zek any place outside a dungeon is practically barren for the most part (save Sro and oasis, 2 very good prime PvP spots).  I can sit just outside of the stone at KC and fight someone there 1 on 1.  90% of the time their backup won't arrive unless a) he is needed for a group inside, or b) I am interferring with their plans some other way.  <br>
<br>
&quot;And I am not even taking into account MOBs.&quot;<br>
-I don't know about you, but every battle I have been in with another &quot;honorable&quot; PvPer, we both stop to kill the mob.<br>
<br>
&quot;No it is nothing like that. Your comparison is way off. With an unresistable snare, you cant get away, and you die. With rogues having this power, you can still always turn tale and run. That is , unless, he hs jboots, and you still do not (I have a feeling you havnt gotten even those yet).&quot;<br>
-It wasn't a comparison between the two at all, it was a comparison in disadvantage.  Adding that snare would make a druid almost unkillable, same with a rogue, shadowknight, or a necromancer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, seeing how you carry all your plat when you are out PKing, I can understand why you couldnt afford a better wep.&quot;<br>
-250pp does not equate to &quot;all my plat&quot;, especially since I generally gain more money from PvP then I lose.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you have spent anytime whatsoever on a pvp server, you know about shouts going up in a zone saying a pk raiding group is there&quot; and hell ya, see invis is passsed out, MR gear is put on, PvP buffs are tossed out, and mobs are not pulled till the situation is assesed.&quot;<br>
-I've never seen this done, not once.  Its actually pretty funny too, just about every time I go to KC I get a good chuckle out of it.  My group (I don't take KC solo like Splorge <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) would come in and kill the entrance groups NP.  What do we do next?  Go around the corner and kill the group pulling mobs WHILE the people at front were dieing.  Now you think that would be bad enough, but noooo, the group from across the way (on the other corner) are *STILL* pulling mobs.  Now, myself...yes I do prepare for PvP when I see the /who list.  I learned my lesson long ago by not doing so.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry to go off on this tangent, but I really didnt like the PvP server world to be so misrepresented.&quot;<br>
-Its not misrepresented.  PvP is @#%$.<br>
