The Sect was led by a man known as &quot;the Old Man of the Mountain&quot; and the murderers sent out were often hopped up on hashish so they felt no pain during an attack.  In tha arabic they were known as &quot;Hashisheen&quot;, the users of hashish.<br><br>Now, this threat of murder only worked because of the strength of the fortress that was the seat of the Assassin's power. It was in mountainous terrain, and was heavily fortified.  The rulers of the time felt that could not be stormed or battered down, and that any army sent to seige it would have its officers, as well as the ruler who sent them, murdered.<br><br>The eventual fate of the City of Assassins was to fall to the Mongols, more specifically to the chinese seige engineers employed by them.  Once the defences were breached the Mongols stormed the city and left no survivors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucaowyth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caowyth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/9/02 10:18:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Caowyth/fullsize/gir4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need suggestions - Religous Assassins</span><hr size=1> Thats how my current assassin works.

Anyone who didnt voluntarily donate was liable to have twice the value of the voluntary donation simply &quot;disappear&quot; from their possession.<br><br>He was a lot of fun to play, mainly because the other characters loathed his theivery, but tolerated it because they could never quite prove anything, and given his vow of poverty, he spent nearly everything he gained on good works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukintire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kintire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/10/02 8:56:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need suggestions - Religous Assassins</span><hr size=1> The Old Man of the Mountain was Hasan-i-Sabah.

This would open the doors to a wide variety of character possibilities.  After all, fanatics can be found in all walks of life...<br><br>So let's go with a prestige class.  It's firmly rooted in religion, so all potential candidates will need to have at least basic training as a cleric (i.e., multiclass to include 1st level cleric).  I think the skill requirements given for Assassins would also apply here.  Once the prestige class is taken, abilities gained would reflect both the martial and mystic.  A mixture of Assassin deadly strike abilities, access to a modified spell list, and certain supernatural abilities would be appropriate.  The latter may include the ability to create Darkness or Silence once or twice per day, gain Darksight/Blindsight, etc.<br><br>I'd take a look at the spell lists for evil clerics and the descriptions of Assassins, Blackguards, and Shadow Dancers for more inspiration. <p>Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br><i>No matter how subtle the wizard, a dirk between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelviscerat0r.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elviscerat0r</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/9/02 10:44:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need suggestions -
