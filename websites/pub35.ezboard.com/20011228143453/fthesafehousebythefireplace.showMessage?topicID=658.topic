<br>
Just wanted to share a little adventure I had, and to give some credit to those who helped me. This happended yesterday, and I've been smiling ever since.<br>
<br>
The scene opens up on the Southern Desert of Ro, in the relam of Fennin Ro, with a human (myself) and a little gnome named Voltic.  Now its night time, and being a rogue, we slip our masks on and get comfy in a DE nature.  There is no sweeter eyecandy then the desert at night with ultravision /grin. Now it was all innocent fun we were having, killin mummies for embalming dust.  After all, we had just traveled from Unrest and were gathering supplies for some lyxt wing dust poison. I remember it started with Voltic saying &quot;I think I'm gonna slaughter some dervs&quot; when it began.  We had moved over to the camp along the left wall, facing away from Oasis.  I had just positioned myself behind a derv Voltic was piercing to get in a cruel backstab when I saw it. I tried to tell him, but in my rush all I ended up doing was jumping and hailing. I finally got it out: /g AC behind you!!  I was astounded! I had joked earlier that we might see the ancient cyclops if we had killed enough mummies, but we had only been in the desert for about 10minutes. Quickly dispatching the derv and a few of his friends, we ran to the scene were only seconds before it had looked like someone had tried to kill the AC with a charmed SG. There was a quite a crowd around the corpse, including Voltic and myself. Still, Im unsure who killed it but whoever has was looting the corpse.  Now friends, heres the twist )<br>
<br>
For those who don't know, the AC drops the Ring of the Ancients, ..a nifty &quot;ring&quot; that goes on your arm.  It's AC 6 +5 INT. a nice thing, though if not kinda fugly lookin for a ring. More importantly, the ring is the key component in the Journeyman's Boots quest.  It is also nodrop.  Now as I was saying, whoever had killed the AC was in fact looting it.  I know this because my rogueish nature instantly kicked in around such corpse as I was furiously clicking the corpse lookin for spare FS weapons or other neglected goods. Voltic meanwhile is behind me, contemplating the size of the corpse and causing general confusion with the chat windows /chuckle. Now as it happend, while Im clicking Im attacked by a ghoul, who knocks me around a bit, but lo! suddenly my screen changes and Im peering into the corpse of an ancient cyclops, still wearing that ring.  Now for a little bit of roguish rational.  I had been clickin for quite sometime, time enough in fact, for a computer to decide that this corpse was now free for everyone to loot, otherwise, why would I be looting it? /grin.<br>
<br>
So Im staring at the all fabled ring of the ancients, a right click away from sliding it into my belt pouch, still being pushed around by a ghoul, when instinct kicks in.<br>
<br>
*click*<br>
<br>
Im in shock still, and dont even bother to select the ghoul and fight back when I'm typing: /g zone. now. to Voltic who was trying hard to pull the damn thing off me.  He had seen the corpse disappear, and not wanting to have to answer anything following click first and ask questions later, presumed to follow my beeline straight for the oasis. The crowd still confused was behind me, with only a &quot;wtf?&quot; ringing in my ears from someone who had been startled by the missing corpse. I improved my safefall significantly as I made a mad dash over the dunes.<br>
<br>
Along with my safefall success came a dramatic increase in alcohol tolerance, as we flew to the Seafareres Roost in Freeport. We drank, we danced, we were bonnie and clyde. Later that night we went down to the rogues guild smuggling port below and outside of Freeport. We sat in a cave and cheered and hugged. It was great.  We made plans to leave that morning and set out on the quest, and not long after we had planned it, where we standing in Rathe Mts. waiting for Hastem. /smile     <br>
<br>
My thanks to Voltic for being there every step of that way, except the last /giggle , to Lotusstar (?) a monk for his company, to Madcaddy, for his TP and Jor(something) for lettin us have the shadow rapier. And to Hastem, for having my size /wink.<br>

After six hours of bringing my fishing skill to master my bard friend spammed AC!! AC!! AC! AC! HOLY SH*T AC!!! As I watch it fall to the ground for the last time I run my un-sowed ass to its corpse and right clicked and to my surprise I see a nice belt looking like item I right click it to read *RIng of the Acients*. I made a shout into my guild *YES! I GOT IT! I HAVE THE RING OF THE ACIENTS!*<br>
<br>
after I calm down I head off to feerot to get the shadowed rapier.. after about 5 minutes of camping them I loot a shadowed rapier.. Time to head to rathe mtns.. I sit calmly waiting for the shorty named hasten to run by... As my wizzard friend goes to ask a druid if he were on track there he goes! runs right by me. Luckily he ran right to my wizzard friend. As he hails him non-stop I run my slow encumbered butt up to him and hailed him.. And at 4:30 PST on monday January 15 I right click my brand new Jboots! <p>-Soreali Soballi
