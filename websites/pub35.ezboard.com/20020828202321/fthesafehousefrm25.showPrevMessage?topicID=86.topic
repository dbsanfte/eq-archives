<br>
I've been fiddling with the idea of trying to run a d20 Dark Sun game lately, and I've found a few sources good sources, but I was really curious if WoTC was planning on releasing any new materials.  I'd heard that the rights to Dark Sun were bought out before D&amp;D went over to WoTC.  <br>
<br>
Overall, it was one of the most fun worlds imho, and I'd love to see it revamped to fit the new system.<br>

I know it most likely isn't, I have never actually played it, and I realize it's most likely only because I didn't ever look too closely at it.<br>
<br>
I have yet to meet someone who wanted psionics that wasn't actively trying to rape the rules. that combined with some of the races and the enourmouse stat bonuses and such that were supposedly in there always made me think it was just a power gamer's world. Now logically if the palyers are bumped up in power the other denizens are as well, but eh, such is life when people are slaves to perceptions. <p><table border="0" align="center">

In rollplay vs. roleplay I favor the latter.  Some don't, or worse don't know there's a difference.  Heck, when I first started gaming I didn't!  I've since learned to love the story more than the dice and have consequently grown much more picky about the players I will game with.  <br>
<br>
Dark Sun has a lot of suspicion and intrigue when played correctly.  You have a cast of characters that range from the most diabolical and evil to the most compassionate; unlike most fantasy worlds though, its ok if the bad guys win on a regular basis.  Almost everyone was miserable before, so there's not any catastrophic difference!<br>
<br>
Just my take though. . . It all depends on your taste and those of your gaming buddies.<br>

<br>
the reason that characters are stronger actually fits with the setting. Darksun is supposed to be an extremely harsh environment, and that is reflected by the rolls (5d4 for your stats i believe). Supposedly the folks in Darksun are more hardy stock than other worlds and such. <br>
<br>
there was also a system of fatigue in combat. if you fought for too long, you started losing stats and the like. Being slightly more powerful was needed to finish the fights faster.<br>
<br>
im not a fan of psionics though, so i only played it a time or two.<br>

If you ever looked at the monster compendium released for it, you'd see why.  The compaign setting even suggested you roll more than one character because death was supposed to be a likely occurence.  <br>
<br>
Generally we always ran games like this.  You started out as a slave in the pits, you get selected to be a gladiator and either fought to freedom or you tried to escape.  If you escaped you had to run from the templars etc, and survive in the desert long enough to make it to a sanctuary or another city, and hope they didn't make you a slave when you got there.  You could be evil and work for the templars and get in their trust if you wanted, or you could be good by being a mercenary/hero type or trying to help the preservers.  <br>
<br>
A very interesting setting with some cool ideas, definitly worth a few campaigns if run right.  Probly not as repeatable as the more general worlds like the Realms. <p><b>Brelkor the Blackhammer</b> The Masta Back Stabba, retired rogue<br>
