Many of the monks i know don't even pay attention to it because all of the 60-65 monks i know have aa's to completely counter-balance the problem or, have enough equipment that it dosnt matter...<br>
As stated by Verant 50ac = 10damage....Monks have among the highest agility rating in the game 3agi = 1ac<br>
Jesus!, a 60 iksar monk in full Kael, had more ac than a friend's 61 decked out warrior...what does the monk need it for? Running w/sow from point a to point b, only to fiegn and let the MA kick the living piss outta it?...<br>

<br>
1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This nerf reduces the over all combat effectiveness of the monk class to be inline with that of hybrids without spells. <br>
<br>
2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This nerf has resulted in some people having to lower the level of the mobs they solo safely by about 2-5 levels. This is a pretty bad change when you consider that the monk class is neither as specialised as the other pure melee nor as solo efficient as the hybrids in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>
In summary, the class that had its all round above average combat ability as its one main selling point is now being shoe-horned into a one dimensional damage-dealing role that many monk players wouldn’t have wanted to play when they invested their time and effort into their character.<br>

<br>
All the hybrids I know (or other straight melee for that matter) couldn't solo anywhere near as well as a comparable monk unless they were 60 with a boatload o aaxp. Especially compared to an epic monk. (beastlord excluded if you consider them in the same category).<br>

Bards can solo far better than monks.<br>

Rangers possibly cant, although Im sure they can do well enough against animals.<br>

<br>
My Ranger at 48th certainly find soloing far easier than my Monk ever did, and I understand thins to have been true pre-PoP until at least 55th lvl... although I note now that a friend of mine at 60th is soloing hounds in WW quite happily.<br>
<br>
As Kawai points out, the only two classes that dont solo as well as the Monk are the Warrior and the Rogue.<br>
<br>
I also play a 46th level Beastlord in very modest gear that makes Monk soloing look like a sad sad joke, and he brings at least as much to a group as a Monk.<br>
<br>
post_nerf, Monk soloing aint much different than the other pure melees, it's only FD that makes it more viable as a safety net.<br>
<br>
If pure melees are going to be so group dependent... and the majority of Monks are now group dependent for any real activity... then I don't think it unreasonable for us to fucking shine at it, because the non-pure melees, all of them are far far les dependent upon having a group to operate effectively. <p><hr />

&quot;Monk<br>
Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping their bodies into pure weapons. Because of this, they shun nearly all weapons and most forms of armor. They can be very religious and the gods are known to bless them, not with spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks. Only two races produce monks - humans and the lizardmen known as the Iksar. Strangely, though Iksar monks invariably worship Cazic-Thule and most human monks follow Quellious the Tranquil, there are some human monks who are actually agnostic! &quot;<br>
<br>
In patch:<br>
Decreased Monks' ability to mitigate damage (please see the Developer's Update on www.everquestlive.com for more details) <br>
<br>
&quot;Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes.<br>
<br>
Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities.  Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys.  <br>
<br>
Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered.<br>
<br>
* Monk Defense.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br>
<br>
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br>
<br>
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br>
<br>
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.  <br>
<br>
Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br>
<br>
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.&quot;<br>

Its time to put this crap to rest.  It's a done deal.  They may go back and change it but more than likely it will remain as is.  I am simply having to change my approach to the game.  I have to remember to stay out of this forum with all the 1 post responses that once again celebrate and justify this change.  One comment, there is technically no such thing as a &quot;pulling&quot; class.  Since the 1 post trolls like to state the &quot;Vision&quot; statement, pulling was never a vision either.  Please see the numerous posts on this board that mention that.  Pulling was a player created tactic.  I can understand the need to vent (I have done my share here), but to continuosly get drug into these flames is getting tiring.  We must try and adapt and move on.  I see more groupage in my future and maybe that isn't as bad as I think it is.  Now just finding the time to fit it into my RL. <p>Tiket Kouryuu<br>

Ummmm... didn't a TON of paladins threaten to quit when:<br>
<br>
1. Clerics got upgraded, summoned hammer and high DPS.<br>
2. They were going to nerf Slay Undead.<br>
<br>
Answer to both is YES. Some did, not all of them but a large percentage.<br>
<br>
So, sort of pot calling the kettle black don't you think? <p><br>

Yes, you've basically just restated patch notes and opinions prety much saying &quot;Ner nee ner nee ner ner, I'm right and you're not, suck it up! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &quot;<br>

<br>
How about showing where VI stated:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> the monk looses 150ac points (thats all that was changed, and i can cite that by fact from Verant's website)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As it happens it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>seems</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that VI effectively reduced AC by about 200, but this is only from player parsing and seems to explain why uber monks with more AC than they know what to do with haven't felt the nerf (at least not on blue mobs).  However VI have stated NOTHING on the issue as far as I'm aware (and this could be an incorrect interpretation of what actually was changed).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> As stated by Verant 50ac = 10damage <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This you just pulled out of your ass. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also whilst stating facts, you convinently ignore the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FACT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that melee balance has been thrown out of wack with the mitiagion nerf patch.<br>
<br>
pre-nerf   (damage) rogue&gt;&gt;&gt;monk&gt;warrior<br>
              (tanking) warrior&gt;monk&gt;rogue<br>
<br>
post-nerf (damage) rogue&gt;&gt;&gt;monk&gt;warrior<br>
              (tanking) warrior&gt;&gt;monk&gt;\=rogue<br>
<br>
<br>
To make it balanced in the role VI seems to be nerfing monks into, that of pure damage dealer, it would have to be something like this:<br>
<br>
(damage) rogue&gt;&gt;monk&gt;&gt;warrior<br>
(tanking) warrior&gt;&gt;monk&gt;\=rogue<br>
<br>
(rogues still come out ahead, but their damage is more situational)<br>
<br>
Not to mention that hybrids are beginning to equal monk in damage, tanking and still have spells etc (which also renders FD less useful as FD pulling in many cases is now better done with a SK than a monk).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a paladin who's recently avoided the nerf bat I'd have thought you'd have more sense.  I never saw anything but support for paladins against the nerf, despite the fact quite a few had previously come here to gloat over the monk nerf. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fopoodzo@monklybusiness43508>Fopoodzo</A> at: 10/24/02 7:14:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skykungfu>SkyKungfu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/24/02 7:25:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...fact or fiction?</span><hr size=1> Most monks HAD more ac than most 60 warriors, and that accounted to their solo ability ~ FACT<br>

<br>
But why, honeslty does a &quot;pulling&quot; class need more damage mitigation...as they stated...Monks were not soley the problem, it was the items that grew around the class and out-balanced the other classes...<br>
<br>
So why do you quit...when A. They admit the problem, and B correct it so everyone else is equal?...isnt that the idea of the game?...<br>
<br>
And btw...Paladins are becoming more and more rare because contrary to popular belief...it does take more skill to play a hybrid than any class in the game...read on Paladins of Norrath...to find out for yourselves...<br>
<br>
I didnt ask for a flame...I asked a question that apparently everyone here missed...Why the hell are 20percent of the monks in the game quitting over a &quot;Damage mitigation&quot; when all a monk really does is pull?...Hence feign...and since the game has become more strategic and group oriented wouldnt it be a better thing to be a monk?...Just like the 10/13 1hb that drops in PoP?...<br>
<br>
Again, I didnt ask for a flame, and defended myself...stating facts, is also a point of the debate team and any law profession, one states the obvious and builds upon that = most offective debate...You have to remember avg reading/grade level in us is under 11th grade...hence you have to bow down to the idiots when you write...<br>
<br>
And Hybrids are meant to deal high damage...They are a tank class, but you also have to remember best weapon in the game used to be monk only...Ton Po's bo stick of understanding...and Fists of Acrylia kick any paladin weapon's ass...especially primal.../priceless...<br>
<br>
Monks still got it better than most classes, again my question was why does everyone run away when Verant admitted they made a mistake, and instead of changing the items ( a good thing ) changed the &quot;damage mitigation&quot; a little...<br>
<br>
Also, mind you...most of the &quot;i quits&quot; on the forumns happened prior to the patch.<br>
