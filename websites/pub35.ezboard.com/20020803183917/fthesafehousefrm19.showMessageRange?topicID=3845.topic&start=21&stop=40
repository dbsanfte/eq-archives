<br>
I cant really comment on sb vs inf, but I can tell you its getting old hopping on an assassin and getting raped in 95% of the scenarios you can imagine. You imagine one we should win, and we just dont. If this fixxes that BS to some extent, I am all for it.<br>
<br>
You can flame me all you want, but until you experience the *fear* that every shade has to endure when encountering another assassin you just wont understand :) Even better, until you experience a sb or inf going through your ranger buddy (who IPed) and you while you were beating on him the whole time you just have no idea how bad the shade community has it. <p><center><br>"I am still learning" <br>

<br>
<br>
Yes, NS's and INF's need a fear of sb's... without those assassin hunting sb's, there is no stopping them from destroying a vast majority of of the classes of midgard.<br>
<br>
<br>
Most of midgard is chain, thrust kills chain, thanes, warriors, healers, skalds, all struggle against a good thrust stealther.  The counter was the shadowblade who had no other real choice but to mess up casters and hunt the stealthers that hunted our realm.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you'd just get over the &quot;this makes me better&quot; mentality and look at the Shadowblade PLAYERS.  You'd see this is a nerf and a very devastating one.<br>
<br>
All rogues kill casters.<br>
<br>
Now the SB is just that, a caster killer, end of list.<br>
<br>
<br>
Very disheartening.<br>

This pipe dream of protecting the Midgard realm is total BS. The perfect defense to an assassin = a group. You want to dominate in 1vs1. Period.<br>

<br>
This patch gives you the other options.  Suddenly you have other targets out there who are vulnerable to your slashing weapons.  Shadowblades gained a lot of versatility in these changes.<br>
<br>
I really think these changes are good for assassins as a whole.  We will have to be more selective in our targets because penalties will really hurt us now, but that goes along with our theme as assassins anyway.<br>
<br>
This will definately be a change which shadowblades must adapt too, but as far as the class, and for game balance I think the new resist tables are a good change.  Even if they aren't that realistic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uubergnome563.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ubergnome563</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 11:01:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> SB should be feared, but not invincible(or nearly invincible).<br>

Like I said on another post, it's like making a stun/nearsight/fastnuke Light Eldritch swap out all their dueling spells for AE spells. They would probably make a great AE mage with those spells, but that is not how they wanted to play their class and it dramatically changes their playstyle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udorlandmuahdib.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorland Muah Dib</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 11:54:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3845.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.camelotherald.com/guilds/guild.php?s=Bedevere&g=213 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> hmmmm<br>

<br>
1) BUFFBOTS ARENT THE REASON FOR MYTHICS RESIST CHANGE. some of you people always want to go off and blame it on buffbots. Like i said i defend buffbots. i dont like them, but i defend them.<br>

2) This is probably a tad too simple but why not give normal leather a low vuln to slash. Whenever i am in RvR I flat out loathe seeing a shadowblade, they are THE assasin hunter and should remain just that, and to be frank i may be low but they still scare the @#%$ out of me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>*****Absque Veritas's Official Wet Paper Towel***** <br>     Dorland Muahdib 40 Black Hand <br>Nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently talented fool.

Shadowblades had a role.  It was a pretty specific roll, but it was A roll.<br>

Shadowblades killed stealthers, and of course all rogues killed casters.<br>

<br>
Open new targets? Did you even bother to read through this post?<br>
<br>
The New Vulnerable List for shadowblades consists of 4 Hibernian Classes, 3 of which are tank classes and the 4th is the healer class.<br>
<br>
Sb's have not been given MORE opportunity, the opportunity is just changed to class with more hitpoints, better absorb, and alot better defensive capabilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
Honest truth.  If anyone ever bothered to MAKE a slash infitrator or slash nightshade they would have been a feared enemy of the shadowblade.  ESPECIALLY the infiltrator.<br>
<br>
Now, where slash is the desired spec for albion and hibernia.  What you are going to see?  SB's getting destroyed by infiltrators and nightshades.  It's not a fair fight.  It was the reason that sb's killed ns's and inf's before... and it will be the reason that they are killed now that the change has brought things full circle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Herein lies the problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shadowblades have never been very good at killing more armored opponents.  Taking a few of the bulkier ones and making then neutral instead of resistant is not going to make it that much easier, the SB is still going to struggle to kill them.  Add to the fact that the SB is now MUCH easier to kill via other stealthers, of ALL spec lines.....<br>
<br>
<br>
SB's are now the bottom of the Rogue barrel.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the general consensus was... INF&gt;SB&gt;NS.<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
<br>
<br>
INF&gt;&gt;NS&gt;SB<br>
<br>
Infiltrators are happy, they stay on top.<br>
Nightshades are happy, life gets easier.<br>
SB's are nerfed once more.<br>
<br>
<br>
But those facts really don't matter.  Because most everyone here is going to revert to type.  Inf's will say it's justified (they came out fine and can kill sb's ALOT easier).  NS's will say it's pivotal (they got a much needed enhancement).  And noone but the people who PLAY the shadowblade will be upset. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Looking over this thread I see why I haven't posted here in such awhile.  Realisticly, we should really put up three more forums on these boards.  One for sb's, one for inf's, and one for ns's.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is not a rogue forum.  It's collection of the SB forum, Infiltrator forum and the NS forum.  We don't work together.  We work for what benefits our OWN class the most.  Pardon me for thinking we could work together to fix problems of our sister classes.  I guess that only happens before we became &quot;viable&quot;.<br>

But, so far, I'm not overly impressed with the sb's new target 'opportunities'. <br>
At a cost of becoming more vunerable to other-realm assassins, I now have a small chance of killing tanks. It doesn't seem to be a very good chance either since most of the armors are only neutral and not vulnerable to slash. Hibernian scale is the exception; I do believe. <br>
These new targets have high hps, speccable shields, better damage, mez, etc....<br>
I would be more optimistic if the targets were actually vulnerable as chain is to pierce &amp; thrust.<br>
I'm not overly-pessimistic either since I am a very group-oriented cb. And, believe highly in supporting my tanks. I have already witnessed how just one PA on an enemy tank with my poisons have helped a Midgard tank finish him off. Or, before a caster is about to blast my tanks to oblivion,  I punch a big hole through his pretty little nightgown, instead. But, I don't think this helps sb's much when we solo. In fact, it probably hinders us.<br>
I'm willing to try it before I totally have a $&amp;!%! fit. But, it doesn't look overly promising.<br>
Also, I'm not overly sure how happy infs and ns's will be about attacking tanks once melee is finally fixed like it should be(assuming Mythic doesn't screw it up). And, blocks and parries play a more prominent role in RvR.<br>

3) Archer TS (uncontrollable).<br>

--------------------<br>
<br>
All assassins should be on equal footing when it comes to #2, or at least have a development path that puts them on a equal footing if they so choose.<br>
<br>
Being <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> forced</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be underdog in the assassin vs. assassin battle is not right.  SBs are royally screwed by the new &quot;improved&quot; armor resists and any Inf and NS who says otherwise is just looking out for themselves.<br>

Shadowblades got hurt with this patch.  They hit hard CURRENT patch, but with the resists to Hibernian Leather, they are going to notice a severe shift in their survivability rate.<br>

Nah, relieved is more of the term i think Bile was searching for.<br>
