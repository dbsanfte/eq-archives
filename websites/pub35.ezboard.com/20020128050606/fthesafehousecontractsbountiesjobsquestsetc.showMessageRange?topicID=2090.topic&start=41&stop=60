Using Ragebringer primary and Lath Drinor (thanks fine steel dagger look) and standing at the edge of melee range I still have to constantly evade while fighting Klandicar or Zlandicar, when evade changes to only drop me to number 2 or 3 only it is going to be over quick I think.  There are a lot of people starting to leave the game lately due to boredom and or frustration, I am pretty sure if they mess up our class the numbers will drop even more.<br>

It sounds as though those items have been dismissed (for the moment), but the other ones are still being considered. So how is it that fantasies like rogue tracking and locked chests are still on the list, but &quot;no action is expected&quot; on crouching to apply poison and hiding through linkdeath? Surely I'm misreading that somehow, right?<br>
<br>
Since I'm posting, let me make a few random comments... Regarding the &quot;secret handshake&quot;: although this does seem like a bug to me (albeit a well-entrenched bug), I just consider it compensation for the fact that EQ rogues can't steal from vendors. After all, a &quot;real&quot; rogue wouldn't have to worry about whether a shopkeeper liked him, would he?<br>
<br>
I think an earlier speed increase while sneaking is an excellent idea, and lvl 41 is the perfect time for it, since rogues currently have nothing to look forward to but HPs between 40 and 50. I also think that cancellable illusions are essential (why can't all buffs be cancelled, anyway?), and hiding/sneaking across zone borders and linkdeath would be very nice.<br>
<br>
Finally, what ever happened to the ID/BS issue? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aerimus>Aerimus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/19/01 9:59:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2090.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Talk Item List - Absor</span><hr size=1> New Locked Doors...<br>
<br>
Currently there are 2 types<br>
<br>
Unpickable...Doors to areas where verant doesn't want to negate the effort that should be required to get in<br>
<br>
Pickable... Places where a rogue is either required or very helpful, usually with something quite nice behind em<br>
<br>
New doors should be scattered over various dungeons and towns in places like peoples homes (makes sense right) and odd corners and passageways in dungeons (places where you don't really have to go)<br>
These doors should be pickable but should also be able to be opened by force, either magical or brute strength.  Forcing the door should agro mobs in a quite small radius<br>
<br>
The provision that said doors only be in places where you don't have to go is because it would make travel impossible in many places without a rogue if you were not in a group that could fight your way past certain points.  If additional doors were placed at key points you had to move through most hurt would be single players trying to move through invis to join groups in progress.<br>
<br>
Certain important places could be guarded by the new doors but not very many.  Mostly these doors should guard easier routes through dungeons (meaning rogueless groups would have to choose between fighting their way through or taking somewhat more difficult paths)<br>
<br>
This would provide another use for rogues scouting and would provide rogues with an interesting way to train their skill rather than sitting at a door for hours opening and closing it.  <br>
<br>
It would slightly inconvenience others moving through certain areas by requiring them to a) have a rogue b) take a slightly longer or more dangerous route if moving invis c) fight a few mobs at key points<br>
<br>
Would provide a few points were rogues made the trip a lot easier rather than a little (but less so than say HS keys)<br>
<br>
This would be most appropriate in new zones rather than existing ones clearly<br>
<br>
How to do it at each door is an npc that is completely invis, with a few hp, that is social with surrounding mobs but has a small call for help radius, that changes the state of the door when it dies, named door.  Picking the lock would leave the npc but would negate the need to kill it<br>
<br>
What I'd really like to see is all our rogue skills mean something in everyday play in more situations. This is the same reason why rogue hide should require a different spell (gained at the same lvl) to see through it.  This wouldn't prevent casters from seeing rogues but would lessen the % chance that a caster would have a spell up to see a rogue thus making our invis mean something in vs players on a pvp server where 8 of the classes have invis/see invis and the 6 classes (4 of which are in classes that are less played on average) which cannot can get items that allow them to at least see invis <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ulenilya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lenilya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/19/01 11:24:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2090.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Talk Item List - Absor</span><hr size=1> Fletched thorwing weapons...<br>

<br>
Very nice. I look here and seee all they have in store for us are nerfs. We're not THAT strong a class. Believe it or not, Ranger with improved offense, epic, and SoV spells have WAY too much attack potential.<br>
<br>
If by nerfing our evade they mean to reduce our dmg factor by forcing us to control hate. They did well. <br>
<br>
However they've also taken away the want for 2+ more rogue on raid(going by the way nerf was done) and the benefit of them living for more that 1 round of AEdmg often given by those uber encounters. Yes, won't have to worry about evading once you have a dragon AoE and hitting you(loading please wait). Its a good thing rogues have a lot of hp(sarcasm).<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing I did not see addressed was Warrior Taunt.(useless 50+ mobs) They claimed to fix it. (not true)<br>
<br>
Oh well, either evade fails or it succeede and you watch as dragon comes right back to you when other rogue evades. Meanwhile the warriors have benefit of waiting for their turn while the dragon finishes his rogue salad. <p><br><br><center><font size=+2><b><font color=#990000>D</font>ynn <font color=#990000>M</font>c<font color=#990000>B</font>ane</font></b><br><i><a href="http://eqforge.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=3513">Blackguard</a> of <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/bcognatus">Cognatus</a><br>

More to come in the form of MILD enhancements and fixes.<br>
<br>
You also have to remember that the rogue class had been getting nothing but positive attention in regards to tuning since release, while other classes getting a lot of things lately got little or no tuning before.  <br>
<br>

<br>
<i>Five percent less experience required to level than any other class besides warriors.</i><br>
<br>
...which, until 2 patches ago (I think that's right, so many patches, so many months) was a disadvantage, as we recieved less of a share of the xp while in groups ^^<br>
<br>
<i>D isciplines added.</i><br>
<br>
And only 3 are really useful.  Nimble, (Counterattack is useless due to the high recycle time), Deadeye (until we get duellist), and Duellist.  You could remove all the other disc's from our list, and i'd never notice.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Monks- Voiddance (immunity to melee damage, from all sides), Stone stance (fast recharge rate, good damage reduction), also have the duellist style disc as Innerflame.<br>
<br>
Warriors- Defensive (what can i say?  this is the reason that Velious mobs are able to be killed.  You are REQUIRED to use warriors to tank Velious ubers), Fortitude (again, complete immunity to melee damage), also have the duellist style disc with Fell Strike (and additional methods of dealing a lot of damage fast with Mighty strike, Charge, and agressive/precision)<br>
<br>
So, it's not like rogues really got some huge advantage. Duellist is kinda fun for the uber stabs, but it's hardly as class defining as Defensive, or the pulling tools that monks have, stonestance and void dance.  Imho, Rogues would have greatly benefitted by a discipline along the lines of agressive or precision, where we deal 30% more damage over the next 3 mins, but take more damage if we screw up too.<br>
<br>
<i>Pick Pockets level cap raised.</i><br>
<br>
And strangely, it's no where near to what it used to be...  We should still be able to pick magic items off of mobs, with certain mobs being flagged as un-pickable, and also unable to pick no drop items.<br>
<br>
<i>Poisons revamped.</i><br>
<br>
And are still nearly totally worthless due to their implimentation. Muscle lock poisons are a joke, they wear off nearly as soon as you use them, and at 10 plat a pop, not including failures... Most poisons worth anything require hours and hours of camping greens that no one camps, so we can't buy the components off of players, we have to spend all that time ourselves.  And for what? there are very few good poisons, and no poisons are good enough to require hours and hours of tedium.  I challenge anyone to go out and get a stack of 20 heartsting scorpion venoms. haha, especially without tracking ^^<br>
<br>
<br>
And for all that, while all those items are improvements, the rogue class also had the furthest to go to become a "viable" class in EQ.  Come on, I would have a hard time believing that even Kendrick forgets this.  While the rogue class has seen a lot of positive attention, the only 3 really big things are: Evade (now nerfed by a fair amount), Increased damage tables, Sneak/hide improvements.  For all the griping that you see rangers do, Rangers started out incredibly butch.  They just didn't see any upgrades, while warriors/paladins/SK's got bonuses, and paladins/SK's soon fell by the wayside, not as badly in kunark as is true in velious though.  Defensive is too necessary a tool when you consider mobs quadding for 850's, and normal blue mobs hitting for 180-250's.  Heh, nothing surprises you more than Assassinating a mob that's hitting the tank for 170's (icewall dwarves).<br>
<br>
Again, not saying that rogues needed improvement, but we don't deserve to get crapped on either.  We were balanced compared to what other classes were, not what they will become. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ul0z.showPublicProfile?language=EN>L0z</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/lozdarogue/Rbsmall.JPG BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 2/26/01 8:45:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cylant>Cylant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/26/01 10:34:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2090.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Talk Item List - Absor</span><hr size=1> to say it frankly.. i think all we really wanted was something new and fun to screw around with.

<br>
We really did get cool stuffs and good improvements, but not as much as others. It's really a great thing hybrids get disciplines, but the way I saw it, Velious brought us, monks and warriors nothing new in the abilities department. i don't count the fearless and resist discipline, because they are just toys for the lower levels to play with, as if to say, 'see? we gave you stuff before level 50'. It would have been nice to add something that really fits our class. What about some discipline that allow us to pick pocket magic items (but not nodrop) of mobs? with a high reuse time and it wouldn't work on some mobs? or one that would allow us to sneak and hide even past see invis mobs? That would belong only to us. I'm sure we could find other stuff like that, and I don't think it is that unbalancing. It all depends on the reuse time and the time it would last.<br>
<br>
i agree that all those things Kendrik said were done for us, but when you look at the real use of them, rogues barely use one quarter of them. you can always make a huge list of enhancement, taking all the fixes of what was broken in the past, and it's good it was done, but it doesn't mean it's enough, nor that nothing else should/could be done...<br>
<br>
Just my opinion...<br>
<br>
See you in game everyone (even though I barely play lately)<br>

<br>
*** ENTER A WARP ZONE ***<br>
We are now 2 years back in time,VI is developping a game called Everquest,some screenshots had been released and all the ones who didn't have the luck to live in the U.S to participate to the beta are drooling patiently,waiting for them to &quot;finish&quot; their game...<br>
<br>
The game is about 90% finished (please don't start a debate about the % :P),we are now in Beta IV,hundreds of thousands people are waiting for this game...But it's so huge..there are so many things to do...VI asks for more time.<br>
<br>
Big boss o'Sony says : &quot;No,too much $ in game,release the game,you ll patch what s missing later&quot;<br>
<br>
You bet,rogues were the one who needed that time...But as I previously said the game is huge,there are lots of bugs to patch...Rogues get forgotten (at this time only a few play this class anyway).<br>
<br>
After that,ya know the story...Safehouse created,it's getting bigger and bigger,there is a beginning of &quot;Rogue lobby&quot;.From time to time Abashi comes here to post some stuff (he quicky gets flammed so threads are often locked),a mysterious man named Kendrick posts some sreenshots of him with 8 tinkerer's bag (eh,I am still shocked,even if this is pretty common now) and says &quot;hmmm,ebonsting is great,still need few little tweaks,but it kicks ass&quot; (As far as I remember,half of the safehouse went mad looking for this weapon at this time).<br>
<br>
<br>
Then the Rogues enhancements starts,we are getting RS armor,evade,new poisons,few new piercier(woohoo !! Eyerazzia ! A rapier !)...I think the waves of Rogue twinks started to appear at this time and went bigger with the arrival of Kunark (most of them looked down at by the &quot;old shool rogues&quot; because they didn t have to work as hard as they did to raise to the top)<br>
<br>
So the question is : did all those enhancements were added after the game as a bonus to the Rogues of were they just a balance issue to an unfinished class ? <br>
<br>
Kendrick,your list isn't &quot;good&quot;,it's truely the shame of verant who has forgotten a class for so long.<br>
<br>
Now I can say what I want : a natural poison resist getting higher with lvls (just all like warriors with they natural RM),locked chests with random treasures and a full set of black leather,even if it has a crappy AC and no stats.<br>
<br>
If you read this to the end,it must be patch day isn't ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There will be more stuff coming.<br>
<br>
Hybrids were long overdue for some tuning and they finally got it.  They'll get more, especially the bards.<br>
<br>
The game isn't going to die in the next 3 months folks.  It's going to be a long-haul game just like UO is.  It's going to be around for years.  Relax and give the rather large development team a chance to get everything going.<br>
<br>
The game is getting progressively better.  The insane number of people buying, playing and keeping with it are a testament to that.<br>
<br>
Don't forget the Pendulum effect.  When something needs to be fixed the natural tendency is to overfix it.  This eventually gets adjusted to an underfix and they finally work their way to just right.<br>

PS:  The Evade change still baffles me.  It looked SO BAD on paper and yet I'm not dying any more than I used to.  I might get hit 5-10% more than before and even on Trak raids and similar level encounters I'm surviving as often as anyone else is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2090.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2090.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2090.topic&start=61&stop=63>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2114.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2125.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2090.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2090.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2090.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2090.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2090.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
