--nifty thing not in magic items, which I have few of, and the big one I do have is flawed.  My favorite aspect our my personal spells, and the fact that my GM lets me use old 2nd edition wild magic modifications.. so that my spells are often surging, and fluxuation in power/effect. hehe.. often as not I blow up my own party members as my enemies..haha. <br>
Favorite spell- Flame Geyser- 2nd level spell.<br>
Long range.  possible targets withing a 20ft radius, randomly determined, though caster picks the point of orgin.  1 geyser, plus one per 2levels over 3rd (same formula as magic missle).<br>
Geysers of fire erupt from the ground, and encase a random target in the AoE for 1d4/caster level of fire dmg (max 10d4).  No matter how many geysers you can generate, a target can only be affected by one geyser. if less targets in area than geysers, extra geysers are lost.  Affects friends or foes within the area of effect. 1 action cast time.  Counts as a Wild magic spell, though 3rd edition dosent technically cover that yet<br>

-Bob the Janitor(Incinerator to some): Porn-loving no longer visionary with a taste for fire when dealing with those that creep in the night.  Mainly just doesn't bother hunting unless the quarry is bothering him. He's been through some hell.  Cleaved a vampire with a half full bedpan while he was in the hospital (Hey scooby doo was on and he couldn't hear it with the fighting and what not) and did a brief stint with mr. t which resulted in the burning of a good portion of the business district of Hannibal, Missouri (in our campaign he's imbued but he ran off after meeting a technocrat.  Poor guy cracked). The Technocrat was hell as well.  Ended up destroying the hummer Bob &quot;borrowed&quot; from mr. t and survived being blown up with primacord, plastique, dynamite added with a chain gun.  Ended up getting killed by his own self destruct in his vehicle.  Bob is now on Hiatus<br>
<br>
-Father Thomas: New Judge Hunter who is a Methodist Preacher.  Burden is fun.  Ghoul in Forklist coming at me full speed. Burden Dodge.  Forklift + Wall = i win<br>
<br>
-Loki: 8th gen Gangrel.  Street urchin embraced at the young age of 14 (no merit, he looks old enough to pass for a teen).  Pretty ferocious considering I can almost solo werewolves if i get initiative.  3 war ghouls is another story. ^_^  1 month of torpor at the moment<br>
<br>
-(Nameless): 9th gen Tzimisce.  Started him and introduced a few characters when i DMed a session of vamp.  Going to be involved with a strange branch of independent tzimisce who seem like some sort of bloody medieval inquisition.  He walks around in a cape, boiled leather armor and a huge modified battle axe with a nice little contraption i invented to up the damage by 1 die.<br>
<br>
D&amp;D 2ed<br>
<br>
-Sander: 20th level paladin (Ravenloft Monster Hunter kit: demons).  Unfortunately he was buffed up to 17 before I started him to get in with an older group. But through wits and ingenuity he's found interesting uses for dragon horn armor and has quested for a holy avenger. Tower full of demons just to find out where the dang thing was then i get it handed to me by an old lady. The GM was playing headgames with me for 20 minutes.  I was all paranoid going in to her house and going downstairs just to find it wrapped in cloth in a box &gt;_&lt;. I'll need it though.  Upcoming games will include a cult of dragon worshippers who like to make dracoliches (we've faced one of their elder red drag ones with little success) and we also have an evil party including a dark knight wielding an unholy avenger.

<br>
Emmet McKrakker - Unseelie <a href="http://www.geocities.com/drmorganes/study/changeling/kiths.html">Nocker</a> with a passion for technology.  Of all my characters, Emmet is most like me - down to the penchant for the liberal use of, erm, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    colorful metaphors</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> when speaking.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Dungeons and Dragons:</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     Kehvrynne Quickblade</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (2E) - Elf Thief/mage with Player's Option.  Kehv was raised in a human city by an old fisherman.  She can cast spells while wearing armor, has a quick-cast bonus, and disdains the use of certain schools of magic (i.e., she cannot learn Necromancies, Abjurations, or Conjurations).  She is a connsumate thief and uses magic to complement her clandestine activities.  Her spell books contain spells like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Item</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Sleep</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (good for taking care of guards without killing them), <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Audible Glamour</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Alter Self</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (A dark-haired human male with a scarred face stole your prized widget?  How terrible!  I'll be sure to keep an eye open for the varlet.  This?  Oh, it's nothing.  Nothing at all...), and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Rope Trick</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Kehv refuses to kill to acquire wealth, and knows very few combat-type spells (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Magic Missile</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is NOT among her repitoire).  For her, it's about the challenge of the job.  She'll break into a king's bedchamber and steal a lock of hair from the back of his neck - and consider the job a failure if she is forced to get physical with so much as a guard dog.<br>
<br>
Kehv is quick with a joke and equally quick to put a dagger to someone's neck (she has has no qualms about hurting others in self-defense - she just won't kill for wealth).  She loves the water and will take any excuse to swim.  She is comfortable with herself, her sex, and her body, and has no problem stripping down and diving in.  Woe betide the cad who takes her nudity for an invitation, however.  Kehvrynne wears a long-bladed dirk strapped to her forearm at all times; she won't hesitate to protect her virtue with cold steel.  <br>
<br>
Jokath, her adoptive father, makes his living telling stories and giving tattoos by the wharf of the port city of Anthar-by-Silversea.  The old man is often consigned by the warmage Madrygal to embed mystical symbols in his skin for later enchantment.  To that end, Madrygal gifted Jonnal with a set of enchanted inks and quills.  Tattoos crafted with these items will never fade and will reform scarless should the skin be cut (that is, they cannot be permanently damaged by cuts).  Kehvrynne has acquired her foster father's taste for body decoration, and sports several of these enchanted drawings.  Her back is covered by a crimson, black, and gold octopus whose legs twine around her torso, twin dolphins chase each other in a circle around her navel, a stream of silvery bubbles rising toward her breasts, and a reef scene of multi-colored coral and rainbow-hued fish plays on her right thigh.<br>
<br>
Kehv is built like a typical wood elf - short, slight but more powerfully built than other elvish sub-races.  She keeps her straight, copper-colored hair cut in a short bob.  Her eyes are green, and turn a brilliant emerald when she is angry (or aroused).  She favors loose-fitting peasant-type clothing, the better to hide the dirk on her arm and the lockpicks strapped to the inside of her thigh.  Kehvrynne is an accoplished seamstress, and augments her clothing with delicate needlework - and small, secret pockets.  Her ears are pierced thirteen times on a side, decorated with small good hoops and studs.  She wears a small clay ocarina around her neck, and may often be enticed to play.<br>
<br>
She suffers from nightmares of the night she was orphaned by a party of marauding orcs.<br>
<br>
(Kehv is my favorite (though the least like me), but I'm guessing that's obvious.  When I get around to porting her to E3, she'll be a thief/sorceror.  I like the idea of her magical abilities being natural rather than the result of study.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     Aubrec</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (no surname) (2E) - Sylvan Elf warmage with Player's Option.  Aubrec has dedicated his life to combat.  His player's kit includes the ability to cast while in armor, the ability to wear leather armor, combat and hit dice as a thief (d6 for hit points instead of d4, better combat tables), quick casting (-1 to all spell casting times).  In trade for increased melee abilities, Aubrec's knowledge of magic is very focused toward damage output. (I don't recall the schools other than Invocation/Evocation.  There are only one or two others.)  His spells are all re-formulated to include no material components - and he prefers spells requiring only verbal components.  Aubrec takes full advantage of his lord's financial resources to select a signiture spell each level (a fast-casting, verbal-component combat spell like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Magic Missile</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Lance of Disruption</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->).  In return for this support, Aubrec has accepted a Geas: he may neither sleep in the same bed twice nor enter a stone dwelling without invitation, lest his magic cease to function for a year and a day.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Failend firch Brionoch ap Scathach</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Human ranger, built loosely around a Celtic warrior theme.  She's tall (just over 6' 1&quot;) and very, very strong.  I've not spent a lot of time with her, and so don't know her very well.   <p>Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br>

<br>
The only thing I regret at the moment is the +2 character level due to being a drow... The minor spells are of less use than they were in 2nd edition. Spell resistance has saved my ass once though.<br>
<br>
But, on the other hand, this is my character that once did 20 some damage with a ray of frost (double crit and sneak attack). Not to mention the odd criticals I'll get now and then when I use a normal old crowbar. Quite useful... use one to break into a place, blunt damage against skeletons, and not always regarded as a weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucikalatherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CikalaTheRogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/12/02 7:20:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What are your current characters?</span><hr size=1> Meep <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucikalatherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CikalaTheRogue</A> at: 4/30/02 2:18:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustylx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stylx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/15/02 7:40:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What are your current characters?</span><hr size=1> in 3rd edition i play a human fighter 5, ranger 1, cleric of tempus 1. <br>
<br>
He wields a spiked shield, and a +2 battle axe of frost. has feats such as two-weapon fighting, shield expertese, extra turning, divine might, divine vigor, ambidexterity, improved initiative, specialization in battle axe, and some other stuff i can't remember now. <br>
<br>
He's a defender of the party. Basically i absorb most of the attacks and i heal myself. I can use my turning attempts per day as a constution/hp/speed buff that lasts 10mins that essentially heals my level in hps in 10mins, or increase my damage per hit by +3 for 3 rounds.<br>
<br>
i also gather the attention to let the party's monk/rogue, sniper type archer, psyon, and summoner to deal the main damage. <br>
<br>
I also took all the skills that deal with dealing with people and leading. so my char is a natural leader and diplomat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uorcmauler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orcmauler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 10:28:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What are your current characters?</span><hr size=1> am i the only one who absolutley hated 3rd ed?<br>

It goes without saying that he's a swashbuckling devil both figuratively and literally.<br>
<br>
Unlike traditional rogues, I don't get into the whole traps/locks thing. As a swashbuckler, he specializes in fencing type weaponry (with weapon finesse to use dex over strength), acrobatic and fast talking skills. <br>
<br>
Jack got his start under 2nd edition rules, originally as a half-elven Fighter/thief, later becoming a swashbucker kit single class rogue. No matter what the specifics all were rapier wielding charmers who prefered overcoming challenges with speed, style and wit than strength of arms.<br>

<br>
The tiefling thing was a bit of a natural progression. One part of Jack's personna was that he had some blood that 'wasn't quite human' but rather than hide it, he played it up for flamboyance value in various ways. Back a few decades ago there were no tieflings, and half-elves fit that role quite nicely. But in later years, Half elves are fairly common, and well...what can I say..horns and a tail are fun. <br>

<br>
*grin*<br>
<br>
Khev - funny thing, the 3rd. edition Khev sounds so familair...  *wink wink* I've actually been planning on doing the same thing with Regio, dual-classing into a sorceror. Any idea where our GM for that game went?<br>
<br>
Current characters played:<br>
<br>
D&amp;D 3rd Ed.<br>
<br>
Regio D'Arnell - Human Rogue, barely 1st level. (This guy turned out freakishly tall, for some reason - rolled 1&quot; short of max height) <br>
High on Dex and Cha, and as mentioned before, eventually he'll be a sorceror as well. Defintely your do-it-all sort of rogue, but more of an emphasis on smooth talking and sleight-of-hand than down-and-dirtiness. Going to be fun, if he can stay out of trouble ; )<br>
<br>
Vampire, Dark Ages<br>
<br>
Kaarl Bratovich - Tzimisce revenant Ghoul, recently turned.<br>
Strange thing, he acts like a rogue, as well, but much more of a bouty hunter than a social interactor. 6th generation, and one scary S.O.B. <br>
<br>
Shadowrun<br>
<br>
Logan - Blatant PhysAd (Physical Adept) based rip-off of Wolverine, and one of my all-time favorite characters to RP. Human, with all of the tricks. Our DM had a thing for PhysAds, and let us earn feats mimicing cyberware for a similar point cost. One of my longest-lived characters, a real achievement in our play-by-mail group made up of college friends. Had trolls, then bridges, then bridges WITH trolls dropped or thrown at him... Only crewmember that's been around as long is our chicken-#^%$ decker who won't leave his basement ; )<br>
<br>
We'll get into past characters later...  Great topic ; )<br>
<br>

What my group plays is....<br>
<br>
Human Decker (8 yr old character, lotsa assets)<br>
Human Detective (upgraded with a lil cyberware after a successful run) <br>
Human Mage (initiate lvl 1)<br>
Human Adept (Kung Fu base)<br>
Human Street Sam (young girl look with troll stats)<br>
<br>
All but the Decker are new to ShadowRun yet love the game and we have a blast each week.  The Decker is turning to a more offensive character each run and the Detective will replace him as the electronics guy soon it seems.<br>
<br>
The Mage is finding out that magic in SR is very powerful, but if you fail a resist roll, you be hurtin!  The Street Sam is finding it a bit slow to just shoot and take hits, so she is lookin at a more in depth character since she knows the game a bit more now.<br>
<br>
As for personal charactes, my oldest(8 years or so) is a Elven Mage/Cleric, lvl 20(or higher depending on the GM <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) in both classes.  Been through about 6 GMs, some of them very realistic and others not so(i have items/powers I refuse to use, even though I was &quot;granted&quot; them by powerGM types).  Best fun with his has been when he teams with the above mentioned Deckers &quot;Fire Elementalist&quot;.  All I can say is, StoneSkin and FireShield together are fun!  We have had some fun times with those two!<br>
