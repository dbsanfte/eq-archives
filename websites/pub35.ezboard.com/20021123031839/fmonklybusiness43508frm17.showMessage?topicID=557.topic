First, you and I know none of you are going to quit.  You and I know that most of you will buy PoP.  You and I know that any disruptive protest will lead to bans and bad opinions of us as Monks.  So, what does this all mean?  <br>
<br>
Well, I don't like the changes.  It's a nerf that really wasn’t needed and was probably imposed to shut plate classes, warriors and 1 or 2 specific assholes up.  It was supposed to nerf the uber high end Monk, but didn't.  It changed the game for a lot of us and it was also very unclear as to what exactly was done.  And it’s this lack of clarity that is probably the hardest pill to swallow, not the actual nerf itself.<br>
<br>
So we can either find a way to all voice our opinions in one well thought out way that speaks from all Monks, or we can piss bitch and moan and get nothing constructive done (what we are currently doing).<br>
<br>
I'd suggest:<br>
<br>
1.  Sending a well thought out and brief /feedback every time you log on.  Not a %&amp;* you VI you %$#@ing nerfed me I quit.<br>
<br>
2.  Getting one thread together and hashing out questions and ideas and writing it up in a letter for Verant from all Monks.<br>
<br>
3.  Just shutting the fuck up and not make things any worse for ourselves.  <br>
<br>
I for one wound rather keep a cool head, work the issue out and try and get a resolution, rather then bitch and offer not positive alternate feedback.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion and some suggestions.  I fully expect the cry baby nerf screamer Monks to flame me.  I've been a Monk for 3 years, made 60, oodles of aa's and Epic.  I'd rather go out with some dignity then surrounded by a pack of peers wetting their diapers and not using their heads.<br>

This nerf was brought about by a small group of people making well stated arguments.  If we as a community do the same thing, i'm shure that a solution could be reached. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=synal31>Synal31</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/23/02 1:07:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suggestions about Monk nerfs and getting some answers.</span><hr size=1> Well said, and here is a very valid arguement to add to it all.  Its been said before, but it should be said over and over.<br>
<br>
VI had a nerf lined up for Paladin's Slay Undead.  They backed off and did not go through with the nerf because it was suppose to be aimed at the top 5% of Pally's and it was not balanced across the board for all Pally's.<br>
<br>
VI had a nerf lined up for Monks mitigation.  They did not back off and went through with it.  The nerf was brought on by the top 1% 'ultra uber' Monks who were tanking high end mobs.  VI implements the nerf and it does almost NOTHING to effect the top 1% of Monks and reams the bottom 99%.<br>
<br>
It doesn't make sense. It doesn't add up.  VI needs to rethink their game plan. <p>~Synal Munkeybrayns<br>

It's impossible to conclude that they are idiots, because the game truly *is* a technical and artistic marvel.<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, despite their stated aim for the nerf, their <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>actual</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> aim was to cripple a monk's soloing and exp-group-tanking ability.<br>
<br>
In that, they were very successful.  I know that I, a level 60 monk with 50+ AAs and 1200+ AC, have basically given up on actually soloing as an even remotely viable alternative to grouping.  On top of that, my ability to contribute to a group by filling in as the tank was severely impacted as well.<br>
<br>
And damage?  /ooc Group LF rogue<br>
<br>
I truly feel for the monks lesser-equipped than me considering the impact that I have felt, and can only imagine the pain that it must be to be a 45-55 monk right now.<br>

That is why I started a petition regarding VI's lack of follow through in explaining the nerf and why it happened to begin with. I would like to think that if enough people (monks) spoke out and signed off on the petition we may be able to pass that along to a higher power and get some resolution. I will not sit here and piss and moan about the changes and how if has effected my happiness as well as the majority of Monks in Eq. and how &quot;I'm gonna quit&quot; and all that. If people really care about what happened you will be cool headed, patient, assertive, and with  a little luck maybe we can get something going. Don't forget people w/o us (paying customers) there nothing, not to say that we should all quit or anything like that but I will tell you one thing the customer always comes first. To be totally honest imagine if 1000 monk playing characters actually quit they would loose say $12.99 monthly? That a measly $12,999.00 a month they may loose for ruining a class and taking away people's happiness. I think there are more than 1000 monk playing people in Eq (of course /bonk) so you guys crunch the ##'s.. So in short go sign your name on the link Called Why not start a petition and lets see the turn-out maybe it will help. Otherwise just shut up and start a caster cause there dam near the same now!!

Anyone else think that the only way to cap all your skills each level is if you are tanking and betting beat on?

<br>
This doesn't really make sense.  I don't see how one can discover someone deserved something bad that happened to them based on their reaction AFTER the bad thing has been done to them.<br>
<br>
I mean, do parents wash their children's mouths out with soap BEFORE or AFTER they curse?  If you just decided to wash their mouths out with soap, then they asked &quot;What the f**k was that for?&quot; and then you say &quot;See, he deserved it!&quot; that's not a far way to determine if someone deserved the treatment they got IMO.<br>
<br>
So monks deserve this nerf because AFTER the nerf was implemented some of them haven't taken it so well?  And who knew monks would act this way BEFORE the nerf was implemented, apparently clairvoyant to the fact that monks would act so bitter/upset.<br>
<br>
I'm just tired of people trying to use monk's reactions to this nerf as evidence that they deserved it.<br>
<br>
This is taking it to an extreme, but after the US retaliated for the attacks of 9/11, and wiped out a large percentage of their forces/bases, I guess Al Qaeda can say &quot;see, look how they responded, they deserved it&quot;.  No, that would make no sense.  <br>
<br>
Not to even begin to compare this with the 9/11 attacks though, as that would be very disrespectful, which I certainly don't want to portray any disrespect for those involved.  I just wanted to make a point how what you said makes no sense, and I've heard it from quite a number of people. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skewert>Skewert</A> at: 10/25/02 12:54:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kratetheswifttail>Krate The Swift Tail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/28/02 11:05:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> I'm saying that with the attitudes displayed, fixing the nerf seems imposible.

The mitigation nerf can't be made any worse by drawing VI's attention to it, what CAN happen is they realise they need to rebalance monks to fix the things they have broken with the mitigation nerf. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fopoodzo@monklybusiness43508>Fopoodzo</A> at: 10/28/02 11:33:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=buhd>Buhd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 540<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/28/02 11:28:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what could they</span><hr size=1> I know I personally couldnt have reacted any more negatively than I did.

Did our reaction make a difference? Who the fuck knows !VI/SOE seems to still be too busy gobbling Furors knob to answer their own fucking paying customers.<br>
<br>
Basically my EQ fees are like a taxes to me now, I fucking hate paying them.<br>
<br>
I sent in civil email and so on and still they are assholes with nothing to say to me.<br>
<br>
No matter what, they were never gonna say shit to us about this nerf, bottom line. Our first thread left them no where to go even if they did feel chatty. <br>
<br>
We called them exactly-balls-on-accurate that they would miss the target and further benefit the ubers and hurt the average. <br>
<br>
We knew where they got their source info, Furor, basically they had nothing they could come here and say and not look like asshats. <br>
<br>
So they may as well say nothing and let us think they are asshats, cuz if they said anything here it would only prove their fuctardation.<br>
<br>
Now I dont know any of them personally, they are probably swell folks, but as a dev team they are turds, from my perspective. Atleast I used to respect their willingness to face their own music..they are fraid of us..hehe<br>

Well, lets see, how did the Druids take their recent 'Harmony' nerf?<br>
<br>
Not too well, from what I read on EQ Druids.<br>
<br>
How did the Paladins take the news of their impending Undead Damage nerf to their AA abilities when it was announced?<br>
<br>
Not too well either.<br>
<br>
Gee, what STOPPED the Druids and Paladins from going further with their Rants?<br>
<br>
OFFICIAL WORD FROM VI WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THESE CLASSES RESPECTIVE NERFS/ANNOUNCEMENT OF IMPENDING NERF.<br>
<br>
Did VI answer ANY of the more reasonable Monks inquires regarding what the nerf would entail? Gee Wizards, Mages, uids and Paladins got a fairly EXACT staement of just what was being done/contemplated; whereas the Monks got a VERY VAGUE statement.  I also venture to guess that had VI posted here, OR SOMEWHRERE with a further clarification of what was being planned for Monks within 24 hours of the inititial announcement (much like what was done for Druids and Paladins); you wouldn't have seen such a further explosion of such ranting posts.<br>

#1  Top 1% of monks who were the desired target weren't effect?<br>
<br>
That is a total misconception.  Ofcourse it effected them.  More so than you even know.  The mobs those top %1 are fighting are putting our way more damage than the rest of the mobs the other monks are fighting.  It's just that those monks have worked too hard and too long to let it get in the way of what they are doing.  It's called adjusting.<br>

<br>
This is another misconception.  I am still able to solo.  It's more difficult but still definately a viable alternative to grouping.  Look at my magelo I compare very closely to the specs you just stated, well with about 50 more aa ofcourse.  Nonetheless, I still solo effectively, just not as effective as before.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It's called adapting and improvising.<br>
<br>
I hate that we got nerfed, it sucks BUT... if you think this set back is going to make me quit my monk or even quit what I have been doing up until now, you are insane.  I'll just work harder, gain more gear, and levels / aas to make up for it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Keep working monk brothren.  With more aas and levels, we will surely be returned to our former greatness.  Infact, even beyond.<br>

How bout you talk to the multiboxers that don't play on the same field you do and not try to discount my opinion because I am an all-star running back.<br>

I feel the effects of the nerf the same as everyone else.  The difference is that I found ways to compensate to make it bearable.  <br>

I'm just suggesting you should too.<br>

           If you really want to see how the Monk nerf affects 'average folks' spend a night Tanking and pulling with your unbuffed AC at 1090, and unbuffed HP around 2400 HP.<br>
<br>
Then go out and get some average buffs (Heroic Bond, Naltrons Mark, Bulwark of Faith, Talisman of the Cat, Talisman of the Brute, Some sort of Regen); and THEN come back and talk about how the average Monk is affected.<br>
<br>
At 1300+ unbuffed AC a LOT LESS 'adjustment' is required. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.catplex.org/chilau/chilau_fk5.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Master Monk of the 59th Order - The Nameless Server</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Fighting around Karnors in DL before the patch I was able to pull and tank briefly until the Warrior (or other taunter) was able to get agro.  I would do this because I have mend so I would just lose enough hp that I could mend or regen back to save the healer some mana. In some cases of short fights I would just tank the entire time. Most of the time when I did this, I actually took less damage then the actual plate classes in my group. Sure I have about 1050 ac which is near what most of them had, but alot of them I could tell were bitter that I could outdamage them and tank better then them.<br>
<br>
After the patch, I pull and FD until I lose agro so I don't get beaten to a pulp.  Ravishing Drovlargs take me down faster then the cleric can ask &quot;is mend up, or should I ch?&quot;  Of course the plate classes in my groups seem ammused that I get beat into iksar monk pudding while feigning curses at verrant for nerfing us. If you visit any warrior forum I'm sure prior to the patch you can see the rants and raves about us tanking well, which probably is ultimately why we got nerfed in the first place.  <br>
<br>
A suggestion to maybe alter or at least alleviate parts of the nerf, or maybe even get us some added abilities would to let Verrant know about them.  They want happy paying customers above all, so if they know tons of monk players are mad and have stated their case with reason and logic, rather then with curses and rants maybe something will happen.  I'm not saying that they will remove this nerf, but maybe they will increase our damage output to compensate.  If you notice now, Rangers can tank and in some cases out damage monks now which is just plain not acceptable.  I am willing to concede the tanking, them being chain classes and all, but out damaging monks? geeshe *looks around for something to kick*<br>
