<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104344">A quick sample of my profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
The AC is probably a bit low, maybe the HPs too, but I am at work so I can't double check. The equipment and resists are correct however.  Yes I know I should be getting my epic, I'm working on it!<br>
<br>
As you can see I have been getting HP gear, and have a pretty (minus a fungi) decent droppable set, but my resists are pretty ordinary.  With SoS proc, my MR hits 77, but I was getting mezzed or slowed a bit in Sebilis, more so with a shammy in the group dishing out HoS (doesn't stack with Major Shielding). Now it seems with the resist changes, my current equipment will be a liability when it comes to resisting slows, ice comets and whatever else those froggies sling at me.<br>
<br>
Has the value of resist gear just gone up big time?  Should the focus for monks equipping themselves with general use droppable gear such as myself switch from chasing HPs big time to finding more balanced equipment?  Will the extra HPs still be the best move? Or is it a case of situational resist equipment use depending on where you have to go?  Early days yet I know, but some initial thoughts would be appreciated.  Should also probably be in the equipment forum, but as the changes are new I think it's probably more important that more people see and voice their opinions.<br>
<br>
Best example I can think of is the Clattering Bone Necklace - did the bonus it gave in hit points just get negated by the resist changes, in favour of the Dragon Tooth Choker?<br>

<br>
it seems that real level advantages were supposed to help with this patch, ie droga and dalnir should become easy for 50+ etc.<br>
(easy to get yourself killed there if your not careful)<br>
<br>
if its how they want it, then quite possibly resist gear will become important, id say wait alittle while, at least till after a few emergency patches.<br>

<br>
The only thing I can say about resists is that ever since Hoshkar, I have done whatever it took to put together a 250+(buffed) suit of each resist for situational fights. I considered this part of building a complete character. Just like zone keys and class gear staples. /shrug Granted, this is from a raider's perspective. Well, ex-raider now.<br>

I'm very glad now that I bothered.

Had 132MR with GRM up, resists for fire and cold were in the 110-120 range with druid buffs up, DR &amp; PR around 80-90.<br>
<br>
Shamen were slowing me maybe one cast in 4 with that setup,  whereas I was getting slowed about that rate before with MR at 63.  Still, not as bad as I thought it might be.  Mobs were dispelling a LOT more than usual though, stripping off any resist buffs you might have.  Poison nukes were landing pretty heavily, and disease based DoTs every one in 3 casts.<br>
<br>
Wizzies were nasty, they were landing Entombment of Ice on me 1 in 2 times at that resist level, when they wouldn't touch me with it before with CR at 67.  Ice Comet landed for full probably 1 in every 3 times.<br>
<br>
I had a good group, so we weren't seriously in any danger, but the camp was considerably harder than it used to be due to casters being much more dangerous.  Without the druid buffs, it would have been even more nasty I am sure.  At one stage the 52 cleric overhealed though, got agro and a frog wizzy made short work of here with 2 ICs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umyotis20.showPublicProfile?language=EN>myotis20</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(9/5/02 11:24:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=306.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myhome.hanafos.com/~myotis/image/lotusj3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Resists changes and what it means to the average monk</span><hr size=1> while I was camping for my alt druid's for corrupted goblin in Lake Rathetear, it seems you get nuked by full amount even by green mobs if you don't gear up with rez gears/buffs..<br>

I was immediately Malosini'd or whatever they cast, slowed, double DoTed, and continuously nuked to hell.  I managed to resist maybe 1 or 2 nukes during the fight and got down to 7% hp a few times.  Before the patch, I could have soloed both of these at the same time.  This made me furious.  We came to the entrance to crypt and there was a knight and enchanter guarding it.  I pulled them both again figuring that my MR was decent and chanters never got anything on me...Sure enough, I was tashed and charmed before the chanter got back to the group.  I stayed charmed the entire time till both mobs were killed.<br>

I was so pissed I almost cancelled my account then and there.  Luckily, once we got inside, there were very few casters and I had a good time which made up for the hassle of getting there.
