Read Kendricks posts more often, after he did the PoH revamp AKA Floor 2, people were complaining loudly about the pathing up there(wonder why? ^_~) and he commented that the zone files would have to be completely redone to fix the pathing issues since the person who did the original geometry completely FUBAR'ed how to make zones with multiple floors or something along that lines.<br>
<br>
So maybe when Planes of Power releases there will be an updated version of Hate with a bit nicer pathing, but I wouldn't expect a pathing fix until then at the earliest...<br>

<br>
Who's to say who uses these things or not?  It's debatable whether they lead to as extreme advantage as this gimp is whining about.<br>
<br>
Personally if the GM's did their @#%$ job and took action against exploiters and the testing department did their @#%$ job and found bugs and the programmers did their @#%$ job and fixed bugs without @#%$ over bards in general every other @#%$ patch maybe you wouldnt get gimps like this whining about bugs and nerfs like a @#%$ moron.<br>
<br>
Personally I dont use bugs like this, its not worth 280+ days played on my bard.  If people use exploits they take the risks and if they are caught action should be taken.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to note that many of this whiners so called exploits do not work to my knowledge most if not all of those were fixed.  DS stacking has also been worked out on test.  I know a guild that was warned for using the WW exploit before, they were threatened with banning and disbanding, think they will use that again?<br>
<br>
In summary, it IS due to the fact that VI breaks bards every @#%$ patch that many people dont want this @#%$ whined about and NOT because people exploit regularly.  If they do exploit it's their business and their account(s) to lose so quit being a nerf whiner and play your own @#%$ game thx. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uziann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ziann</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/8/02 2:49:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugnomeeater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gnome Eater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/8/02 5:57:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> It is debatable whether your IQ is over 0 or not...

<br>
A)group an epic bard, a shammy with all the spells, and the person your buffing.<br>
<br>
B) junk buff the person being buffed, 3 or 4 is good.<br>
<br>
C) cast the &quot;best&quot; spell on the person being buffed (in this case group focus)<br>
<br>
D) have the person being buffed click off the junk just &quot;below&quot; group focus<br>
<br>
E) have the bard proc his epic so that the effect is in the space just vacated by a junk buff.<br>
<br>
F) have the shammy cast the next spell in the focus line (in this case single target focus)<br>
<br>
G) have the person being buffed log out.<br>
<br>
H) have them log back in<br>
<br>
I) repeat for next buff in the focus line<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can find something that bards cast with the proper attributes to let you stack aego too.  There's also some way using this that clerics can stack blessed armor with some other stuff.  Not sure on the specifics of it ~shrug~<br>
<br>
Now please, since we have all these exploits listed, delete this thread.<br>

What is funny is that the forum he runs to has the same rules already and has not had rampant complaints about it.<br>
<br>
If you know an exploit report it.  Do not post it for those who will exploit to see and use.  Gnome eater, you are only giving info to people who did not have it.  You have said nothing that it is not common knowledge that Verant knows and is trying to fix.  Some call it a grey area because it really isn't causing much of a balance issue.  Things are a little easier and maybe a few fights alot easier.  Over all it isn't being used much, and that is why no rush patch breaking bard coding has been done.<br>
<br>
If Verant wants our help, they should start to take it.  Starting with test server, how many bugs that were reported many times on test made it live to hurt bards?  Stop releasing reported bugs from test as a first step, second if you rush a patch to fix a code and severly break any class, emergency patch to fix it.  At that point I will be glad to see a more robust method of sharing info that gets things fixed.  Until then Verant is the enemy and aiding the enemy is treason. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uminmei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Minmei</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://forums.filesnetwork.com/images/smilies/rock.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/8/02 11:39:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I just used Dain hammer effect to get my Focus to stack but I dont' even bother anymore.

<br>
What your saying is not that bard songs stacking with other buffs is whats exploiting, what your saying is that using bard songs you can force spells that normally overwrite each other to stack with each other instead.<br>
<br>
It's similar to the stacking issue they fixed in the Hole recently.  It worked like this, you cast Dead Man Floating on yourself.  Then you cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself.  Then you cast Spirit of Eagle.  Now normally, when you cast Spirit of Eagle, it overwrites Dead Man Floating, however, it was bugged so that it only overwrites one spell at a time, in this case, SoW.  So you have both DMF and SoE on at the same time.  Now you could zone into Hole and only ONE of your levitation spells would drop(DMF in this case).  LEaving you levitating inside the Hole.  I watched several guilds to drops down to master Yael using this exploit.  Fortunatly, this was recently fixed.<br>

You are so against bugs and exploits but you share them with the world to use.  Posting them on boards like this only gets more people to use them.  Reporting them through proper channels is the best route.  Not only do they get fixed in a timely fashion you don't give others information to use innapropriately.  You are hurting your own cause Gnome Eater and don't even see it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showPrevMessage?topicID=10631.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showNextMessage?topicID=10631.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.emailToFriend?topicID=10631.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.threadControl?topicID=10631.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10631.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10631.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers>The Back Alley</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
