I was wondering if there is one (or a few) particular classes that are better suited in a PvP environment?  I don't care if they are melee, caster or hybrid based classes.  <br>
<br>
Here are some classes I think would make a good choice for PvP:  shaman, enchanter, shadowknight, wizard.  Do my choices make sense?  Can you recommend any other classes?<br>

<br>
If you are looking to gank people...well, I'm not giving you any advice there.<br>
<br>
I played a druid on RZ for a long time.  Since pickup groups are even more dangerous on RZ than they are on the regular servers, there was a real advanatage to being able to solo.  You are powerful ebough to defend yourself and mobile enough to escape if you get attacked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://meddik.tripod.com/Images/cross.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/01 1:29:03 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PvP Class ?...Which classes are more PvP-friendly?</span><hr size=1> For defense, Clerics are good.<br>
<br>
Its pretty darn tough to kill a Cleric in PvP. DA/DB/Heals/Buffs/Gate. They can generally get away from almost anyone.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, no offense. Melee stinks, all offensive magic is versus MR, which everyone has maxed early on.<br>
<br>
Also, very bad at travel. No SoW, no invis, no see invis. Prepare to be ambushed if travelling alone as a cleric in PvP land.<br>
<br>
So Clerics are pretty good at surviving an attack, but not very good at taking someone else down. On the other hand, they are generally fairly rare in PvP servers, so you can count on being unique, and Highly sought after, moreso than on the blue servers. <p><TABLE CELLSPACING=10>

<br>
enchanters- terrible at solo pvp.. excellent at group pvp.. prepare to be severly ganked very often if you play this class and don't travel with guild.  This holds true for most int casters without shadow step.<br>
<br>
shadow knights- see the shaman description..<br>
<br>
wizards and necromancers- *ugh*.. sure they're decent.. but very very overplayed.. and nobody wants wizards in groups.  Go with necromancer if you're set on either of these.<br>
<br>
hybrids- very good.  very hard to kill.  very good in duel situations<br>
<br>
rogues- carry poison.. and be prepared.. and you can beat most foes. (hybrids not included)<br>
<br>
monks &amp; warriors- ..good luck.. not much to say about this other than carry many empty bags<br>
<br>
druids- very good.<br>
<br>
mages- best pvp class until level 20.. after that..really really bad.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
basicly.. the key to surviving on a zek is a decent balance of offense and defense.  Shaman.. rogue.. and the hybrids all do exceedingly well.  If you pick a caster, you're an easy target for anyone, especially when you're in ice comet/splurt/envenomed-bolt/winged-death/other-large-spells or melee discipline range. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulirintz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lirin TZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/01 4:56:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PvP Class ?...Which classes are more PvP-friendly?</span><hr size=1> i have to say that cylant got it right on the head.  <br>

once you get to a level where almost everyone has 40mr or greater, you cannot pk.. possibly in groups.. but for the most part you can't do much.  If you want to be a good group pvp'er... go with a druid shaman or shadow knight.  Spirit of the wolf and cheatah combined with snare/root means that you just plain won't die.  The worst pk attempts i've had on me are lone int casters outdoors.  The best attempts have been wisdom casters outdoors, or melee's with wisdom caster partners indoors.  Ranger comes to mind as a good class for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwiergraf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wiergraf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/10/01 12:11:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PvP Class ?...Which classes are more PvP-friendly?</span><hr size=1> My opinion is that the top classes in PvP at low to mid levels would be druids and necros.

<br>
Heh, depends on what gear they're wearing to me.  For some reason, damn dwarven clerics in plate always seem to have an uber-channeling ability.<br>
<br>
You wanna know my thoughts?<br>
<br>
Necros and SKs.  THE 2 most powerful and well rounded PvP classes, with a Ranger being a strong 3rd.<br>
<br>
Necro- Shadowstep, and unresistable DoTs and Lifetaps own in PvP, escepcially in open/hilly terrain.<br>
<br>
SKs- Like a warrior with necro spells.  HT is really nasty on a Caster/Rogue.  Also great escape artists with that damned shadowstep.<br>
<br>
Rangers- Don't laugh, these guys can be mean in PvP.  If a snare lands, your dead.  Now with SoW at 30, and a decent damage sheild, a ranger with a good weapon can toast you in seconds.<br>

But it doesn't mean it's 'impossible' to kill them, it's just a little more difficult. However, I do realize that as I get higher my spells will become more easily resisted (better mr gear).  But casters never seem to be much trouble for enchanters.<br>
<br>
Casters usually aren't much trouble.  And I can only see it getting easier for me as I get higher in level, and the cost of mez in terms of a percentage of my mana pool decreases cost wise.  Plus, as spell casting times for everyone goes up, I'll still be able to use my 2.5 sec mez, to interrupt. =)<br>
<br>
Now mind you I'm only level 16 atm, but with enthrall/mez/cf (all of which are rarely resisted *cf rarely fully resisted*).  At the very least I can make the battle close, often times I've given them a run for their money.  I had a duel the other day with a red con necro, pets up, buffs up, full mana. (Rare situation on Tallon =)).  It was close, and several minutes long. *I really don't have the mana for solo kills at this level w/o some medding.* At the end, she was down to 1/5 oom, where as I had here enthralled/rooted and was just about to resummon my pet, when a healer jumped in and healed me back to full, at which point we stopped.  *sighs*.  I would of loved a red con necro kill screenshot. Bleh.  Enchanters aren't horribly uber, but out of all the classes I've played on a pvp server, I definately love the versatility, in terms of the way I can go about a fight. =)<br>
<br>
If ya want uber, what the other people have suggested are fairly accurate.<br>
<br>
Shamans aren't too great at lower levels, but if you're especially good at jousting/dancing....I never really had many problems with melees, joust/dance/crappy dots.  Casters are pretty much mince meat. ;p.  <br>
<br>
Necros are good, strong dots, pets, method for healing, method to increase mana regen, escape spell in shadow step, damage absorption line, mini mez, and a line that slows targets. ;pThey have some long ass casting times higher up though ;p.<br>
<br>
Bleh....<br>
<br>
Sks are nice if you like melees.  In terms of uberness, for many of the reasons a necro is good ;p. <br>
<br>
Bleh, and to that person who said 40 MR, and you're useless?<br>
PUHLEEZ. =)<br>
I've killed people with way over 40 MR, judging by their twinky gear they were carrying.<br>
<br>
<br>
There's a way to get around almost everything in pvp.  If you're patient enough ;p.<br>

<br>
<br>
at upper lvls rogues are one of the most feared pvp classes.  the ability to move unseen by almost any mob combined with MASSIVE damge output is just gross in pvp. a single bs can take most casters from the fight mode into flight mode instantly, and if they dont run they die and wonder what happened to all that life they had.<br>
sk's are Nasty<br>
Shammans are Nasty<br>
all int casters can be nasty but you will get owned by anyone with a high mr.(this is by no means as common as people seem to think)<br>
you all forgot bards, possibly the hardest class to kill in the game.  and they are great to add to a pk group.<br>
Necs are NASTY!!! but its hard to get loot when you pk with a nec, if the pet or a dot gets the kill you cant loot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
my advice Dont wear anything you will cry over if you lose. dont wear any mr gear until you can get mr to 100 or more and your fire/cold should also be near 100 <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=182.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showMessage?topicID=189.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.threadControl?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15>The Arena</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
