You can also get a d100 (hundred sided), but it's a lot cheaper to use 2d10 (two ten sided dice), taking one of the dice to be the &quot;tens&quot; column and one other to be the &quot;ones&quot; column. <br>However, dice are cheap, so just buy a couple of each. Make sure they're different colors, so it's clear who has rolled what. It'll make the game go faster. <br>The most important rule about dice is: Always know where they are. There're few things more aggravating than getting a bunch of people together to play a game and then find out that no one has any dice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>And about Monty Python . . .

If you want to get your feet wet quickly, definitely go pre-prepared.  The only drawback to this is that you may find it hard to truly clear you own mind of these store bought images when you want to create your own world within the same rule set.  You'll probably be more original if you make your own world first, then buy some adventures based on the same rule set and mold them into your world.  It just takes a long time to really create a campaign.<br><br>If you're into role playing over combat rules, miniatures aren't really needed - you can all play the fights out in your head, if the DM has a good mental image of what he feels is going on.  If you like tactics, you HAVE to play with miniatures.  I only played sans miniatures when I was a kid and couldn't afford them.  I much prefer playing with the painted pewter things.  You will find you use extra dice for monsters, so LOTS of dice!<br><br>Man - this is bringing back memories ...<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelerion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elerion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 10:44:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.tiscali.no/~t-brandr/shadow_face.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> Well, this example is for playing D&amp;D: Forgotten Realms, the most popular system and campaign setting out there. Forgotten Realms is a Tolkien'ish world, and has an immense amount of material available. It's written from a DM's point of view.<br><br>1. Get Player's Handbook, 1 d4, 3 d6, 2 d8, 2 d10, 1 d12, 3 d20. This will give you the absolute essentials for playing D&amp;D. Of course you can make do with 1 of each type of dice, but the numbers above are, in my mind, the minimum for running a smooth game.<br><br>2. Dungeon Master's Guide, more dice, and I would recommend getting the Dungeon Master Screen package. DMG will allow you to get more of an understanding of the game, and is a great tool for inspiration and guidelines for the Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master Screen will allow you to keep your notes, maps, dice throws, etc hidden from the players, and it also has most of the useful tables printed right on it, so you don't have to look up everything in the books all the time. Don't let the players read the Dungeon Master's Guide for now. It's no disaster if they do, but some things in there are better off kept as a secret. Besides, the more advanced rules in there might confuse them, and they may even start questioning your way of DM'ing.<br><br>3. Monster's Manual. This will make it a lot easier for you to create adventures, and some pre-made adventures also require you to have this to look up the stats of the monsters. Most good pre-made adventures will include stats though. This should also be kept hidden from the players, for the most part. You can let them flip through it and look at a few pictures and things if they insist on doing so, but don't let them study the stats and behaviours of the monsters. That knowledge will make your campaigns a lot less interesting. There are few things as exciting for players and DMs than when the players have to scramble to find ways to hurt your seemingly invulnerable monster. It's no fun if they just go &quot;Oh, another Lycanthrope, pull out the silver swords and whack him&quot;<br><br>4. Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. This is very nice if you are going to make your own adventures. It gives you maps, world history, deity information, hex grids and a number of useful things. I believe it also contains a small book with minor adventures. This is by no means necessary, but will make it easier to fit your adventures into the world of Forgotten Realms, and will bring more depth and consistency to them.<br><br>5. Adventures, if you wish. However there are many great adventures to be found on the internet, including on WotC own website. When the players get more experienced though, I would recommend getting a few of the really classic adventures like Dragon Mountain.<br><br>You can buy all these things used if you live in an area where RPG's are moderately popular, or at conventions. I HIGHLY recommend getting 3rd edition (Mostly labeled just Dungeons &amp; Dragons), and not Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Second Edition. I use the latter in my campaigns, but that is because I own a lot of material with that ruleset. 3rd edition is a lot easier to learn, a lot more intuitive (bless the d20 system), and all the new material WotC releases is for the new system.<br><br>I have only played with miniatures a few times, and they are not really needed. If you and the players have a vivid imagination, and you are decent at drawing a rough sketch of the battlefield, that usually makes for more interesting battles. However, when 25 goblins storm your players, miniatures are a necessity. You may be able to keep track of the goblins with a lot of sketching and noting, but the players will not. Once the battles get larger than 12-14 persons/monsters (including PCs), miniatures are recommended.<br><br>Good luck getting started <p><table><tr><td><img src="http://home.tiscali.no/~t-brandr/blackmage.jpg"/></td><td><font size=-2><i><b>Elerion Swiftpoke</b> - Retired Rogue Warden of The Tribunal<br><b>Entharion Sweettalker</b> - Retired Enchanter of Tholuxe Paells<br><br>"Thief?

It can indeed take a while to buy a horse, or to find a lantern, or any number of things.  It depends a lot on the people you are playing with.  There is only one DM, so its not like EQ where if someone wants to craft, you can hunt for a while.  If one person decides that tonight, he is by G. going to role-play a dickering horse buyer, then the whole group will wait for him to finish dickering, or for the DM to warn him of the &quot;dark stormclouds above, threatening a sudden, non-resable lightining stroke&quot;.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>If you have a group of folks who are in synch about what they want the game to be and are organized, two hours can work, IMO.  In general, expect it to be kind of like a guild raid - usually roughest in the beginning - works much better if you play with the same folks over and over.<br><br>If I were going to play with strangers (many game shops have sign up sheets for pick up games) I'd expect to have to play a few sessions and/or with a few different groups before finding a bunch and a game that I was really enjoying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukambic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 5:00:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kambic.homestead.com/files/gate.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> Ok that little link what do I do with it, save all those txt and zip files or what?<br><br>And is that supposed to replace manuals cause I'd kinda like to have some manuals maybe =p<br><br> <p><center><hr width=150 color="blue">Wang Pk<br>Gnome Wizard<br>Honorbound<br>Sullon Zek<br><hr width=150 color="blue"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uinjijo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>injijo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://injijo.homestead.com/files/10x10.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 5:40:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How can I get started</span><hr size=1> I just made another thread about it, but I would reccomend playing G.U.R.P.S.(generic universal roleplaying system) over playing AD&amp;D.

Actually, it's even more important than the Screen in my eyes.<br><br>About your question, 4 people (incl. GM) is a good size to start with.

And it isn't that much of a problem if the GM never has played yet either, but he should try to get at least a basic grasp of the rules (or at least character creation) before he invites the rest of the group for the first game. Skimming over combat rules certainly doesn't hurt either. Of course, the best thing would be if he had a rough idea about the complete rules set, but it isn't necessary.<br><br>A few good rules to keep in mind:<br><br>1. The game is about fun.
