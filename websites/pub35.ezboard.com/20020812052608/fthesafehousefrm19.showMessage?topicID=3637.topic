No!</span><hr size=1> This post is an offshoot of Wulien’s post about what to take Critical Strike to.  I decided to create a new thread because this is more of a SB’s point of view about CS in general.  If you don’t care to see how I reached my decision skip to the end and read the last couple of paragraphs to see my conclusion.  <br><br>Now I really liked my 5 spec at first, even though I hadn’t auto trained stealth.  I had figured out on how to have 50 in all 5 skills by RR6, unfortunately epic armor came out and I personally don’t believe you can use anything less then a player made weapon for your main hand(of course the dragon/legion drop is nice, but I’ll never get that).  <br><br>I used to duel weld Golden Alloy Axes for get a huge +8 axe, +2 left axe bonus.  One day I tested a player made enchanted 98% quality cleaver.  The damage increase was unreal, even with losing the skill bonuses from dropping a GA axe.  This left me with a dilemma.  I could no longer have 50 in axe and left axe so I started looking at ways I could improve axe.  One way was changing my original spec: 39 Left Axe, 36 Envenom, 34 CS, 34 Axe, 34 Stealth.  This spec allowed me to have 50 in everything at RR 6 with some creative item use.  I decided I should try the following spec: 39 axe, 39 left axe, 34 CS, 34 stealth and 31 poison.  This change would cost me lifebane, but I figured I could compensate that with the improved axe skill.  This spec would get me pretty close to 50 Axe and Left axe.  Of course then I started thinking about something else….  <br><br>My poor kobold SB had about 950 hps.  I was using the DF bracers to give me +4 in left axe.  I really wanted more strength and hps, but at what cost?  I decided to get crazy and drop all my CS gear and the bracers.  What do I need it?  I would say at least 60% of the people I attack are in epic armor.  I used to wear the DF arms (CS +3), Belt of Mischief (CS+3) and 2 twisted darksteel rings (CS +2 each).  Being a 5 spec SB I found that I wasn't ever capping on my Perfs unless the target was a sitting mage/rogue.  I would then switch to my one hander for the one-shot.  When they removed the one-shot stay hidden attack I realized that there was no reason at all to keep wearing all of my CS gear simply hoping to find a sitting castor or rogue.  In addition, my perf damage really isn’t the much better then some of my positional Axe and Left Axe moves.  <br><br>So now I find my CS at 34 base with +3 from Realm Ranks.  By switching my CS items with mostly Infernal diamond DF stuff and other types of armor I now have 1205 hps at level 48.  (I also have Aug Con II and Toughness II).  Now this came at a price.<br><br>By doing that I had to accept the fact that at level 50 and RR6 my axe would be only 48 and my left axe would be 45.  Now this is fine and dandy, but I really starting looking harder at the skills I liked.  I love poison and I want 50 so I can use lifebane.  I would love to use 2 player-mades, but my axe skill would take a -4 hit.  What skill could I cut?  I took a hard look at Critical Strike and decided the only reason I keep it at 34 was for the CD stun.  More importantly the CD stun vs. mages because I couldn’t use my 39 Left axe stun against them because they don’t melee me.  In addition I am finding that I am missing perf a lot for some reason, and my CD is getting missed/blocked/parried a lot.  So I have all these points spend on a positional 2nd string stun that does bad damage and I don’t seem to land that much.  What to do?  <br><br>One SB said simply use Backstab 2’s small stun, personally I didn’t think it would long enough but I thought I’d try it.  Sure enough I find a solo mage level 50 mage in epic armor in the room above the Alb milegate and backstab him.  I pull BS II, my poison lands, and turns and I land a double frost before he stuns me.  He then proceeds to kill me.  Point being BS II doesn’t last long enough.   How can I dump all these points I have in CS?  The Realm Ability Purge.<br><br>I asked myself why keep a skill at 34 simply so I can stun mages?  I can use the Realm Skill Purge to break out and finish them.  By dumping CS I can now spec at 44 Axe, 44 Left Axe, 34 Stealth, and 36 poison.  This spec allows me to use two player made weapons if I like and to have lifebane at RR6.  The only other small change I will make is to take dodger to level 3 so I can get my level 39 left axe stun off regularly.  These high specs allow me to max out my constitution, hit point and strength gear w/o costing me skill points.  To me this is the only viable spec if you are not a crit blade, IMHO.  BTW, this does not take into account spell crafting which I feel Mythic won’t include until the expansion simply so they have another hook to get us to buy it. I also find it interesting that our CS skill sucks so bad that we can even consider getting rid of one of our “supposedly” trademark skills…<br><br>Gellor<br>48.5 SB Igraine.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gellor02>gellor02</A> at: 6/27/02 9:19:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 9:30:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3637.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do non-critblades really need Critical Strike?

I think I've been on the short end of that one time . <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm in total agreement (as you may have read in Wulien's thread).<br><br>CS, in it's current form and in the current state of the game, is far less powerful than it once was.  We used to discuss the viability of the post-34/39 CS styles.  Many replied that those later styles were nice, but that they were no more important to a decision than the added points to the Perf cap.  The primary reason the perf cap was important was because we were trying to one-shot people.  With the one-shot nerf, it is obvious that the Perf cap is a much less important issue.  Now the question is more about whether the styles are useful.  Stunning Stab and Leaper ARE pretty good styles.  Worth going from 34 to 44?  Hard to say, but my feeling is that they aren't worth quite that much.<br><br><br>So with the reduced viability of CS as a line, it is fairly easy to understand that points spent in that line might be better used elsewhere for a variety of reasons.  I actually find myself thinking more about my GARROTE cap than my perf cap.  How screwy is THAT?  My CS is at 44 right now, and I used to be very happy with that.  Now, I'm considering dropping it when I can respec because I can no longer really validate the points spent in it.<br><br>I will see what I want to do after they implement respec.  If they make major changes to assassins in general, or to CS in particular, I may change my mind.  But if things stay the same, I'll be specing a completely different type of Inf.<br><br> <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 9:43:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3637.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do non-critblades really need Critical Strike?

My spec is as follows:<br><br>Stealth 40<br>Axe 44<br>CS  50<br>Evenom 17<br><br>I have absolutely no regrets at this point about my spec.  I can still 1 shot lvl 50 casters. Even when the caster is buffed to high hell cleric buffs etc i still usually kill in 1 hit because of mastery of pain 3. Even if i don't kill in first hit they're dead on the second no matter what even if i'm using 1h or 2h.  Tanks i can even take out lvl 50 fully sheild spec paladins or even an armsman but they're a bit tougher. <br><br>Sure my evenom is rather low but having a high weapon spec and maxed CS more then makes up for the dmg in my opinion.  The only poison i see useful is the snare or disease poison since the targets i go for are dead with in 2-3 anyways. Even after respec goes in i'll probably just drop my stealth a little bit and evenom completly so that i can have both 50 axe and CS.<br><br><br>Ayron Erebus<br>&lt;Aftermath&gt;<br>50 Shadowblade Iseult<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uhelathien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Helathien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 3:57:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3637.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do non-critblades really need Critical Strike?

All of those points are just not worth 2 styles that are so ridicously hard to land, and don't really do that much more damage than L axe styles.  The only place that I wil miss perf is in keep raids where you only get one swing at a person, and it helps to make it as hard as you can. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uhelathien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Helathien</A> at: 6/27/02 3:57:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ucougarpak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cougar Pak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 4:07:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3637.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.pakcafan.com/daoc/images/cougsig2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do non-critblades really need Critical Strike?  No!</span><hr size=1> hehe Servo, I've known that for a long time. I'm one of those rare shades that doesn't get lazy in groups and just spams G/AH but move around and use different positionals. And I'd always get 'effect already on target' when I used Wasp/Hornet then G/AH... but never the reverse... which means Hornet is better.<br><br>Wasp/Hornet is also useful when people flee from you (Especially stealthers) that extra bleed ticking damage just keeps resetting their stealth timer. But I digress. <p><img src=http://www.pakcafan.com/daoc/images/cougsig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3637.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3637.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3637.topic&index=8><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3637.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3637.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3637.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3637.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
