<br>
Nice to see some hard numbers coming out (even if they are just relative).  It must have taken a long time and we appreciate your effort.<br>
<br>
In continuation of your mentioned moves, please also consider that there are two &quot;modes&quot; of fighting for an SB, those of &quot;assist&quot; and &quot;tank&quot;. <br>
<br>
Where &quot;assist&quot; is when the SB is in a party (becoming more of a requirement as the SB is now more motivated to group ・ala de-stealth from one-hit, reduced solo damage, and See Hidden, et al.).<br>
<br>
The second being &quot;tank&quot; where the SB is solo fighting or the mob has gone agro on the SB in a group ・easy to argue that the mob going agro on the SB is due to poor SB agro-management technique.  Any effort to address &quot;tank&quot; mode will affect PvP issues and Mythic will likely be loath to modify anything in this department.<br>
<br>
Obviously your analysis is looking at the &quot;tank&quot; role with forward-facing moves only, focusing on highest damage regardless of agro draw.<br>
<br>
Fair enough, I'm keen to be effective in a 1-on-1, but I think that of high concern is making the SB effective in groups during PvE so that we can get groups and be effective in them (this is Mythic's strong mandate, so I would think that they could at least have the decency to be responsive to this).  Why is this important?  Well it speeds up the exp treadmill so that we can get to end-game and do some RvR out there with groups (as was apparently intended).<br>
<br>
Please refer to my rather generalized grouping guide for some background on SB grouping and technique (which I知 sure you are familiar with, but more for the logic and supporting argument).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/nage42/ShadowBlade/shadowblades_on_the_exp_treadmill.htm">www.geocities.com/nage42/...admill.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Boiling it down to essentials, I would be of the strong opinion that Snowsquall and Icy Brilliance are areas of not only importance, but also areas where perhaps Mythic will throw-us-a-bone because it will not effect RvR (I think some other poster mentioned about Snowsquall perhaps piercing BladeTurn... this is a great idea for RvR, perhaps it should snare also: much like a Garrote equiv so that it could have medium defense penalty too so that using it will make you vulnerable if you are fighting in &quot;tank&quot; mode).<br>
<br>
If you get a chance, would it be possible to run the numbers for Snowsquall and Icy Briliance because these are very important PvE moves ・potentially adding a weak detaunt to Icy would make them move viable.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to constructive discussion on these topics.<br>
<br>
Respectfully yours,<br>

Will look over it further.<br>
<br>
A side note, the two weapons I was using were<br>
Shimmering Arcanium Cleaver (16.5/4/99/99/35%) AND<br>
Accursed Avernal Axe (15.8/3.3/99/89/25%)<br>
<br>
Not the two best, but I had to hop on immediately to meet the CSR member for my mob so I didnt get the chance to swap out weapons between my characters.<br>
<br>
And yes, I am planning to do the full style tests.  Today I was limited by time so I took care of the ones that were easy for me to do solo (well, I had a lvl 19 healer with me keeping me topped off, but still, thats technically solo, right? =).  Next round Ill be sure to have a few friends with me so I can test positional styles, Axe styles, and sword styles, and any other pertinant combos I wasnt able to cover today.  Although it is relative, it gives us at minimum a great resource when choosing our paths for comparable damage.. hopefully the data when fully parsed will help as a tool for style revamps where necessary.<br>
