The incredibly stupid ones more often. From what I have found at my age (14, but i have alot wieghing on my mind) it is truely up to the parents. If your parents are hard, mean, cruel then A) sucide shall happen or B) you will become a genius and strong or C) you will be just like your parents <br>
<br>
IF your parents are the sweet ones that think oh isnt he/she adorible? lets give it all the candy it wants, then let it watch TV all day the child will be A) extreamly lazy with no thought of workin. B) a complete moron or C) will commit sucide just because he/she has nothin better to do and will create problems in thier mind.<br>

I have parent set A. so far i am smart enough =+P, i hate them, i really wanna get a job so i can get out of this god forsaken house, and i have the biggest imagination you could ever imagin lol.<br>

I think it's the same. However, today when you are entertained it's more than likely that you will be sitting on your butt doing nothing. The results of instantly being entertained is the same. Heck, isn't reading a book instantly entertaining? People have been able to do that now for hundreds of years. Maybe 80 years ago, you would go outside and chill with friends and neighbors and be entertained through some games or just &quot;talk&quot;. Basically, you probably interacting a lot with people.  Maybe listen to the radio together as a family...key word there is family. It seems to me, (just a general observation) that more and more people watch what they want by themselves or with a select group of people than with their family. <br>
<br>
I agree that there are a lot of stupid, dumb, just plain off the wall morons as teenagers. The population forever increasing at an alarming rate, that not only will you increase the dumb stock, you will also increase the smart ones. Same with the in betweens. Today there are more colleges than ever before, and more people going to them than decades past...so isn't that good? <br>
<br>
So what is the point? Yes there are moron teens running around that don't know better. However, they are also a lot of not-so-bright adults walking around too. <br>
<br>
&quot;All teens are inherently punks&quot; Bah, what a load of BS to me.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushamsung.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shamsung</A> at: 8/1/02 10:42:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubumblingschmuck.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bumbling Schmuck</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://schmuck.cjb.net//cheedited.bmp" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 4:58:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5181.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://schmuck.cjb.net//pics/mrt.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kids: A Rant</span><hr size=1> I'm 14 and I see what the original poster is talking about nearly every day.

<br>
I am a 15 (almost 16) year old and find the stereotypes about young people today to be quite irritating.<br>
<br>
People say we complain too much; that life is &quot;cushy&quot; these days compared to how it was 30 or more years ago.  To those people I say: &quot;that's @#%$&quot;.  Granted, things <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> very different now than they used to be.  That doesn't mean they're easier, though.  When my father and his father were growing up, their biggest demands were physical; helping their parents complete labor intensive tasks, etc.  I'll admit that these days the physical demands on a teenager are much less, and that they live a more comfortable lifestyle, if you follow me (air conditioning has become standard, radio, TV, etc).<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean we have things easy, though.  I think it's reasonable to say that we're challenged mentally and emotionally quite a bit more than young people have in the past.  With the divorce rate in our country hovering around 50%, many teenagers have very emotionally stressful lives.  Likewise, academic demands are much greater today.   Colleges are much more competitive, schools tend to offer a more challenging cirriculum and much more of our free time is expected to be devoted on meaningless, repetitve &quot;busywork&quot;.  Sure, alot of us aren't working to help support our family or spending all of our time helping around the house, but that doesn't mean we don't have just as much work to do heh.<br>
<br>
As far as claiming all teenagers are alike, I beg to differ.  Yes, on the surface it appears that 99% of young peoples lives are shrouded with this image @#%$, but when you look beyond that, most of us have alot more to offer.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the original poster claimed we're devoid of creativity, imagination, intelligence, etc.  How the hell would you know?  Have you been a teenager in the late 90s, early 00s?  Just because we aren't writing poetry or acting in plays doesn't mean we don't have an imagination.  As far as the comment about the standard teenagers intellect, considering your comments, I would wager that I am less &quot;stupid&quot; than you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Musically, most teenagers DON'T listen to rap as much as MTV would like to make you think they do.  I personally despise rap, pop, and hip-hop.  My favorite band is Tool and I listen mostly to, uhh, &quot;edge-ier&quot;, less mainstream bands.  Most of my friends have the same taste.<br>

God damn beatnick. Get a job.<br>
God damn hippy. Get a job.<br>
God damn raver. Get a job.<br>
<br>
Same tune, different generation.<br>
<br>
Children today are a lot like those of the past.<br>
<br>
Except today they learn valuable skills that will help them survive in the world, they don't lynch eachother for having a different coloured skin, and they understand the world around them. Can ANYONE honestly say there has ever been a time in the history of the world that people were, generally, better off then we are right now?<br>
<br>
I am an internetworking engineer. I maintain complex systems.  Without people like me, the world as we know it stops, because the world relies on us to maintain the flow of information.  I serve a useful, and valuable purpose.<br>
<br>
I do not accept people over the age of 35 for new positions without extensive prior training in either knowledge, or natural aptitude.  <br>
<br>
Why? Agism?<br>
<br>
Yes. It's agist. I have yet to meet a 40 year old who can understand and relate to the systems I maintain, unless they have already been using similar systems for years.  The world we live in is much more complex then the world we used to live in.  If you suddenly removed me from what I do now, and stuck me in ANY job 60 years ago, I could master it in about a month.  Most jobs of yesteryear were drudge work. A lot of moving various things to various places. Assembly lines. Farming.  <br>
<br>
You couldn't do the opposite, I guarantee you.<br>
<br>
If anything, children today are too smart, too creative, and too driven.  There are so many things to do, that many take long periods to rest and play.  Me sitting at my computer playing a computer game is in no way different then somebody going out and playing baseball. I am excercising my mind, they are excercising their bodies.  Physical prowess is all well and good, but it a nonissue in the way our world works today.<br>
<br>
That being said, the original poster is singing the same tired tune that has been sung for an untold amount of time. The children of today will say the same things about the children of tomorrow.. and of course they will be just as wrong as the children of yesterday were. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237392">Treliah Trelani</a> - Vicar<BR>

I'm impressed!  Impressed to the point of thinking you're some sort of divinity, if what you say is true.<br>
<br>
You cold be a master machinist with a month's training!<br>
Or a (master!) surgeon!<br>
Or a masterful mechanic, engineer, college professor, lawyer, carpenter, or any of a great number of other jobs that required years of training or experience to really do well.<br>
<br>
While I agree with your basic premis that the &quot;kids are worthless&quot; argument is basically the same as its ever been (kids are no more worthless today than they were in the past... go check out &quot;Heavy Metal Parking Lot&quot; to see the winners of my generation), I have to disagree with the concept that life and work were all easy in yesteryear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utolano.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tolano</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 7:36:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5181.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kids: A Rant</span><hr size=1> uh im a kid and i still read before bed... have since i was like 7 and could read lol <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uewanakanach0king.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ewan aka nach0king</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 8:42:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5181.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.datazap.net/free/nach0king/images/potshot.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kids: A Rant</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I start talking about the house market and asking a few questions and she looks at me, pauses and asks me if I want freaking piece of candy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
