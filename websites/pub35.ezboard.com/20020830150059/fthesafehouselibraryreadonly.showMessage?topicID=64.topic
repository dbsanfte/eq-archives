The group I go to Kedge with is made of of the following.  Although it's high, you do not need this type of firepower to control the upper level (except for some exceptions, mentioned later).  <BR>   <BR> 50th Cleric  <BR> 46th Druid  <BR> 41st Warrior  <BR> 37th Druid  <BR> 35th Enchanter  <BR> 32nd Rogue (dats me!)  <BR>   <BR> First off, before you go to Kedge Keep, go to the Inn that is in East Commons RIGHT NEXT TO the zone to West Commons and buy a TON of Fish Scales for your druid/enchanter so that he can cast Enduring Breath.  Bards can also come in handy with their EB song. <BR>   <BR> You could also get a Rebreather or Aqualung from an Tinkerer and support their trade.  They can be expensive though.  <BR>   <BR> Magicians can also summon Waterstones for underwater breathing and are great for those times when your Enduring Breath (EB) is fading during combat (which it shouldn't, more on that later) and you need to keep alive till your EBer can recast it on you.  <BR>   <BR> You can also purchase Potions of Water Breathing in Halas I believe.  They go for 12pp.  Our group got 6 of them and have them hotkeyed just in case of emergencies.  <BR>   <BR> On the subject of underwater combat.  <BR>   <BR> Few things you should be aware of.  <BR>   <BR> <b>Melee Classes</b> - When hit underwater by these fish, you get pushed back.  At first it's tough to fight underwater, but you'll get used to it fast.  Generally, you want to find something to prop yourself against so you don't get pushed out of attack range if the fish swings around and hits you back.  It's not nessecery, but it is helpful.  Just past the Pull Zone (on the map below) right before it opens up into the room is a ledge (you'll see it when you get there and understand) that you can prop up against when your puller drags it into the hallway there.  You cannot swim backwards normally.  If you duck (D key) you can swim backwards though!  Also if you have SOW cast on you before you go in you can swim backwards.  You will also run low on stamina alot because of swimming and fighting.  Enchanters should have augmentation on everyone to help with this, and other classes have stamina regeration spells if need be. <BR>   <BR> <b>Casters</b> - Movement back / forth WILL interupt your casting, up down (without forward or backward movement) will NOT interupt your casting.  Be aware that if a fish hits you, you WILL float backwards and thus, interupt your casting.  It is HIGHLY suggested that casters stay in the corners, that way if they're hit, they don't float back and at least have the chance to roll for a continued casting.  <BR>   <BR> <b>On Enduring Breath</b> - It is the ENTIRE group's responsibility to be aware of the time remaining on EB.  If someone dies due to drowning, it's EVERYONE's fault for not keeping on top of it.  <BR>   <BR> Enduring Breath is a 25 minute spell.  Have someone in your group with a stopwatch start timing when the first EB is cast and let the group know when 20 minutes have elapsed.  Recast when he says the 20 mins are up.  Don't wait the full 25 mins, no need to cut it close.  <BR>   <BR> Everyone in the group should be aware of time remaining.  Don't get angry with folks asking &quot;time on EB&quot; ... they just want to be informed.  <BR>   <BR> <b>On Rezzing in Kedge</b>  <BR>   <BR> If you have a death in Kedge, and you have a Cleric who can Rez, have your Druid or Enchanter ready to cast Enduring Breath on the newly rezzed player.  Also have the Cleric ready on the heal.  Rez sickness wipes any and all buffs from the player, you'll have to be ready with the buffs.  <BR>   <BR> Okay, on to the actual fighting...  <BR>   <BR> <b>Map of Kedge Keep's FIRST FLOOR</b>  <BR>   <BR> <center><img src=http://www.wlvrn.com/images/kedge_upper.gif border=2></center>  <BR> <u>Creatures on the First Floor</u>  <BR> 30-31 - Lancer Swordfish (blue to me at 32)  <BR> 33 and up - Piercer Swordfish (yellow and red to me at 32)  <BR> 42ish - Impaler Swordfish (RED to me)  <BR> 43ish - Fierce Impaler Swordfish (RED to me)  <BR>   <BR> <b>Lancers</b> - Not too many HPS.  They hit hard (60s) and fast (double, triple hits).  Great XP for a mid 30s group.  Lancers are 98% of what you will see on the upper level.  They are placeholders for the ONE Impaler/Fierce Impaler and few Piercers that spawn on this floor.  <BR>   <BR> <b>Piercers</b> - Can be nasty.  They tended to be more RED then Yellow to me at 32.  I'd say they average in the 34 to 37 levels.  They are pretty much the same as Lancers 'cept they hit for more in the 70s and have a good amount more HPS.  <BR>   <BR> <b>Impalers</b> - 42 or so creatures.  They are VERY nasty.  They hit hard (101 was a common theme) and fast (double hit for 101 is fast enough for me).  They also have a LOT of HPS.  Do NOT let your casters get these aggro on them, you'll be minus a caster before you can do much.  Seemed to spawn every half hour instead of one of the Lancer spawns on the far end of the room from the pull area.  Those spawns are near the ceiling.  <BR>   <BR> <b>Fierce Impaler</b> - Take an Impaler, give it more HPS and let it hit more in the 110-20 range.  This creature drops the <b>Gloomwater Harpoon</b> that we all are after.  It is a RARE spawn that takes the place of one of the Impaler spawns.  Rare for even a rare spawn.  <BR>   <BR> I suggest that a mid 30 group be VERY careful with the Impaler and Fierce Impaler.  You best have a VERY cohesive group.  I'd venture to say that a upper 30s group could take the Impaler and Fierce Impaler spawns.  <BR>   <BR> The roaming path marked on the map is where the two flanking lancer spawns will roam.  They just go back and forth.  <BR>   <BR> <b>Upper Level Tactics</b>  <BR>   <BR> Tactics used in this area were pretty basic.  Basically, be aware that you're prolly going to be pulling multiple fishies.  We had an Enchanter who could Mez or Charm the extras.  Druids can also Charm the fish.  This can be vital during fights down here as these fish are very nasty critters.  I highly suggest and Enchanter in the group.  If not, have your Druid Charm an extra fish if you get in trouble.  Beware that when Charm breaks, the Charmie is going to be VERY angry at your Druid, so beware.  <BR>   <BR> If you have an Enchanter or Shamen, use a SLOWNESS spell.  It's a GREAT spell down there.  <BR>   <BR> Make sure to have your casters wait till the meleers have taken the creature down a bit before nuking it.  Fish and casters do NOT go well together.  <BR>   <BR> <b>INFO for HIGHER level groups camping the Gloomwater Harpoon</b>  <BR>   <BR> If the upper room is cleared and you want to pull something, there are some Fanged Tooth Piranna right when you go down on the second floor.  <BR>   <BR> <b>BEWARE</b> of them.  They were BLUE to the level 50 cleric in our group.  They hit hard (80s, double attack) and have A CRAPLOAD of HPS.  I'd venture to say they're considerably nastier than Seafury Cyclopses.  Our group (the one outlined at the begining of this post) could manage 3 of them at a time, but this was ONLY because of our Enchanter and Druids charming and Mezing, even then, we found ourselves medding during the fight and, well, it was prolly the nastiest fight I've witness in my time in EQ, and I've seen some nasty ones.  <BR>   <BR> You WILL pull more than one from the below level.  Be warned, they are VERY nasty.  <BR>  <BR> <B>Other Facts</B> <BR> Most creatures can NOT see invis <BR>   <BR> <b>Conclusions</b>  <BR>   <BR> This is prolly my favorite zone in all of Norrath.  It's great fun to play down there.  The XP is simply GREAT for a mind 30s group camping the upper level.  Do NOT go down there for loot, it sucks (only got cash of the Shark on the second level).  <BR>   <BR> All in all, it's a GREAT time.  <BR>   <BR> I hope this guide has enlighted those of you wanting to go down there and get your Gloomwaters and helps you have a good time.  <BR>   <BR> Good luck fellow Rogues!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showPrevMessage?topicID=64.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showNextMessage?topicID=64.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.emailToFriend?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.threadControl?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=64.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=64.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly>Library (Read-Only)</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
