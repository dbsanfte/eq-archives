Same goes for all the gimp SKs that wouldn't dare face PvP without death touch up.<br>
<br>
EQ PvP is gimped at most levels.  If you're going to play to have fair pvp, and be &quot;teh PeeVeePee ownage&quot; just go buy quake or something.<br>
<br>
I have fun, beacuse I play PvP for my team, and my guild, for zone control.  That's where its at.  Whether you're a cleric, chanter, rogue, warrior, etc.  Everyone plays a crucial role. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uceescritdabossalini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceescrit da Bossalini</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/8/02 10:46:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udiosfrenzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DiosFrenzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/8/02 3:24:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What characters do well in EQ's PvP</span><hr size=1> Heh, Elegance must have gone to Lady D's school of pvp. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would probably rate Rangers as #1 most deadly pvp class now with luclin.

<br>
When you get to the upper levels, and SKs obtain the DT disc, it really is more or less a DT...  At lvl 60, and sk can pop an insta cast ~1060 points of damage effortlessly.  My rogue is decently well equipted for being on a PvP server, and he only has 2100 health, so that DT, kills me if i'm around 1k health.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, rogues being able to do the same damage? Sure! But we accually have to work hard to get in good backstabs in pvp, its not simply clicking a disc off in the middle of a fight.<br>
<br>
SKs &gt; all<br>
<br>
I can't remember how many times i've been pvping in nek and have been doing great, only for a trigger happy SK to come out of no where and ruin my fun with a DT.  DT simply makes them over powering, and without it they would still be up there.<br>
<br>
Also, it is offly tough for a non-casting class like rogues and warriors to do realisticly good in pvp against druids / rangers.  Only real way you would have a chance is if you had sow to start off, golem wands / pumice, or a head start. <p><center><b>-</b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=164177>Xanroth</a><b>-</b> <br>Weapon <b>X</b> <br>Emerald Defender<br> 59th Rogue<br>Vallon Zek</center> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uceescritdabossalini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceescrit da Bossalini</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/15/02 2:24:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aztecmfgcorp.com/_private/eq/avatar2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What characters do well in EQ's PvP</span><hr size=1> A 60 SK can kill a 60 chain nuking wizard with lifetaps only. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urenc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Renc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/02 12:19:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What characters do well in EQ's PvP</span><hr size=1> elegence dont be foolish =/.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufaxanadu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faxanadu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/02 7:12:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What characters do well in EQ's PvP</span><hr size=1> If people wand me (which I consider not honorable) then I wand them and lifeburn them. <br>
