<br>
2hand slot - Tuskers old Wound 100% quality and condition 13.2/3.4 effective DPS 12.0 <br>
Left hand slot - Serrated Lion Fangs. 10.8/2.5 <br>
Right hand slot - Huge Sharpened Boar Tusk 12.6/2.6 100% quality &amp; condition effective DPS 12.0 <br>
<br>
I attacked about 20 yellow rooters without using poison and 'only' using amethyst slash. I used stats only where i never missed. (I almost never missed on all attacks anyway) I also didn't count the lone left hand hit for 40 damage. <br>
<br>
I also checked my xp after the kill and used stats from equal xp kills only. (about 5 mil xp) and about 900 hp damage to kill. <br>
<br>
I check the timer from &quot;you enter combat&quot; to &quot;the rooter dies&quot; times <br>
<br>
I managed to kill the rooters in 21 seconds with the slow weapon. <br>
I managed to kill the rooters in 24+ seconds with the fast weapon. <br>
<br>
Side Note: It looks like a round is about 4 seconds and DOTs tick just under every 4 seconds too. <br>
<br>
So with my first round of tests my conclusion is the slow weps end a fight faster when using 1 main style. I will try some more tests and wanted to get your inputs on this info. <br>

The slower the weapon, the more bonus. So this doesnt surprise me, the question is: Would you rather kill something a little faster or reap the rewards of faster weapons?<br>
<br>
I personally favor faster weapons because I find it much easier to react for styles, even stack them in PvE (db, db hamstring or even db, hamstring, db, hamstring if the timing is just right :)). I seem to have better luck with 2 fast weapons, as opposed to one slow (for perf). All personal preference....<br>

personally i have been running some tests to see what fits my playing style. this is what I have found works for me and why<br>
using<br>
netherium stilletto and epic with a main G on 2h player crafteds are 99 qual<br>
main G i use for  perf cause it does seem to up damage by 50-60 compared to my stilleto, and is still fast weapon for use in 3 poisons<br>
used raipers and gladius but they are just to dam slow and eat up my end like mad<br>
and the last real reason for using the fast weapons is i seem to evade more the faster the weapon is I use. no real data on this I have just noticed more evades with faster weapons, which allows me to get my evade chains off, which seem to be my bread and butter. I `m using stilletos cause of the spd and their damage is acceptable, i love to hit for 30 pts more with the heaver weapons but i find i don`t evade as offen and I don`t have the end to do chains when i do evade. SO i have started to wonder if slow weapon spd has some sort of negitive effect to defence? now that i think about it i think my pally blocks a ton more with shield when using a short sword compared to bastard or long. can anyone help me out with some  info on this??<br>

<br>
Same Mob this time I used evade styles too. <br>
I came very close to dying twice when I used my fast weps. Once I even switched to the Slow wep to help prevent dying and losing that bub when I was soooo close. <br>
<br>
Interestingly enough using evade moves, the weapons did not seem to finish the mobs faster. (I guess since the evade moves do about 20hp higher damage than Amethyst. If I get to do 3 that's only 60hp. Not really noticable.) <br>
<br>
When using evade moves: <br>
Slow wep would finish mobs in 22-27 seconds 4.5-6.0 million xp <br>
Fast wep would finish mobs in 22-26 seconds 4.5-5.5 million xp <br>
<br>
In fact I tried using only amethyst again with fast weps and finished mobs in 22 to 24seconds. on 5.5 million xp rooters <br>
<br>
I also took Zeemee out to fight the same Rooters and found that she took a few seconds longer to finish mobs than Xeemee. (2-<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Zeemee weps used for test were. <br>
Shard of Grovewood 14.1/3.4 effective DPS 10.7 <br>
Long Lion Fangs 10.7/2.4 effective DPS 10.8 <br>
Zeemme normally uses Orange 99% Quality Asterite Gladius with 12.0/3.7 effective DPS 11.9 which did similar damage to Xee's Slow wep. <br>
<br>
I found that evade moves helped conserve endurance and, since you evaded HP also. The evade moves also give a bonus to defense, often making the mob miss the next attack. I also found that Garotte or Garotte &amp; A/H combo chewed up valuable endurance. Even running out before the fight was done, making the evade moves very important. <br>
<br>
My conclusion here is that evade moves dont finish a fight faster but since they conserve endurance they make a longer fight more likely to win and multple mobs easier to kill. It also looks like a simple amethyst attack finishes a fight faster than using evades. Oh... 1 more thing FAST weps seem to use more endurance because you hit more often. I thought that the weight of the wepon was a factor balancing this point out but I don't believe it. <br>
<br>
I might do a test to see if Xeemee finishes a fight faster with Amethyst or Garotte combo. I sure hate the endurance drain of garotte, annnd the hoping for an evade. <br>

this is becaus the damage you get when you hit is 'charged' while youre wateing to swing.. after the initial attack, spd dosnt matter since dps is a constant.. BUT the initial attack is free so a slower weapon gets a higher damage from the first 'free' attack=P<br>
<br>
so with a 16 dps weapon any speed will do the same amount of damage over time after the first attack is made. The first attack is the only place you have controll over youre damage manualy since the speed of the wepaon effects the amount of 'free' damage you get..<br>

I use close to half of my endurance, using a netherite guarded rapier, on my perf chain (per/cd/ss).  I'm pretty much out of endurance after 3 garrot/achilles heel combos.  <br>
<br>
When I use my wicked thorn, I can do the perf chain and garotte/achiles heel for days.  I will never perf with my wicked thorn because it is not slow enough to do any kind of damage, but switch to it if i have to stick around to melee peeps down.   I haven't run any tests or anything but this is what i've observed using both slow and fast weapons.  <br>
<br>
Guarded rapier has delay of 3.6<br>
Wicked thorn has delay of 2.2-2.3<br>
