I couldn't really think of anywhere else to post it.<br>
<br>
I need a little help. I have two computers that I run EQ on, and recently (3-4 patches ago) one of the computers has started crashing very often. I'm hoping someone here can tell me how to fix it.<br>
<br>
First off, the specs:<br>
The computer that DOESN'T crash is a p4 1400 mhz, geforce 3, WinME, gig of ram.<br>
<br>
The computer that DOES crash is a p3 1000 mhz, geforce 2, WinXP home (not pirated), 768 megs ram.<br>
<br>
This is basically what happens: After an hour of EQ running perfectly fine, the game just crashes to desktop. There is no error message, and no program had opened up to cause the crash. It happens basically EXACTLY after an hour of playing (the other night during a 3 hour raid, I crashed at 10:12 PM, then again at 11:13 PM, for example). It doesn't always happen at the same time, it seems to happen after an hour of playing no matter when I start playing...<br>
<br>
When it crashes, like I said, there's no error message. The only thing remotely odd that happens is my desktop turns grey (instead of my background picture) but that seems to happen when any program crashes.<br>
<br>
I have to stress that this computer has always worked fine up until the last month or so. I definately do not have a virus and no programs run in the background except my virus scanner (which has never caused any problems, and its also installed on the computer that doesn't crash). EQ seems to be the only program that is crashing. I recently updated to the latest Nvidia drivers as well, didn't fix it.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty good with computers, but I'm stumped, and this is a major problem for me since I'm the main puller for my guild, plus I play on Rallos Zek. It's also a huge pain when 2-boxing. Anyone who can help me out?<br>

btw...i get a crash to desktop every once in a blue moon too. =/  <br>
<br>
I got an AMDathlonXP1900+, geforce3 ti200, winXP, and 1gig of ddr ram.  I get the same thing...crash to desktop.  No other game i have crashes to desktop...lol  I play RED FACTION, Command &amp; Conquer Renegade, and a bunch of other games too.  No problems...no glitches...but with EQ...poof to desktop.<br>
<br>
My stupid pc locks up with EQ too.

After exhausting pretty much all software possibilities, we started removing components to see if one was faulty.  It turned out to be a bad stick of RAM. After taking the stick out and replacing it, he had absolutely no more problems with EQ.  We hadn't even considered that because everything else on his computer was running so well... but that's what it turned out to be.  So you might give that a try... it's worth a shot, anyways.  :)<br>
