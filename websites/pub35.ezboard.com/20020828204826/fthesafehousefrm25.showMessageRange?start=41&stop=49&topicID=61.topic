<br>
There are also restrictions to the Whirlwind Feat, the most relevant one in this instance is the number of strikes you can make is equal to your level.  Obviously, this makes for LARGE theoretical numbers of attacks for high-level characters, but there are also restrictions on the number of creatures that can engage a single target.  I believe a medium-sized target (i.e., a typical adventurer) can only be attacked by six or eight enemies at one time.<br>
<br>
Even a 20th level fighter is going to fall to a &quot;zergling rush&quot;.  Rules for grappling and subdual are substantially different than regular melee.  If memory serves, the DC for grapple attacks is 10+Dexterity bonus (could be wrong here, but it makes sense to my sleep-needing mind).  Said fighter may be able to shake off the first four or five kobolds, he will eventually be overwhelmed and brought down.  Assuming, of course, that the attackers are stupid enough to engage in melee.  Even kobolds can use bows.<br>
<br>
As mentioned repeatedly above, it comes down to the skill of the individual game master.  Sure, a very high level chararcter will be able to take out an almost obscene number of one or two hit-die attackers.  Heck, he may well overcome a force of fifteen or twenty - but 400 is an ARMY.  No way a single fighter - I don't care what level he is - is going to take down an entire ARMY on his own.  <br>
<br>
On the subject of playing evil: <br>
<br>
It's been my experience in 20 years of tabletop gaming that people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> don't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like to play evil characters as a matter of course.  Sure, it's nice as a diversion, but folks generally want to be the hero.  Heck, even Elric did right more often than not (albiet for the wrong reasons).<br>
<br>
White Wolf's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> World of Darkness</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is NOT geared toward role-playing evil.  Of all the varying facets, only in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Vampire</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are the players inherantly tainted.  Even so, if you play the game as it is written, the players struggle against their natures and against the twisted Kindred society - &quot;their heroic deeds shine all the brighter for the darkness within them.&quot;<br>
<br>

If one assumes the warrior is tireless(which some GMs make the mistake of not keeping track of) I would not be surprised to see the warrior win.  After all, they CAN'T kill him 6 at a time.

<br>
Here are three things he can add to the mix.  Fatigue, Ground conditions, and Grappling.<br>
<br>
Fatigue.  "You miss this attack round, because your sword arm is getting tired."<br>
<br>
Ground conditions.  "You've slipped on the blood and guts of the fifty slain orcs that lay at your feet.  Roll half your dex or less to see if you've fallen to one knee and lose your agility bonus to AC and your attack for this round."<br>
<br>
Grappling.  Unlike the characters in the average martial arts movie, the npc's will sooner or later try gang tackling rather than straight up melee. "After seeing their comrades fail by trying to strike you, the gnoll leader commands his troops to rush you and attempt to grapple."<br>
<br>

<br>
If everyone agrees that the PCs place in the world is one of vast power, that kings tremble at the rumor of their approach and even the heavens treat them respectfully, that works.  Not my personal favorite campaign style, but to each their own.<br>
<br>
Problems usually appear when the GM envisions a lesser place for the PCs than the players do, and does a poor job of communicating this, by repeatedly trying to put the players in their place via in game trouncings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uarafain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arafain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/18/02 10:59:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://wootage1.homestead.com/files/aoshi2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pen Pencil Rogue Reality</span><hr size=1> Also, with regard to attacks of opportunity as monsters enter your zone of control...<br>
<br>
You don't get an attack of opportunity on any creature that runs right up to you.  Only if they run PAST you or another mitigating circumstance.  Otherwise you could never attack any kind of monster with a ten-foot reach - he'd just stay five feet away from you and keep attacking you, and if someone else tried to close with him in melee, he'd get an attack of opportunity before they ever came close.  Rather nasty with trolls, who have a ten-foot reach and a rend attack. <p><b> -- Veteran Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br> -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic<br> -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend<br> --  Formerly of Requiem of Souls<br> -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br></b><i>"Once, in the old west, a gentleman shot a professional gunfighter in the back.

<br>
I was GM'ing once, and one of my players (a necro) got the bright idea to wipe out a small hamlet. I didn't like the idea, and tried to discourage it. He persisted, so this is what I came up with. Tit was a LONG campagin, and worked out quite nicely if I do say so myself! hehe<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The village was under the protection of a local duke, of modest means and influence, but great ambition. He had been skimming off the top of taxes and tariffs a percent to fund his own bribes to further his own political agenda, and would then send the expected ammount to HIS own Lord, a noble and just man. The Duke was compacient with his own cleverness having purchased all officials involved, and believed his embezzling scheme safe from discovery by his Lord.<br>
<br>
Enter his Lady Wife. A stong woman, willful and resourcful, who resented her husband's regard of her as a &quot;trophy&quot; and of their marriage as a political neccessity. The dutchess had, of course, full knowledge of her husband's scheming, and exerted what little power she had, covertly, to ease the suffering of the serfs of her dutchy.<br>
<br>
News of the massacre of 90-some people within his lands upset the duke, but more becasue it drew attention of his Lord and meant a reduction in his own coffers than becasue of the loss of innocent life. In responce, the duke launched an &quot;investigation&quot; to seek out the perpetrator which would of course, not be much of an investigation at all. An inspector from the Lord would arrive, be schmoozed, and would return to the Lord with reports that the duke was conducting his own thorough investigation and would bring the murderers to justice<br>
<br>
Unbeknownst to the duke (and my soon-to-be regretful player), the hamlet was the birthplace of his Lady's handmaiden; her closest friend and most trusted confidant. Amongst the victims were every single living relative of the Lady's maid.<br>
<br>
When the Lord's inspector arrived, the dutchess cornerd her husband and revealed her knowledge of his embezzling operation, and threatened to expose him to the inspector should the duke not hunt down the murders, and should he kill HER, letters would be sent to the Lord revealign everything.<br>
<br>
The Duke, fearing for his office AND his head, channeled all of his resources (including those he'd been stealing from the taxes) into hunting down my murdersome player and bringing him to justice.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
SO, what happened? I involved my players in the story and let them discover all the subplots. THEN they got to (all good characters) participate in the hunt. hehe It was quite a lengthy chase, and VERY fun. The murdering necromancer was captured and deliverd to the Lord broken in places (hehe), but alive. He met his demise some time later, the result of exposure to the hot summer sun, on public display, while hanging in a cage that negated any casting by the victim inside.<br>
<br>
My &quot;good&quot; players had a jolly time hunting the evil bastard down. hehe I did give him a few chances to escape death, but the dice didn't like him that weekend. lol<br>
<br>
It was probably one of our most fun weekends. Well, fun for all but our necro. He was pissed becasue the character was pretty high-level, and was a few years old. lol HOWEVER, I thought it was poetic justice, becasue no act of great consequence can escape reaction, good or ill. <br>
<br>
If your gaming group has the apropriate players, I'd suggest giving this story a try. We all had a blast. =)<br>
