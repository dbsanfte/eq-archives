<br>
I have several observations to make:<br>
<br>
1. The min/max graph...is accurate and reflects the Mythic statements. But...the damage dealt with each blow within the min/max limits appears to follow a binomial distribution - at least from the limited data I have collected. This means that very low and very high hits are *rare*...the majority fall much nearer the mean damage. This therefore means the impact of raising weapon spec is slightly less impressive than the graph implies. Sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. It would be interesting to plot damage dealt against spec points invested ... perhaps you would see then why Mythic have always suggested that specc'ing to 50 is *not* an optimum route to take.<br>
<br>
3. Most of us know that cs styles are a bonus % of the base weapon damage. For instance, PA vs a green mob adds 61% of my base damage - I'm lvl 33 SB. Garrote adds 28%, Achilles 38%...and so on...so you can see that improving base weapon damage is immediately reflected in your cs style bonus.<br>
<br>
4. What many don't realise is that the percentage bonus is variable and depends principally on the con of the target. Hitting greys is not a very informative exercise as you will encounter damage caps very quickly which distort the overall picture. To get good data on this needs first of all *lots* and *lots* of hits and these have to be done on a variety of different colour con mobs. I am having to solo most of this and as you can imagine, collecting data from the oranges will be a bitch <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I feel that the most vaulable info will come from yellow con mobs - after all thats what all the enemy should be once we reach lvl 50 (dreams on)<br>
<br>
5. Finally...I have an odd template currently in that I have no weapon spec at all. I do have 98 points saved and after next level will have 160 plus. I plan to spend it all on swords and:<br>
<br>
     a) log the effect of cs skill and weapon skill on base weapon damage, PA, Garrotte and Achilles<br>
     b) do this on green, blue, yellow and orange mobs. I will also test that %ages are the same for different          mobs of same colour<br>
     c) I will take weapon skill from 1 to around 20 in stages keeping Quickness the same on all tests<br>
     d) I will raise cs skill by up to 5 (items) at each weapon skill stage to compare effect with weapon spec<br>
<br>
and post it all here for general discussion and your delight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Unfortunately #3 is not true. Your comments in #4 quickly explain why #3 isn't true. If it was a precentage bonus it wouldn't change based on the con of the mob.<br>
<br>
Styles I believe actually have a SET DPS that is based on the amount you are spec'd in that weapon type. I as a Hero am fully Spec'd in Large Weapons. At full Spec my Frontal Assalt is about 33 DPS. This means with a 5.4 second Hammer and 45 QUI I do about 130 Damage with the style. The actual amount of the style varies perfectly with the damage done with a given weapon but if I change weapons that have same delay but different DPS I see the same varience but at a hugely different percentage. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now the main question is what raises the style damage DPS on Critical Strikes? Is it your Spec in Critical Strikes? Or is it your Spec in the Weapon you are using? If it was Critical Strikes then there would be very little reason to put points into a weapon type such as Pierce, or it might be that the random roll that is used for the base damage is also used for the critical strike and that random roll is constrained by your skill in your weapon type but the style damage does increase as you increase Critical Strike.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see anyone that challenges my theory to conduct the test I recommend and come back here and report the results.<br>
<br>
The test is thus: Get a weapon appropriate to your level, say you are level 45, get a nice 14 DPS weapon of some delay say 3 seconds. Go out and kill some low greens. Notice you will get different amounts of Style and Base damage but they will move together giving the effect of the &quot;% of base&quot; theory so many people believe. Now get a store bought weapon of equal delay (3 seconds) but much lower DPS (say 1.5dps) you will see that your base damage drops considerably but your style damage is about the same.  (Make sure you have same QUI with both weapons as QUI effects Style damage). <p><table style=filter:glow(color=#FFFFFF

I believe - and I need to redo this after the last patch - that the percentage bonus from cs styles does vary depending on the con of the mob.<br>
<br>
The percentages I gave were for hitting the same type of green con mob. So they are fixed for that TYPE of mob and prob for that CON of mob...but I suspect changing the con will alter the percentages.<br>

<br>
Yes - the average strike damage is a good representation of damage inflicted but my point is that the graph can be read - if you didnt know about effects of the binomial distribution - as though all damage values within the range are equally likely.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I'm odd but I won't place my faith in a single mean value...I have a better feel for the damage I am likely to inflict if I consider it in terms of plus or minus 1-2 standard deviations from the mean. Nobody else feel this way?<br>
<br>
Dither,<br>
<br>
yes faede, and this is also pretty well known. classes that full spec in weapon have dramatically better damage<br>
                            output, and rogues that have went full spec weapon and high left axe are able to solo yellow very very easily,<br>

<br>
I have followed a lot of your posts Dither and you always have good points and make them well ...and I know this is a pet issue with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Mythic have been consistent in advising us that this is the case. What I am trying to do is provide demonstrable proof that the code actually works in the way they claim. I'm afraid I won't take their word for it (witness the farcical patch on 29/1). <br>
<br>
I also agree that high weapon/LA seems to be the best way to max your damage output as a SB...I just like swords and although 2H ax prob does more PA damage due to lower speed, there have always been more and better sword drops out there. Player made weapons may change this of course but now we have the epic area drops - whatever they prove to be - to consider.<br>
<br>
Finally, I can take swords to at least 40 and get into that &gt;2/3 range to increase damage - I cant do that speccing Ax and LA.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufaedeblack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FaedeBlack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/30/02 7:31:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1946.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the proof you asked for re &gt;2/3 spec</span><hr size=1> So i guess when it comes down to it, we need to test this stuff out.<br>

<br>
Actually from what I've seen the percentages while sticking with the same weapon are consistant from level -0- grey all the way to Purple. At a given QUI with a Given Weapon DPS and Given SPD on the weapon I hit for ~60% with my Frontal Assault style every time whether I hit for 300 or 100. Often I hit much higher on greens than purples but percentage remains steady. Its possible Critical Strike works differently. <br>
<br>
However when you change weapons the Percentage changes drastically indicating it has nothing to do with base damage of the weapon. Also when you change QUI it changes drastically again indicating it has nothing to do with the base damage of the weapon since base damage doesn't change when you change quick.<br>
<br>
The percentages aren't fixed at all.
