--Story-<br>
<br>
Vehemence had been nestled in his bed since well passed the midnight equinox when the sudden shift in the wind woke him. The wards and traps set in his room were all still valid leaving only the window to pay close attention to. Suddenly the image of Tani appeared from the shadows in front of him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Jadduk, Vehemence Belaern the king has need of your houses services again.&quot; Tani said while kneeling.<br>
<br>
Vehemence Belaern, once the stepping stone of all Neriak now the sole Patron to Qu'ellar Belaern could not believe what he was hearing. Where was this king when his precious light races ignited the flames of war within his families home, nearly destroying all that was dear to him. Bah! He would hear no more of it. With a motion of his hand requested Tani to rise.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not interested in what the king has to say. You may relay to him that I do not answer to him or the Queen. I am still trying to rebuild our once proud house.&quot; A slight sneer rose across Tani's face and than quickly disappeared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sire, it would seem that the king is willing to commission you to slay the people involved in killing Myrkolar and be sent out to gain Ragebringer itself.&quot; Tani slightly grinned at this obvious lie.<br>
<br>
Vehemence's eyes seemed to shine at the mention of the weapon. Stanos himself had stolen this sacred weapon from the halls of Belaern many a year before, if there was even a slight chance of getting such a weapon within Belaern again his ability to command would be without question and many allies of the house would call again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine. List what is to be done Tani and begone. Do not return to my home until I have asked. I must train and gather what few allies we have with the Belaern and be off.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Tani handed a parchment with all of the  tasks that needed to be done and before Vehemence could look up from the paper Tani was gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn him.&quot; Vehemence exclaimed while reading the letter.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Vendui Belaern,<br>
We have found that the iksar we thought to be our ally in the fight to unify Kunark is not what he seems. He is but a shade. It is requested that you and your friends travel to Charassis and hunt Drusella Sathir. Once she is found you will know what to do. <br>
When this task is complete you will than need to go to Karnor's and destroy Venril himself. Oh I understand your concern for what the commanders of the outpost will think of you, but you are Vehemence Belaern, and no matter what anyone says you Belaern's find a way to stay around.<br>
This needs to be done soon I will send supplies in transit. It would be wise to keep this negotiation a secret and travel via your outpost. We would not want to alert your presence to those within Firona Vie.<br>
Good luck, and farewell.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
As Vehemence set the letter down he almost bit his lip. <br>
<br>
&quot;What have I done?&quot; Vehemence asked himself. Go to Howling Stones hunt the Shade and than slay Venril himself. Oh this is not my day.<br>
<br>
With that the Dark Elf crawled back into his covers. A small smile seemed to crease his face at the thought of gathering allies for a glorious battle and more training to rebuild Qu'ellar Belaern.<br>
<br>
Tani smirked as he watched Vehemence sleep. &quot;The fool has no clue this is to finally kill him and severe all ties of this Noble house of Neriak.&quot; Tani thought to himself: Bah! Worthless I say, they would be better if they let me just kill him and put him out of his . . . &quot; His sentence was cut short with a Blood Point embedded into the wall next to him. A trickle of blood now dripped from his right cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said go.&quot; Vehemence Belaern said staring dead into the shadow Tani thought himself so well hidden in. With that he stepped out of the shadows and bowed. This time leaving through the window. As Tani leapt from the building he looked over his shoulder remembering a phrase said to him as a child. &quot;Never turn your back on a Belaern. Never!&quot; With that thought Tani looked up at the window to the First Jadduk and Patron of Qu'ellar Belaern just in time to see Vehemence closing the shutters to his window. A fine steel throwing dagger in his hand, no doubt dipped in some type of poison. Tani hurried down the alley and back to the Ebon Hand.<br>
