Both are rogues and half elfs (because that is the only race/class combonation i can stand playing =p)<br>
<br>
Here is Ralluwen's story:<br>
Ralluwen was born by his wood elven mother; when he was concieved she was a barmaid working in a local tavern of the wood elf city of Kelethin. A human adventure felt the city of Kelethin had not given him what he deserved, so he took Ralluwen's mother. His fathers identity was never exposed and was taken to his mothers grave when she died many years later. Ralluwen, as a Half Elf, was never truly accepted by the wood elves but, like many half elves, became a Scout of his home city. Ralluwen has little allegience to any one though he has an inate hatred of humans and kinship to wood elves. Ralluwen still seeks his father, though he is likely long gone, but has little to offer the man that so brutually gave him life. All he cares to bestow is a blade in the back, and as he swore, he will return that blade to his mothers grave, as a bond for his fathers soul to forever protect his mothers in whatever is beyond final death. However Ralluwen tries to convince himself that there is no afterlife, that Bristlebane gives all things a single chance to exist and be great, and in the end lets death win the game. Ralluwen, though a rogue, feels rules are made to be bent, but never broken as they are what makes a game worth cheating at. He is generous at times, and cruel at others, but often jovial and forgiving. Though he has many a friend and foe, he has yet to find a true soulmate or a true nemisis.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, the plot has thickened and Ralluwen thinks he may have finally found a lead to discovering who and where his father might be.  Turns out Rinolwen was born and raised in freeport and is the son of a human female, who's brother (Rinolwen's Uncle) fits the right time, place, and description of Ralluwen's mysterious father.  Supposedly this man was the commander of a patrol for the Freeport Militia ordered to 'acquire' some dwarven ore and an new gnomish invention.  On the way though the patrol decided to stop off in Kelethin and sample some of the fine taverns there.  Rinolwens uncle supposedly told, even bragged to, Rinolwen's mother about how 'easy' some elven barmaid was.  At the time Rinolwen's Uncle was 28, and his mother was only 17.  Rinolwen was born when his mother was 32 and she died at age 55 some 32 years ago; making the incident about 70 years ago, and Ralluwen is, you guess it just about 70 years old (note that elven hiretige allowes them a life span of about 100 to 150 years).  Problem is this would make Ralluwens father 98, which is not normal for a human (note that human life spans for this type of era are about 50-70 years)  And it gets even thicker.  Turns out Rinolwens father was an elven ranger.  At about age 32 Rinolwen's uncle left on a mission and did not return.  10 years later when Rinolwens mother was 31 she met and married her husband and one year later gave birth to Rinolwen.  About 5 years after Rinolwen's birth his uncle suddenly returned and bearing a newly fueled disgust for all elves he was enraged at his sisters chioce for a husband, he killed Rinolwen's father and was about to kill Rinolwen when his mother gouged out her crazed brothers eye with a fork (ouch).  He then fled and has yet to return.  So believing that they are cousins, Ralluwen and the much younger, and rasher, cousin, Rinolwen, now quest together as family and fellow rogues in search of this elusive 'one-eyed' man, or his final remains, in order to answer questions that would otherwise forever haunt them.  Besides 'What would like on your tombstone?' Ralluwen's question is 'Are you my father.' and Rinolwen's question is 'What happened in those 16 years that made you so hateful to elves that you go from raping a elf to killing my father for being one?'<br>
