We tried that the last battle and were not successfull at keeping him out of the great room.<br>

Either somebody opened the door and let him in or he opens the door himself if not pinned against the wall.<br>

<br>
Wherever you decide to fight him (both the ones mentioned work brt), try to make sure your MT is on the phone with someone, or two boxing another toon at the fight.  He'll be blind about 90% of the fight, and if not positioned correctly, getting blown all over the place, not holding aggro, etc.  <br>
<br>
Until Verant &quot;fixes&quot; blind to only remove the rendered image (possible with the new UI, since the windows are overlays instead of part of the rendered image), having someone tell the MT where he is/facing, or being able to watch from another toon's point of view, is pretty much the only way I can &quot;see&quot; to keeping positioning down reliably.  Even if you can keep in the corner, getting spun by a stun can really mess things up...<br>

Im looking for more info on him too. Last time we tried him one of our clerics got aggro too early, was summoned and killed.

Greig is a puzzle mob.<br>
<br>
Figuring him out is 90% of the battle... once you know, and can execute the strat he is terribly easy.<br>
<br>
I know this is small comfort if you are looking for more info, but that 'more info' is basically handing him over.  Sit down with your braintrust and experiment.  Figuring out these kinds of mobs are among the best experiences in the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueasirok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>easirok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 9:36:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11665.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone know a strategy to take down Grieg?</span><hr size=1> There is probably a dozen ways to kill him, all with their own merits and flaws.<br>
<br>
After a few tries and a lot of thinking about how to deal with his annoying AEs, this is what we do (and it always works now):<br>
<br>
Clerics make balanced groups. Key is to have healing distributed among the melee. Casters can all group together. If they are paying attention, they wont take damage.<br>
<br>
Coming in from the portal room, go through the door, and up the stairs, then it makes a right turn. We place our clerics and casters there on the right wall to sheild them from AE.<br>
<br>
Coming in from the portal room, next to the door, on the right hand side, in the hallway, before the first flight of steps. This is where ALL melee wait (no exceptions).<br>
<br>
There is not really a MT. You can designate one and he can taunt his heart out, it just dont end up with that one tanking. Treat all melee as shifting MTs, heal whomever needs it. Hence the spreading of your healing ability to every group. Clerics also can target group members with F2-F6 a lot easier than using /target.<br>
<br>
Greig is indifferent/dubious until aggroed. His 4 guards are fast respawn - 10 minutes or less. Just pull the guards as fast as you can kill them... you dont want an add during the fight as it just complicates an already annoying fight.<br>
<br>
Use a shadowknight to snare pull him (high aggro) down the steps, past the casters (they will all suffer heart attacks - but the SK should have sufficient aggro that greig ignores them), and stop right before the door, directly next to the melee. If the SK can get away with it, FD right away so the melee can get him turned towards them.<br>
<br>
Then all melee just start beating the piss out of greig. He will be placed with back against one wall next to door, melee with back against the opposite hallway wall.<br>
<br>
Your rogues will need to leave their ego at the door for this one, because nobody will be standing behind greig (at least not for long).<br>
<br>
He has two AEs and one single-target attack. His melee is a joke - it ranks equal or lower than his guards, especially once slowed.<br>
<br>
The single-target attack is a blindness, not sure if its got Curse or Poison or Disease counters, but if this positioning strategy is used, it wont matter since you will always be facing him and never out of range.<br>
<br>
The first AE is &quot;Gravel Rain&quot;, easily resistable snare. However, this fight lasts long enough that it WILL eventually hit you, and combined with the other AE and blindness can really screw up your melee. Even more annoying is the snare will last for a very long time and in some cases (has happened to me) it will still be on you even after death. Could not find any way to cure it, just had to wait it out or hope /duel clears it.<br>
<br>
The other AE is a strange knockback/stun. Its resistable, but VERY hard to resist (magic based). If you resist more than one or two the whole fight, then you are a very lucky person. The knockback portion of this effect kicks everyone within greig's line of sight to DIRECTLY where he is facing, and you wont stop until you hit a wall (yay all melee get pinned in a corner, unable to move from the pile-up). The stun portion affects you once you land, and is a good 6-8 seconds long. He procs this AE about every 15 or so seconds as best I can tell.<br>
<br>
If your melee are positioned as I mention, across a hallway from him, he will always be facing them, and they will never get thrown out of melee range from the knockback (backs are to the wall already). As soon as the stun wears off, all melee will be able to resume fighting, without worry about the snare that will inevitably hit them or the blindness. Have a melee call out the *stun* AEs, so your casters can step out for nukes between them. Healers are always protected from AE by the corner and should never be out of range. If he somehow does manage to go after your casters, a simple Stun cast by a paladin will easily grab his attention and you can pull him back down to where you want him.<br>
<br>
Last thing.... when he close to death make SURE he is not tight against a wall. Even if you have to prolong the final moments of the fight, pull him out into the middle of the hallway for the killing blow. If he dies too close to a wall, the human version (one with loot) will poof when it dies, and that will just make everyone mad.<br>

Works fine, knockback doesn't turn you around so just holding the down arrow keeps you in position.  Clerics usually hide outside and get jammed into the corner by the door by his aoe.  Does no damage around walls, but still moves them.  He kicked our asses many times with warriors trying to do the same thing, then we did this and he's a joke. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/urezer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rezer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.pacbell.net/cappies/pictures/ghost.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 7/31/02 1:27:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upeacefulsalvation.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peaceful Salvation</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/02 8:05:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11665.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone know a strategy to take down Grieg?</span><hr size=1> Do his guards aggro when they respawn during the fight, or can you pull him far enough away from his guards' spawn point?

Position spam healers and casters on the wall on the first flight of stairs going up by grieg, use the wall to block the AE.  Have melees there too ready to rush once the warrior has gotten argo.<br>
2nd) position a warrior and paladin and shadowknight at the corner between the two rows of stairs near the door where Grieg is.<br>
3rd) Puller pulls Grieg out of the room down the stairs, SK then whacks him with HT and dies to position him.  Hell add in a sacarficial chanter to die and do a tash on him as well to keep him in the corner.<br>
4th) Have Warrior start whacking Grieg to get argo, when warrior gets low, Paladin LOH's and dies.  Don't have anyone start healing or debuffing till warrior has got argo.<br>
5th) Do a few spam heals on the warrior and then start debuffing.<br>
6th) LOH rotation and all melees engage.<br>
7th) sit back and kill grieg and then his 1hp corporeal version and enjoy some loot.<br>
<br>
Its about that easy.  And a warrior can maintain argo as long as he's given time to build it up.  Griegs AE is for all extents and purposes unresistable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufendrylistalindir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fendryl Istalindir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 9:28:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11665.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: song</span><hr size=1> 4.5) pray that people don't get pushed through the geometry &amp; ported out to Scarlet Desert.<br>
