He was stronger than the other High Elven children in the town, and was also very advance for his age in his school work.  His strength and wisdom progressed as he got older, and was nearly finished with school when he decided he needed to move on.  Tamazar had done most of the grudge work in Felwithe for just about anyone who needed help, and was, at the time, the strongest elf in all of Faydwer.  <br>
<br>
When he was 19 years old, he informed his parents that he would be leaving the city... not for good, but for a long time perhaps.  &quot;Why?&quot;, his mother asked, &quot;Why would you leave your home?&quot;  Tamazar replied confidently, &quot;Mother, I wish to fight for the honor of our city.&quot;  There had never been a High Elf that was born with the blood of a Warrior, &quot;Could he be the one?&quot;, his mother thought to herself.  She was in awe at the unusually large stature of her only son, she herself was an Enchantress of Tunare and his father a very powerful Wizard.<br>
<br>
Tamazar gathered his belongings from their small house, kissed his mother goodbye and walked out the door.  The tension that had been in his mother's mind before he left quickly vanished, as now she felt like he had forgotten something.  &quot;Of course,&quot;, she thought out loud, &quot;money!!!&quot;  She quickly ran to her own small bedroom, reached into a hidden compartment in the wall, and removed a small leather purse full of Platinum pieces.  She ran from the house towards the city gates to meet her son there to ensure that he would have enough money to buy needed supplies for his journey.<br>
<br>
Tamazar slowed as he came to the gate and saw his mother, whom he had just left a few minutes ago.  Without a word, she handed him the purse, hugged him, and walked back home.  &quot;Mother, I shall return!&quot;, cried Tamazar as she slowly walked away.  He left the city gates somewhat saddened by the previous events.  Upon reaching the wooded area just outside the city limits, Tamazar pulled out his hatchet and began looking for deadfall trees to chop and use as firewood.  &quot;If only I had father's skill,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I wouldn't need wood for a fire at all.&quot;  Tamazar found a suitable tree, a birch, known throughout Felwithe as the best type of tree for building a fire.  As he was taught as a small boy, he stacked the newly chopped wood, and removed two small rocks from his pocket.  He smacked the rocks together repeatedly, causing sparks to fly from his hands and into the pile of wood.  Eventually, the sparks caught the wood on fire, and Tamazar sat, thinking about his journey ahead.<br>
<br>
In the morning, Tamazar awoke to the sound of birds chirping in the distance.  &quot;A more beautiful day, I have never seen.&quot; he said to himself, and began collecting his gear once again.  He opened his backpack and pulled out a hand sewn leather tunic, leather pants, and a short sword.  Having made sure his fire was extinguished, he began walking deeper into the woods.  He was unsure of where he was headed, as he had never left the city before last night.  He continued walking however, and eventually found monsters in his path.<br>
<br>
They were like nothing he had ever seen before.  As he was still quite far away, they hadn't seen him yet, but he was unsure how long it would be before they did catch a glimpse of his movement.  He sat again, and removed a large book from his backpack.  He opened to the first page, and it was blank.  He removed the enchanted quill his mother had given him from the bindings of the book and placed the point of the quill on the page.  On its own, the quill began dancing all over the page, copying the image in Tamazar's head.  It drew the monster exactly as Tamazar had seen them, and stood completely still on the page when it was finished.  He replaced the quill and the book, stood up, and slowly moved toward the two ugly creatures.<br>
<br>
As he crept nearer to the creatures, he could hear them 'talking'... but he couldn't understand a word of what they were saying.  Suddenly, he stepped on a branch and the monsters snapped their heads in his direction.  They began running towards him shouting unknown obsenities about Tamazar, and he drew his short sword from it's sheath and began defending against the attackers.  He blocked slash after slash from the two vile creatures and quickly reached over his own shoulder and pulled from his pack a chained mace.  Swinging from the backpack, the head of the mace came crashing down on the first monster's head, killing it instantly.  The second fell soon after from the same force.<br>
<br>
In his rush of adrenaline, Tamazar failed to notice that he had been cut by one of the creatures.  He bent down to pick up the change he found near one of the creatures' corpses and the sight of the blood on his arm made him grasp the wound tightly.  A warming calm came immediately over him, and when he removed his hand from the wound, it was gone.  Not even a scar remained.  &quot;What is this?&quot; Tamazar wondered.  Never had this happened to him before, and it scared him greatly.  He began to break into a full run towards his home town of Felwithe once again, and entered into the guild of High Priests.<br>

He was extremely tired as he entered the church and knelt before the High Priest in front of him.  &quot;Father, I have been on a journey to the great lands outside of Felwithe.&quot; Tamazar's breathing began to slow as the Priest placed his hand on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you see on your journey?&quot; asked the priest.<br>
<br>
Tamazar quickly replied, &quot;While my journey was not long, I did see many creatures.  Giant Wasps and Bats littered the landscape, and I occasionally saw skeletons of fallen elves walking as if they were alive.&quot;  Here, the young elf paused.  He removed his pack and pulled out his notebook.  He turned to the page with the drawing that his quill had so perfectly made, showed it to the priest and continued.  &quot;This, Father, is why I returned so soon.  I saw two of these creatures, and they did not speak in the elven tongue.  I could not understand anything they said as they ran towards me.  They were quite weak however, and my mace and short sword quickly dispatched both of them.&quot;  Tamazar went on, &quot;Before it died however, one of the creatures managed to slice open my arm.  When I noticed the gash, I placed my hand over it to stop the bleeding, and instantly, the wound disappeared.  Not even a scar remained.&quot;<br>
<br>
The priest looked at the drawing and began speaking.  &quot;The creatures you met, my son, are Orcs of the Clan of Crushbone.  They were probably scouts send by the Emperor to find a good target for their next raid.  I praise you for killing them as quickly as you did, orcs are quite strong.  You shall be honored at our next mass for dispatching the vile beasts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What about my injury, Father?&quot;, asked Tamazar.<br>
<br>
&quot;My son, you are the first Elf I have ever seen with the powers you have described.  I have heard of Humans and Dwarves with the same ability to heal themselves.  I believe you are a Paladin.  In due time, you will be granted the powers of the High Priests as well.  You must use your skills wisely, as you can save the lives of both yourself, and your comrades in battle.  Your ability to heal yourself can only be used once a day however, and will completely heal you of any injuries you have sustained.  Use it wisely.&quot;<br>
<br>
The priest walked towards the altar with Tamazar at his side.  He picked up a piece of parchment and his quill.  As he spoke, the quill wrote, &quot;My dear Drazen Agestim, Master Tailor of Felwithe.  We have in our midst the first and only Paladin to be born within our city walls.  Please create for him a garment that will be recognized throughout Norrath to show Tamazar Fleethart's stature.  He shall be honored at the next mass as the first Paladin of Tunare.  Signed, Quintane Solen, High Priest of Tunare.&quot;<br>
<br>
He gave the rolled parchment to Tamazar and instructed him to go to the tailor's shop on the east side of the city.  Tamazar knelt before the priest in reverence and went on his way.  He went directly to the tailor's shop and handed the note to Drazen Agestim.  Dragen read the words on the parchment, nodded, and began instructing his assistants to find the highest quality silks and fabrics they could find.  &quot;Return in two days time young man, and your garment will be finished.&quot;, said Drazen, and Tamazar left the shop without a word.  He was very excited to tell his parents of the news he had received, although he didn't quite understand the possibilities and quests his future had in store for him.<br>
<br>
When he arrived at his small home in North Felwithe, he was greeted by his parents.  &quot;Mother, Father!!!  I have great news.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it, my son?&quot;, replied his father.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a Paladin.  The priest told me I am the first and only Paladin to ever be born in Felwithe.  I have the power to heal myself and others.  The priest is having something made for me at the tailor's shop and blessing me at the next Mass.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is outstanding news!&quot;, replied his mother, and she hugged him before she finished speaking.  &quot;I will make a great feast.  We will eat heartily tonight.&quot;, and eat they did.  Tamazar was so full, that after dinner, he went straight to bed, and slept until the sun rose the next morning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usadelia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadelia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/31/01 5:41:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~pamalam/_uimages/kitty.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Birth of a Paladin: Continued</span><hr size=1> good story! <p><table border="0" width="545" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

He packed his gear silently, ever so carefully, so as to fit everything he had into it.  He left it on his bed and strolled happily outside.  It was a beautiful morning, with the sounds of the forest outside the small town echoing in his ears.  Many people, like him were also up and active, but none wore such a large smile on his face as did Tamazar.  He placed his hands inside his sleeves as it was slightly chilly this morning, and began his walk to the tailor's shop.<br>
     People all around him were talking to him, staring in amazement, and just plain being friendly as he walked down the streets of Felwithe.  He stopped to pet his friend's wolf puppy, and continued on his way.  It was about thirty minutes before he saw the shop, since he had walked so slowly and stopped to talk to many people.  He noticed the shop was still closed, but the candles inside were still alive with light.  He calmly sat down and waited, hiding his excitement about what would happen later in the day.<br>
     The shop keeper opened the door promptly at 7am, and Tamazar shuffled in quickly.  Before him, the Tailor's assistant held a beautiful robe with a winged heart embriodered in the center, the mark of his family for over forty centuries.  As everyone knows, elves live a very long time, some well into their fifth and sixth centuries.  Tamazar was 50 years old, and not even half finished with all his training in the fine arts of Elven Fighting.  The assistant broght the robe to Tamazar and placed it over his head.  He then went back into the rear of the shop and returned with a heavy belt that was placed around Tamazar's waist.  He looked like a heavenly knight, he noticed as he gazed at himself in the mirror for a moment.  He realized that it was now 8am and he had to get back home.  He removed the robes and belt, handed them back to the assistant, and started his short run home after thanking the Tailor.  The tailor promised him the cloak would be done before the day's mass started.<br>
