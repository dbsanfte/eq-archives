<br>
Q:  Why do I always get attacked by adds when I'm hidden when fighting with a group?<br>
<br>
A:  In Dark Age of Camelot aggro is group based, not simply single target based, therefore, when a puller pulls a group of mobs, aggro transfers to all members of the group in a sense, the puller naturally being the brunt of it via proximity and whatever arrow/debuff/DD he pulled with.  A hidden rogue thereby gains aggro despite being hidden, if you've ever ran from a mob long enough to get far enough away to hide, you'll rapidly learn that being hidden doesn't wipe aggro. On top of that there seems to be a flag within the system that rogues are flagged as a higher target because of being hidden assassin types.  It's likely this is an artifact from &quot;scout&quot; type mobs (Mobs who can naturally see rogues from a distance, and reveal hidden rogues like all mobs.) and it's applying to normal mobs for some reason. Irregardless, this bug has no ETA for resolution, and is something you are going to have to cope with.  If you are in a group pulling several high reds to purples it may cost you your life if you are unaware of it.<br>
<br>
Q:  Why do mobs keep frenzying on me and the tank can't taunt them off after a backstab, should I not backstab?<br>
<br>
A:  No, you should backstab or perform your later criticals, if this is a regular problem (Which it can be your life if you're fighting high reds and beyond) then you should take steps to rectify the situation.  The first is taking a bit of time to allow the tank to get a taunt or two in.  In constant multiple pull situations, the time it takes you to run off and hide, and get back, a tank will generally have taunt, it's mostly in single pulls where this is an issue.  You may lose a few hits, and reduce your effectiveness a bit, but nothing harms downtime and general group morale than a party member dying, or dying regularly.  Your experience bar will be none too pleased either. <br>
<br>
Q:  I'm setting up a good distance from my puller and following the target in, and it's hitting me despite it not being aggroed on me and I'm hidden! What's going on?<br>
<br>
A:  This also relates to the above issue of group aggro and all sorts of other unidentifiable issues.  This is also a bug, the finest solution is just to keep your distance as a mob is being brought in.  It might cost you a hit or two on your opponent, but it'll save you several hits, and your healer some mana as well.<br>
<br>
Q: What is &quot;stick&quot; and how do I use it?<br>
A: Stick or /stick (How it is applied) is an auto follow command, but keeps you within melee range at all times of your target presuming your movement allows it (IE, if you're hidden, your target is gonna outrun you if it's moving quickly.) This is stick as the title applies, you can strafe and maneuver for your critical to your heart's desire.  It has been recently patched to have a small range associated with it.  Use stick to your advantage.<br>
<br>
Q:  Are poisons useless in groups?<br>
A:  Yes and no.  In small groups, up to four mayhap, the dot poison is particularly useful if you're fighting high cons, the extra punch can make or break a battle, and due to a battle's long length due to your small group, your dot gets to run its full length, sometimes you may be able to get off as many as two.  The crippling poison can also be mildly useful, again, in a small group the benefits become more obvious.  <br>
<br>
But even in large groups some poisons can still be useful.  The snare poison, for example, is heavily overlooked.  A wise rogue always has a blade with snare poison on it, always.  If you are the last alive and your healer is being chased down, whip out a slow delay weapon (Yes slow) and smack that mob.  This could be a grey broadsword and you're specializing in piercing/thrust, it doesn't matter.  The goal is not to damage the mob, it's to hit it with the poison, the low delay gives you more control over breaking the snare, as hitting it again will wear off the poison's effects.  Once the poison kicks in, it's now snared and your healer will be able to get away.  This can be the difference of your group spending 20 minutes on horse rides or getting a bunch of free rezzes.  Particularly adept groups can adapt the snare poison as a form of crowd control as well.  Since a hidden rogue will almost always get aggro to begin with, bring the add to you, and smack it with a snare poison.  Then proceed to kite it around for a wee bit (It is only a wee bit, but better than nothing) while the rest of your group smacks the primary target.<br>
<br>
In large groups tearing through purples every 20 seconds, your poisons aren't going to be as useful.  But in small groups doing single targets multiple spell lines and styles (Those which are Area Effect based) have no purpose as well.  As in all abilities, envenom has it's profoundly useful spots and it's minimally useful spots.<br>
<br>
General tips: <br>
<br>
-Get in the habit of always sitting after a mob dies.  A rogue in particular needs all the stamina they can get. There is nothing worse than chatting and forgetting to sit and having your puller bring back three mobs and you're half fatigue.  In the frontier this isn't such a bright idea, and you'll need to fight more conservatively to preserve your stamina.<br>
<br>
-Do not be lazy and use a single style bank.  By the time you are 20 you will have more styles than you know what to do with.  Set up multiple hotkey banks for multiple situations.  In an ideal group you will never need your taunt.  But things are rarely ideal, sometimes you will need that taunt to get it off of a healer.  Having it in a nearby bank will make things easier.  The same goes for styles you previously thought outdated, Pincer seems much more desirable when you don't have enough stamina to perform a garrote but really need a little extra punch.  Shift and the number of the hotkey bank will allow you to toggle between your hotkey banks as easily as you dance through your styles.<br>
