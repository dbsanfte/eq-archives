<br>
To get Amontephena to spawn, kill all the mummies, Amontephena is a rare pop anywhere a mummy can pop.<br>
<br>
To leave the 4th floor, use the key you needed to get INTO the 4th floor on the locked door to the right as you entered the 4th floor.<br>

If you fall into the pit on the 4th floor, run around the lower level until you see the firepot.

I've spent ALOT of time in ToFS, so here's what I can tell you about keys/invis travel/killing Tserrina:<br>
<br>
First off, you only need one key per group-or one per raid if the person with the keys doesn't mind running/gating back out and bringing people in. Keys are NOT soulbonded, so be ready with someone to summon corpses if you get a wipeout.<br>
<br>
2nd floor key: When you zone in from Iceclad, you will be in a short hallway leading to a circular room with slippery floors and a pit full of skeles in the middle. There are three hallways on either side of the room. Go to the middle hall on the left side-there is a trap a little ways down the hall that will summon a handful of skeles in the small room at the end of the hall. Camp out in that room and spring the trap every so often and you will get the Large Undead Gnoll pretty quickly-longest time I've waited was about an hour, usually within fifteen minutes. Note, alot of people say to kill everything on the floor to get the key. I've seen people waste four hours doing this-after I told them to camp out in that room, they had three keys within an hour. Opposite the entrance area, are two spectre looking mobs (Lesser Ice Shades) and past them is a small hallway that branches right and left. The mirror to the left takes you to the infamous mirror room at the top of the tower (need the key off Tserrina to do this), the one on the right will take you to the second floor. Exit mirror to Iceclad is on the wall behind you when you first zone in.<br>
<br>
3rd floor key: The second floor is a huge library full of ghosts. Basically, slaughter everything and hope you get lucky on a spawn of the Enraged Librarian-she is a corpse spawn off of any mob on the level. I've spent anywhere from walking in and seeing her up to two hours on getting this key. Mirror to 3rd floor is straight back from the entrance at the end of a short hallway. Exit mirror is in the back of the room, in the far left (NW) corner-there is a bookcase here that slides open and reveals a short hallway with the exit mirror at the end.<br>
<br>
4th floor key: Third level sucks, honestly-its my least favorite level in the whole place. The Armored Shadows here hit for way too much and have far too many HP. I've seen people who can stroll through 4th floor get smacked around pretty hard on 3rd. Like the second floor, find a comfortable place to camp (the kitchen at the end of the hall to the right of the entrance or near the mirror to fourth floor (go right from entrance to the end of the hall, turn left just before you enter the kitchen, go to the end of that hallway and follow it around to the mirror to the next floor) are probably the best spots) and pull everything you can-an Enraged Shadowbeast will eventually corpse spawn and drop the key. Exit mirror is found by going right from the entrance, left before entering the kitchen and right in the second doorway into a room with a pool of blood and some undead, then left into the next room which looks like a bedroom-exit mirror is in there.<br>
<br>
5th floor key: OK-some of the best exp in game for levels 35-43 is on the 4th floor-I was doing about a level a day here. This place is also one huge maze. To get the key, you need to kill Amonpheta to get Cara Omica to spawn-she can also (rarely) spawn by killing random mobs, but Amon is a guaranteed place holder. Now-Amon can spawn anywhere on the level, including down in the pit that a few false floors can drop you into (to get out of the pit, click on the torch in the center of the room-it will take you back to the entrance). With all the twists and turns, he can be a real pain to find sometimes. Just keep looking. I'll do my best to describe the path to the mirror to 5th, but it will most likely be confusing. Go right from entrance, then left. Take the first of the two side passages to your right and follow it to the end. Turn left there and follow that passage to the end (NOTE: there is a point here where you will see a passage to either side and a small coffin decoration against one wall. If you get engaged by mobs here-MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE HALL-you will get so many adds, it is unreal. We once fought 10 mobs back to back here, and I've seen many wipeouts occur here-seems like half the wandering mobs on the floor path past this point.) When you reach the end of that hallway, the passage will turn left and you will see some alcoves with shadows hiding in them. The wall straight ahead is a false wall, with more shadows behind it-try to take out the first two before you move through. Follow that passage to the end and you will see some stairs leading up to a room with a couple coffins in it-Cara Omica spawns in the coffin on the left. The stairs down lead to another short hall with about 8 shadows in it-the mirror to 5th is at the end of that. The exit mirror is located past the locked door just to the right of the entrance (the key that got you to the 4th floor will open this door)-follow the hallway all the way to the end, turn left and follow that long hallway to the exit mirror. Note: there are alot of mobs in this hallway, so usually the only people that can make it alive while fleeing to safety are those with harmshield/divine aura. FD is rough because shadows cast alot. Usually evac is your best way out of the 4th floor in an emergency.<br>
<br>
6th floor key: Payday! 5th floor is the &quot;wedding&quot;, where some of the nicest loot in the tower drops. This is where rune etched wedding bands, diamond wedding bands, laced veils and ceremonial wedding swords are-and they all drop off of two level 30ish undead. This floor is kind of creepy when you take the time to look around-its full of ushers and wedding guests (there are some stairs on this floor-they only lead to more mobs, nothing special up there). Bridesmaids (female vampire graphic in the small side rooms) are enchanter mobs, so watch out for charms. An Enraged Relative holds the key to 6th and is a random corpse spawn on this level-kill everything and you'll get him eventually. He's quite a bit tougher than anything else on the level (level 45 spectre looking mob compared to 25-33 for the rest). Mirror to 6th is in the back of the level, in the middle passage there and is guarded by two ushers. Exit mirror is just to the right of the entrance from 4th.<br>
<br>
7th floor key: To the left of the entrance is a hallway filled with Icy Shades (spectre graphic) keep killing those till an Ice Shade spawns (alot of times, the Ice is already up, if not, he spawns pretty quickly). Kill the Ice Shade to spawn Vhal`Sera in the next area (will get to that in a moment). Straight ahead and to the right is where the Incoherant Shade (who occasionally corpse spawns Abrahm-for Kael quests and also drops a nice axe and a so-so hammer) spawns. Keep going further back and you'll come to a pair of rooms-the one on the left contains the exit mirror in the back-right corner, but be careful, there is also a nasty fire-based trap with a huge trigger radius that will hit you for a couple hundred damage near the exit. Turning right will lead you to a hallway lined with alcoves that contain shadowed beasts-to get single pulls on them, the puller slides along the side of the hall until the stand right in front of the beast to gain agro, then moves back along the wall to get back to the party. Moving down the center of the hall will agro multiple shadow beasts at every set of alcoves. Following the hallway around leads to a set of stairs going up-at the top of the stairs, stay against the wall till you get to the next room or you will agro the Icy Shades down below. The next room has a mirror in it that requires no key to pass through. This leads to a round room with water around the edges with a couple bats in it. The bats will spawn vampires who like to GFlux upon death. Avoid pushing the vampires into the water or they'll happily Flux you to death while you try to get into the water to cast/attack them. The stairs in the middle of the room lead up to a circular cave filled with bats and, if you spawned him, Vhal`Sera (looks like a genie/efreeti). Killing Vhal`Sera will net you a key-he's alot of fun to fight, IMHO and has a crazy spinning attack that needs to be seen to be appreciated. The mirror under the stairs is your exit mirror for this area-it takes you back to the zone-in point on this level, from there you can go to the exit mirror with the trap. Go up the stairs and follow the cave around either direction (its circular). At the back is a hand holding a red bowl in the wall-clicking on this with the key will take you to 7th.<br>
<br>
Master key: From the entrance, move straight ahead, and go either way around the pillar in the middle. The tapestries on the walls are traps, but don't hit for much-maybe 40-50 pts. You will come to a rectangular room with a well in the middle-this is a good point to pull the various familiars (look like drakes) in the nearby area to. You can then go either right or left out of this room (leads to the same place). The next room that you come to will be a huge room with a spiral staircase leading up and is filled with familiars and shadowed torches. Wipe out as much of this room as you can-its probably the most dangerous room in the tower if you go charging blindly into it, but easily handled if you are semi-cautious. Up the stairs and around the hallway leads you to a room with a locked door in the back-pick the lock or use the key from Vhal`Sera to open it-this leads to the mirror room, with the enigmatic locked mirror and 6 other mirrors that lead you back outside. Alternatively, invis/camo/hide-sneak (note, bard invis song does not work, for some reason) and go through the tapestry/secret wall behind the spiral staircase. Invis is crucial here-I usually tell people that if they gain agro, they might was well stand and die, or they'll likely get everyone killed (note, this is for high-40s/low-50s groups, mid-upper 50s groups should be OK, though invis will make your life alot smoother). Go all the way to the back of the hallway. Pull the bats one-by-one to this area. Once again, either a vampire will spawn, or, if you're lucky, Tserrina. The reason to pull them once at a time is Tserrina has been known to spawn off as many as three of the four bats at once, which is just brutal. Bats are on a one hour timer, and Tserrina usually spawns off at least one of them. If you have a pet class, they will usually (about 90% of the time) not be able to get their pet to attack the bat that will spawn Tserrina, though they will attack Tserrina herself. WARNING: If Tserrina is spawned and not killed, she will be at the top of the stairs-she is MUCH harder to defeat up here-she often gates to the hallway at low health (hence the reason to fight her in the hallway whenever possible) and will quickly summon everyone to their doom one by one (had it happen to me once-when I got down there, it was her and three of her little bat friends beating the hell out of me-NOT pretty).<br>
<br>
Fighting Tserrina: Basically 100% MR, lures will land, as will fire based spells, especially if you have a druid along to cast Ro's Firey Sundering/Smoldering Disjunction. Very resistant to changes in movement speed (snare/slow). Never seen one land, to be honest, not even off ranger epic. Buff the hell out of MR-she likes to charm and blind. Poision is a solid choice for secondary buffing, but you want 100 MR+ on your MA and as many other people as possible. As long as you have a good tank with good MR, she's a kitten-she sticks agro pretty well, and doesn't do alot of damage against a properly buffed/decently equiped 50+ tank. But, if you don't lock down agro, she can be a nightmare and will generally rip through casters pretty quickly. Trying to stun won't affect her and will get you summoned in a heartbeat, so don't waste the mana.<br>
<br>
Approaching Tserrina if you have the master key. Go to the mirror on the left on the first floor. This takes you to the mirror room upstairs, you need the 6th floor key or someone to lockpick past the door. Follow the hallway around, but DON'T go out on the bridge that leads to the spiral stairs. Setup camp at the end of the hall, have puller invis and walk out onto the bridge, stand there for a few seconds, then come back into the hall. Actually-use a lower level person for this-level 60s don't have a large enough agro radius, 50-55 seems the be the ideal. Now, the familiars out there see invis and will agro, where as the shadowed torches will not. It's CRUCIAL that you get ALL the familiars in the room. You can pull the torches afterwards if it makes ya happy, but they are generally more of a waste of time to kill than anything-high HP, moderately high damage, basically zero loot-decent exp though most people going this route are after Tserrina, not exp. Once you are POSITIVE that all the familiars in the room are dead, invis the party up, run off the bridge and go through the tapestry to the end of the hall. Proceed from here as above.<br>
<br>
If Tserrina is up on the bridge: Ouch...not pretty. Best tactic is to pull her with a ranged attack from the hallway and take her back to the room with the locked door (but not the mirror room) to fight her. Make sure you have the firepower to nuke the hell out of her at low health, or she will almost definately gate (she gated through chain stuns (no resist message given) and three tanks bashing her) and summon everyone who doesn't gate out in time to their doom.<br>
<br>
Invis tactics: So, you have all the keys but Tserrina's, or you have her key but want to keep it in the bank in case of a wipeout? OK, here's a list of what invis works where:<br>
1st: Invis to Undead for entire floor.<br>
2nd: Invis to Undead for entire floor.<br>
3rd: Camo/Invis for all but undead, but there are no undead along the path to the mirror up. In fact, many times there are no mobs at all, or one armored shadow. When doing solo runs, I usually just skip invis all together and root/atone if I get agro. It's possible, but rare, for mobs to pop up through floors if you have agro and use the mirror to the next floor.<br>
4th: Camo/Invis seems to work on even the undead here, oddly enough. Very rarely there may be a see invis mob along the path to 5th. I usually gate or run like hell to the mirror if this happens.<br>
5th: Invis to Undead works for entire floor.<br>
6th: Invis to Undead will get you to the second area (past the unkeyed mirror). After that, Camo/Invis should work, though most people I know just fight the first bat or two and Vhal`Sera (it *is* a fun fight), then camo past the annoying bats to the hand-pot to 7th.<br>
7th: Invis to Undead will get you past the golems at the entrance. Trapped tapestries will make ya lose it. Familiars of all kinds see through invis anyway. Neither shadowed torches nor bats see through camo/invis. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unightgod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NightGod</A> at: 1/15/02 11:06:11 am<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13>Quests of Norrath</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
