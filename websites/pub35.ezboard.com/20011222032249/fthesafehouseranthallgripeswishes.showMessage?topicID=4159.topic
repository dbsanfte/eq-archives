I know it might seem likely because we've had some recent historic debate, those topics simply brought these thoughts to mind, they aren't actually about those things or people. In fact they're mostly about other groups, but at any rate, I'll get to the meat.<br>
<br>
I'm seeing a lot of national pride (from people of varying backgrounds and nationalities, this ain't no America rant neither..) based on what ancestors/etc did in the past, far before the people claiming them (or their parents, for that matter) were born. &quot;We&quot; did this, &quot;we&quot; did that, they throw the ol' solidarity around like it's going out of style, and can't seem to get enough of their particular countries past heroics. But when a topic is brought up which they feel was wrong in some way, they instantly disassociate from the people who engaged in whatever slice of history they find so distasteful. &quot;I wasn't even born then, why do people keep pointing the finger at me&quot;, etc... Which is it? Is your country's entire history &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;them&quot;? Do you get to pick and choose which tidbits of memorabilia come to mind when someone thinks of your heritage?<br>
<br>
And on a related note.. people who claim national history before their nation even existed. Here's a suggestion.. Find out on what date your country <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> actually</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gained independence, sovereignty, a post-it note saying &quot;We Rule&quot;, etc, and remember it. Then you can compare it to the date when events happened through history, and perhaps not look like so much of an ass by trying to claim events for your peeps that have nothing to do with you. If you're going to just go back and say &quot;Well the people living on that land eventually had children who eventually had children who eventually were around when the country went legit!&quot;, why not go on extending? Why not claim actions based on land mass alone? Forget culture and historic accuracy and all that nonsense, I live in North America, and I'm gonna start claiming everything that ever happened here as part of my nation's rich heritage. Remember when we created the Peace Pipe and Sundance Ceremonies? Man, we were cool back then. <p><p><table><tr><td>

<br>
I don't see any inconsistency about taking pride in what your culture/ancestors have done, without being held liable for their failures.<br>
<br>
At any rate, We could focus one each of them equally, an make everyone equally miserable, as the shortcomings and mistakes of all our predecessors is constantly thrown up in our faces.

That fool Pretentious Darkelven who trolled here last week, for instance, was way too obsessive about the treatment of Native Americans, but there are important lessons to learn in studying that whole period.<br>
<br>
This topic makes me think of something I ponder on sometimes : people in the past who did what we may consider terrible things almost certainly thought what they did was &quot;right&quot;.  Even taking such an extreme case as the Nazi party, they, or their leaders at least, thought the Final Solution was a &quot;good&quot; thing.  For me that makes passing judgment on the past tricky.  The Holocaust I can pretty easily say was bad, but was it bad for the Aztecs to sacrifice people to their dieties?  After all, they thought they were ensuring the success of their crops thus saving the society from famine.<br>
<br>
Roger Ebert wrote a really interesting &quot;Great Movies&quot; review of John Ford's film &quot;The Searchers&quot; which illustrates this a little bit.  He discusses the change in racist attitudes presented in old western &quot;cowboy and indian&quot; pictures, and how those attitudes changed, and how The Searchers represents a murky sort of transition.<br>

but then again, the sacrifices beleived that too, i doubt too many Jews beleived much of what Hitler said during the Holocaust.<br>
i'm pretty sure the Aztecs beleived that the sacrifices got instant retribution, basically a free ride into heaven (or whatever they liked to call it).<br>

Can you really be sure? Your values are instilled in you by the society, and if that society happens to think that sacrifices = good, then you will most likely think that sacrifices ARE good. You could be a kind and wonderful person and STILL think that, because your values are given to you.<br>
<br>
True, there are exceptions to the rule, people who think a certain way no matter what society believes, but we can't all be exceptions to the rule.<br>

Even if I were the me from now, with all I know and the upbringing I've had, I suspect I would still do some of the stuff it is fashionable to say is &quot;bad&quot; now.  Like overthrowing the Aztecs.<br>
<br>
Without a doubt, If I were a me who was brought up in that previous time period, I would go along with what was happening.<br>
<br>
Does anyone really think Cortez managed to conquer the Aztecs with his paltry 200 some odd men?  He didn't.  His men were undoubtedly very good shock troops though, able to force a break in the Aztecs formations, to overwhelm at any one point whatever the Aztecs could put forth, allowing the other natives to exploit the break.  The Spaniards were armed and armored with steel, a dozen or so were mounted, and they came from a culture that had been at war for 700 years against Muslim invaders in Iberia.  They can be thought of as an elite tank formation, and were used that way.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukeeperofthecows.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keeper of the Cows</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/01 7:17:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selective National Pride</span><hr size=1>     hmmm I have a plan.... <p><img src="http://bigalo.homestead.com/files/RLsig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukoru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Koru</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/01 7:19:21 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selective National Pride</span><hr size=1> Jhani, that would require actually reading your post rather than just the header.

I am very proud of some parts of americain history, and absolutely ashamed of others. Look at japan right now. they are angering the surrounding nations by glazing overwar atrocities commited during WWII. By ignoring it happened that takes away a part of those the affronts were commited against. <br>
<br>
If a man comes to your home and kills your wife , children, and parents then at his sentancing the only thing that is mentioned is his wonderful record of community service, that he worked 20 years faithfully for the same company, that he always pays his taxes on time; does that make your loss any less? No it doesn't but to you it seems like he is trying to ignore your loss. <br>
The same goes for national history. You can't glaze over past transgressions, doing so only means that someday you may make the same mistake again because your nation never had a chance to learn from it's errors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.aodoctors.org/Cross.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/3/01 12:02:20 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selective National Pride</span><hr size=1> But the difference is that in most cases the shameful action has ceased, but the action you are proud of continues.<br>
<br>
Example: I am very Proud of what the American Founders did when they established a country based on Democracy, and the fact that legitimate government comes from the consent of the governed. This Democratic ideal continues to this very day, and the US has been a strong supporter of democracy around the world. I am proud of this, in both the past actions and the current actions of my country.<br>
<br>
Compare this to a shameful event in American History. The First one that comes to mind is Slavery. It is gone. It is no more. If we were still continuing the practice of slavery, We would have every reason to be ashamed of our actions. However, the fact that Slavery has been abolished changes any guilt that could be ascribed to modern day America.<br>
<br>
I could certainly find similar examples for any country or civilization out there of both good and bad things. I'm jsut usng the US as its the example that comes to mind msot easily for me.<br>
<br>
If there is something that began a long time ago and continues to happen, There is no problem in being proud of it. However, if something horrible happened and was then bought to a halt prior to your lifetime, I see no reason why you should feel guilt for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showMessageRange?topicID=4159.topic&start=21&stop=25>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showMessage?topicID=4165.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showMessage?topicID=4172.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.emailToFriend?topicID=4159.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.threadControl?topicID=4159.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4159.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4159.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes>Rant Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
