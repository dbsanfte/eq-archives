You say, 'Hail, Torsten Reidan'<br>
Torsten Reidan says 'Oh, hello there. Sorry I didn't notice you before I was thinking of an old friend. This used to be his room. I guess no one else has been assigned to these quarters. <br>
You say, 'What old friend?'<br>
Torsten Reidan says 'His name was Bregun Dorey. What a funny little halfling he was. He had a good heart and worked hard. That is up until one day he just started acting odd, very nervous like he was hiding something. Then all he would talk about was Bixie Treats and then show off some weird heirloom charm bracelet. His time for the question came and due to his odd behavior he was sent to Marus Seru. I sure wish I knew how he was doing. <br>
<br>
<br>
Head out to Marus Seru and fine Reotho at one of the Recuso camps:<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'Where is Bregun Dorey?'<br>
Reothe says 'Bregun Dorey... I have not heard that name in many years. I will never forget it. He was very unique, always running around with an odd metal hat on. He swore that it would keep out the mind probing magics of the Question. I know where he was last seen, and I will tell you if you help by getting us some [supplies]. <br>
You say, 'What supplies?'<br>
Reothe says 'Get me two Bark Potions, a Spring Crystal, and a Harvest Crystal. I will tell you where I last saw him headed. If you buy them in Sanctus Seru do not tell them you are giving aid to the Recuso or you shall be prosecuted as well. <br>
<br>
<br>
Head back into Seru, get him what he wants and hand it in:<br>
<br>
<br>
Reothe says 'This is great! We can treat our ingured and have something to eat for weeks. I can vaguely recall Bregun heading towards the Lair of the Netherbians. You might ask a guard there if they have seen him.<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
You say, 'Where is Bregun Dorey?'<br>
Legionnaire Dalini says, 'Yeah maybe I know Bregun. You know, I sure am thirty with all this guard work I am doing. I know what I want, some Dawnshroud Cider! Yeah, go fetch me a cider and we will see if I remember anything when you get back.<br>
<br>
Vantak Mere sells Dawnshroud Cider for 52pp at loc 830, neg 600 in S.Seru.<br>
<br>
<br>
Legionnaire Dalini says, 'Ahhh! That is the stuff! Yeah I saw the halfling with the crazy hat. He runs around in the caverns, hanging out with the Troglodytes. It seems he somehow befriended them, I guess they enjoy his madmen antics.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Bregun Dorey'<br>
<br>
Bregun Dorey says, 'Trog trog trog trog?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Trog'<br>
<br>
Bregun Dorey says, 'Ha! What are you talking about?! Strange thing you are. Wait a minute, come closer. Are you from Norrath?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am from Norrath'<br>
<br>
Bregun Dorey says, 'I thought so, you armor looks to be made from things found not here. Have you heard of Rivervale?<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have heard of Rivervale'<br>
<br>
Bregun Dorey says, 'Good.<br>
<br>
Say 'Good' and he he will respond and tell you he wants 4 Bixie Crunchies. When you give him the crunchies you get a bixie charm give to torsten and run back to dorey again handing himt he note torsten sent<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:37:52 2002] Bregun Dorey says 'Trog trog trog trog? '<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:38:01 2002] Bregun Dorey says 'Hahaha!  Silly Torsten.  Always snooping over my shoulder.  Well I have nothing to lose... take this to him, it's directions on how to find the Journal I kept.  I hid it where no one would look!  Haha!  Trog trog trog! '<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:48:00 2002] Torsten Reidan pulls out a hollow book entitled 'A Detailed Look at Etiquette and Proper Grammar' and opens it to find a journal placed inside.  'This is astounding.  The information in this journal is invaluable and must be brought to the others attention.  Take this insignia.  When you are ready to help us further seek out Euzan Jurek, tell him you were sent by me, and he will tell you what you can do to further our cause.  I can not tell you more than this, but keep the insignia close to you for now.' '<br>

[Thu Feb 07 06:53:05 2002] Euzan Jurek says 'So Torsten has sent you?  He must see the potential within you to help us.   I cannot give you any information right now as to who we are.  That is a trust you must [earn]. '<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:23 2002] You say, 'how do i earn yoru trust'<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:23 2002] Euzan Jurek leans in and whispers to you, 'Let it be known that assisting us will show your distrust in everything this city stands for.  If you do not want to get involved I urge you to walk away now.  However if you wish to [bring about change], stay and I will tell you how to earn our trust.' '<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:49 2002] You say, 'i wish to bring about change'<br>
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:50 2002] Euzan Jurek says 'Good, you must do something for us.  One of our members, who needs not be named, is due to be called for the Question.  We need you to go into the Heart [Consillium] and replace their records with this one.  This false record shows that they have completed their Question and still have time until their next one.  Changing the records will make the question pass over us so that we avoid being discovered.  Go in stealth, when you have completed this task bring me back the original records and your Insignia Earring. '<br>
<br>
saying consillium gets you a  general response everyone tells you<br>
<br>
Give the replacement files to the File Cabinet, you get back the old records and a guard spawns and attacks you, I got killed but no matter still had the records. Take the old records to Euzan and he rewards you with the 2nd earring.<br>

Tilbok Furrunner is located @ neg144, neg1971.<br>

He is in the large castle on the second floor.<br>
<br>
Tilbok Furruner reads through the report, hands you a small satchel then starts to explain, 'Finally news from Euzan. I knew that it would take a long time to get planted within Seru, but i still worried about their mission constantly. This report shows that you have earned trust from Euzan, so I in turn will show the same trust. Euzan and Torsten were placed in the city for information. They are deep undercover and risk their life everyday. Every person in that city is ingrained with the [purpose] of either destroying Katta or converting his people.'<br>

<br>
You say, 'what purpose?'<br>
Tilbok Furrunner says 'The teaching in the city is that Katta feigned his death to blame it on Seru. When in fact Seru actually poisoned Katta. The crusade that Seru leads is false and must be stopped. We must gain access to Seru's [chambers] and destroy him and show the city the truth.<br>
You say, 'what chambers?'<br>
Tilbok Furrunner says 'We do not know much about Seru's Chamber, that is what we need you to find out. This will require great effort on your part. We need you to head into Sanctus Seru and bring back reports from each Consillium. I do not know who will have these reports, and I have only heard rumor that they exist.

Ask her about the [Arx Key] she will no doubt ask in your service retrieving it. I salute your service to the city and wish you well. '<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 14 23:03:59 2002] You say, 'what arx key'<br>
[Thu Feb 14 23:03:59 2002] Lcea Katta says 'The Arx Key, yes. I have read the compiled reports that have been brought to us and it seems to gain access to Arx Seru you need four shards, one from each Praesertum leader. When the time is ready each leader inserts their shard into the door of Arx Seru at the same time, and they are transported within the building. We need you to retrieve the four shards. When you have done so seek out Elnerick Augustleaf, and tell him that you serve Katta. His powers over the arcane are great and I believe he can form the shards into a single master key. Once you have received the Arx Key, place the seal given to you by Elnerick and your Runed earring in this jewel box and give it to me. I eagerly await your return. '<br>

[Thu Feb 14 23:08:55 2002] Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Greetings Moro. I am Magistrate Elnerick Augustleaf of Katta Castellum and the Loyalist Empire. If it is arcane knowledge that you seek you have come to an excellent place to study. Not only do we have wondrous magical resources available at the Magus Conlegium but the teachings of Tsaph Katta are well known to all of our citizens and aid in preparing the mind for the freedom of thought and mental and emotional discipline needed to become a great wizard. '<br>
[Thu Feb 14 23:09:08 2002] You say, 'i serve katta'<br>

Bregun gives you a &quot;Bixie Charm&quot; which in turn you give to Torsten. You then give a Note back to Bregun, then a Book back to Torsten with your first Earring to get #2. (just to clear that up, as I was confused myself).<br>

If you do not wish to make the Bixie Crunches to get the charm, simply kill Bregun and loot the Bixie Charm yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utynkmindrifter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tynk Mindrifter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 8:54:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4076.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Earrings of Veracity 1st 2nd and 3rd (collaborate info h</span><hr size=1> ok i replaced the vague text with eq log sorry bout that i was sorta busy the other day when i posted this<br>

Also note, Custos Armorum etc. are all level 60. They can triple for 127 or so. Most are hasted as well. That's a HUGE jump in difficulty from Earring 2 to Earring 3.

Personally, I don't see the earring being worth the trouble. I killed the four mobs in Seru with one of the top guilds on my server.

First off you dont need to kill the Head Praesertums for earring 3....this earring is somewhat comprable but can you upgrade Ivandyrs hoop to an ac15 with buku stats ear??<br>
<br>
So while the lower earrings may not &quot;seem&quot; worth it, they lead to a much more desireable ear slot then the hoop so many people want to compare this to.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uetheon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Etheon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/13/02 5:12:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4076.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Earrings of Veracity 1st 2nd and 3rd (collaborate info h</span><hr size=1> On the first quest, is it possible to skip straight to the part where you hand the guard in Neth Lair cider? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uhordolinawanagin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hordolin Awanagin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/13/02 5:26:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4076.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Earrings of Veracity 1st 2nd and 3rd (collaborate info h</span><hr size=1> If that's the case you could skip straight to Bregun Dorey. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umiriameleprester.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MiriamelePrester</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/13/02 9:58:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4076.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Earrings of Veracity 1st 2nd and 3rd (collaborate info h</span><hr size=1> [quote]On the first quest, is it possible to skip straight to the part where you hand the guard in Neth Lair cider?[/quote]<br>
