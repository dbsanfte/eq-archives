<br>
One thing I'll say, is get yourself some Javelins. The agro range on these mobs is about 100. So your shurikens will be next to useless.<br>
<br>
**The Below is considered spoiler information***<br>
<br>
First off you need to clear through the first hallway of Drakes. These don't drop any loot, and have the same respawn; 82 minutes, as the West Wing mobs.<br>
<br>
I suggest clearing these fast. It is possible to run them around the hall and pull them single; or time the casting of spells and split them that way. The problem is that you want to use the first hallway, as a place to clear the middle. So you're working against the clock. If you have 2 good tanks; you should have no problem taking 2 at once. If you don't; then pull them single. Once the first hall is clear, I suggest moving your raid up. As you get more comfortable with pulling you can move them sooner. I often move my raid when there are still 2-4 mobs in the hall.<br>
<br>
Beyond the first hall there are 2 drakes that should radious agro depending on how low your faction is. You should be able to do a classic FD flop on these guys to get them far enough apart from each other, so it allows a warrior to tag. The key to this is not you getting them single, but getting them far enough apart so you can get the warrior to agro, then you can stand up run forward and hide from the AE. Repeat this process for all the drakes, and clear the middle from all wandering drakes. <br>
<br>
After the wandering drakes are dead pull the wurms, they will pull into the room, don't worry about path walking them. Simply agro, run to your group and wait for them to pull through.<br>
<br>
Once the wurms are dead, work on the West Wing guards, chances are you're fighting the clock here so have your raid moved up the first hall a bit, as this will buy you a few extra minutes. <br>
<br>
You raid is now ready to move to the west wing. There is potential that the named Onyx Drake guarding the North Wing will agro, so you may, or may not, want to pull him first; it all depends on where he is standing.<br>
<br>
So now your raid moves west, but is ready to fight. You run to the west wing and there is a mob there. Have your guys engage and DO NOT have them jump into the pit. Have them all stay up top. This is a great place to do an AFK break, as chances are you've been fighting pretty non stop until htis point.<br>
<br>
After the AFK break, continue the pulls. Once again DO NOT have your raid jump down yet. The drakes like to run toward the middle, if you fight them in this room. The room dynamic should show you why this could be a problem.<br>
<br>
Now for splitting the west wing.<br>
<br>
You're looking at 2-3 Wandering mobs, plus the 3 Statics. Eye of Zomm kicks ass here, because it lets you scout around and see if there are any wanderers. No Eye and have a wiz or something do it. <br>
<br>
Remembering the wurm/drake rule. You'll want to pul the drakes into this room. Now you should be able to pull them in; FD, and they should be naturally split far enough apart that only one will charge the raid. Again having a warrior bow shot them here helps.<br>
<br>
Pull at least the first 2 static drakes here; it helps a lot if you can snag a wandering drake or two, but considering they wander so far and sometimes stop to chat (and buff) with each other; that's not always possible.<br>
<br>
So once you've gotten a couple drakes, and are ready for the wurm, move your raid into the room. You can set up here. Facing the door there are two firepots in front of you, and one off to the left as you exit the room. In &quot;the room&quot; your clerics can hide from the AE using the Firepot on the right; provided you &quot;pin&quot; mobs in the OUTSIDE firepot. It's IMPORTANT that your raid uses the room as the &quot;safe spot&quot;. <br>
<br>
Everyone runs outside to kill drakes, resets back in the room.<br>
<br>
Everyone runs outside to pin the Wurms in the firepot. Chetari War staffs (Knockback weapon drops in DN) are great tools here. Gives the druids and shaman something to play around with. <br>
<br>
I like to pull &quot;right&quot; toward Gozz's lair first. Easy to pick off a couple wurms from here. Also if Gozz has been killed you can move to his lair and fight there. There are a couple &quot;clusterfuck&quot; places where all the mobs seem to path together. A little patience and working with the pathing allows you to split this though, a COH mage helps a ton.<br>
<br>
That is it for the most part, just some things to remember in general.<br>
<br>
- Don't push mobs into walls, they will warp<br>
- Pin ONLY Wurms in the Firepots<br>
- Surround drakes to keep them in control<br>
- Blue Drakes, White Wurms, Glimmer Drakes all will gate if given the chance. Gate is prevented by having enchanters mana sieve. Enchanters will try to fight you on this, tell them just to do it.<br>
- Blue Drakes and White Wurms complete heal, so if you have 2 you kill BLue/White first. always. CH is prevented by nukes at the end.<br>
- Dragon Lairs make excellent pull spots, provided you know they will be vacant for a while.<br>

<br>
Enchanters mana sieveing is good, yes, but these mobs regen mana very quickly, so in the past they may have felt it wasn't worth the effort. The best thing to add to the mix is Torment of Argli: a weak Enchanter DoT, but it also has a mana drain component.<br>
<br>
Sieve gets the drake to OOM, and Argli keeps it there. Otherwise it can regen back the mana to gate in about a tick or so even if OOM. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/umaddiefaye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maddie Faye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Disciple</span><br>  Posts: 400<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(4/17/02 10:12:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=878.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Setting up for Gozz</span><hr size=1> To set up from Gozz from this style break, start off by pulling to the left.  as you head down to the left there are 2-3 Wandering wurms, and a static drake.

  Any guides to WToV out there?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 My guild is pretty much finished with HoT. Just about everyone is in full SS now. We may hang on to our faction for awhile in order to bonk Telk and Gozz a few times without having to worry about clearing much, but very soon I see us making the big switch to Giant faction. <br>
<br>
So, are there any guides to WToV? I'm really just interested in the best places to set up camp and where wanderers/statics are.<br>
<br>
There didnt appear to be any guides in the guide forum. <br>

 well, if you are going for WW Farming i would set up after the dropdown behind the door, there is a 1 static spawn upt here that you have to kill everytime.<br>
<br>
in the next room are 3 static spawns (wurm, 2 drakes) but singlepullable [tm] if done with bio orb or much luck.<br>
<br>
the rest is work for 1-2 monks<br>
<br>
MT should stay outside the door after the dropdown<br>
caster can stay IN the dropdown ! <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 I'm not aware of any guides to wtov. We always use CoH and fight from the zone out. Reason for this is so we dont have to clear 20 or so drakes just to get to our pull spot.<br>
<br>
There is a 90 degree turn that casters can easily hide behind for AE. The first 4 mobs from zone out is about all you really have to actually worry about splitting. There are 2 worms and 2 drakes. At 60 with a 100 range shuriken I can single pull 1 of the worms as long as I go after the higher level one and throw from max range and run backwards after chucking the shuriken.<br>
<br>
Next pull the other worm. Then there will be 2 drakes on either side of you. Just pull them both. The pathing is bad at the top of the stairs and the drakes (but not the worms) tend to run back and forth a few times before coming down the stairs. Just be careful as there are 2 worms and several drakes that wander through this area. You can "walk" the drakes back to eliminate the pathing problem if you are worried about adds.<br>
<br>
After the first 4 mobs are clear, if you are kos to CoV you can simply stand at the top of the stairs and wait for the 2 worm wanderers to run into you and aggro you. Then just pull them to the group. If you are not kos yet, just get to work pulling whatever you see. Pull the wandering drakes when you happen to see them. When not kos it can be hard to aggro the wandering worms because they litteraly run so fast they pretty much warp through before you can target them and chuck a shuriken at them. But if they happen to wander by when you are pulling something else, they will assist and aggro you.<br>
<br>
For this reason, I find pulling when kos actually easier here. The majority of my pulls consist of either 1 worm, or 2 drakes. There's really no reason to pull more than that unless you botch a pull or get a wanderer.<br>
<br>
Save your disc so you can use stonestance and mend when necessary during long worm pulls who will smack you around a lot. Run 3 helps so much here.<br>
<br>
Btw, dont even attempt to farm wtov zone out if Lendiara the Keeper is up. Even a non kos person pulling stuff in there will aggro her. She will then nuke you. And as long as she is aggroed, any wandering mobs that happen to walk by her she will transfer aggro to and you will find yourself with many adds. Having 3 AEing worms and any numbers of drakes really sucks. If Lendiara sees you from LoS if you are kos or get on her hate list by attacking anything in her sight, then she will again send any wanderers in the area after you.<br>
<br>
Not really a guide, just some hints. Good luck in wtov. <br>

 We set up at the zone out as well and if you guys are already nonkos to WToV then you'll have np cothing to that spot. I don't like the drop off at all. To small of an area and if anyone screws up (missed snare, gater, etc) then you have a whole bunch of problems. There's also pats there (on the other side of the door/drop off) that will agro if anyone is fighting where they shouldn't be. The fire pots always seem to cause a problem for people (no idea why probably just because the area is so tight). <br>
<br>
We fight sometimes in Gozz's room as well. Nice little area with a wall to hide behind.<br>
<br>
But, like was said before, the casters can hide behind the wall at the zone out. Lots more room to position and fight. More room if snare is missed. Plus if you have a wipe out a clr can zone out rather than try to camp. Then just coth the cleric back in..or run in if they aren't kos.<br>
<br>
Lendi is a pain...trying to pull with her up is not fun...atleast it isn't for me. <br>

 Just a note on changing factions.<br>
<br>
If at all possible attempt to have your mage remain non-KOS as long as feasible. The advantages in WTOV and even in NTOV(to a lesser extent) are huge. If you plan to make this a long term proposal have your guild roll up a mage twink to CoTH and put it on draggy faction. The time saved for the whole guild is a major return on the PLing investment. <br>

 advantage to having a nonkos CoH magician in ntov is HUGE.<br>
<br>
most of the time the magician can run straight for teh coh spot by aary and start summoning all nonkos, then once full group with cleric there, summon the kos and clear chickens. <br>

As you level the agro range on west tov mobs gets smaller like every other place. however drag agro is still the same size. you can split just about every spawn in there by dragging a corpse to agro.
