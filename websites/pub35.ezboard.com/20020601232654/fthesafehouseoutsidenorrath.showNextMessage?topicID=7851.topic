I'm not from TX, and this story hasn't got much play in the NC news. (Plus, I'm about 3 days behind on reading the newspaper...)<br>
<br>
FWIW, I wouldn't worry about it too much. If you think she is the first one to use this loophole to get a license early without financial justification, think again. It just happens that she is the first one whose daddy is the Governor.<br>
<br>
IMHO, All drives license applicants should be treated equally, regardless of financial status. If it is safe to let a poor 15 year old driver drive, then shouldn't a rich one be just as safe of a driver? In NC, there are laws preventing those under 16 from running a Meat Slicer at a Deli. (Supposedly a 15 year old with a meat slicer would end up decapitating himself in short order.) Should those laws be waived if the family is poor, and the kid needs to get a job at your local deli? Arguably, the rule is a dumb one, but changing it should not be done on a socioeconomic basis.<br>
<br>
While she doesn't fit the description of "Financial Hardship", I don't think that should be a determining factor in who can drive. The loophole is a stupid one, and shold be done away with. There are probably hundreds of others using that same loophole, who wouldn't qualify as "Financial hardship". Either say all 15 year olds (with Drivers ed training) can drive, or none can. Don't base it on someone's tax bracket.<br>

<br>
In NJ, the age is 18 for operating a meat slicer, or the garbage compactor in a supermarket, or anything that might be considered dangerous.  <br>
<br>
I think it has something to do with the age of majority here.  At 18 they can sign for themselves at the hospital if they've gotten injured.  Under 18, there's a nice big chewy lawsuit against the store owner for endangering a minor. <p><center>

<br>
It's not as big of a deal as some other freebie could have been. Like her getting a hardship scolarship (if they have those for non minority) or something like that. No one lost anything from this. Of course, if we hear next month that she was out getting drunk like Bush's daughters...<br>
<br>
The guy makes $114k a year, they obviously don't need it. She's got personal drivers to take her around to school/work, to boot. I think it's just ludacris that they were allowed to apply for it.<br>
<br>

<br>
Justify this with something other than retoric.<br>
<br>
If you're saying that republicans give too many tax breaks to the rich, that is only because the rich are carrying a disproportionate amount of the tax burden. The top 1% of Americans pay about 50% of the taxes in this country, whilst the bottom 25% pay ZERO taxes.<br>
<br>
Giving tax cuts to the poor doesn't actually do anything.<br>

Those making an extremely low amount of money not only pay no income tax, but the goverment gives them additional money in the form of an earned income credit (Free money to add to your tax return).<br>

I'd guess that the 25% of people paying zero taxes is an exageration. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upeebs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peebs</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/22/02 10:43:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.aodoctors.org/Cross.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/02 10:56:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseoutsidenorrath.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7857.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.myezboard.com:81/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/aodoctors/images/weeee.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So Meddik...</span><hr size=1> Well, most discussion of taxes is referring solely to an income tax.<br>

Not the various fees, surcharges, income taxes, val;ue added taxes, registrations, permits, licenses, etc. that the government uses to raise money.<br>
<br>
Add them all up, and the typical American family pays well over 40% of their income to state, federal or local governments. Of course, the rich pay more in income tax, and the poor pay less in income tax, but if you average it all out...<br>
<br>
Anywa, about the 1% and the bottom portion, here is a story from the chicago sun times, via Google's Cache.<br>

&quot;The wealthiest 1 percent pay more than a third of the taxes, while people in the bottom half pay 4 percent.&quot;<br>
