Pal/SK should not be better than a monk defensively. Granted, for 99% of the game they'll have massively more AC and HP, but that doesn't mean they should always take less damage than a monk does on average. That 99% of the game is why monks have block instead of parry, and why it's so much more effective. Our dodge and riposte work exactly like any other class' does at the same skill level, but block is 4x as effective.<br>
<br>
Now, when AC is the same, and HP isn't quite as much of a concern this is going to mean that monks tank better than pal/SK, and that's not unfair in the least, especially when you consider the amount of work that goes into getting that gear. Can a monk tank Vindi now? Sure, who gives a rat's @$$? Vindi hasn't been high end content for more than a year now. You won't find a monk playing MT for Emp or VT for the same reason a monk didn't MT Vindi a year ago. Balance has been maintained.<br>
<br>
Now, as to why monks make superior rampage tanks? That's easy. FD. It makes for far less chaos due to how VI coded rampage and luclin bosses if a few monks who can turn rampage on/off at will are the rampage tanks. <p>See me at: <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47953">Schezarine's Sexay Stuff</a>

<br>
Think of utility as flexibility.  <br>
<br>
In baseball a 'utility' player is someone that can play multiple positions without a loss of functionality to the group.  So a manager can slap a shortstop onto second base, and not lose defense or offense.<br>
<br>
In EQ, a warrior has no utility.  He can't play multiple positions without costing a group some effectiveness.  <br>
<br>
If the warrior is put in the pulling role without sometimes having to be pulled back as a corpse.<br>
<br>
If he is put into the second assist role, then yes, he's only as good as his sword (can't use taunt, not taking the main damage).  <br>
<br>
And of course he can't do anything else (healer, whatever).<br>
<br>
I'll leave the other people to argue about who is balanced with what.  But there's no denying the fact that warriors can only really do one thing decently well.  And that's take damage.<br>

<br>
The game as it stands isn't broken. Monks are not vastly overpowered like Kreugan wishes we were. The only thing that's going to come of all this at most will be POP AAXP options. Which, frankly, would be hard to do worse for monks than the Luclin ones did. Maybe we'll get a decent class only other than rapid feign. <p>See me at: <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47953">Schezarine's Sexay Stuff</a>

Wow nice personal attack there buddy. I dont believe I attacked you in any way.<br>
<br>
Warriors get to do damage, and take damage. Thats it. We dont invis people, we dont cast sow, we dont get anything in the game other than the ability to do damage and take damage. We are the very base class that all others get perks on top of.<br>

However, merely making AC affect the mitigation in these high end encounters is would not sufficient in and of itself I suspect. <br>
<br>
At the highest Levels, raw AC numbers for monks and plate melee are not dissimalar. I personally have AC in line with many of my guilds warlords. Wether or not these numbers true mitigation value would remain constant class to class, I am unsure, i suspect not though.<br>
<br>
Point is, if they merely reintroduced mitigation value to extraordinarily high AC values I do not think it would neccessarily fix the problem. It may require a reavaluation of item AC values affect on the high end community. <br>
<br>
I very much agree with the idea of making sure Plate melee mitigate better than monks. However, i'm not convinced the task is as easy as just allowing for mitigation thru AC on high end mobs. <p><img src="http://www.adventurersanon.com/images/sigs/axiss_sig.gif"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10004">Magelo Profile</a>

<br>
My guilds top warriors can grab and maintain agro much better than even our top monks, and with AE taunt they can usually do it *faster* than an SK.  This is important, if the mob is all over the place, everyone will die, it needs to stay focused.  Here warrior &gt; monk.<br>
<br>
Now, total hp comes into play.  A CH chain is designed to be as efficient as possible, while not allowing enough room for the tank to die from a bad melee round.  This means a chain for someone with less hp has to be faster.  The monk may take dmg at about the same rate as the warrior, but he has less hp.  Also, the warrior will take less dmg during his discipline, during which time the CH chain will be slower.  Over time, its more efficient for the warrior to tank, slower CH chain = less mana used, and on plenty of fights I've been a part of, cleric mana running out was the limiting factor that led to failure.<br>
<br>
BTW, CH is 400 mana base, Specialize Alt. DOES affect it, as do AA skills, focus items do NOT. <p> <center><img src=http://www.webspawner.com/users/ceri2/cerisig.jpg><BR><font size="1"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=86991">Arianwen Taur`amandil  53 Druid and Tradeskill Diva</a><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14796">Ceridwen al`Ban  60 High Priestess</a><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=323015">Geckonia Chazaliae  30 Monky</a><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=87181">Wenlan Rainjarbot  60 Warder</a></font><BR>

In Magelo profiles, sure.  But not in *potential*.<br>
<br>
High End Warriors choose HP gear because they either believe (*incorrectly*) there is a cap somewhere between 1200 and 1400 (why can't they decide on a number if it exists?) or that they realise (*correctly*) that they cannot achieve the AC needed for the top mobs and raw HP is better.<br>
<br>
Warriors going for 100 and 125 hp items in every slot are sacrificing 100 to 400 AC.  The equipment exists for them to have a considerable advantage over Monks *if* that advantage starts to be meaningful.<br>

i disagree with you 99% of the time about everything... but you really did outline the problem well here, and correctly identified the underlying cause:  the AC softcap/point-of-minishing-returns.<br>
<br>
but:<br>
<br>
1)  no, despite what you like to spout, monks were not tanks in the original EQ they were damage dealers.  maybe YOU viewed yourself as a tank.  maybe YOU stocked up on AC/HP instead of str/dex/agi.<br>
<br>
... if i made a enchanter on EQ day 1 and went straight AC/HP does that mean verant intended enchanters to be a tank class? umm no.<br>
<br>
face the fact that monks were NEVER intended to tank <br>
(exhibit 1:  class specific armors<br>
exhibit 2:  FD &quot;given because of monks low AC&quot;<br>
exhibit 3:  no taunt button<br>
etc)<br>
... and tanking ability is something they have gained.  they went from a non-tank to a second best or best tank.<br>
<br>
2)  even if verant fixes the balance of mob ATK values vs players' AC's, monks will still be stupidly broken.<br>
<br>
why?<br>
<br>
because of god damn ac 60 magic pajamas.  monks should be limited to class specific armors with ac on par with what you see in every set of monk class specific armors.  (note the low AC)<br>
<br>
remove stupid all/all high ac/hp items , AND re tune mob ATK values vs players' AC's, and the problem will be solved without nerfing monks.<br>
<br>
_____________________________________________<br>
<br>
look, guys, some of my best friends are monks.  but even *they* recognize that they are playing a stupidly overpowered class, given high ac all/all items.<br>
<br>
hell, thats why they picked it: power.<br>
<br>
well... EQ isnt just about power, theres a little thing called *class balance* to consider.<br>

As to the monk Vs Warrior comparison, as I pointed out on the FoH board:<br>
<br>
 Assuming monk avoidance is the same as warrior (misses) and that dodge and riposte are the same, monks take an addition 16% or so less damage per hit thanks to BLock vs parry. Block goes off about 12% last time I checked (been several months) and parry around 4%. Given a warrior or monk with CA3 wboth classes avoid (miss/block/dodge/riposte/parry) around 50% of all attacks. The addition 8% of avoided attacks out of 50% attacks that land is about a 16% reduction in damage taken.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I dont see how you came to this figure of 16% from your own discussion.<br>
<br>
Using your starting data a simple scenario would be:<br>
<br>
Given an npc hits both a monk and a warrior 200 times and for simplicity's sake the same amount each time.<br>
<br>
After applying your estimated avoidance of 50% we are left with 100 hits for each.<br>
<br>
For the 100 hits that get through subtract those avoided by block for the monk and parry for the warrior.<br>
<br>
You are left with 88 hits on the monk, and 96 hits on the warrior.<br>
<br>
Damage taken over this period,<br>
<br>
relative to the monk, the warrior takes 8.3% more damage<br>
<br>
relative to the warrior, the monk takes 9% less damage.<br>
<br>
All of this is with the implicit assumption that during this time the warrior and the monk are being hit for the same average damage. Now it might be said to be true for highend raid encounters, and probably also for highlevel well equiped players in older zones, but not necessarily in all situations of play. Certainly as soon as a warrior uses evasive or defensive this situation is different.<br>
<br>
As much as warriors try to throw away those two disciplines when arguing this point, the fact remains they exist and are often used in difficult encounters. They are as much a part of the warrior arsenal as mend and feign death for the monk.<br>
<br>
Granted you can succeed on a lot of end game encounters without using defensive or evasive simply by increasing the rate of the heal rotation. However often times the same can be said of monks pulling, its certainly not essential for us to pull many of the things we do.<br>

Slam is a racial abiliy of the large races, and class independant. A troll shaman can slam as well as a troll warrior.<br>
The other races can bash as skill if the class has the skill using a shield.<br>
I agree with Ed on most points except on the downside part.<br>
My 54 human monk was the first character to hit 50+.<br>
I had a 49 cleric/48 druid/47 warrior when he reached the level with no exceptional gear (bronze arms on the cleric for example).<br>
When the monk was started he basically was thrown some cured silk/wu's armor and a fighting baton i got while hunting in Dalnir with my warrior.<br>
So no major twinking.<br>
No powerleveling of any kind as this was before i had my cleric/druid moved to a second account and around half a year before Luclin (maybe a bit more), so no h2h weapons.<br>
When the monk was 47 he was wearing Fungi and other assorted goodies(this was before the Fungi became the rare drop off king) you will find on many 55+ monks (lacking no drop gear except a bracer of hammerfall).<br>
With the cash my monk made by farming/exp-hunting in Sol A and later CC I basically twinked my other higher level characters.<br>
Of course this was before the drop rate decrease in CC, a blackened crystalline robe could be sold for 800 to 1000 pp and high end tailors were looking for stuff in CC on a regular basis (did i mention that i got my Crown of the Froglok Kings by trading for 3 stacks of small pieces of velium?).<br>
<br>
Monks might have disadvantages, but being poor isnt one of them and if you are level 50 and still have cured silk/wu's it is because you choose exp&gt;pp and didnt put any effort in it.<br>
<br>
I had reactivated my human monk a few days ago and joined a group in Chardok with some guildies and their friends.<br>
Melee side of the group was 60 ranger/57 or 58 paladin and me 54 human monk.<br>
Rest was 56 druid/mage and 57 shaman.<br>
We did quite well but even using IFS i got aggro from time to time and somehow i managed to get less hit than either the ranger or the paladin, so in the end i didnt even try to drop aggro anymore once i got it.<br>
I found it remarkable, because i know the pally quite well and he had 1235 AC buffed (druid/shaman and Heroic Bond by my 55 cleric whom i just logged on for that-full SS plate except PoF bp) against my 1065 (1018 unbuffed).<br>

Monks had the highest AC in the game from day one.  Sure, I wrongly put it at 100AC advantage, in reality it seems it was about 50AC more than Warriors (it was 150AC more when Rubicite was the best shits there was!), but that's *still* an advantage.<br>
<br>
Much of Warriors additional HP advantage WAS ADDED OVER 6 MONTHS INTO THE GAME.  But sure, they were still better if you used the CHeal approach to big mobs (which very few people actuall did).  But day to day tanking - Monks were the rocks.<br>

I agree. But then again:<br>
1. Shamans' prime goal was intended to be stat buffs, not slows<br>
2. Clerics were not intended to be DA pullers in some cases<br>
3. SKs were not intended to be a better taunter than a warrior in exp groups<br>
4. Wizards were intended to be uber damage dealers before level 60<br>
5. Bards were not intended in the first place (half their shit doesn't work and never has)<br>
