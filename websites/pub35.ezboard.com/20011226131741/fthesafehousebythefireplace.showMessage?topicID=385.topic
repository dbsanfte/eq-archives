Admiring the silvery sheen and sharp edge, she turned it over and over in her hand.  Glancing at her companion beside her, Joon idly remarked, &quot;So, Bronin, tell me how you were able to escape the dungeons of High Hold Keep. I am most awed by your daring.&quot;  Bending her head to one side, she strained to hear the low murmur of the halfling.  &quot;What's that you say? Speak up!  Can't hear you!&quot;  Eyeing Bronin, Joonling realized he didn't want to tell her.  Normally she would respect that, after all what rogue would share secrets with another, but in order to collect pay she had to find out. The captain of the High Hold Keep Guards was most curious as no one before Higginsbot had ever escaped.  He was offering her a large reward in return for information.  And one damn halfling was not going to stop her!<br>
<br>
&quot;I respect your silence, really I do, but I need to know.  You see there is great reward to find out and I want to know!&quot; she shouted at her prisoner.  Again silence met her inquiry.  Anger uncoiled in the pit of her stomach and spread to her hands.  With no conscious thought her blade lashed out and sliced into his arm.  Feeling slightly sickened by her actions, Joonling immediately used the cloth that polished her blade as a bandage for his arm.  &quot;See what ya made me do!  Just tell me Bronin, please just tell me! The captain wants to know.  If you tell me I might be able to stop him from killing you.  It was stupid of you to leave your very distinctive dagger in his aide's back you know.&quot;  she muttered as she tied the cloth around his arm.  Standing up, she began pacing in front of him, stopping only once to make sure the rope tied around him was secure.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing personally ya understand Brosnin, but I cannot trust you not ta get way from me.&quot;  Joonling resumed pacing and muttering, wondering how in all the gods' names she didn't believe in she could get this halfling to talk.  Stumbling slightly, she looked down to see a branch from her fire.  It lay at a strange angle and she realized it had had rolled away from the firestones to the dirt.  Knowing that halflings detested fire an idea sprang to her mind.  Bracing herself as she knew this would get ugly, she took the branch in one hand and knelt before her prisoner.  Waving it before him, allowing it to touch portions of his body, the smell of burning flesh ripe in the air, she once again asked how he had escaped and why he had left his dagger in a guard's back.  Only the crickets singing to the night responded.  Finally giving up for the moment, Joonling made her bed beside Bronin, making sure he could not escape.  Angered at the lengths the halfling had driven her to, Joonling fell asleep swearing.<br>
<br>
The sun's rays pierced Joonling's eyelids and forced her to awaken.  Groaning, mornings were not her best time, she rolled over and encountered air.  &quot;NO!  he did not escape!&quot;  she cried out as she leapt to her feet. Relief made her limp when she realized he had merely shifted to the side. Kicking his inert body, Joonling told him to get up.  Realizing her time was limited, the guards patroled this area of the woods outside the gate to Misty Thicket, she hastily removed any signs that they had camped there for the night.  Saddened that she would not get the reward, as she had decided to give up and merely return him to High Hold, Joonling straightened her clothing, brushing off any dirt.  Quickly spinning her dagger, Joonling flipped it into the sheath at her side in case she ran into trouble.  Hefting her fine steel spear in one hand, with the end of the rope tied around Brosnin in the other, she started off towards High Hold Pass.<br>
<br>
Shadows filled High Hold Pass despite the sun's position high in the sky.  Screams of raging orcs rebounded against the canyon walls, making the guards on duty flinch.  A slight noise, different from the thundering beats of anxious adventurers, made one guard look down from his perch.  A lone woman walked the dusty path, a rope dragging behind her. Wondering at the dried blood encrusting her clothing, he was shocked to see Bronin Higginsbot behind her.  Despite numerous bounty hunters sent after the infamous rogue, none had been successful.  Calling to his superior, he quickly told of what he had seen.  Smiling wreathing the Captain's face, he came from the balcony of the Keep to meet her personally.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, Joonling you have returned!  Have you the information I seek?&quot; he jovially asked her.  She merely turned and dragged Bronin forward, dropping him at his feet.  Ignoring the gasps, Joonling requested that she be paid.  Gaping at the woman, the Captain sputtered helplessly.  &quot;I wanted vengence for my trusted aid's death but I never expected this!  I never ASKED for this! I merely wanted the information and to stretch his neck on the rack.&quot;  Eyeing him strangely, Joonling motioned to Bronin.  &quot;So I failed in the information gathering, he is still here for you to kill.&quot;  The Captain wondered what trick she was trying to pull.  &quot;He is already dead woman!  You have only brought me his head! Without his ears I might add.&quot;<br>
<br>
Joonling gasped and stared at the rope she held.  Attached at the other end was the head of the once great escape artist formerly known as Bronin Higginsbot.  Glancing down at her own clothing, she realized the dirt she thought she had brushed away last night was instead blood and gore.  Withdrawing her dagger, Joonling notice hair at the tip.  Looking back up at the Captain, she shrugged and replied &quot;So I have.  Either way am I still to be paid? <p></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/ujoonlingshadowstryker.showPublicProfile>JoonLingShadowStryker</A> at: 6/5/00 9:10:50 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=393.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=387.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=385.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=385.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=385.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=385.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
