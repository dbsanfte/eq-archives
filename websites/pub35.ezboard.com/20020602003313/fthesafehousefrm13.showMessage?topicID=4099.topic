Once the ore has been found, more is needed.  Since the dagger is magical, one must first get the magical component specifically needed for completion.  The frontier ore is said to be found within the mines filled with the warring Goblins.  Some Goblins keep it close to them.  The magical component needed is the gem of nimbleness.  Once the two items are found, there is only one that has the talent to successfully make the weapon.  His name is Dapper Blackhammer.  He is known to frequent the area around Kaladim.
