I write down how much each perf was and how many times I critted on them. Prior to the relics I was critting about twice every 20 perfs or so. The Crits were &quot;fair&quot; ranging from an extra 15-30% damage of the total perf output.<br><br>Now my crit rate has gone thru the roof. In the last 2 hours I have critted 26 times in some 58 Perfs!

PA uses a multiplier on this damage as well.<br><br>The two relics add 20% to your base damage.<br><br>Now your weapon skill takes that base and multiplies it (on your best hit) for an extra 50%.  The net effect is that the relics make your actual max base hit increase by 30%.<br><br>Now you are using the CS line, and this modifies your modified damage.  Now you get to see obscene numbers when you use PA, which is the biggest multiplier of the CS line.<br><br>Even funnier than melee weapons are the spells, which at full spec do 200% base damage... and the relics add to the base damage, not the final damage.<br><br>The end result is the realm with the relics has a huge advantage in RvR, that is almost impossible to beat.  The also have a huge advantage in PvE, which attracts new people to their server, as it is easier to level there by FAR.  Success breeds success.  <br><br>Hence Mythics problem that unbalanced servers tend to become more unbalanced over time (this is called a Negative Dynamic Stability for those who care). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unage42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nage42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/28/02 7:05:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3826.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 3 strength relics do more than you think.</span><hr size=1> Oh man, I've been having a hard time soloing as it is (and we had all three STR relics until this weekend)....
