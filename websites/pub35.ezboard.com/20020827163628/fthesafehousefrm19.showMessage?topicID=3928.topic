If one happens to pass by the VN boards sometime and sees all the &quot;nerf&quot; posts one would see what I mean.<br>
<br>
People don't seem to care about the person behind the charecter at the other end of the line.  They don't care if the game is fun for anyone else or not accept for them.<br>
<br>
In accordance with this, assassins have had to take the most @#%$ than almost any other class (perhaps archers have had it just as tough).<br>
<br>
But the point is, why did we pick an assassin, and more importantly why did mythic put it in?<br>
<br>
Probably because its a role playing game and thievery is an essential feature of this. <br>
<br>
Me I had only really played 1 MMORPG b4 starting DAOC and that was Legend of Mir which was a horrible game.  In any case, daoc had been reccomended by a friend so I thoguht I'd try it out.  I asked my friend what class would be &quot;fun&quot; to play and had greater long term rewards for &quot;sticking&quot; it out.  So I chose to play in Hibernia because a lot of my friends were playing on it, and I chose a Nightshade because the NS was the assassin class of the hib realm.  I had been told by several ppl that leveling would be HARD, but boy I had no clue.  <br>
<br>
Right from the start, the responses when looking for groups etc.  In any case I'd like to shorten the rant here, I could go on about the problems with assassins in DAOC and the truth is that its basically happened due to mythic's poor handling and absolute incompetence to understand the game, resulting in a class that was supposed to be fun to play (atleast in RvR) having a lot of its features removed in order to &quot;complete&quot; the class.<br>
<br>
I wonder when the &quot;nerf assassins&quot; posts will end.  But there will always be some 14 year old caster moron, and there will always be the seemingly bigger idiots working down at mythic.<br>
<br>
Already my play time in DAOC has gone down a great deal, and seeing the departure of Elaa and mythics blatent disregard for the views of the assassin comminity, it makes me wish that I had never put as much time as I did into the game.<br>
<br>
To answer my own question of the subject, I picked an  assassin because I thought it would be fun, I thought PvE would be hard but I would be rewarded by fun in RvR.  Everyone talks about RvR being the end game, but my NS has a lot more Played hours trying to get to 50, then the amount of time spent since, which I guess shows my dissapointment with the treatment of assassins.<br>
<br>
So why did you pick an assassin?   Was this what you had in mind when you started playing the game?  If not, is it perhaps time to move on? to tell mythic no more money will they make from us ever again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 1:12:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3928.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why did you pick an assassin?</span><hr size=1> Why I picked an assassin... more specifically, why I picked a Nightshade:<br>
<br>
I got into beta and rolled up a Stalker, leveled up to 5.99999, and waited anxiously for Nightshades to be created. The description of Nightshades told me that I would be physically weak, but I would have all sorts of sneaky spells.<br>
<br>
I never envisioned myself as a killer. I figured I'd be a scout or a spy--casting spells that made me invisible or illusions to spy on the enemy. Considering how difficult as a Stalker it was just to level to 5, I couldn't imagine Nightshades ever being good in combat. At the time, you could only train weapon skills and dual wield to half your level and you could train the climb skill. At level 5, my stalker had 4 points in climb and 3 in stealth. Ugh, what a mistake.<br>
<br>
Nightshades went in 3 weeks before the end of beta. I played up to level 12 before the end of beta. The class wasn't anywhere near finished, but I decided that perhaps I could still help shape the Nightshade class into the sneaky spellcaster I was hoping they could be. Of course, Mythic got lazy and just threw a bunch of scraps together for the assassin classes, some minor tweaks to the assassins and wallah: light tanks with stealth and poison.<br>
<br>
Knowing that Mythic isn't going to lift a finger to help us, I only have one question: If we're balanced RvR-wise, can we please be balanced PvE-wise?<br>
<br>
I have many alternate characters, but I always come back to my Nightshade. It's fun being tiny, invisible, and standing over the dead body of a troll (a green con, but I'll take what I can get).<br>

I was attracted to the Nightshade based on the powerful spellcaster/rogue class description, which played a role in my purchasing DAOC.<br>
<br>
I wanted to relive some of my mage/thief experiences from paper and dice D&amp;D in a real time MMORPG. What I discovered is that you are basically &quot;Roleplaying&quot; a spellcaster/rogue by playing a Nightshade. They technically meet the bare minimum requirement of what it means to be a spellcaster/rogue because they were released with a single DD spell and Stealth/Backstab combo. Instead, the Nightshade is really a melee class that can stealth, and the magic is more of a spice factor. The spells really don't do anything to change in the dynamic of how you would play a Nightshade. My EQ Ranger was more of a spellcaster/rogue than my Nightshade, and spells had a dynamic effect on the way I played my character.<br>
<br>
Neverwinter Nights does an excellent job (well, it is D&amp;D afterall) of capturing what it feels like to be a mage/thief multiclass. It's also nice to return to other pure rogue like games. There's always Thief, Deus Ex, or even Metal Gear that does a great job in capturing what it means to avoid detection, strike unnoticed, and break into places. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=servo>Servo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 1:58:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3928.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why did you pick an assassin?</span><hr size=1> Jah, Elaa.. after beating Deus Ex twice, I've reinstalled it to relive those awesome moments (and partly to see it after I tweaked my gfx card with Radeon Tweaker, heh).<br>
<br>
Anywho, I originally bought the game because a few of my friends had also bought it. They said it got some really good ratings, and compared to Anarchy Online, it was much better. I had originally decided to play an Eldritch, but when it came down to it, I rolled a Stalker instead. At that time, I wanted to be a Ranger, since I had recently passed the requirements to become a part of the Ranger Platoon at my highschool (which I now regret). So apparently I talked to the wrong people at the wrong time or something, and became a Nightshade.<br>
<br>
Around level 20, I felt like there was a hole in my chest from dying repeatedly (at least 30 times) at the parth farm in Lough Derg. Anywho, my friends passed me in levels easily, me at lvl 15, they at 25, me at 35, them at 45, and finally they're 50s and I'm 41, heh. It's been a difficult road, but I get a great feeling one-shotting greens, rofl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gharrick>Gharrick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 2:04:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3928.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why did you pick an assassin?</span><hr size=1> I never really heard of DA0C until Oct 22, when I overheard two people talking about it in Asheron’s Call. I went out and bought DAoC the next day and never looked back. So when I started, I really didn’t know anything about the game except what was in the manual that came with it.<br>
<br>
I saw that there were three realms, and I envisioned that an infiltrator would be able to sneak into other realms (the home realms, not the frontiers) and spy on enemies. Maybe I could even sneak into their guilds and castles and eavesdrop on their battle plans. That would let me go places no other character could go and I would be useful to my realm. I think the name “infiltrator” also led me to believe it would work something like that. Back then, I had never heard that assassins were called &quot;assassins&quot;. The single-player game Thief also had a lot to do with my choice. Before that, I hadn't thought much about being a thief-type character, always choosing something like a paladin or wizard instead. But Thief showed me how fun sneaking can be. I also briefly considered being a scout because I was an archer in AC and I really liked it.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the infiltrator class turned out to be not what I imagined. And also, the game turned out not to work as I imagined. (You can’t get into other home realms). That’s not a criticism of the game. It’s just a result of my ignorance at the beginning. But as it turned out, the infiltrator class IS a nice class and is a lot of fun to play. So I’m not too disappointed. I don’t think I would rather be anything than an assassin or archer class.<br>

I chose them because from all the research i found they were good at soloing. I chose Hibernia because my friends were all playing there first....my personal preference would have been Midgard. <br>
<br>
I made it to 41 with my Enchanter mostly solo with a high Enc/light spec and then they suddenly added the new Enchanter pets. The worst bug of the pets(still not fixed) was that it would miss it's first swing and just stand there while the mob was running at you. I tortured myself this way by playing to almost 42.5 and then decieded to try a new class. <br>
<br>
I took every other Hib class to at least 10 sometimes 15 before i tried the shade.  I had avoided the shade because I had heard so much about how gimped they were and how careful you had to be to spec. <br>
<br>
Then one day on a whim i though WTF I'll try a shade and see how it goes. If i didn't like it i probably would have left Hibernia and maybe the game. I spec'd for CS/Stealth/Env and went too it and found that is was the most fun i ever had playing this game.<br>
<br>
 I made my first 9 levels in one day but I was a bit twinked out because of the extra cash/loot i had from my Enc. I knew from this day on my main was going to be a shade. My Enchanter is almost 43 now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  with only 27 days played while Brio is 50 with over 42days played. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uappolion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Appolion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://lobo.freeweb.supereva.it/gallery/lobo-04l.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 3:46:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3928.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why did you pick an assassin?</span><hr size=1> After numerous characters in all 3 realms since day 1 of DAOC's release to the public, I gave up on the game and the nerfs after the release of Neverwinter Nights.<br>

<br>
I couldn't figure out what to play.  I've always been drawn to the Artemis Entreri and Drizzt characters, and wanted something like that.  My friend Jon somehow talked me into a Mercenary (I'm still confused on that whole thing).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was having a bit of fun with my Merc (Brandyn, hence the EZBoard name) until my first foray to Emain at level 20.  I was all giddy and nervous being in &quot;The Frontier&quot; for the first time.  An assassin (shadowblade I think) named Softfoot was one shotting people.  We were standing in a group of about 10 or 12 people and every now and then somone would let out an awful death scream and fall to the ground.... &quot;RandomVictim was just killed by Softfoot!&quot;<br>
<br>
That was sooo cool.  I remember everyone getting all nuts and running around in circles trying to find him.  I caught a glimpse of him for about two seconds before he slipped out of sight.  I knew right then what I had to do.  I did a little research, fiding Safehouse and Tarnished Dagger, then a little more research to find a cool name (since my usually vivid imagination seemed to have deserted me).  I settled on Aurra Sing, a not-so-well-known assassin from a very-well-known science-fiction universe.<br>
<br>
I've always played thieves and rangers In D&amp;D, so once I made Aurra, I felt much more comfortable. <p>-Aurra Sing-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucephlen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cephlen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/02 6:17:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3928.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why did you pick an assassin?</span><hr size=1> I picked an assassin particularly because I enjoyed games where subtlety and cunning was used to dispatch your enemies.

<br>
Unfortunately after they took away one shot unstealth kills I feel less and less drawn to the game. Also instead of me using stealthy knives I have somehow been stuck with a sword that makes me look like a barbarians girlfriend.  Even with epic armor and the fact that everyone in emain is lvl 50 seems to distance me from the Tenchu image of an assassin I desperately wanted. Even level 50 lurikeen casters (red con to me) who don't see me coming always seem to escape with their lives and somehow take mine in the process.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has played Tenchu or Tenchu 2 knows what kind of an assassin I am striving to become.<br>

Later, it became AD&amp;D and they were just called rogues, if I remember correctly.<br>
Anyone besides me remember when assassin and thief were actually seperate classes in D&amp;D?<br>
DAoC was the first MMORPG that I've played. My wife was going to have surgery and be out of commission for a week. I would have to stay home and tend to her and everything else. I decided to buy an on-line game to occupy my time. <br>
The choice was between DAoC and EQ. My friend told me not to choose EQ because the game had been out for years and I'd be way behind.<br>
So, DAoC it was. Bought it about 1 &gt; 2 weeks after it released. Rolled a sb because I figured not many people would run a kobold assassin. <br>
Also, figured that if I didn't like the class, I'd roll a big, mean fighter. I liked the looks of trolls more than I liked the looks of firbolgs. So, eventually also rolled a troll warrior.<br>
BTW, my user name is actually from my warrior, Shonuff. My cb is named Dzugu Longshanks on MLF. <br>
Dzugu is an old word used in some West African languages. It means 'wicked' or 'evil'.<br>

I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting. I never anticipated being a toe-to-toe fighter, in fact I probably would've been content never killing a soul if I was able to alter battles with distraction and deception and otherwise be a pain in the ass to invaders.<br>

I also like the fact that in the rvr scene, all the non-stealthers really don't have much say in the situation, but at least has option of not dying sometimes. *shrugs*  Sounds kinda unhelpful for the realm, but if they're getting rolled, wouldn't you rather be scouting than back at your bind ready to go back out and know that the force that just rolled you down earlier is probably out there and awaiting your arrival.<br>
