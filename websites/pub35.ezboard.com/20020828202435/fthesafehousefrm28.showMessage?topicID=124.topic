I've browsed through a lot of places for the more popular ones but can't seem to find one I like (that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> isn't</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> sold only in Korea heh). So I thought I'd ask here and see if anyone has something similar to what I'm looking for or could suggest one.<br>
<br>
Basically I'm looking for something small and easily portable that doesn't have to hold a lot of songs. It also needs to use the more common memory cards, like say the CompactFlash cards. No Sony sticks. I'm just after something I can comfortably stick in my pocket and play a few hours of music on. Err and any player requiring me to use 'this' and only 'this' mp3 software to put songs on it is automatically disqualified on grounds of being too bloody annoying.<br>
<br>
Oh and I am of course always looking to learn more about whether I should get an AMD or Intel for my computer, and after I've decided, would you recommend running Windows or Unix?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaidden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asst.

When you say small, can you give me some dimensions?<br>
When you say hold some music? how many songs or how much time?<br>
<br>
What quality are you MP3's stored at?Will you insist on removable media?<br>
<br>
USB?<br>
USB2.0?<br>
Firewire?<br>
<br>
Do you have a budget?<br>

Removable media is a must though, I'm not fond of relying just on the internal. Usually store my mp3s at the standard 128.<br>
Budget - depends on quality of the player, I'll hard cap around $500 though and I'd prefer something around the $300 or less range.<br>
<br>
Size, 10 inc.. err, sorry, wrong board. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Less than or equal to 4 inches height 2.5 inches length roughly.<br>
<br>
The important thing to me isn't whether it can store 5 GB of music, or whether it can play every song by Mozart ever flawlessly at 192 while in a blender on puree or not. I'm trying to find something that's smaller than my dying portable cd player (bless it's electronical mid-90s soul), can be concealed in pockets at the workplace, sounds ok, and won't cost half a soul. I'm also attempting to not give in and buy the flashiest one I can find, so the only things I draw absolute lines at are the types of removable media (no Sony sticks!) and refusal to install even more crappy software just to use it (yes Lycra, I'm looking at you).<br>

<br>
I get the need to use software to transfer the files. What I'm not into are the ones that rewrite the mp3 files to whatever pseudo-mp3 format the player actually uses. Requiring me to rewrite the files to that format everytime I want to change songs. Or when the player comes with another mp3 playing program and requires you to use <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to dl the songs to the player (all the while suggesting you'd be much happier to switch file associations, play lists, folder organisation and probably your soul to the new program).<br>
<br>
The ability to transfer files other than mp3s is ok but I don't plan on using the player for anything other than playing music. Nor do I need a lot of memory, 64mb total would for example be sufficient for my current music need. Another reason the HD based systems aren't high on my list - overkill and more expensive it seems.<br>
<br>
And shucks, you're afraid of little old me yelling at ya? I'm mostly harmless I assure you, feel free to make suggestions! Even if they don't meet my requirements it's still better than the nothing I have now. How am I supposed to yell at you for being a Nazi moderator if you don't offer opinions?! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaidden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asst.

I need the smallest physical deminsions, min 64mb memory, the ability to use a minimum of another 64mb card.  Preferably I'd like one that does not required software to transfer.  I don't have USB 2.0 support.  I would much prefer to connect it to my linux computer but would settle for win2k I guess.  Also I don't have the world worth of money to use.<br>

And ipods are good.  Though I'm sure everyone has heard the story of the kid who walked into a store and downloaded MS office for OSX onto his ipod.  (Or more correctly, got caught doing it.) <p>--------------------------
