At least post 20... pre 20 its a bunch of deleveled tanks running around killing people that can't really hope to fight back.  There is no PvP to speak of on rallos, I played there 52 lvls and was only attacked 10 times, 4 times I escaped, 4 times the attacker suffered exp loss from mobs(this was at lower lvls), 2 times Darkenbane members layed dead at my feet.  <br>
<br>
On TZ I was in easily over 500 pvp battles going from lvl 1 to 53.  I'd say thats a large difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustytchyapgud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stytch Yapgud</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/18/01 8:36:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.marillion.com/pix/covers/assass.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Before comming to the Zek's please read.</span><hr size=1> not played on rallos so cant comment but on Tallon I started in freeport which was probably a bad idea an I got ganked constantly at the weekends.

<br>
Its good tho cos when ive gone back to my vorpse i allways give  a grats to my &quot;ganker&quot; and they are allways cool about it and wish me luck in gettin better.<br>

i did gank a shadowknight of the same level tho we kept goin at it even tho i kept winnig an he was cool about it too. <br>

it says some crap about &quot;this class/race/religeous combo is considered medium difficulty&quot;<br>
<br>
this post should replace that page on the team servers, on rallos it should have one added paragraph.<br>
<br>
<br>
   When you spawn in A_NewbieZone_00 and get ganked before you even turn in the note for your tunic Dont Cry.  If you have been ganked for the nth time in west freeport Do not shout to the zone how you have nothing leave me alone I just want to lvl blah blah blah.  The Newbie Zones Are For the Newbie Killers. If you want to come to rallos and lvl GO TO ANOTHER ZONE!  freeport has 4 count em 4 newbie zones attached to it efp/wfp/ndr/and the south side of ec from fp all the way to wc. Only west freeport is the newbie nightmare. Get a clue Grow a Brain or Get The @#%$ OFF THE SERVER! It is PAINFULLY easy to get to 8th lvl without ever getting ganked on this server, So shut the hell up and find some place else to lvl.<br>

Oh Yeah Dont Come To one of the Zeks Shouting &quot;WTT UBER FAT LEWT ON a_carebearserver_00 For CASH/GEAR ON THIS ONE!&quot; this only pisses us off. <p>Diabolein Avidya <br>

I only met one person who actually liked pking and liked the thrill of the hunt (or being hunted).<br>
<br>
I am not afraid of these circumstances described in the &quot;rules&quot;, they seem very appealing from my viewpoint as a rogue that was constantly puched around by casters unless they were in an arena with me.

The PVP rules need to decide that this is really a 4 team game and forbid cross-team grouping, buffing, healing, etc.  The new &quot;RP server&quot; (BLUE!) that is going to have grouping restrictions is a step in the WRONG direction if they don't reform TZ and VZ's systems.<br>

Saying ye sent someone back to &quot;mommy&quot; is...interesting. I never keep track of those that &quot;got away&quot; nor do I ever offer excuses if someone slays me.  As I once said to a halfling I slew in Paw, &quot;we are at war, the ever vigilant live, the lax die&quot;.<br>
<br>
Killing people has never been an issue of &quot;record&quot; for me and most of the Shanks.  I attack people mainly for roleplay purposes or to launch an attack on a zone I wish to gain items from (such as Cazic Thule etc).<br>
<br>
There is a new Zek server coming up where they plan to test some new rules.  I did my best at the panel discussion to support the idea of hardcoding one of the team servers to team, setting one as &quot;good vs evil&quot; and letting a move log occur.  It seemed that this was also the idea of Lady D who was leading the discussion so we know we have at least one supporter.  I also mentioned to several of the dev team that rules needed to be made clear and I suggested a bit of explanation be added to the log in screen so folks who may have just chosen a PvP server due to low population will have more warning of what they are getting into.<br>

As for my snide remarks, I couldn't say I've killed a Shank because I haven't yet.

<br>
One interesting thing about joining Zek to kill.... I did join it for PVP, obviously, but I don't feel I have to KOS anyone but my enemies list; heck, that covers it anyway.  As a good Elf, I think it's sensible to roleplay a peaceloving char; targets go out of their way to present themselves by attacking me or others.<br>
<br>
Not that I 'disapprove' of PKing or anything ridiculous like that.  I just roleplay a do-gooder, as I always tend to, and that involves more anti-pk fighting than anything.  I'm sure glad I get attacked, and it's not like I'm playing PvE on a PvP server.  The Shanks, the Combines, the Shorty PK guilds, Illuvatae... They are all great folks that serve a good purpose.  <br>
<br>
I guess I might attack a non-elf PK guilder in an unprovoked fashion... Just to keep things fair.<br>
