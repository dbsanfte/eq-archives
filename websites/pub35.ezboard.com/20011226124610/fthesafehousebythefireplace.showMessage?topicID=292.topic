As I do every morning before I set off for an adventure, I checked the safehouse board hung at the back of the bar. Pleasently surprised, it informed me that my apprentice Tadyen had just the day before gone to Guk and retrieved the mask that we had together searched for. I swore to myself once again that I would try again for a mask of deception once I have fully recovered from both my death (OOC I lost my lvl 18 char of the same name/class), and recovered from the abortive attempt to find the assasin which was still fresh in my memory. I remembered how close I had been that last time, getting into the Lair of the assasin alone, Tadyen already been slain a few times trying to get here. I hid behind a pack of fine adventurers, just to see the assasin appear, and some how, turn and see me! Before I could even scream for help, I was slain. That would have been ok, if I had'nt paid for the services of a cleric to ressorect me, just to have my fine apprentice remove my corpse before the cleric could cast his magic. *smile* still, we had tried, failed, but as it seems, Tadyen had gotten the nerve to go back faster than I.<br>
Leaving crows I decided to head to BlackBurrow to practise my backstab and parry with a few Guards. As I was getting there, a messanger sent by a friend of mine, Scrounge, rushed up to me.<br>
&quot;Sir, are you the Cyriex who seeks the mask of deception?&quot;<br>
Slightly startled by the fact this guy knew of the failed attempt before (which I had until now keepen very quiet about), I told him that indeed, I was that man.<br>
&quot;Good, my master, Scrounge, is planning to hunt down the Assasin tonight. He sent me to tell you that if you can get there quick enough, he will leave the mask for you&quot;<br>
Delighted, I gave the messanger a measly tip of 10pp (stolen, of cause), and rushed back to Qeynos.<br>
Not wanting to risk loosing any more than a bit of my experiance, I left all but the bare essentials in the bank. So with some food, water, my greater lightstone, a compass, and a amulet of bravery I had just aquired for finding out that a guards daugther had been slain in the aqueducts, I set off.<br>
As I left queynos, I asked for some magical assistance, but as none was forthcomming, I was silently happy, for I do not trust the abilities of magic, it is far too fickle and seems to fail you when you need it most. Once again, I would have to enter Guk based solely on my knowlage of stealth alone, and this time I would be going in alone, or at least that is what I thought at that time.<br>
As I was passing the Aviak village in South Karana, I saw a beutiful silluette of a half elf on the horizon. As I approached, I realised it was none other than my wife-to-be, Saja. Please to see me, especially as I was wearing practically nothing *grin*, I told her what I planned to do.<br>
Much to my protest at first, she came with me. I was deeply worried of her safty for then on. She's a ranger you see, and no where near as stealthy as we would require to get into and around the dead side of Lower Guk, even if she is as powerful as I was before my death. Still, happy with the company, we headed off. After a slight detor around most of the Rathe Mountains, we entered the Feerrot, and somehow got seperated right from the start. Praying that her excess agility would get her past the spectres plauging the area, I was relying on sneaking and hiding to get me to the Innothule swamp. Good thing too, as I neared the only path out of the forest, a spectre flew right over my head...good thing we rogues are unrivaled at staying out of sight nowadays.<br>
In the swap we made our way to the lair of the frogloks, and Saja could see from the danger faced just in the swap that perhaps accompanying me down to the assasins lair was not the nicest of ideas. When we entered Guk, she told me that she would wait here and rest a bit, they catch up later.<br>
Secretly happy that I could now do the hardest part of the quest on my own without having to worry about Saja's safty, I headed down to Lower Guk, following the route I had taken so long to find before. In record time I was in the deadside of the ruins of Guk, to be greated with the largest amout of corpes you could EVER imagine. Luckily, some were of the ghoulish frogloks themselves, and I made a quick few platinum before I was forced to hide as 3 Greater Iced boned skeletons ran past me, trying there best to slay none other than my friend Scrounge. Knowing that there was no way I could fight these undead abominations, I was very happy to see them killed by those around me, and Scrounge survived without a scratch.<br>
I found out that those around me who were'nt dead, were with Scrounges party to kill the assasin, and while they readied themselves with magical armor and healing, I headed off to make sure the route was as clear as it could be for them. I reached the tower in which is assasin lives, gave them the all clear, and the brave band of 5 rushed in and quickly secured the room the assasin is frequently seen in. Up there we waited, and waited, the bordom frequently being broken as ghouls appeard, and once a few Ice bones got up in the assasin room, and took a rather large chunk out of me before the group could save me...still, I lived, and so was the rest of the group.<br>
Then, just as I was about to call it a night and head back to the surface, the assasin appeard! Not seeing me this time, probably because a foolish Teir'dal was acting as a great dark elven shield *grin*, the group slayed him with such effciency, I was shocked. they even slayed two bodyguards that appeard with him, while none of them too serious damage. Shaking with sheer anticpation, Scrounge checked the corpse, adn told me, indeed, that this assasin carried the mask. I lowered my hands to the face of the evil abomination, and took its mask of its foul face, and after giving it a quick rub down, put it on my own. Smiling from underneath the mask, I thanked all those about me continuously, untill they got fed up and told me to get lost! Happy, I snuck out, and ran out of Upper Guk, just to be greated to Saja's smiling face. Together, and happy, we headed off towards freeport. However, tired as I was, I barly had entered the desert of Souther Ro before I faited with shear exhasution (link dead). Happy that my quest was finally done, that was a fine sleep I hade.<br>
<br>
OOC Seems like my return to Guk was alot more profitable than the last. No deaths, ok, a few injuries and close calls, but that makes being a rogue worth it! and I got the mask within 1 hour of being there..and about 10pp in other loot. Not a fortune, but makes the whole thing more worth it...now, onto level 14 and getting the damn mask to work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>
