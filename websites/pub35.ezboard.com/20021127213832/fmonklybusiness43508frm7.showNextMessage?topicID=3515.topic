<br>
Using the law of exponential probability, and some of the Raster camp times I estimate that his chance of spawning at any given time is about 2%...<br>
<br>
Background:<br>
The probability theory goes like this, take the chance that an event will not happen, and raise it to the power of the number of times that it can happen to see what the probability is that it will happen at least once during that time period...  Take flipping a coin for example...  Flip it once and the probability that it will not be heads is .5...  Flip it twice and the probability that it will not be heads one of those two times is (.5)*(.5) or (.5)^2 or .25...  In this example the probability that you will see heads one of the two times that you flip the coin is 75%...<br>
<br>
Raster:<br>
Bodi's guide has the probability that Raster will spawn at .05...  Using this probability, the average number of PH that you should see before encountering the bastard is 13 or 14 (.95^13 = .51)...  Some would see him sooner, some would take longer but you have a 50-50 chance of seeing him at least once in your first 13 or 14 spawns...  Using the 3 spawns per 72 minutes, the average Raster camp should be about 5 and a half hours...  If you see 90 ph spawns (36 hours) you should have a 99% chance of at least one of them being Raster...  This is obviously not the case as many of you will attest...<br>
<br>
Based on the other threads I've seen in this section it seems that the average number of PH seems to be more like 40...  Putting the camp on average more like 16 hours...  This would indicate a spawn probability of 2% (.98^40 = 44%)...  The problem here is the people who claim to have put in like 200 hours at the camp...  This is 500 PH spawns...  At 2%, the probability that you will see him sometime in he first 500 spawns is like 99.995%...  Now it is feasible that someone could get that unlucky, there could not be vary many who are...  I'm sure that there are at least a half dozen who claim to have put that kind of time in on that camp...<br>
<br>
If we assume the probability is 1% then you have a 50-50 chance of seeing him in the first 68 PH spawns...  This would put the average camp at 27.2 hours and the probability that you will see him in the first 500 spawns is 99.35%...  This still too small a chance for my taste, plus I don't see the evidence that he is this rare which means there has to be another factor involved that I am not accounting for...<br>
<br>
I don't think we can rule out the possibility that SOE has put in some conditions which makes it impossible for him to spawn...  Perhaps they have some limit like he is not allowed to spawn more than 3 times per week...  Perhaps its like the Ry'gor Emissary who spawns like crazy right after a patch but if the servers have been up for a while almost never spawns...  This would mean that there are some poor saps who camped him for long periods of time where he had no chance of spawning...<br>

<br>
1. The previous spawn has absolutely no effect on the current spawn. <br>
<br>
2. The random number generator is anything but random. I'd really like to see SOE post their RNG.<br>
<br>
Probability is good to tell us what we might expect to happen, *given a long enough run*.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ssyxz<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->60 Iksar Grandmaster<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=178226">Magelo</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=z0nk>Z0nk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/21/02 8:55:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5872.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raster rairity</span><hr size=1> The exponential probability theory has does not assume that the probability of an event has anything to do with what happened in the previous event...  (The chance that he spawns has nothing to do with what the previous spawn was in my equation)...<br>
<br>
Let me try and explain it better...  The chance that you will see heads if you flip a coin is .5 (50%)...  The chance that you will see heads at least once if you flip the coin twice is (1-.5^2) or 75%...  the break down goes like this, there are 4 possibities... heads then tails, tails then heads, heads then heads, tails then tails...  in 3 of those possibilites, heads occurs and in only 1 heads does not occur so the probability that you will see heads at least once if you flip a coin twice is 3/4 or 75%...  If we take a random event that has a much lower possibilty of occuring it works the same way...  If you assume that raster's chance of spawing is 2% then his chance of not spawning is 98%...  If you see 100 Raster PH spawns your chance of at least one of them being  Raster is (1-.98^100) = 87% <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lauralynmournblade>Lauralyn Mournblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.telocity.com/~stormwolf/Hosted_files/smallringdgreen.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(11/21/02 9:25:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5872.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raster rairity</span><hr size=1> give me a sub-atomic vector plotter and a good source of brownian motion (say, a nice hot cup of tea) and to hell with probability. <p><table width=468 height=108 align=center border=0><tr>

Being bored I tracked the spawn times of the room.  The spawn adjoining the pit area occurs every 10 EQ hours, exactly.  The spawn at the 'corner' of the hallway entering the area where Raster spawns occurs every 10 to 11 hours. but does occur.  <br>
Currently as of this date the spawn times on Raster's 'stage' is off by approximately an hour, as I stopped by and discussed it with a monk currently holding the camp (as soon as I woke up).   It can be reset by allowing the next spawn to despawn at the 8am time, even though the wait will be long.<br>
This is the most unfair quest imaginable.  Only one monk can camp at a time and others have to sit and watch or keep returning in anticipation of the long, long rare spawn to occur.  <br>
I even had an incident occur where another monk insisted we share the spawns under the no camping allowed rules.  He proceeded to kill the 5am spawn and I logged off.  <br>
I am almost out of food and water again.  And this is fun?<br>
