I am thinking about starting a meele class. A class capable to go inside dungeons and solo enemies all the way in, deeper and deeper. I talked about it to my guild and they had 3 options for me. The Iksar Monk, the Iksar Sk and the Troll Sk. I am not saying that the other classes cant do the job, but from the meele classes these are the best ones to do it.<br>
<br>
I wont lie to you. Pulling is something I dont like to do. As a wizard I love to deliver damage and the rogue on the first moment seemed to be the logical choice but the rogue cant solo at all and it is boring. <br>
<br>
I have some questions for you that I couldnt find answers for. I already read some posts and used the search.<br>
<br>
<br>
1- Can a &quot;NOT TWINKED&quot; monk solo all the blue mobs from level 1 to 60?<br>
2- Are the good monk items very expensive? I have heard that the good SKs items are much cheaper.<br>
<br>
<br>
PLEASE DONT ANSWER ME WITH SOMETHING LIKE: IF YOU DONT LIKE TO PULL DONT BE A MONK. IT ISNT VERY CONSTRUTIVE AT ALL. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hamirez>Hamirez</A> at: 5/20/02 2:03:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ubrialmobslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brial Mobslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/20/02 2:01:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1523.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is a monk capable of?</span><hr size=1> The solo part... let me tell you.

No you will not be able to solo all blue cons up to 60. at 37 a griffiene is green and a griffawn is light blue, and I wouldnt try them.<br>
<br>
Pros of Iksar monk: <br>
Biggest Feign Death. I know SK's get it too, but its a spell and can be interupted.<br>
Mend. Every 6 RL min you have a heal spell. Once over 100 skill it wont fail.<br>
Iksar and trolls both have the regen, but I think trolls are better. but not sure<br>
Fighting: you will have dual weild from lvl 1 and double attack at 15. With a SK there is no dual wield that I can see and dont get double attack till lvl 20<br>
Monk has kick, round rick, tiger claw, eagle strike, tail rake, then flying kick as rounds progress. SK's have bash at lvl 6 thats it. <br>
In 1 round a monk has a chance to hit with main hand 2 times, off hand once as well as a strike/kick. And speed is his freind. thats why a monk usually strives for faster weapons over powerful (8/20 for bamboo bo, and fighting baton/ 7/18 with wu trance stick and jade mace is 9/1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Cons: weight. Only being able to carry 14-20 pounds of stuff sucks. <br>
Hit points and ac can be as much as half of a warriors. But thats why warriors and knights are tanks and monks arent usually.<br>
<br>
Shadowknight pros: Bigger weapon/armor choice, hit harder, spell casting. <br>
Less down time<br>
Not too familiar, so these are just from what I have seen.<br>
Cons: would say you are hated everywhere, but trolls and iksar already have this<br>
Mana dependent for healing and other spells.<br>
Iksar cant wear plate armor, where trolls can.<br>
<br>
If you decide to be a monk, expect people to want you to be the puller. If you group and find its you a cleric and an enchanter, better tell them to get a warrior or knight to be puller. <p><a>

If what you meant is &quot;Can I solo blues to get all the way from level 1 to 60 if I am not twinked?&quot; then the answer is yes.  You just have to know what you can and cannot fight at a given level.<br>
<br>
2. It depends on what you consider &quot;good&quot; and &quot;expensive&quot;.  1k worth of gear can easily get you to level 40.  Add a haste item and that same gear can take you to 60 if you want.  On the other hand, a Tranquil staff will set you back about 30k.  It's all a matter of degree.<br>
<br>
If you want to hit dungeons, I'd stay away from the troll.  Because of their size it really is more difficult to get around indoors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/umyris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Myris</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/20/02 7:30:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1523.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is a monk capable of?</span><hr size=1> 1-You can solo blues all the way up to sixty just gotta know which ones at which lvl dunno what the guy was talking about not being able to take green griffons lol<br>

<br>
solo to 60.....yup it can be done.  it may be slow at times but it can be done.<br>
<br>
it depends on what you consider expensive.  some decent monk items can be had relatively inexpensively.<br>
<br>
a monk with decent gear will have AC on par with a well equipped warrior and are probably the best class for damage avoidance.  in terms of damage output, the last i heard the monk lags only behind the rogue.  all in all, the monk is a very fun and well rounded class.<br>
<br>
the SK is a fun class as well.  they aren't quite as soloable as the monk in my opinion.  they do have their taps for healing but for constant fighting could really use a healer.  i don't like kunark myself but an iksar sk would seem to be the better choice than troll.  the plate issue isn't as much of a problem with the magical armors out there, the regen is equal, but the iksar have that nice greenmist quest.<br>
<br>
personally, i'd roll the monk.  they have a little more freedom of travel than the SK will and as long as you have bandaids you can keep fighting. <p>Tempur Flarin - 35 Monk - <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=67354>Magelo</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/unorpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Norpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand High Poobah</span><br>  Posts: 3362<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/21/02 4:09:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1523.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/shiken/shinsai1_th.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is a monk capable of?</span><hr size=1> &quot;almost 100% positive iskar regen is better than troll&quot;<br>

Most important things to a monk.<br>

2) Equipment<br>
3) Level<br>

With that said, monk equipment isn't that expensive in comparison to other classes.<br>

Seriously, though, I love playing a Monk.  Whilst Druids and Necros will tell you they're the best soloing class, they're not strictly correct.  They can inflict more damage soloing, but they're not a patch on a Monk when it comes to &quot;all round&quot; soloing.  And the other Melee classes don't come anywhere near being as self-sufficient and &quot;balanced&quot; as a Monk.<br>
<br>
As for the comment about equipment &gt; levels, I'd have to disagree.  In just three levels I've noticed a vast improvement in my abilities when fighting and my success in killing mobs.  And I've hardly upgraded my far-than-uber equipment.<br>

Just like to comment on the SK for you.. equipment for the monk and for the shadow knight appears to be relatively cheap..monk stuff still being cheaper mind you...<br>
<br>
level 1-50 i can't imagine a monk being a better soloer than a SK... Fear kiting is your friend as a SK.. at the high end (talking level 60) the monks i know seem to have a pretty good time of it on their own<br>
<br>
Based on similarily equipped moderate equipment (not talkin high end) I can only assume a monk is going to outdamage me.. Sks do, in the end, imo have more versatility.. Sacrificing dmg output for some utility and multiple role ability.. That being said if you look at very high end you see monks with comparable hps / ac and Sks with comparable dmg (the dmg ratio on high end 2h weapons available to SKs is just insane)<br>
<br>
As either class though you can expect to be asked to pull a considerable amount in a group..<br>
<br>
Biggest pro for a monk = minimal equipment required to go out and just bash stuff. and for the casual player better melee dmg output.. &quot;may&quot; find dungeons easier as an Iksar as well(I am a Troll btw and it can be a hassle - tho so far so good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Most people know what to expect of a monk.. dmg output and pulling abilities<br>
<br>
Biggest pro for a sk = versatility/survivability.. can go anywhere with invis / invis vs undead and fd.... have good ac and hps and can carry half the dungeon to zone if Fd ain't workin for ya, and still have a reasonable chance of survival...Spells... if ya like spell casting.. hybirds baby<br>
they do require more equipment however.. Most often groups think of SKs as unspectacular in any respect and will consider other classes (such as a monk) before you... you have to work harder to dispell the myths.. SKs can be excellent dmg dealers and excellent tanks for all but the high end.. So you need to work your &quot;faction&quot; with PCs...<br>
<br>
Well, enough pro-sk on a monk board hehe..From what i can tell of my little monklet so far they are alot of fun... dw, da, fd, all sorts of kicks and punches too (oh my)... they are a low maintenance character for the casual player as well<br>
<br>
my opinion.. both can be enjoyable classes. <p>><p><center><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33463"><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/krwilson/pics/mord/mordbanner.gif" border="0"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/udaleb123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daleb123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk-in-Training</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/22/02 10:12:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1523.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Answers</span><hr size=1> 1- Can a &quot;NOT TWINKED&quot; monk solo all the blue mobs from level 1 to 60?<br>
<br>
No class can solo ALL blue MOBs to level 60, as MOBs have varying special abilities that make them match up differently against different classes. It is possible to solo all the way to 60 however, by being very careful in choosing the best gear you can get, and by being selective in your opponents. <br>

Your definition of &quot;Not Twinked&quot; will make a big difference in your capabilities as well. If by this you mean that everything you ever obtain will be by your own efforts with no help whatsoever from anyone else (even carrying loot for you), then you will find soloing to level 60 extremely difficult if not impossible. However, if you intend to make friends and have them help you work your way through this aspect of the game, then you will be fine. <br>
<br>
Also note that for pure solo play, Iksar Monks are VASTLY superior to Humans.<br>

2- Are the good monk items very expensive? I have heard that the good SKs items are much cheaper.<br>
<br>
Yes, the good Monk items are expensive, and more so than any other melee class. However, it doesn't matter because the longer an item is allowed to continue dropping in game, the more the price falls. Today's uber items will be available at bargain basement prices this time next year. As long as you don't shop for the newest items, you will be able to buy good equipment.<br>

Fear kiting becomes your main tactic, which is based largely on pathing, and radius of add mobs.  So soloing in dungeons, depending on your lvl over the mobs can be difficult.  Monk soloing is based very strictly on the, &quot;I can kill  you, faster than you can kill me&quot; method.  This gives them a legit advantage over all blue con mellee mobs.  Casters fucking suck.  Also at high ends when &quot;clickable snare&quot; items become available, you can still fearkite with a monk too, but SKs well never get Mend.  I personally prefer the monks soloing abilities, although I do have to say that SKs win out in the fashion department.  Its hard to make a stylish monk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ukkorikvalkyr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kkorik valkyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/26/02 3:33:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1523.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> SK &gt; Monk</span><hr size=1> I have a lvl 40 Iksar SK and working on my lvl 25 iksar monk right now...both are very good soloers and neither were twinked all too much.<br>
<br>
SKs are really good at soloing in out door zones thanks to fear kiting.  Makes them very stong against casters and mobs that just hit hard like giants.  Also the iksar have some great quest that leads to good gear...Dreadscale is great quest armor that can last into the 40s<br>
<br>
Monks basically work on the method of killing something b4 it can do too much damage, problem is you have to be a little more selective on mobs until ID starts to work well enough to make kiting an option.<br>
<br>
My Sk was able to solo mobs a few lvls earlier then my monk was because of kiting.<br>

It was a 5K weapon and I use GSC (free) and KD (2k) and he can't compete with my damage output. We are both level 40 and with flying kick plus the high DW it's not even really close. Mind you he is hiting double 70's a lot but when you add up the damage his DPS is a fair bit lower. I haven't looked at all the high end weapons but how many weapons an SK has that can compete with a JM/SoS or better combo? Also, monks just do insane damage with the best 2hb weapons in the game.<br>
<br>
Now as for soloing I think SK's probably have some very nice advantages simply because they aren't pure melee. They have FD so they can employ many of the tactics we do, plus slowing, self buffs, and life tapping lines are nice little perks. Not to mention their pets as an extra DoT, yes they are sucky for the most part, but they do add damage to the equation and make up at least a little for the lack of DW. Overall both SK and monk seem to solo rather nicely. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ueqdoktor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqdoktor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(5/28/02 2:19:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1523.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Monk solo - less downtime.</span><hr size=1> I have a level 30 monk (iksar), 2 SKs (31 Troll SK and a  24 Erudite SK - the &quot;melee&quot; SK and &quot;caster&quot; SK) and a level 36 warrior. The 4 have been twinked from the loot I cant be bothered to sell from my main 58 Enchanter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The key to soloing is reasonable downtime.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Every class can &quot;solo&quot;. <br>
Whether you can solo CONSISTENTLY and steadily is a different matter entirely.<br>
My level 36 warrior can solo blue to white cons anytime but even with BW, it can take me 10 to 20 mins to regain my HP to within a reasonable level to take the next one (not even to full, mind you). Assuming that is, I don't get adds that will kill my warrior. Warriors can solo if you want to level at 1/10th the speed of a soloing monk.  You'll die of RL boredom if you try to solo with a warrior.<br>
<br>
Contrast this with my soloing monkey. Even without regen items (the fabled Fungi Tunic), my lizard regen (with maxed BW, mend over 100) can take on a blue/white con every 5 mins or less (FB, CoT and I'm in Mars seru/Netherbain lair now). I can kill 2 blues (low blue) together and FD the rest away. The levelling speed of my lizard monk takes my breath away (Paludal Caverns, solo 18 to 26 in 3 days and I was taking my time to enjoy the place). Innate lizard regen, BW  and monk mend takes the sting out of downtime. Monk FD adds to the the safety factor. You can do monk soloing in dungeons too!<br>
<br>
Shadowknights can solo MUCH BETTER than the warrior but is definitely the lesser compared to monks. Fear kiting is really the only downtime reduction tactic and don't make me laugh if you say that lifetaps can heal you and keep up with the mob damage. Lifetaps are miserably inefficient and even an erudite SK will oom long before the mob is dead (let alone the Troll casting). SK FD is spell based and is pretty reasonable as an emergency &quot;ouch adds&quot; OUT button. IMO, SK soloing is pretty much dependent on the mana availability. SK HP is usually a lot higher than monks (thus SKs make better meatshields) but thats just more HP to regen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SK and Monk solo points:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1) Monks have downtime reduction skills (BW and mend)<br>
2) Troll and Iksar have innate regen (both SK and Monk races) - another downtime reducer.<br>
3) Monk solo tactics (overpower and kill) can be used in dungeons, Fear Kiting in dungeons = die horribly.<br>
4) SKs soloing in dungeons - doable but very slow compared to monks.<br>
5) Solo Trolls in dungeons - buy shrink potions.<br>
6) Both monks (from level 17) and SKs (from level 30) have emergency escapes - Feign Death.<br>
<br>
Personally I will take monks for what you described above (soloing in dungeons etc.). To tell the truth I really enjoy BOTH classes, SKs have their fun factor too! Monks are definitely more in demand in the high end game but gosh! Troll/Ikky SKs clean up all the loot in plane raids (everything defaults to the SINGLE SK up there or the items rot). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ueqdoktor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqdoktor</A> at: 5/28/02 2:21:10 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1523.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1523.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1523.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1523.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.threadControl?topicID=1523.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1523.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1523.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6>Newbie Zone</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
