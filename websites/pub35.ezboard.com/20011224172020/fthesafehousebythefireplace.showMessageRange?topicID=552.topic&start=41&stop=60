He stood on a short stool, which allowed him to clearly see over the buildings to the walls around the perimeter of the city.  The room had been an office for much taller men than he so he had the stools placed at every window, so he could look upon his demesne from a higher vantage than his natural height would allow.  His shoulders sank and he looked at the ground.  He let out a small sigh and shook his head in a sad swaying of his downward looking head, and looked up again at the flames as they closed on his lavish office in the center of town.  As they got closer, his heart sunk more deeply.<br>
<br>
How did she find out so quickly?  He wondered to himself.  It hasn’t even been four hours since he had heard the news of the demise of his two nephews.  He knew it had been a huge mistake to agree to keep the two overgrown brats in his town, but there was no denying Theophilia.  She wanted them out of the way during something she was working on, and assigned him to be their nursemaid.  Pah!  She made him a nursemaid to a pair of eighteen year old miscreants!  She told him to keep them in the city and teach them how to deal with people.  He had thought putting them in the charge of the town guard might discipline them.  He was wrong.  He hadn’t wanted the two anywhere near him at all, but when she said to do something, no sane person would deny her.  He could do no better, though now he wondered whether or not he could fit into the category of the sane any longer.<br>
<br>
An hour earlier, he had been wakened by the screeching sound of the alarms echoing across the city.  Horns were baying all throughout the town.  He had thrown off his covers, dashing out of bed.  He ran to the window of his bedroom, ripped off the nightcap that had fallen across his face at an odd angle, and quickly rubbed the sleep from his eyes to try and clearly identify all the bright flickering lights in the city.<br>
<br>
The city was on fire.  He saw the flames tearing across the city, like an avalanche of flame, tumbling across the town one building at a time.  The roofs of houses and shops all along the walled city were ablaze, flames angrily reaching higher and higher towards the sky.  The cold mist in the air, and the still wet wood and straw did nothing to restrain the punishment that was coming from the other side of the wall.  Hundreds of arrows lit the night sky in a constant stream, their flaming points pouring over the walls from every side of the city.  The river of arrows continuously cascaded over the walls, peppering the roofs of the buildings, even those that were already lighting up the night sky with their burning.<br>
<br>
‘What on Norrath?’  He thought to himself.  “Mistletoe!  Get in here!  Now!”<br>
<br>
Eventually, an obese halfling girl had come to his bedroom door, rubbing sleepy eyes and stretching, trying to talk while restraining a yawn.  “How on Norrath is a halfling to get any sleep around here with all this horn-wailing and boss-screaming-at-me-to-get-up and…what is THAT?”  She pointed out the window.  The mayor looked out another window in the direction she was pointing.  Outside the walls, there was a monstrous oak tree, seemingly floating in the air dancing side to side, up and down, searing the sky with flames.  Squinting their eyes, they could just make out the glowing orange figure wielding the tree, swinging and smashing it back and forth.  The hill giant’s gnarled hand, impervious to the fire, could just barely be seen grasping the broken roots of the tree reaching over the walls to set in flames anything and anyone it could reach.  When everything within reach was immersed in crackling flames, the giant started lighting the wooden palisade that surrounded the city.  Many of the poorer houses and shops sat between the wooden palisade and the stone wall surrounding the city.  Every one of the buildings between the wall and the palisade appeared to be on fire.<br>
<br>
“Wh-wh-what is going on sir?”  The frightened halfling girl hugged her arms around herself and trembled.<br>
<br>
“That is why I called you Mistletoe.  I need you to get a messenger to the city guard and find out what’s happening.  I don’t know why I haven’t already been informed of what is going on!  Somebody’s head will definitely roll for thi…”  A loud banging on his front door cut him off in mid sentence.  “Go see who it is girl!”   She still sat there, unmoving, staring open mouthed out the window at the giant, mercilessly destroying the outer edge of the city.  <br>
<br>
“MISTLETOE!”  She let out a startled squeak, flinching from the window and looked up at the mayor.  “Go…see…who…is…at…the…DOOR!  NOW!”  She had squealed and bolted, running from the room to the front door.  Moments later, an out of breath messenger stumbled into his office with the frightened halfling girl trailing behind him.  His blonde hair and guard’s uniform were singed, his face was black with soot.  He was cut and bruised, and looked about to collapse from exhaustion.<br>
<br>
“Milord!  Orcs!  Everywhere!  Palisade…gone!  At…the…main…walls!”  He tried desperately to speak, though obviously every word was a struggle, his chest heaving, his voice wheezing from the lack of oxygen.<br>
<br>
“Catch your breath boy, and then tell me everything.”  The young man nodded and crouched down, put his hands on his knees and tried to slow down his pumping lungs.  He took two very deep breaths, and continued with his report brokenly between gasps.  <br>
<br>
The messenger reported that the captain had sent him to report of what the mayor could already see, that the city was under heavy attack.  Only that it was orcs completely surrounding the city was new information that the mayor hadn’t already surmised.  <br>
<br>
The messenger shuddered and continued.  “Sir, that is not all.  We have been fighting them off.  We were holding them back, though they severely outnumbered us.  They continued to attack the walls, climbing upon their own comrades in an effort to reach the top.  Not that they needed much help with that giant out there.  Still, we kept them back somehow.  Then…” the messenger shuddered, “a coach came to the back of the orc lines.  It was so black.  Huge it was.  I have no doubt that a person could stand up in it!  There was something just wrong about it.  It seemed to suck the very night into its depths.  Then suddenly a green aura started building around the coach.  The light started pulsing, and all of the orcs started to back away from the walls.  Suddenly, the green light shot away from the coach in an arc, directly at the walls.  It came at the walls like a wave in the ocean, only it was made of lighting.  The wave passed through the orc lines, and we all tried to take cover behind the walls.  The light never hit the walls.  As soon as it hit the orc corpses piled against the wall, the wave stopped, and that green lightning started bouncing around all the dead orcs.  Then the pile started moving.  Every one of those dead orcs came back again and now they are attacking the walls.  They’ve destroyed the outer palisade, and as you can see, the stone walls are being slowly torn apart by that giant.  We tried everything but the catapults on the giant.  But the undead orcs…those are awful milord…an abomination to be sure!  Every one of them that we killed is fighting us yet again, and now they seem to be twice as strong as before.  The burning oil and metal does nothing to them.  They just shrug it off.  We take off a limb, and they keep crawling towards us.  We are all actually afraid to kill the giant.  Anything that can create so many undead with a single spell, we were afraid that the giant would cause more damage than it already is.  Who could have done such a thing Milord?  Who is out there?”<br>
<br>
“Don’t be an idiot boy.  You know who it is.”  The mayor scowled at the messenger.  “It’s Theophilia, and she is here to take vengeance on the death of her two sons. “<br>
<br>
“Her sons?  You mean, the two guardsmen who were killed this evening?  How?  How could she have gotten an army here in that amount of time?  It’s impossible Milord!  There is no way it could be done.”<br>
<br>
Again the mayor shot a dark look at the messenger.  “Impossible, eh?  Well, regardless of whether or not you think it’s a possibility, there is an army besieging and destroying this town, and you are standing here dribbling about whether or not it’s a possibility that they are here.  Get back to your captain and tell him that you have given your message.  Tell him that he needs to place a white flag at the gates.”  The messenger’s eyes widened in surprise.  “Yes boy, there will be no stopping her.  She will kill all of you until she gets to me, or I will go there and accept the consequences.  Maybe I can calm her down.  I was always able to talk to her when we were younger.  She listened to me then.  Maybe she will accept my surrender and spare the city.”  The messenger’s face almost showed a trace of hope in the mayor’s words.  “Do not count on it, boy.  Theophilia is very close to the brink of insanity, if she isn’t already there.  All the dark arts that she has studied.  I can’t even imagine some of the places she has gone to, and the things she has seen.  We are most likely dead, every one of us, but I can only try.”<br>
<br>
The messenger ran off to pass the mayor’s words to the commander of the guard.  An hour later, the mayor, now dressed in his robes of office, sat in his office and continued to watch the orc army decimate the city.  There was a parlay, and the message was given that the mayor had surrendered himself to his sister requesting that she take him and leave the city.  It was not that he was a strong man, or even an especially noble person.  He could just not live with the fact, that somewhere in history, his name would live forever as the man who caused an entire city to be destroyed.  His pride would just not allow it, and surrendering himself to her was the only thing he could do.<br>
<br>
He had received another messenger, advising him that his terms had been accepted, and the coach had rolled towards the walls in an agonizingly slow advance.  The gates were opened, and the coach rolled forward.  As soon as the coach cleared the inside of the gate, the air started rippling around the black coach.  The wicked looking horses stomped and threw their heads back, snorting and growling, more than neighing.   The night went completely silent.   The invading army and defenders both seemed afraid to move as the coach took on a mirage-like shimmering.  <br>
<br>
A loud explosion ripped from the coach and all who looked upon it shut their eyes at the blinding purple light that burst from the coach.  When the light died out, the gate, and a huge section of the wall was completely missing.  No broken stone, no dust, not even a hole in the ground.  The wall just stopped, leaving a gaping wound in the defenses of the city where the gate and the guard towers used to stand.  There was no sign of the defenders that were just manning the wall and the gate.  The tower’s defenders were completely missing along with the towers themselves.<br>
<br>
The black horses lurched forward again, towards the center of town.  A green tide of orcs flowed past the slow moving coach. A roaring echoed throughout the city with the battle cries of the orcs and the attacking army surged forward, intent on pillaging, looting, and destroying anything in their path.  Guard and townperson alike scattered into the inner city to hide or organize for a stand.  All were terrified, and all praying to whatever gods they worshipped that the orcs would overlook them.<br>
 <br>
The small man stared below into the courtyard of the town center.  He watched the coach roll to the front of the building that housed his office.  He nervously ran a hand through his hair again and tried to swallow the growing lump in his throat as the door of the coach creaked open.<br>

Our mail server has been down for two days now.<br>
<br>
I will say that I find it slightly more difficult to write about Scuttle since I have stopped playing EQ, but I have to mention that Scuttle is probably a bit more like me than I care to admit, so I'm still able to get some ideas.<br>
<br>
I apologize for the length of time this is taking to continue the adventures of Scuttle.  I should just do what Koz2 does, and make sure I set aside time to write.  What is taking so long is that I am still trying to figure out exactly what I intend to have happen in this story and how to bring the additional characters I have planned into Scuttle's life.  So, honestly, you are really reading the rough draft.  The story is writing itself as I go along.  I will complete it, put it in final form when the story is finished, and of course, tidy things up a lot.<br>
<br>
I wanted to thank everyone again for all the feedback and enthusiasm.  It was a complete surprise that there was an interest in my writing at all.  I fully expected the story to have 3 views, and be somewhere on one of the last pages of the By the Fireplace forum by now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I would have not continued beyond the second post had I not received such kind words.  I am glad that you are enjoying my meager writing skills.  You are the only reason that I continue with this.  Again, thank you for your feedback.  It is greatly appreciated.<br>

A cursory inspection of Scuttle's home had left him all but sure that the halfling had left the town, but he was without a clue as to where.  The search of that bar wench's room, he ground his teeth remembering the last encounter with his target, hadn't given him any clue where she had been going either, but the man was sure that if he found that woman, he would find Scuttle.  This job was going to be more difficult than the dwarf had originally contracted him for.  It was one thing to take out a target that was inside of a city.  It was a whole other issue to track down a target over an entire continent...maybe multiple continents.  He was obviously going to need more time to kill that lucky little runt, but he was definitely making the dwarf pay him more money for the job as well.  He thought about charging the dwarf even more, purely for the level of frustration that he had to deal with when attempting to assassinate the obnoxiously lucky little halfling.<br>
<br>
He cut through the center of two deep buildings.  Alleys held no fear for the man, not even in such a well populated city such as this.  He spent a decent amount of his youth wandering and scavenging in a city that was far larger than this one.  He doubted that he was going to find anything in the alley that gave him the slightest concern.<br>
<br>
In the middle of the two buildings, he heard a sort of yelling from some distance, many voices.  He wondered.  It was much too far away, and far too many voices to understand if there were even  discernable words coming from, but it sounded like hundreds of voices...almost like the sounds of many battle cries.  Then the horns of the city guard echoed from everywhere around him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the...?&quot;<br>
<br>
He ran through the remainder of the alley and whipped his head in both directions to see what was happening.  Nothing.  This was a minor avenue, and he couldn't see to the city walls from here.  He turned left and quickly bound to the next intersection.  That was a main road, and he was sure he could see what was happening from there.  He glanced up as he ran, and noticed an orange flickering glow reflecting off of the low clouds hanging over the city.  Turning his head to both sides, he saw that the glow came from all directions.  The riotous yelling got louder as well.  Damn these tall buildings he muttered to himself.<br>
<br>
He hit the intersection and looked to the right.  He could see all the way to the end of the road.  There was a minor gate here, and the gate was swarming with city guard and militia that had arrived at the sound of the warning horns.  They were fending off something, many somethings,  but it was too far away for him to tell what it was.  He looked the other direction, and was able to see far across the city, almost to the other side.  Flames reached towards the sky in an angry dance.  It looked like the entire outer palisade was ablaze, and small fires were starting in many of the buildings near the wall.<br>
<br>
Great, the tall man thought to himself.  Of all the places for me to be, I have to pick a city that falls under attack only two weeks after I arrive.  He cursed his lack of fortune.  He wondered if that little halfling was so lucky because he somehow stole the luck from of everything and everyone he came into contact with, leaving a trail of victims with the equivalent of a man crossing the path of a black cat, while simultaneously walking under a ladder and smashing an armload of mirrors.<br>
<br>
Nothing to do about it now.  He shrugged slightly and continued on to his original destination.  The battle didn't concern him, unless it was right in front of him.  He had no particular affinity for this city or its denizens.  He was only concerned with his own welfare, and getting paid to complete this job.  Occasionally, he slowed and listened to the sounds of the battle around him.  Were the sounds getting closer?  He wasn't worried or scared, merely annoyed that he had ended up in the middle of this conflict.  Was that a hill giant's voice reverberating from beyond the dwarf's home?  What on Norrath was going on here?<br>
<br>
He took one more turn, and finally reached the home of his employer.  Considering the fact that the dwarf was, well, a dwarf, the home was gargantuan.  Including the walls, the gardens inside, and the home itself, it sprawled across an entire city block.  The man shook his head in amazement every time he saw the place.  The amount of platinum it must have cost to build the place must have been phenomenal.  The thick marble walls that surrounded the estate towered twenty feet, and appeared to be one solid piece of stone.  Only close inspection by a dwarf craftsman could see where the marble was joined together.  The walls were completely covered in hand carved scenes depicting great battles and adventures, all with a greatly exaggerated image of his employer as the center and hero of all the adventures.  The gates were solid iron, banded with even more iron.  They hung open at the moment, but guards stood on either side of the gates, ready to swing them shut.  The massive house behind the walls was still visible over the marble palisade, and would have put many a lord to shame.  It was a small castle in the exact center of the estate.  Towers rose from every corner, and small mobile ballistas sat on the top of each.  The walls and towers swarmed with the dwarf's personal guard.  The home was truly formidable, and looked absolutely impregnable.<br>
<br>
The man still wondered why, with such a force at his command, why the dwarf would even bother hiring him to assassinate the halfling.  It seemed that it would be so much easier to send a small company of his own little army after that lucky little rodent half man.  However, he was not one to question, and as long as he got paid, he couldn't care less why the dwarf wanted him to kill the halfling instead of one, or many, of the dwarf's own lackeys.<br>
<br>
There were people running in and out of the gates.  It looked like an anthill that had just been kicked apart, only servants, messengers, and people dressed for combat took place of the scurrying ants.  <br>
<br>
He took a step towards the home and paused.  The sounds of the battle were very close now, just beyond the dwarf's home.  The ballistas on the far towers released with a loud crack and the screams of pain echoed on the other side of the wall.  He could not see beyond the small castle, but the voices that carried over the walls were definitely orcish.  Arrows arced over the wall, and the defenders fell in agonizing screams as the orc archers took their toll on the inhabitants of the dwarf's home.  <br>
<br>
A steady pounding rhythm made it's way closer to him.  Even over the sounds of battle, the rumbling rhythm got louder, overpowering the war cries of the orcs and defenders alike.  The ground trembled and shook with the loud, thumping beats.  At the edge of his field of vision, a hill giant's head manifested itself over one of the castle towers.  Archers he could not see were firing volleys of arrows at the massive creature, but seemed to phase the giant less than a swarm of gnats would bother a troll.  The man heard the ballistas fire again with a crack-whoosh sound, that only a giant crossbow could make.  The huge bolts pierced the giant, one in his shoulder, the other just under his collarbone.  Where the arrows were completely ineffective, the spear sized bolts definitely phased the giant, but still failed to stop him.  Surprisingly, it only seemed to enrage him more.  He angrily brandished the smoldering remains of an oak tree as a club.  He whirled the 50 foot trunk over his head, the wind howling in protest at the momentum of the powerful swings.  Easily stepping over the marble walls, the giant slammed the club against the nearest tower.  It shattered like a stack of children's wooden blocks.  Screams of dying soldiers reached the tall man as he watched the carnage.  The giant turned on another tower, and sent many more soldiers tumbling to their death amidst stone and ballista wreckage.<br>
<br>
Well, the man decided, there would be no use trying to get to the dwarf now.  He was fairly certain that the dwarf would have to have a substantial amount of luck, even greater than that little halfling vermin, to get out of his own castle alive.  He turned the direction he had come, and decided he had better find a way out of the city.  There was obviously no reason to stay in the city any longer.  He had no wish to be a hero and help these people fight.  He fought and killed for money, and nothing else would motivate him to take any action.<br>
<br>
A thunderous crumbling sound came from behind him.  He turned just in time to see the dwarf's personal castle being ripped apart by the furious hill giant.  Walls tumbled in on the stone structure, screams of pain and death carried into the still damp night air.  Uninterested, the man turned away to find an escape from the city.<br>
<br>
As he looked for a safe path out of the city, he decided that he would still try to find Scuttle.  He was certain that the dwarf was gone, and he would never collect his second half of the payment, but he was very curious about the halfling.  He was going to find him, and maybe, just maybe, he would let the little rogue die without suffering. <p>Scuttle - Professional Natural Disaster - Now causing destruction only in the mind of Kaibutsu.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukaibutsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaibutsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0> at: 5/17/01 10:34:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhalladhiddenstab.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hallad Hiddenstab</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/01 9:47:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scuttle the Rogue</span><hr size=1> OK, there is no way this is your first attempt at writing something like this.

You all are great!  Here ya' go...<br>
<br>
A throbbing pain in Talia’s head was her first greeting with consciousness.  Orange flickering light beat against her eyelids, lighting them with a dull glow.  She slowly opened her eyes, squinting painfully at the bright light in front of her.  Her vision was covered with a gauzy, translucent substance.  She blinked, trying to clear her vision.  Still in a dazed semi-conscious state, she sleepily raised her hands to her eyes to rub clear her hindered sight.  As her arms moved, she could feel a light, silk-like material falling from her.  She reached her eyes, and felt some soft material lying across her face.  She quickly pulled off the cloth and sat up painfully.  She felt more of the soft movements of material falling away from her arms and torso as she raised herself from the ground.  Excruciating pain lanced through every muscle as she moved.  She looked at the handful of material she had pulled away from her face.  It was a bundle of fine strips of cloth.  Beyond the material clenched in her hand, she noticed she had been completely covered in hundred of these strips of cloth, loosely lying across her entire body from head to toe.<br>
<br>
The flickering light was a tiny smokeless campfire.  She tensed, looking around fearfully, remembering the orc attack, worried that one of them could see the fire.  Obviously she was not a captive.  Those strips of cloth certainly weren’t meant to detain her in any way.  Taking in her environment, she noticed she was in a deep bowl, walled in by earth on all sides, huge trees majestically standing guard over her little campsite.  It was well into the night, and the cold mist from the earlier storm turned into a light fog which drifted in opaque patches all around the edges of the recessed encampment.  Well, she thought, unless they come to the edge of this bowl, the fire should be almost invisible.  She visibly relaxed.<br>
<br>
She brushed off the rest of the strips of cloth and crawled to her feet.  Wincing in agony with every movement.<br>
<br>
“TALIA!  You’re awake!”  The bright, high-pitched voice came from behind her.  She nearly screamed in surprise and turned around.  The stealthy little halfling had entered the camp without her hearing him at all.  Halflings were notoriously silent creatures, especially ones that fancied themselves rogues.  Scuttle happily bounced around her and reached down to pick up one of the pieces of cloth that had covered her.  “Since you seem to get in so much trouble,” he held up the piece of cloth to her, “I figured I had better learn how to heal people with bandages.  I must be better than I thought, because you’re already up and moving.  You were unconscious just a few minutes ago, and now you’re much better.  Wow, I am really good at healing!”<br>
<br>
Talia remembered the bandage blanket that she had been covered in just moments ago.  She laughed in spite of the pain racking through her body.  “Yes Scuttle,” she diplomatically agreed, “I am much better thanks to you.”  She looked down at the little rogue and noticed two large rabbits tied to a leather strap hanging from his shoulder.  “Are those for us?”  She realized that it had been hours since she had eaten, and the hunger merely added another small pain to her aching body.<br>
<br>
“Yep!  I shot them myself.  With this, look!”  <br>
<br>
He dropped the rabbits on the ground, and slipped out of the large pack on his shoulders.  He unclasped the latches, and pulled out a black, hardened leather case.  The case was about the length of Scuttle’s arm and covered in silver symbols, possibly even script of a language Talia didn’t recognize.  He opened the case and fished out a few miscellaneous pieces of wood.  He sat down and began assembling the pieces together, occasionally sticking his tongue out of the side of his mouth while he concentrated on his task.<br>
<br>
Talia took charge of the cooking during Scuttle’s construction project.  In due course, the two rabbits were roasting over the open campfire.  <br>
<br>
While he assembled the weapon, he described the past few hours, explaining what happened to Talia’s after losing consciousness following the fight with the orc shaman.  “Well, after you fell asleep, and that was a most inopportune time to take a nap, if you don’t mind me saying.  All those orcs running around like that.  You really should pay more attention to where you fall asleep Talia.  Anyway, I tried and tried to wake you up, but you wouldn’t budge, so I dragged you all the way here.  Boy are you a heavy sleeper!  Sheesh!  I would think that you would have to be a lighter sleeper since you are a rogue!”<br>
She smirked and glanced up at him.  “Scuttle, I never said I was a rogue.”<br>
<br>
He glanced up from his work, looking at her doubtfully.  “That’s true…I guess.  Anyway, we’re still pretty…OW!…it’s really hard getting the prods in place at the same time.  I always seem to pinch myself.”  He tenderly massaged his injured finger.   “We’re still pretty close to the city, but I don’t think we’re near enough that the orcs will find us here.” <br>
<br>
When he was through, he held up a string-less crossbow for her to inspect.  She took it in her hands turning it over.  It was a small weapon, but it would be huge for a halfling.  It was heavy, felt well balanced, and finely crafted.  However, to her it still looked somewhat like a child’s toy, as there were no places to string the crossbow, there was no channel for launching a bolt, and no catch to hold a projectile in the weapon.  While it did have a trigger assembly, it was flat and level across the top, and the trigger did not appear to be attached to anything.<br>
<br>
She handed the small crossbow back to Scuttle, eyeing him skeptically.  “You got those rabbits with this, eh?”<br>
<br>
“I sure did!  See, watch!”  He brought the crossbow up, pointing it at a head-sized rock sitting on the ground.  He took close aim and brought his finger to the trigger.  As he touched the trigger, a low, pulsing hum came from the crossbow.  The short prods on either side of the stock bent back on their own accord, and a shimmering gold line drew itself from one end of the bow to the other.  Scuttle pulled the trigger on the crossbow and the string snapped forward.  As the bowstring completed its movement, a stark white bolt of electricity the length of Scuttle’s forearm shot out from the end of the bow.  The electrified projectile hit the rock, and arcs of lighting danced back and forth across the surface.  He pulled the trigger again.  As the second bolt shot from the crossbow, Talia followed it with her eyes.  It looked like a short burst of lightning leaving the front of the weapon, surging forward with an angry blast.  The weapon made very little noise when it discharged, but the effect was devastating.  Sparks of white-hot energy still danced along the surface of the rock from Scuttle’s first shot.  As the second bolt struck the stone, it shattered, sending shards in every direction.  Talia and Scuttle both flinched, turning away from the burst of stone.  Small fragments bounced off of their turned backs.<br>
<br>
Scuttle looked towards Talia, his eyes wide with surprise.  “Wow!  I never shot anything twice in a row like that!  That was fun!!  What else can I shoot?”  He turned in a circle, looking for another inanimate target.  He leveled the crossbow at a tree and started to pull the trigger.<br>
<br>
“Uhh, Scuttle.  Do you really think it’s a good idea to set a tree on fire with all those orcs so close?”  She really had no idea where she was in relation to the city, but she was sure that one of these massive trees bursting into flame would draw some unwanted orc attention.<br>
<br>
“Hrmm, I suppose you are right.  Well, I should start on these rabbits!  I think they’re ready to eat, and I’m hungry!  Let me take this bow down first though.”  He sat down next to his pack and started to disassemble the weapon.<br>
<br>
“Scuttle, may I see it before you put it back in its case?”<br>
<br>
“Sure!”  He jumped up enthusiastically and held the crossbow up for her.<br>
<br>
Talia gently took the weapon, inspecting its every detail.  There was a small sense of the weapon pulsing in her hands, almost as if it had a very soft heartbeat.  The stock was carved from a wood she didn’t recognize.  It was black and unfinished, the same symbols that lined the leather case also ran along both sides of the crossbow in mercury-like metal.  The prod was made of the same wood, and also had the silver script.  In the past, Talia held magic weapons.  The two daggers on her belt were magic.   The magic in this bow felt almost alive, almost wrong.   …and that writing.  She knew she had seen that somewhere before.  The surety that it was something familiar nagged at her memory, but she was unable to trigger what it was she thought she should remember.<br>
<br>
“Scuttle, where did you get this?  I don’t remember you ever telling me about anything like that before.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, you know.  I think it was lying around my house somewhere.”  He turned to the rabbits, removing them from the fire.<br>
<br>
“Scuttle, I know about the things ‘lying around your house.’  Where did you get this?”<br>
<br>
He looked up at Talia.  She watched him intensely, waiting for an answer.  “Wow Talia, you look really serious.  Okay, okay…let me think.”  He sat down and concentrated for a moment.  “Oh yeah!  I remember!  There was this interesting guy that came into the inn, you know the one next to the tavern you work at.  I was there practicing sneaking around, and not having a very good time of it.  People kept stepping on me.  It was very annoying!”  He shook his head in exasperation.  “Anyway, there was this guy, he was all huddled in a corner.  He had on this really fascinating robe that looked really similar to the case for the bow.  All the same symbols and things.  He was eating some stew I think, a bowl of something, and he kept hovering over this box.  Well, I thought, I bet there is something really fun in the case, so I walked over to take a look at it.  I’m not sure how it happened, but suddenly his bowl of stew just jumped off the table, and fell all over him.”  <br>
<br>
As Scuttle described the animated soup bowl, Talia noticed that he made an unconscious gesture with his hands.  Oddly enough it looked like the exact motion a person would do were they to tip a bowl off a table.  “Suddenly the bowl ‘jumped off the table,’ eh Scuttle?”  She grinned at him lopsidedly.<br>
<br>
He nodded vigorously.  “Yeah, it was really amazing!  He jumped around squealing, I guess that stew was still pretty hot.  He looked kind of silly too.  He was a huge guy, and he was jumping up and down knocking over his chair almost knocking over the table and, fanning at the soup that spilled in his lap.  He almost knocked that case on the floor while he was flailing around like that, so I picked it up off the table for him, so he wouldn’t hurt it.  When he finally calmed down, he noticed that I had moved the case, and he started screaming and yelling.  I think it had to do with something about him he really appreciating someone taking such good care of his stuff like that.  Though I think he probably had too much to drink, because he suddenly started yelling some nonsense about someone stealing it from him.  He was running around the inn, cursing and swearing, and literally throwing people around the room trying to find his case.  Well, he seemed pretty mad at the time, so I figured I would bring it back to him later when he had a chance to calm down, maybe even when he fell asleep.  I thought it could be a nice surprise for him to find it in his room when he woke up.  I sneaked out of the Inn and set the box in the bottom of my closet at home, just to keep it safe until I took it back to him.  I guess I forgot about it though, because when I was getting my pack to come meet you, I saw it on the floor of my closet.  I figured that tall man might be looking for it, so I grabbed all my things, and ran to the Inn on the way here.  He wasn’t there though, so I just brought it along.  Maybe we will see him while we are wandering around!  I’ll give it to him then.”<br>
<br>
Something suddenly occurred to her.  “Scuttle, exactly how long ago did this all take place?”  <br>
<br>
“Hrmm.  I think it was about two years ago.  As upset as that guy was, I was sure he would still be there looking for it, so I thought I could give it back to him.  I wonder where he went.”  Scuttle became briefly lost in thought as he imagined what adventures the man might have had after he left the Inn.<br>
<br>
Talia smiled.  She knew Scuttle, at the moment, meant every word he said.  However, she also knew, that if by some incredible chance, the little rogue did actually come across this man that owned the crossbow, Scuttle would ‘forget’ that he had it.  Scuttle was not malicious or devious in any way.  Just a typical halfling that seemed to suddenly ‘find’ things in his possession, things that the previous owner somehow ‘lost.’<br>
<br>
