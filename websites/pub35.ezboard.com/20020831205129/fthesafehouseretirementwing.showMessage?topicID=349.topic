I'm just not gonna play much now...</span><hr size=1> (I refuse to use paragraphs) Tonight I made my decision. Tonight I put the wheels in motion. Tonight I took my first step to retirement. I gave away everything I had except no drop stuff, FBSS (for Jais), Diamondine Earring (for guildmate), RS Chestguard (for Lurik), 1382pp (for Durden) and a Bone Razor which isn't mine anyway. Now without all that stuff Mideon sucks ass but is still somewhat capable of fighting because I had so much no drop stuff. I can still log him on and kill some crap or run around and talk to friends until October. I won't be much though. Once school starts EQ will be very low on my list of priorities and I will pretty much just goof off on my cleric. Until October I am still a rogue though and will continue to post here and treat you all to my odd sense of humor. I am writing this post as if I were leaving today because I feel I can cover everything easier that way. I had alot of fun in this game and on this board. My flame war with Kul, being the original hijacker, "haha", iron nuts, pancakes, my much publicized duel with Ehrynn where I got spanked and not in the kinky fun sort of way. I worked my ass off to get what I had in that game. Untwinked from 1-22 when Durden so generously gave me all that stuff. Sadly it only made me special for about 8 lvls. Then it was back to scraping for what I had. I never made lvl 50. I'm lvl 48 right now and it seems that is where I will remain. I didn't have a trak tooth or any Kunark items. I didn't make 51 or fight in Kunark. I guess I sorta wasted my money haha. I liked to think of myself as a pretty nice guy who was capable of being a rogue. I'm sure I did a decent enough job. Nobody ever called me on it if I ever pulled some serious screw up anyway. I've made many, MANY friends in game and have been asked to stay by a dozen people at least by now. A few people offered to pay for my account until I could play again. I declined of course. Nobody can ever play my rogue Mideon. Mideon's not just my lvl 48 rogue, he's a part of me. The lighter and crazier side of my f*cked up mind. That part that annoys my mom. For the 8 months I played this game Mideon Viscera was as much a part of me as my real self Brett Spears. I have 58 days /played on this character now. If you figure that out it sure is alot for 8 months. What can I say? The game is addictive. Not really that much fun but it's addictive. Next time I get an addiction remind me to have fun with it. I quit mostly because of private real life reasons but here are the reasons I quit in game. Being high lvl is poor. It truly sucks. Everybody fighting over who's gonna go to the planes and who gets what loot when you're there. I'm not even gonna start on what happened yesterday. High lvl guilds all have such deep rooted hatred for each other because of the actions of people who don't even play anymore. On Flamevault the retired players somehow manage to influence the game as much as the ones still playing. There were times in EQ where I just got so pissed about idiots that I /Qed right on the spot. Whenever that happened I would come here. My haven. Mideon's gone through alot of changes here. When I first came I was just like every other new guy. Kinda shy, just asking simple questions. Somewhere along the line (not sure where) I became the c*ckiest, most arrogant guy around and while some of you absolutely loved it there were others who hated it. Anyone remember my longwinded challenge to Ehrynn? That pissed off more than a few haha. Then there was that time where I used "lvl 60 RAKE" in my sig. That of course was about 2 weeks after Kunark came out. More angry people naturally. I had to explain myself at least once a day on that one. When the "Outside Norrath" forum came along I was accused of being the reason. Yeah I was ACCUSED haha as if the "Outside Norrath" forum is some cesspool of evil or something. Anyway it came because of Shadowbane. After all that crap I became the Mideon you see now. Off the wall 100%. I like it this way. Back when I was c*cky I used to have to think about what I was gonna say. Not anymore muwhaha Sometimes I wonder how I avoided any sort of warning for what I was doing.  There are alot of people I wanna thank. I'm gonna do all the important people I remember one by one. If I forget you here's your thank you in advance. Thank you. BTW these will only be people who I think may read this.<br>
<br>
Durden: You were the first person to help me. Without your help I may have never made it to lvl 30. It's still unsettling to see that I'm way ahead of you now. At least we got to group that time in Upper Guk at the Ghoulbane camp. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Zappalan: You brought me into the Veiled Alliance. Probably the first person to ever accept me for what I was and not get mad about it. You always took the time to answer my question no matter how retarded it was. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Jais: Hail a country bumkin! My oldest Safehouse friend. You lent me an FBSS. Man that was so exciting back then. I couldn't believe I was actually using an FBSS! I still don't get why you didn't keep it for yourself but aw well. I'm not cmplaining. You get it back soon enough. Thanks man.<br>
<br>
Keyno: You gave me some poison components for stuff that was WAY to hard for me to make haha Of course that's not the only thing you did hehe. When I was in Sol A desperately looking for someone to kill Lynada you brought on your druid and took her out for me. Hell you even made sure I got the exp. Then you ported me to WC, sowed me and told me to run to Freeport while you brought Keyno to pick the lock for me. The next day I got my rapier. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Matteo: You're my bitch. There was a time when you weren't my bitch of course. Once you were gonna give Durden a lap dance for elf hie gloves. You were his bitch then haha I remmeber you were gonna bring your guild to take out Lynada for me back before Keyno did it for me. That was very cool Matt. Now you put up with my @#%$ and never make me feel like I'm bothering you. You also didn't get mad when I gave you sh*tty stuff haha Thanks.<br>
<br>
Tubbins: You gave me a gloomwater harpoon when I was trying to trade for one. I wnated that harpoon more than anything in the world and you got it for me. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Glip: Wtf did you ever do for me? haha I'm sure you did something. Just escapes me at the moment. Anyway you're my little buddy. Thanks heh<br>
<br>
Kul: We had the bigass flame war. That was a ton of fun. All credit goes to you because it was you who started it after I pulled my first hijacking. Thanks haha<br>
<br>
Kezzek: Not only did you tolerate my crap, you sometimes joined in. You also locked my other retirement thread when I asked. Thanks.<br>
<br>
All Moderators Together: You sure did put up with alot from me. I never got banned, never got yelled at, never got warned. You were more than fair with me. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Wixramiablo: You showed me what having fun in EQ was all about. You also taught me to know my role. We have some real funny memories. Every time we got together it was a blast and innocent victims always died. Not sure where you've been the past few days so I E-Mailed you some dirty porn. It's true.......it's true. Without you I still wouldn't know half the stuff I know now. Thanks.<br>
<br>
last but certainly not least.....<br>
<br>
Ehrynn: heh I was never one of your admirers/stalkers though when I think about it I was probably alot more annoying. You helped me alot but you don't know the most important thing you did. Just send me a tell and I'll explain that. Lurik the punk was wrong in his theory Rynn and THAT...is true. <br>
<br>
Since this post took me an hour to write I'm guessing it's VERY long. To end I'd just like to say good bye to everyone on Rodcet and on The Safehouse. I'll be around for a bit but don't be suprised if I vanish all of a sudden when school starts. Saturday night at around 10est I'd like to have a little gathering like we did a while ago except this time the whole Safehouse is invited. If anyone on Rodcet has a problem with that time I'll change. I am your role model, I am your hero and all of you have become raving, lunatic Mideonholics. Time for the Ayatollah to step off his throne and take off his crown. Ciao jerky. <p>Mideon Viscera<br>

Thanks for your contributions to the Safehouse, Mideon.  I think we can all agree: You're one of a kind.  I'm glad to have "met" you on this board.<br>
<br>
I think this moment calls for something...<br>

In honor of your contributions to the Safehouse, Mideon, I give you--<br>

You were your own guy and knew how to have fun - I'd like to thank you, cause if not for you and a few others, I doubt that I would have kept on playing. The jokes that I heard you pulled, I'd occasionally try on Fennin. It kept me occupied and having fun, so you have my thanks.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that you were the c*ckiest guy around, and liked to refer to me as D*icklin, you were still great in your own way. It was almost like cursing people off was a pet name (though I hate to think that you had a pet name for me). Just don't do it too much in real life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

Whatever you do, keep your sense of fun. It's part of what makes you hysterical. And also don't forget to use that maple lip gloss.<br>

I don't think I'll be able to make the whole meeting, but I'll try and get there late.<br>

It's always hard saying goodbye to a friend, no matter what their reasons.  I'd just like you to know Mid, that in respect to your decisions, concerning what we've talked about in game and through e-mail, I am really proud and really respect what you're doing.  That isn't to say I won't miss you though.<br>

Like all those times I spanked you in duels, like the other day on top of that building in Freeport.  Haha (tm), I told ya I couldn't find my kerran toy while I was applying some blind poison and wound up spanking you down to half life before you could even see me.
