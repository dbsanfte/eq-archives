<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Are Monks Any Good in PvP? </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I get asked this a lot, and the short answer is yes, Monks are good in PvP. However, several factors other than the class go into whether monks are &quot;good&quot; at PvP, these being (in order of importance):<br>
<br>
1. Skill<br>
1. Level<br>
2. Resist Gear<br>
2. Normal Gear<br>
3. Primal Weapon (yes, this has its own category. it only applies to the 50+ PvP scene though.)  <br>
3. Movement Speed (pumice, SoW, jboots, etc)<br>
4. Regeneration<br>
5. AA abilities (other than improved run 3) <br>
<br>
If you have these all on your side, then yes you can be a hell of a PK'er as a Monk. Its not an easy class to play, or start untwinked as on a PvP server though. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>  Jousting</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
You don't go toe-to-toe with melee's on a PvP server. Instead you &quot;joust&quot;, which is exactly what it sounds like.  Best strategy to use when jousting, it to strafe to the right or left right before passing your opponent, and quickly hit him with FK/autoattack/disarm. If you're getting beat down, go on the defensive, make your opponent charge you and use the strafing-joust technique. If you're outmatched by your opponent, stay defensive and make them charge you, then evade it and hit them. Try to make your jousting patterns unpredictable, rather than just blindly charging your opponent over and over. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    Fighting specific classes with a Monk</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Warriors &amp; Paladins</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
They have more HP and sometimes more AC than you, and have a lot of high damage weapons available. A fight with them will be largely dependant on your skill in jousting. Most fights with warriors I've had have been pretty close, remember to always use flying kick when jousting and use mend as soon as you get below 70% HP. The longer the fight takes, the better chance you have of winning because mend will eventually give you the advantage. Counter Mighty Strike discipline (if they use it) with Whirlwind. Same tactics apply to fighting a Paladin, but be sure to pumice the Paladin as soon as you can (cancelling their HP buffs can knock off a lot of HP &amp; AC) and make them lay hands as soon as possible so you can retreat if you are losing and effectively waste their Lay Hands. A 58+ Pally with full mana is damn near unkillable because of the DoT Heal they get which cast in about a second and heals a lot. Paladins are very hard to actually kill since they can heal themselves in so many ways. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Shadowknights</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
SK's are a bitch, plain and simple. You're gonna need at least 80 MR, a see invis item, pumice stone(s). If they land a darkness on you, you can pretty much consider the fight over - so wear some MR gear but don't sacrifice too much AC/HP for it. I've never fought a SK who used his pet when fighting me, most seem to favor using a pre-nerf CoS which can be deadly if you don't have a see-invis item on. Fight them like a warrior, but watch out for Harm Touch. Sometimes its best not to use Mend as soon as you get below 70% HP when fighting a SK, wait for them to HT instead.. but not too long to where the HT will outright kill you. If you can't win the fight after they hit you with Harm Touch, retreat and come back to a much easier fight. Don't let the SK get too far away from you, you don't want them getting distance on you and hitting you with DoT's or what not. If you score a victory over an equal or higher level SK, then give yourself a pat on the back cause it won't happen often. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Rogues</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Fight them like a warrior, don't let them get behind your back. Wear a see-invis item, otherwise they're going to pelt you with backstabs and/or poison. Don't joust them straight up, good rogues know how to do a foward-backstab, so try to get on the side of them. Also, take your time when fighting a rogue, don't attempt going toe-to-toe with them. Stay defensive. Once you get careless, they start landing backstabs. Rogues are weak at jousting if you take away their backstab. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Bards</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Annoying as hell. You can't win against them in outdoor areas, enough said. Indoors they are a shitty Ranger and a peice of cake. Anyway, if you have a TStaff and get lucky with procs and innerflame, you MIGHT be able to kill one outdoors. Otherwise, just boost up your MR, FR, and CR (90+ in all three is good) and they can't do jack shit to you (unless they are decked out in North ToV gear or have levels on you). Resists are the key to not losing against a Bard, but there's just no good strategy to actually killing them. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Enchanters &amp; Wizards</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When fighting a Chanter, sacrifice everything for MR. Tashania takes off a lot of MR. No MR? You are dead.  Same thing applies to Wizards, except you need FR and CR too. For both classes, fast weapons will work best for killing them. Pumice stones also do some good to get rid of lev/shielding/etc. Wizards and Chanters have very low HP &amp; AC, stick to them and don't let them get any spells off. Of course a level 60 Wizzie or Chanter can channel through almost anything, but you still stand a better chance of interupting them. Yonder can be annoying, but its not too hard to spot where they land unless you're fighting on hilly terrain. Again, if your MR sucks they will school you. Recently Implemented was the wonderful Wizard-only AA skill Manaburn, this is an instant death for almost anyone. When Verant implemented this skill I'm sure they didn't give PvP servers half a thought because a Manaburning Wizard can kill anybody in one shot now.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Druids</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You need: many a pumice stone, very high MR &amp; FR. Start off the fight by using your pumice stone untill SoW/thorns drop. Winged Death is not nerfed in PvP, and it also stacks with Drifting Death. These DoTs are also basically unresistable and a Druid's primary killing tool, even at 60. If Winged Death lands on you pumice it immediately. The key to killing a Druid is to not let them land their DoTs, stick to them as close as you can. Having good FR helps a lot too, since all of their nukes are fire based and they can debuff your FR. Thorns + heals will enable you to basically kill yourself, so always use pumice untill thorns are gone. A Druid with his SoW/levitate/thorns buried deep below other buffs, who knows how to play his class can be a nightmare for a Monk. Don't let them get out of melee range. If you're equipped with a lot of pumice stones and half decent resists though, its hard to die to a Druid. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Necros &amp; Magicians</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Stick to the caster, don't worry about the pet. You can try instill doubting, but its way too unreliable from my experience. Dispelling the pet (hard to do, but possible) will make life much easier while fighting a Mage as their pets can still put a dent on your HP's even 50+. The epic pet will tear you up. Necro pets are pretty weak even at 60, never go for a necro pet instead of fighting the Necro. Monks can't really factor the pet out of the equation like most classes can via Root or Snare, so you won't have an easy fight against either a Necro or Magician. Almost all the high-end Necro DoTs are dispellable, and its best to dispell them immediately because they pack a hell of a punch. Fortunately they drop fast just like Wizards, just stay close to them and don't fight the pet first. Necros have the AA ability Lifeburn now, this is the Necro equivalent of Manaburn and is just as overpowered in PvP.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Shamans</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Its impossible to get rid of a Shaman's SoW if he has Black Fur Boots (easily obtained instant cast SoW). Most likely, his pet will have SoW too. Shaman pets don't do much damage, you don't really have to worry about them. You need: Pumice stone, lots of MR PR DR CR. Resists are the key here, you need to max them out when fighting a Shaman.  If Ebolt and/or Plague lands on you, its over. They aren't very deadly untill 60 when they get Malo (unresistable 50+ debuff to all resists - dispell it immediately if they use it), but still a huge pain in the ass to kill no matter what level. Fight them like you would a Druid. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Rangers </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You need good MR, pumice stones. Get rid of their buffs, resist ensnare, and don't let them bow-kite you and you'll have one hell of an easy fight. Their nukes can hurt, especially 52+ so high FR does help. 60 Rangers with a good bow, Archery Mastery, and Trueshot *will* kill you in a matter of seconds if you let them. A Ranger with thorns buried deep and a good jousting weapon (Rangers I see more than any other class using 1h weapons even when jousting) are often underestimated and can kill you too despite the common stereotype that Rangers just suck at everything. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Clerics </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You need high MR and pumice. Clerics are not meant to be a PvP class and really can't do any significant damage. They rely on nukes, and melee damage (yes you heard that right). Root won't land unless they have levels or your MR is crappy, and most of the times nukes won't do full damage. Despite this, they are probably the hardest class to kill in PvP next to Bards. Their heals are extremely efficient,  they do have good AC/HP, and Divine Aura. With a very good 2hb, and nukes they can actually get kills sometimes, so don't get careless.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Beastlord </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Almost the same as Magicians, except they can take more of a beating. The pet is on par with Mage pets, so they will do damage to you. Beastlords themselves don't dish out much damage. The problem for Monks here is that the pet and the owner will both be SoW'd, so again you have to manage to pumice the owner's SoW off and take him out. Feign Death the pet off, instill doubt it, or get lucky with misses so you can pumice him. Whatever you do, don't try to take out the pet - it's not gonna happen. Not with the pet heals they get, plus they will wisen up and begin beating on you along with their pet. Not a particulary good PvP class from my experience, especially at the high end game. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Player-Killing on a PvP Server</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Most fights occur when you don't expect them to, so its a good idea to keep at least some resist gear on at all times. <br>
<br>
The main factor in whether you win a fight or not on a PvP server is if you find your opponent, or if he finds you.<br>
<br>
Don't pick fights you can't win, not gonna go into detail here. <br>
<br>
Don't talk shit in OOC / Shout excessively, as it just makes you look dumb. <br>
<br>
Don't be a lamer, if you kill someone let them loot their corpse and leave. If you get killed, loot your corpse and leave for a while. Don't train on people, or attack them while they're fighting a mob. <br>
 <br>
Some people opt for high AC or resists over Regeneration (fungi tunic), but the regeneration will help you more in PvP than any other single factor. It can be a lifesaver in long fights and give you an advantage over the opponent. 3 AA points into both Improved Run Speed and Improved Regeneration will help a lot in PvP. <br>
<br>
When PK'ing, have:<br>
- Jboots or Improved Run 3<br>
- SoW Potions <br>
- A fast weapon<br>
- A high damage weapon<br>
- Pumice Stones (19pp at many vendors, 5 charge nullify magic)<br>
- Resist gear (see below) <br>
- Bandages<br>
- Little money on you <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Tranquil Staff </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Recently aquired one of these, and its no secret why they cost so much on my server now. This weapon alone can give a Monk a much better chance at winning a seemingly unwinnable fight. The unresistable 2-10 second stun proc is godlike in PvP, and also a perfect opportunity to use Innerflame when it goes off. Normally I don't recommend relying on Procs in PvP but this one is an exception. <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   PvP 101 (Long)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
This was posted a while back by a Tallon Zek guild and really is a good introduction to PvP servers as I tend to agree with the author on most points, though he comes off as being just a little bitter. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EQPvP 101 The Basics – Attitude<br>
<br>
For those just starting on a Zek Server<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 1: I came here to kill people<br>
<br>
Repeat after me, “I came here to kill people”<br>
<br>
Welcome to EverQuest with “option” for PvP, but your grave and the coffin of every player on the PvP servers was nailed shut when you logged into these servers. If you are not here to kill or be killed, take your friendly ass to Bluebie Ro or Friendly Marr.<br>
<br>
This is Player vs Player, plan on dying, plan on having to defend yourself, plan on having every goal you have set for yourself in the game outside of PvP delayed. Plan on being stabbed by those you consider friends, plan on getting upset, plan on accomplishing nothing for days on end.<br>
<br>
You did not come here to kill dragons, you did not come here to kill gods, you did not come here to have the phatest lewt in the game, you came here to kill people. The sooner you get it through your bluebie head that you are a killer, and REALIZE that this is what you wanted to be, the faster you will start gaining the mentality that will keep you alive and the less you will see “LOADING PLEASE WAIT….”<br>
<br>
If the dragons fall and the gods are defeated, those are added bonuses, but you did not come to this server to do that, you are a killer or you are a victim, your choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 2: You just got knocked the @#%$ out, what now?<br>
<br>
Aweee, did Mister Meanie Inkie come gank you and take your spawn? Would you like a tissue? Oh you think that if you spam him for the next hour calling him every hostile word in your petty little head that you are going to upset him? Bluebie Please.<br>
<br>
Why did he kill you? Why did he have to come into your dungeon on your only day off this month and gank you just before the spawn with the killer robe you wanted was about to drop?<br>
<br>
Your answer is simple, yet so hard for many to understand, “Because he can”<br>
<br>
He came to this server to kill people, if you still haven’t grasped lesson 1, please review it now. If you are reading this for the third time, and still haven’t grasped lesson 1, please delete your sorry ass and get the hell off of the “Zek” servers.<br>
<br>
Now you are sitting naked at your bind point looking stupid, the newbies are looking at you wondering what just kicked your ass. What are you going to do?<br>
<br>
You are going to run to your corpse, you are going to keep your mouth shut, you are going to loot your corpse, and you are going to leave. Why are you going to do this?<br>
<br>
Because Mister Meanie Inkie kicked your ass, and Mister Meanie Inkie is standing on your corpse that has everything you own on it. Because Mister Meanie Inkie was smart enough to attack you when you were not ready, he has earned the right to stay there at HIS spawn that your ass has forfeited to him by combat at arms. Don’t like this concept?<br>
<br>
Too bad, welcome to Zek. Get your shit, get out, stay out for a while. Show some respect to the player who just ganked you. There is gonna be a time when he is on the ground bleeding to death because of your actions, and he will be humbled back.<br>
<br>
What now? There are more zones and spawns in this game then you can ever see, time to find something else to do.<br>
<br>
Give you a clue, how about going to the enemies home city and learning how to fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 3: You are at the bottom of the food chain<br>
<br>
Welcome to Zek, Mister Worm. You will eat dirt and like it. You should be happy we allow you to have OUR dirt, the only reason you do is because we have stopped caring about it, and players like you.<br>
<br>
You do not own this server, you do not have the right to hunt anywhere without our permission.<br>
<br>
You may ask, who is “Our”? “Our” is the first generation players of the Zek servers who run this place. Think of this as a jail cell, and we run the block. Get out of order and get a beating. Want to play hardball with us, then you best get strong, get some heavy levels, get a lot of friends, and get owned anyway. Such is life on the Zeks.<br>
<br>
You earn the right to eat better then dirt or the right to breathe by doing one of two things.<br>
<br>
First, is you ask our permission, and if we are in a humorous mood, we may allow you.<br>
<br>
Second is to do it with attitude and balls, and when we ask you why you are on our turf, your response should be “Do something about it”, for more about “Do something about it” see lesson 6.<br>
<br>
Again, You EARN the right to breathe, and eat something else besides dirt. You EARN this right by being tougher then the people who are telling you that you don’t have this right. You EARN your respect, and your reputation. You EARN the right to stop being a worm, and start being a rat.<br>
<br>
If you want to be a rat without earning the right to be one, you will be ganked over and over again. If you forgot what to do when we gank you, please review lesson 2 a second time.<br>
<br>
When you actually move up from Worm to Rat, you own the worms. Just be careful, because some worms have cats as friends who like to eat Rats who get too big for their ability to produce death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 4: Just kill him<br>
<br>
Ok, some munchie elfie just ganked your gnoll scout that you thought you owned, that gnoll also had a rusty two handed sword that you really could of used. If you seriously thought that was your gnoll, please go back and review lesson 3. That was not your gnoll, that was OUR gnoll, how quickly you forget.<br>
<br>
So now you are upset, because this elfie interrupted your ability to level. First, I thought I told you that you were not allowed to breathe without asking for permission, but I guess you have started to get some balls and do it anyway, good! You are learning.<br>
<br>
So now this elfie just laughed at you and your inability to finish what you have started. Feel the blood flowing yet? Getting mad? Feel yourself hitting the keys while you are typing just a bit harder then before? Oh you are starting to feel the pull to this server.<br>
<br>
You are the little kid on the playground and some bully just took your ball. Now the elfie walks over to 2 other elfies who are also higher level then you, and nightmares of your childhood come to mind. The elfie gives that sword to his friend, and he shows it off to you, taunting you to do something about it.<br>
<br>
Four choices you have in front of you, and this is your moment of truth.<br>
<br>
First, you realize you are going to get your ass kicked, you turn around and look for another one of our gnolls to kill. If this was your decision, start the lesson over, because that same elf just did the same thing to you.<br>
<br>
Second, you get stupid and call the “Police” to come intervene. Lets say for kicks and giggles that a cop (Guide or GM) shows up, they are going to sit down and explain to you that this is a pvp server, and they can do that. This makes matters worse and now the elves are laughing hysterically at you.<br>
<br>
Third, you shout to the zone for help, and all of a sudden the entire zone is laughing at you. Please delete your character and go lie down next to your dog in the corner. When the dog goes to eat out of his bowl, kick him really hard and remind him that its your food. After doing this for an hour, start a new character and come back into the game. Also, go back to lesson one and start over EQPvP 101, you just failed.<br>
<br>
Fourth and correct answer, just kill him. Walk up to him and his friends, and kick all 3 of their asses. You do not talk smack, you do not try to come up with some witty line out of a Rambo movie, you simply walk up and attack the elf that took your kill. You do not stop until he is dead or you are dead. You do not beat him down to almost no life then taunt him, you kill him. If he runs to all the way from Blackburrow to Akanon, you follow his ass to Akanon and finish it.<br>
<br>
You do not run, you do not flee, you do not ask for help, you do not ask him what his mother was doing with the ogre last night, you just kill him or die trying.<br>
<br>
If you do actually kill him, the next person that goes down is the one with the rusty 2 handed sword. Why? Because he was the one who received it. You keep attacking him until he is dead or you are dead. Rules are a bit different now. If this one flees, chase him off the play ground, then go after the third.<br>
<br>
Why the third? Because he was there. Beat his ass into the ground and kill him too. If he flees the playground, the playground is yours and you made your point.<br>
<br>
Now that is best case scenario, now lets deal with worst case scenario. You attack them, and they OWN you. You get rooted, you get nuke bombed, and they embarrass you. At this point, please return to lesson two and follow instructions on what to do to get your corpse back.<br>
<br>
At minimal, you showed them that you are not one to be fucked with, and next time they will chose to pick on someone who they can bully and not have to spend the time in battle with.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 5: School of Hard Knocks and RESPECT<br>
<br>
Oh, you are one of those players who like to tell everyone that you can hunt where you want to hunt because you pay your 10 bucks a month to be here?<br>
<br>
Heh, great, we love players like you.<br>
<br>
See, we pay our 10 bucks a month to do what we want to do, shove cold hard reality in your face and make you scream in agony.<br>
<br>
Oh please tell us you are the type who like to tell us they are going to call the “Police” too, we love that.<br>
<br>
I can play angel with the best of them, and when they show, my halo will be polished to a clean shine, and will GLOW for them. You will be so upset that you are using harsh language and screaming at the “police” person to do what you think his job is because you pay his salary. You own everything, and the Guide leaves laughing at you, because you forgot where you were.<br>
<br>
See we know that the “Police” are king, and we treat them with respect at all times. You are a piece of shit who thinks they own everything, we win.<br>
<br>
Oh, now that the “police” are not going to help you still think you got a chance? Oh you someone big in real life and are now gonna sue me?<br>
<br>
Oh, you are my BEST friend, and we are gonna be best friends for a long time.<br>
<br>
I am going to follow you everywhere you go, I am going to kick your helm in, I am bloody my sword on you or burn you to a crisp. I hope you walk into water so I can root you and watch you drown. I get a kick of casting blindness on you and watching you run off a cliff. I am going to kill you so much that your hard drive is going to crash from so many LOADING PLEASE WAIT sessions.<br>
<br>
See on this server, you have one right, you have the right to get your body. I am going to ask you to get your body and leave MY zone. You say no and refuse to leave, I have the certified stamp of approval to put steel to bone on you a second time. If you leave the zone, and I catch you in another zone, you are free game.<br>
<br>
Here is what you forgot. You don’t run this server, its OUR server. Forgot who OUR is, review lesson one.<br>
<br>
Second, you forgot keep your mouth shut when you get your ass handed to you, as learned in lesson 2.<br>
<br>
Third, you forgot that you are a worm, and picked a fight with someone higher up on the food chain then you, please review lesson 3.<br>
<br>
Fourth, you didn’t kick your dog hard enough, review lesson 4.<br>
<br>
Fifth, you are here to learn the hard way, some people need that though, I guess that is you.<br>
<br>
Lets start with respect. First you need to learn the order of respect.<br>
<br>
Highest respect is to the “Police”, because you piss them off enough you will no longer have an account, and you end up buying a second account and starting on the bottom of the food chain again. They are the ultimate authority regardless if you are a dragon who can kill any other 10 players at one time. If one shows up, its “Yes m’lord” or “Yes m’lady” and whatever they state is law, is law. Hear what they have got to say, don’t argue, and leave.<br>
<br>
Second, is to you. Easiest way to respect yourself is to learn who you are and where you are allowed and not allowed to be.<br>
<br>
Third, is to the powers of the server. Learn who runs which area, and either make friends with them, or don’t cross them.<br>
<br>
Third is anyone who can take you out. Either they are stronger characters or play the game better, either way they can make your life hell if you piss them off enough.<br>
<br>
Fourth and final, is everyone below you on the food chain. Respect them because even the smallest worms can grow up to be the largest dragons. They will REMEMBER you if you made their life hell for reasons not out of respect, and repay it a hundred times over. Don’t mistake respect with being soft, treat them rough, but be respectful.<br>
<br>
No respect is given to those that show dishonor and lack of respect. Gank these morons mercilessly and earn more respect from those who have honor and show respect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 6: Do something about it<br>
<br>
Don’t take shit from anyone on a zek server, play it tough, but play it right. Someone says shit to you, hit them so hard that they see stars. If they do anything but stand there and bleed hit them again. If they open their mouth again hit them again. If they attack back, even a single punch, finish the fight and put them on the ground. If they didn’t attack you and backed off, cool down and leave them, you proved your point.<br>
<br>
Don’t talk smack, let your actions tell the story. Anyone can come on the server and talk big smack, it’s the walk and actions that will make your reputation.<br>
<br>
Doing something about it doesn’t mean bind point rushing and corpse camping someone. This will be covered more in EQPvP 102, dealing with Honor and Reputation. Doing something about it is about attitude.<br>
<br>
As long as you maintain honor, do what you want to do. If anyone has a problem with it, tell them they can do something about it. Someone doesn’t do something you like, do something about it. The worst thing you can do is to never do anything. Sitting there with your thumb up your ass is the best way to get ganked and earn the reputation of “a lamer”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 7: Everyone takes a beating now and then<br>
<br>
So you were walking around talking big smack and a group of 4 trolls introduced you what pointy horns are really used for. You were picking on some inkie who you thought was a cleric, and it turned out he was a SK who Harmtouched you so hard that when you woke up, you had 3 different patches to update. So you were laughing at a ranger 8 levels below you when he stepped up and put you on the ground. Ok scratch the last one, it is too far fetched, but you get the idea.<br>
<br>
Realizing that you are mortal and can be killed is one of the most important aspects of PvP combat. You are not a god, you can be killed. You will not win every fight you engage.<br>
<br>
The biggest thing to taking a beating is to LEARN from what happened. Why did you die? What mistakes did you make? How could you of won that fight? Where was your partner when you were getting turned into a Popsicle by the troll with the staff?<br>
<br>
Don’t think that everything in this game is luck, there is a lot of skills involved in PvP combat. Learning to make the same mistake ONCE and not again, will keep you on the up and up and killing more.<br>
<br>
Speaking of learning, your dog by now should know not to go to his food bowl while you are lying on the ground trying to figure out the name of your next character. If he can learn, so can you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lesson 8: Watch your back<br>
<br>
Final lesson of EQPvP 101, is to always watch your back. If you are in a dungeon, your back is against the wall, and you are watching your screen in all directions to make sure no one is coming up on you.<br>
<br>
If you are in an outdoor zone, you are on a zone wall, if you have to be in the middle of the zone, you are in third person view watching all directions.<br>
<br>
Smart pvp’ers are constantly updating the /who list to know WHO is in the zone. Those who have been around for a long time know most of the enemies by name, approx level, definite class, and definite race. Also the reputation of the player as a good pk or a bad pk, honor level, and the guild they represent.<br>
<br>
This knowledge takes time, but its something to get used to as soon as you enter the zone.<br>
<br>
-compliments of Aggressors, Tallon Zek.  <br>

Let me just add/enphasize a few things:<br>
<br>
*  Jousting relies on a good internet connection and a very hard hitting weapon.  Add a fungi tunic and you'll destroy most melees who can't compete with regen+mend.<br>
<br>
*  Pumice is your best friend against all casters and hybrids.  It makes an excellent opening shot when you get the jump on someone.<br>
<br>
*  A see invis item is required or you will get owned.<br>
<br>
*  Jboots, not that crap from Sol A, are pretty much required for monks.  SOW potions are a bit faster so you might want both.<br>
<br>
*  RESISTS!  Especially MR.  AC is nice against warriors, monks, and rogues.  Resists are far more important against everyone else.  PR is also important vs rogues!<br>
<br>
*  You can buy potions that cure poison spells like EBolt.  Very handy since these spells damn near kill you straight up.<br>
<br>
Key Point:  There is no best or worse PvP class.  The better player who is well prepared can almost always win or certainly not loose.  That said, the very nasty encounters for monks seem to be well prepared:<br>
<br>
Necros<br>
Mages<br>

<br>
first of all, yeah, monks can defanatly kill somebody when your lvl 8.. in fact, its much easier because you have duel wield and they dont <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you get close to any caster, theres a 90% chance they will die before they will get a spell off, unless they are smart and dont get close to you<br>
<br>
if you go against a bard, dont even try unless you can root/snare the fast bastard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Thats just the basic common sense pvp for a low lvl monk, i guess you will have to just go pvp some yourself to find out how easy it is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Shadowstep splurt and ignite/pyro = dead monk.  dont need snare, dont need fear dont need pet sometimes either.  Pumice the necro and you MAY have a small chance at getting a few good hits in.  prepare to go through a LOT of pumice stones if you wanna win though.  Splurt is only 200 mana.  plague/ebolt is pretty ez to resist, so I wouldnt worry about it.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if the necro is over 54, just zone it... shadowstep and Deflux will get you killed faster than you can do 500 dmg to him (deflux = 2.5 sec casting time 338 dmg lifetap- 250 dmg in duels or so).<br>
<br>
Killed a few lvl 60 monks with my necro at 51, got killed by a few lvl 50s necros with my monk, it's just no contest, these guys own pretty much anything but paladins, and even those, at 60 if the necro is willing to spend essence emeralds (ToT fights, necros owned with those), then they pretty much dominate...<br>
<br>
Necro pet is such a pansy, and often the lvl 49 pet dies in an ashen hand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Mages IMO are some of the hardest... get 200 FR or you wont stand a chance... if you got a snare web for the pet and 200 fr you'll stand a decent chance.  dont fight gnome mages in crowded areas =\<br>
<br>
wizards, pretty much same as necros... though you can run them oom if you got good resists/hps gear.  they will try to nuke with fire/cold/mr non lure, if you resist those, they're already a tad low so they'll start lures... cant resist those, but they're a major mana drain and usually long enough casting times.  shurikens are your friend, pumice, and resists in those 3... mr the least imo, mr nukes are easy to resist.. cold are nasty to resist, fire- monks are pretty good here with 45 fr at 60 naked. <br>
<br>
note on warriors:  willsappers are resistable with 82 mr as of last nite.  warrior didnt do a good job at *resisting* tstaff proc/innerflame yesterday, = game over.  (this was a duel yesterday 60 monk vs 60 warrior w/ willsapper/crescent blade of luclin and full ss armor).  I was down 1 bub without mend used when the warrior was at 2 bubs of hps left.  he backed off and agreed it was game over <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Rogues you're good as long as they dont land some nasty poison on ya... Poisoned mantle/fingerbone hoop monks, I feel yer pain... get a lil PR gear and most poisons are easy to resist.  again, tstaff proc vs rogue = rogue feigns to clear monk agro.<br>
<br>
bards, its pretty much luck and cheapness... if you can land a snare web on him, burrowing scarab, and a few tstaff procs, you're golden, if not, give up while you're still alive =)<br>
<br>
monks:<br>
tstaff vs tstaff. if he procs first and innerflames, he's dead, /disc stonestance, dance around a bit after he's done hitting you for 30s, wait for disc/proc and own him.  If you proc first, innerflame him and he doesnt stonestance, you're golden... if he does stonestance, play defensive, use mend as it comes up, fungi all the way, etc.   tstaff vs everything else:  no contest pretty much, tstaff owns duels.  <br>
<br>
paladins:  fungi + tstaff... coldain ring, and hope for the best... at lvl 60 they can heal a lot... and I mean a LOT.  very long fight, usually 3 mends used at least.<br>
<br>
SKs can be hella nasty, they are the gods of pvp, period.<br>
<br>
Druids are easy to kill IMO... fastest kill ever lasted me 11 seconds, that included pumicing the druid, innerflamning him and reading the win msg <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    they have low ac, they usually think they can tank through your staff, and they'll try to run when they see hits for 250+, only you'll have pumiced their sow/wolf form, right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

they keep running around and i just never hit them, I DO have very fast weapons, but when they keep running around like weird there is nothing u can do. Usually they won't even try to cast on u until u are rootet by pet. If u aren't rooted (or even worse they use Water pet) they let the pet do all the work. If u root pet, they keep circling the pet. <br>
<br>
Only chance would be to root him... and don't ever expect root to stick... u will be interupted anyway....<br>
<br>
So how the heck do u hit them except for that occasional lucky hit ? (they got regen too, Pumicle has a casting time....)<br>
<br>
Any suggestions ?<br>

I have found where the monk shines in pvp is when you have someone in your group to hold them still so you can lay waste to their face.  In my experience, it's damn near impossible to kill casters as a solo monk because they will just ss or gate.  However with mages there is something we can use against them, when they run and hide, fd the pet and just follow it back to the the medding mage(or necro, enchanter, shaman as the case may be)<br>

<br>
- don't go for fast weapons/fists, use slow, hard-hitting 2 handers instead - puts their DS totally to shame, heh.<br>
<br>
- In a PvP situation, with the current game engine, people from outside the US will be owned, easily, since their ping rate is normally 200+ (Mine is). 200 milliseconds is enough to screw up your visual update. You think you're next to your opponent, when in fact, you're not - so here, the only thing that works is to train, train, train, and train on getting used to where your hits land when strafing towards your victim, because what you see on-screen in a fast-paced duel, is NOT being updated (thx, verant, for screwing that up)<br>

<br>
- Dont bother fighting a paly they can heal all day long if they know how to duel.<br>
<br>
- Dont bother fighting a bard in big areas. Ive fought bards for over an hour. In close combat we kick there buts but then they run off and heal. When they do that we get mend. Rinse repeat. Usually ends up being a draw.<br>
<br>
- When fighting necro or mage ignore the pet and keep on the caster if your around the same lvl as your enemy there pet will most likely be to low to do any serious dmg and if they start shadowsteping far away just FD off the pet. 90% of the time the pet will just stand there after you get back up.<br>
<br>
- 2h kicks but in pvp. But if you realy need to interupt somone use 1h. Ive never seen somone get a cast off while im using 1hb. Clerics love it.<br>
<br>
- Use distance to your advantage with casters. If you see them casting and your a good distance away move back usualy they get that nice &quot;Your Target is out of range message&quot; before they can nuke you.<br>
<br>
- fungi tunic<br>
- Did i mention fungi tunic? =)<br>

As soon as the Tstaff procs, right-click bio orb and bang, unless he's got good resists, your opponent is blinded and helpless.  Repeat process and the result is a quick fight.  I've noticed that alot of people don't expect a monk to blind them so they panic, which tilts the fight over your way some more.  Even better if you have those spider nets with 2 charges of root for melees =)  Root and blind is nasty  #8-O <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/umilassissugarfists.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milassis Sugarfists</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/23/01 11:53:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=535.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> More stuff</span><hr size=1> I've found that generally the buffs that you have can greatly effect the outcome of a PVP combat.

A lvl 60 sk with a primal is whacking you for 300, a necro is levitating off a cliff and you just burned an entire pumice with on effect,  a gang of people that all have 5 lvls on you want you dead.  In some cases you just have to run.  You might just be trying to  get away, separate one of the people from the rest of the group, or change the setting of the fight where that caster doesnt have the levi advantage. <br>
<br>
How to run:<br>
Strafing is a must, you travel slightly faster.<br>
<br>
Run on hills, use the hillbug.  The pvp system is broken. If you want to live you will have to exploit the bugs like everyone else.  <br>
<br>
Find a zone. zoning is a good getaway tatic IF you zone fast. If you don't then you could end up zoning back and forth for a while.  If I have to zone more than 3 times from a faster zoner, I usually give up and make a break for it.  Also, zoning at very low health will strip all buffs(including dots), and give you a few hp back.  Some people consider this lame, but they are usually the necros that have been hill bugging and levitating over water for 50 lvls.<br>
<br>
Fd can work on pets.  Kinda.  It might give you a half of a second lead on them, but thats long enough to find a zone.  dont stop to look behind yourself.<br>
<br>
Water: casters cant land a spell on a person in water if they are not.  Its called the water bug, its supposed to be that way so casters cant nuke things that cant leave the water.  The necro that was levitating over that cliff will call you lame.<br>
<br>
Some people might call you a chicken for running, but when your outclassed, out gunned, and on the ropes, you have two choices, run or die.<br>

Magic resist gear is THE most important of all resists at first...  Once you get it to about 100, you can start getting the others up..<br>
<br>
<br>
Why magic first?  Simple, you do NOT want to be rooted or snared.  A rooted/snared monk is a DEAD monk.  Also, you should try to have sow/jboot on before you go PK.<br>
<br>
Against a caster:  Yes, they will try to kite you..  The trick i use is either pumice them and take off their sow, or follow them till they start to cast, then go all out on them.  They will probably keep concentration but you still do dmg to them, and casters dont have much hp.<br>
<br>
Against a melee:  Well, as an iksar monk, i have more ac than a warrior my level and more atk.  So pretty much, try to melee head on, and you will most likely win.  If the other guy tries to joust, well, dispel his sow with pumice if he has it, and if you have sow/jboot on, its a lot easier to joust when you move faster.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is pre-50 fighting btw, not high enough for post 50, but pretty much most of the same things stick.  Except for if you are fighting a caster, wait to use offensive disc till they start to gate, cause gate is the spell the will mostlike not try to move away from you when casting. <p>I play everquest!  yay!<Br>I play Tilnam and Nilerek on the Quellious server.<Br>Kazdun on Sullon Zek server also.</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=535.topic&start=21&stop=34>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=535.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=535.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=535.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=535.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.threadControl?topicID=535.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=535.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=535.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2>Guides and Tactics</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
