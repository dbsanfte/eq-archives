When I was in my mid 20's I was out in Emain (before battlegrounds, before realm abilities, etc.) because I needed to do something other than level.  I started following a 40+ Shammy and a 40+ Zerker thinking I would be a little safer when Meddah (50 Minstrel) mez/stunned all 3 of us.  Meddah took out the Shammy in a hurry, then started on the Zerker.  The Zerker took out about 3/4 of Meddah's health before he bit it, so then it was my turn.  I evaded the first 7 attacks, while connecting with a garotte and 2 hamstrings and for a second, I thought I might actually survive.  I was wrong, but I spent the next 15 mins just laughing with the image of someone sitting at their screen in shock about not being able to hit a grey con.  It is one of the most memorable/entertaining fights I had even if I had no business being in it, and I have never evaded like that since. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unage42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nage42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/02 4:10:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3777.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Hehehe, well I imagine there's a dime-a-dozen BG stories out there, but I do recall a fairly good one that certainly made my day.<br><br>I was a pure CritBlade in BG3 at lvl 35 with the important parts being CS:35 (+<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , Sword:29 (+6)<br><br>I was using a 99% qual Asterite Dwarven Great Sword, 99% Eldritch Svar chest &amp; legs, rest Braided Darksteel, etc... generally pretty &quot;twink&quot;<br><br>I had been terrorizing the poor Albs all night one-shotting their casters/archers/infs in their midst (back when we could), and they were chasing only me all night (7 of them, one of me).  Mind, this was back before backup styles, so off-evade stuff took skill/luck to use, i.e., a slow wep had an advantage that way, also no RAs, so pretty even playing field.<br><br>Anyway, got a little too close to the main group and the minst landed a mez on me.  Now, their Pally musta stopped them from attacking me (cause he said something and the others didn't attack) -- I can just imagine it was: &quot;This evil doer is MINE, don't touch her!&quot;<br><br>Anyway, they all backed off.<br><br>So, Pally (sword+board) takes first swing and hits pretty hard, but away I go with my Assult -&gt; Ice Storm chain (wasn't gonna use Garrot cause of def. penalty).

Anyway, his team then jumped on me, but my eyes had misted over with tears while I laughted myself off the chair imagining him with his jaw bouncing off his keyboard.  Granted, he prolly had @#%$ 89% qual stuff (vs. my 99% qual which makes HUGE difference), but it was just so funny to watch his team run around in panic (he was their rezzer).
