Juniors at a top-20 business school and they're too @#%$ lazy to bother making sure that they know all the information on the old exams that I had provided for them, and from which every one of my problems came (numbers changed, of course).  Maybe that's my problem.  Maybe I shouldn't change the @#%$ numbers so it would be more 'fair' for these poor hardworking students whose heads are so far up their asses that 3 years into their schooling they seem to have no @#%$ clue how important knowing this stuff is going to be to their futures.<br>

I know, I know, state university, so we're going to get all the cast asides who 'deserve' a college education because they have arms and legs and can propell themselves into classrooms.  But Holy @#%$, how do people get this far in the first place without flunking out?  <br>

<br>
Good @#%$ @#%$!  How did you manage to get a 44 on the same @#%$ exam that someoen else got a 98 on?<br>
<br>
If you're brilliant and lazy, go for it.  If you're dumb but willing to work, I'm here for you.  But if you're so dumb that you don't @#%$ know how dumb you are, get the @#%$ out of my classroom.<br>

There are a plethora of jobs out there that do not need a College education. Technical training, perhaps, job skills, a work ethic, etc.<br>

However, I really think that there are a lot of people that would be much better off not going to a 4 year college, and instead could benefit greatly from a local community college, or on the job training. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upulid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pulid</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/communtychest.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 3:36:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4543.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't go to college if you're stupid and lazy</span><hr size=1> meddik society today says basically everyone has to go to college.

There was such an incredible pressure put on EVERYONE I am friends with - even the retards - to go on to University. Most of them did it. I did. A couple of guys I know are miserable because they can't handle the work. (Or don't handle the work.) They would have been better off with maybe community college, or going straight into work. Hell, my best friend's pretty bright but he went straight from high school's final year into a decent accountancy job and he's doing OK for himself. College is a great path for quite a lot of people but LOTS of parents, teachers and other people with influence are doing many young people a great disservice by touting it as *THE* way to go. <p><HR><b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">If I was a stupid web gimmick, I'd be...</font></b><br>

If you don't go to college you're obviously some stupid loser who should never be given a real job. Community college is like a big no no. Only retards who can't learn like 'normal' people would go to one of those! So everyone goes to a normal college and a lot of people drop out. Not before they manage to slow the entire class to a crawl though. The hillarious thing is that the community colleges that are such bad places to go to are the ones teaching useful courses like basic marketing, writing job applications, home accounting, or making presentations. The colleges have no time for silly stuff like that. No siree, not while there's poems to find white male patriarchal oppressing symbolism in!<br>
<br>
Oh and if you go to certain colleges it has to be because you couldn't get into the really good ones. Gah, how I loathe the utter snobbery regarding college here. lol, when it came to picking a college I didn't even consider MR (the hah 'best' college in the city) because you get to choose very few of your courses there. My HS grades could have gotten me in there no problem. But the place is way past it's glory days in course selection, teachers, service of any kind and in facilities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulilum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 4:53:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4543.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't go to college if you're stupid and lazy</span><hr size=1> Pulid of those 98% that go to college how many of them actually graduate?  The high school I attended has 90%+ college attendance, but only something like 30% of those actually graduate.  <br>
<br>
High schools do a piss poor job of preparing students for college.  This is going to be very non-politically correct of me to say, but I'm going to anyway.  In a lot of ways we spend education money in the wrong places.  In most, not all high schools there are special education classes, but in these same schools there are very few programs for the gifted students.  (My experience with the education system is limited to rural areas, so this may not be the case everywhere)  Kids whose biggest contribution to life will be to be a janitor have money thrown at them.  While kids who have a possibility af actually achieving something are largely forgotten, or left to their own devices.  I was a victim of one of these so called &quot;gifted&quot; programs.  Basically all it was, was a place to warehouse me two hours of the day so I wouldn't disrupt the rest of the class because I was bored out of my skull in &quot;regular&quot; classes.  <br>
<br>
To be honest though I do understand that I have noone to blame for my lack of ambition but myself.  It would have been nice though, to have been taught how to use the tools I was given in life.<br>

Our school system is (supposedly) one of the best school systems in the state.  And all anyone cares about is preparation for the next level.  We do everything to strive for college.  I've been harangued by my parents for getting a B+ in a 10th grade math class (I'm in 8th grade)  because they &quot;know I'm capable of an A&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm not interested in sports very much, but my parents pressure me to join one simply because it looks good on the college transcript.  I haven't even thought about what college I want to go to yet, but already I seem to be doing everything in life to prepare for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrimjawbadflagon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimjaw Badflagon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 5:29:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4543.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't go to college if you're stupid and lazy</span><hr size=1> Community colleges are smart to go to.

The G&T programs at my high school (and Jr high) were cut so that the sports teams (and band in high school) could get new uniforms. In the three years I was at that highschool, the football team was 0-29-1 and the other sports teams sucked just as bad.<br>

Americans tend to fear and revile intellectuals, which is really too bad. It leads to utter morons like the one in Llabak's class thinking they can succeed in an academic world. <p><a href="http://pub51.ezboaard.com/bstormmountain"><IMG border=0  SRC="http://publish.hometown.aol.com/wonko53/myhomepage/sig4now.gif" alt="Storm Mountain Boards"></a><p align="left"><FONT FACE="Times new roman" size="-2"><i>"Lauriston isn't just a name, it's<br> a whole new level of flava."</i></font><br><font face="times new roman" size="+1">Lauriston Pianoforte<br>Bard of Quellious</font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugypsysongman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gypsy Songman</A> at: 2/12/02 7:28:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.aodoctors.org/Cross.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 8:32:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4543.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't go to college if you're stupid and lazy</span><hr size=1> [quote]Americans tend to fear and revile intellectuals, which is really too bad.[/quote]<br>
<br>
No, Americans Revile Intellectuals who flaunt their "Superiority". This probably goes more for "Red America" than "Blue America"... (I would argue that the same distaste applies to those who ostentatiously display their wealth too, but thats a different topic.)<br>
<br>
And Pulid, you are right about Society's expectations. However, I think those expectations are wrong. Unfortunately, everyone is so hyped up on self esteem, they feel the need to convinve themself that they and their child are above average. Unfortunately, the truth is that 50% of the people are below average. Thats just the way it works.<br>

<br>
The Typical usage of the term "Below Average" means that they fall below the 50th percentile, that is to say below the Statistical Median.<br>
<br>
Of course, the Proper usage of "Average" in statistics means the Mean Value, but common usage is quite different than that when referring to achievement.<br>
<br>
In any case, the Mean and Median are <i>Usually</i> incredibly close to one another for developmental type things like IQ, grades, etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaxlelandarogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Axlelan DaRogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 10:13:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseranthallgripeswishes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4543.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't go to college if you're stupid and lazy</span><hr size=1> I go to Virginia Tech...I.....just.....cant take....the morons....ANYMORE!!!
