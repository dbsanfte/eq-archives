<br>
some advice on hunting in the deep:<br>
<br>
1, respawn is extremely fast.  you HAVE to do a dungeon crawl, meaning you have to continally move foward after each fight, or the spawns will pop behind you.<br>
<br>
2, wear some MR because the shrooms cast stun and slow and a mushroom shape changing spell.  the thought leech evokers cast a mean nuke of over 1k.<br>
<br>
3, most of the mobs are social, meaning that when you pull one, their friends come along too.  and because of the way you have to dungeon crawl, there's really no room for a monk to split pull, so bring a chanter.<br>
<br>
4, we were there for about 3 hours and got no drops besides fungus spores and some throwing dagger type things.<br>
<br>
5, there was only 2 other named MOBs on track the whole night.  1 one was the "Chasm Overseer".  we got really close to him, but we had o evac out right before e had a chance to see him because of bad pet pathing causing a big train.  he other is "a deranged underbulk"?  something like that.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways, thought i'd share hat. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubraidfreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>braidfreak</A> at: 12/8/01 10:01:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umanyfactors.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Many Factors</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/8/01 12:13:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: THE DEEP</span><hr size=1> Went real deep into the deep, it gets really hard.

Spent a few hours the other night trying to get to him and once we did, found out he couldn't be targetted or attacked.  Feeblemind seems to only have effect on certain types of spells.  After having it, I never fizzled (no more than usual) on evocation or conjuration spells, but fizzled 9 times in a row casting shielding, with all casting skills maxed.  So perhaps it only affects certain types of spells.<br>

I met the named red-to-60 and chatted him up.  He gave a spiel about cooking one of the drops from the mushroom guys.  I don't have my logs here at work, but he's easy to reach and friendly, so anyone can get the spiel.<br>
<br>
The creepy bit are the guys who look like diseased humans.  When we hit the first one, he said<br>
<br>
nac llits uoy elihw tuo teg! (or something like that)<br>
<br>
Backwards, this of course is &quot;Get out while you still can.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but I found this warning to be, well, a bit horrifying.  Nice job with that, Verant.<br>
<br>
He was some kind of &quot;outcast.&quot;  There's a thread elsewhere here about what a creepy fascist town Sanctus Seru is.  There was this bit about how everyone has to submit to intense police questioning every now and again, and those who refuse to submit are &quot;cast out&quot; as are those who fail somehow to pass muster.<br>
<br>
So is The Deep the wasteland where those creepy Sanctus Seru types send their outcasts, and is that who we're killing in here?<br>
<br>
I hope it turns out that, faction-wise, one reasonable option is to beat the stuffing out of Sanctus Seru.  I don't know much about them, but what I do know, I don't like. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujaedengrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeden Grae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/01 2:15:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Very Creepy Stuff In Here</span><hr size=1> The Sanctus Seru outcasts are the Recuso in Marus Seru.
