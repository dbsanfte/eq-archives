<br>
i applaud your efforts to get detect hidden changed..it was really lame before but mythic has gone way way overboard with this....anything not fully speccd in stealth has no hope now....<br>
<br>
my suggestion is to make minimum range for equal level 5 paces...which is i understand the a^2 + b^2=c^2 correctly is 250....lower levels need a penalty resulting in zero range....well like on pace basically too late...obviuosly it needs to be scaled so a level 45 isnt invisible to a 44...alos there should be a max range on it of like 20 paces.....i can honestly target lower level stealth and nearly walk out of sight and stil have them on target....<br>
<br>
archers should be terrible at finding hidden people for god sakes they are going to get tracking one day....they already hit harder than perf from range, and have a run buff in 2/3 cases.....and the one that doesnt has a pet and a 2h weapon...<br>
<br>
also i think detect hidden should be based on level vs level, not level vs level of stealth...its just too hard to balance fo those who choose not to fully spec in stealth...<br>
<br>
stealth is realisitcally our only defense in rvr....in theory i should have a 30% chance to evade and it works nowhere near that. i so dont understand why many of the caster classes have nearly doubled in power over the last few patches, while assassins have gotten consistently worse...im not saying that the extra damage on garrote isnt nice...but most times in rvr if you have to use garrote you are already dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 3:42:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2128.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~bdemong/valaface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I can't believe they doubled the range to see archers without doubling the range to see assassins.

Anyway, are you finding it to be working other than what my testing reveals?  If so, I'd really like to know.  There are several variables involved, the only way to really know is by grabbing someone and doing some tests.<br>
<br>
That's what I do, that and get feedback from you guys (who have certainly MUCH more RvR experience than I do), and test it in action myself as I can.<br>

<br>
i think you probably did testing with another assassin....both having fullspec in stealth correct?  <br>
<br>
what ive seen is a large increase in the range everyone see's us....before i used to walk around in rvr and run right over blues all day and be out of range before they could f8 and f6....it takes tow buttons to uncover a shade....<br>
<br>
i think the biggest problem before the nerf other than most people couldnt be seen at anything but a foot was lag...i know from personal experience that lag makes you appear for a split second then poof again before anyone can do anything about it...<br>
<br>
i dont disagree at all that detect hidden needed to be changed...but it really need to go back to the old stealth system where everyone without detect hidden was scrooed. (they dont have detect hidden so why should they be finding hidden people.....) and give assassins a range of 5 paces minimum up to 20 paces maximum...and this isnt to say max being if you have 50 stealth and they have 1.....im saying maybe for each level your stealth is above thiers range should increase by a foot up to a range of 20. 5 pace radius is stil plenty for a rogue to guard a milegate...and see anyone that comes through..but a low level (as in level ten) shouldnt be able ot stand in a milegate and uncover every levle 50 that walks through...thats just plain wrong...<br>

I am glad they are trying to upgrade detect hidden, but as it stands right now, it is too dangerous to even think aobut getting close to a force in RvR.  Actually trying to slip in close to an army to attack someone is completely suicidal.  <br>

For the time being we have no use in arge battles, and are forced to pick on greys in newbie areas if we actually want to kill anyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 7:49:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2128.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yes very different</span><hr size=1> Hehe, I know your pain guys.<br>

This is on test however.  I'll be sure to test it out some more, it's hard enough to land a surprise perf with the detection range as is for non-detect-hidden classes.   I haven't noticed any differences of late though, anyone else have info on this?  Have you been detected easier as of late?<br>

That sums it up.  About 3 patches ago, they changed this.  People posted on the Gawaine board and a few others about how gray cons could see them when they got very close, and this is true for me as well, I have proved it several times.  Before the patch, there was a good chance a big group of players (even purple cons) could charge right over you and not see you (although there was a chance they *would* see you).  Now, even green cons have no chance of missing you if they run right over you.<br>
<br>
The ONLY chance you have of getting off PA now is if you walk backwards through the guy while he is casting or busy with something.  If you approach from the front, especially an orange con caster (our bread and butter) they will see you, without fail, from about a horselength away.  Does anyone get off PAs anymore?  Sure I kill plenty of casters, but not with PA very often anymore.  Unless they are already nuking someone, they see me easily.  <br>
<br>
Combine the new minimum *guaranteed* detect radius for all classes with the hit-uncovering-you addition, and we have had a major nerf to RvR.<br>
<br>
Sorry for hijacking the thread Squink, and its awesome that your suggestion got implemented and Mythic listened to its Team Lead.  I appreciate the work you're doing.  Finding archers is much easier.  The only other suggestion I would put to Mythic is NO minimum detect radius for non-stealth classes whose level is lower than our stealth.  I'm not saying make it a zero chance for them to find us, but make it like it was before they changed it for non-stealth classes - make it a good chance they won't see us at all. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usammyd11.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sammyd11</A> at: 2/12/02 8:57:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udevaril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Devaril </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/12/02 9:33:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2128.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yes very different</span><hr size=1> I had no problems last night -- Went from Albion portal to Gate in Emain wishing to pass thru to hunt newb areas.

A full party of Red hibs opened the gates for me and I walked straight thru them. Nobody gave me a glance. Luck? maybe, there were opportunities galore to see me and knock me down.<br>

Now in contrast -- wandered to Crauchon Gorge and was stalking the entrance valley from frontier fortress, spotted a grey and intercepted the idle bloke. He turned as if lookig for easy prey - seemed to spot me and ran for the fortress. Upon giving chase luck went against me as 3 purple Hibs ran right past him and took 30 seconds to sweep me up. I zigged when I should have zagged. But it was the grey that spotted me, very disconcerting.<br>

In the future I have no intentions but to trust my stealth and see how things sort out.<br>

I don't doubt Squink's tests at all, but it just feels like something fishy is happening with detect, and if the detect vs archers are true on test then it is probaly unintentional. <p><table width="600" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
