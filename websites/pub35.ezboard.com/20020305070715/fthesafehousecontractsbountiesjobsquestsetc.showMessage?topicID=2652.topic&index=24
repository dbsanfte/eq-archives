  It wasn't an email.  It was a voice conversation which took place after Steve Weiss called my cell phone and I returned his call.<br>
<br>
  This is why I am so *VERY* clear on his intent.  It wasn't a email back-and-forth exchange of, &quot;well I can't do this, can I do that?&quot;.  It was back-to-back questions, followed by straight-forward answers.  Those answers are as I stated them earlier.<br>

<br>
EQWatcher, can you really be 100% certain that people using your software cannot be detected, and subsequently banned? Would you bet your life on it? If not (and you are a crazy idiot if you would), then you have a responsiblity to at least let users of your software know that, however slight the possiblity, they MAY be detected and banned. <br>
<br>
Who cares what the EULA says?? That doesn't matter. VI said they would ban for it, and they just might. If it is possible, weather or not it is legal, weather or not it is fair, you should warn your users. Period.<br>

<br>
Talnari: People using my software could be detected at any time should Verant/SOE have the desire to do so.  I mentioned before, they might already know thousands.  I would bet that they cannot and will not ban users for using a real-time log parser.  Glimwin may be trying to be responsible, but you are most certainly wrong where you say &quot;Who cares what the EULA says&quot;.  That is just plain ignorant.  &quot;Who cares what the US Constitution says&quot;  They're both legal agreements.  If you don't care about the agreements you make, that is your choice.<br>
<br>
Being responsible should not involve spamming message boards and news sites with mindless drivel.  If he was as intelligent or wise as he claims to be, he would have challenged the Legal Director's stance as I did several months ago:<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for contacting Sony Online Entertainment with respect to EverQuest<br>
and your log parsing application.<br>
<br>
Applications like the one you mention are not allowed to be used under the<br>
EverQuest User Agreement and Software License (&quot;User Agreement&quot;), which<br>
states,<br>
<br>
&quot;9. You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to<br>
change Game play. You may not use our intellectual property rights contained<br>
in the Game or the Software to create or provide any other means through<br>
which the Game may be played by others, as through server emulators.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neither Sony Online nor Sony Computer Entertainment America provides<br>
permission for these types of applications as they are in direct violation<br>
of the User Agreement.  The use of this application by an EverQuest player<br>
may result in the termination of their EverQuest account.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments you may have.<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
<br>
Steve Weiss<br>

<br>
I lost the exact emails I SENT but basically I said something to the effect of &quot;With all due respect, have you even read what you copied and pasted to me?  It obviously says 'to modify' which is the active phrase in that sentence.  Anyone who passed high school English should be able to recognize this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he replied with this, which in laymens terms is called &quot;backing down&quot; and using the &quot;easy way out&quot;:<br>
--------------------------<br>
Section 14 of the Rules of Conduct states:<br>
<br>
&quot;You will not create, use or provide any server emulator or other site where<br>
EverQuest may be played, and you will not post or distribute any utilities,<br>
emulators or other software tools related to EverQuest without the express<br>
written permission of Sony Computer Entertainment America.&quot;<br>
<br>
That means that any distribution of the log parser or any other utilities<br>
relating to EverQuest without the express written permission of Sony<br>
Computer Entertainment America is a violation of the Rules of Conduct and<br>
the EverQuest User Agreement and Software License.   Finally, Sony Computer<br>
Entertainment America will not be granting any such permission.<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
<br>
Steve.<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
So I ask why permission would not be granted:<br>
<br>
-----------------------------<br>
Sony does not grant permission because it feels all utilities<br>
affect gameplay, which violates the rules of conduct/user agreement. In<br>
addition, there are people who place trojan horse viruses into utilities and<br>
distribute them to gain access to other EverQuest players accounts and then<br>
loot/delete them.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I personally don't think he's had much law experience, or even qualified for his position.  Regardless, this took place in August, 2001.  I have been &quot;on their radar&quot; for the duration.  My web site and message boards are quite public.  No users have been banned, nor have I received an email asking me to cease distribution (which as I mentioned previously, they can't come after me with knives, all they can do is say my EverQuest account can be banned because I'm distributing software).  EQWatcher's users are informed (or should be) of what the EULA states and they have made their own decision on whether or not they want to think that &quot;all third party software is prohibited&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is currently January, 2002.  EQWatcher has been available for over 4 months, and thousands of EQ players have downloaded it.  There have been no complaints.  EQHotkeys (for offline editing of hotkeys/socials) has been available on my website for a comparable amount of time.<br>
<br>
Editing eqclient.ini with notepad fits Steve Weiss' description of what they &quot;feel changes gameplay&quot;, and may result in termination of your account.<br>
<br>
If you think they're going to ban people for parsing log files and playing sounds, that's up to you.  I really dont think going on a crusade trying to tell people not to use third-party software just because of someone stupidity is really necessary.  I don't make a penny off EQWatcher and I don't intend to.  All I can say is that it's pretty popular and it makes me happy to be developing it.<br>
<br>
Edit: By the way, whoever was arguing about detecting programs.  Open up the Windows Task Manager (run TASKMAN or TASKMGR or hit CTRL+ALT+DEL depending on your windows version).  Microsoft is detecting all of the programs on your system when you do this!  Obviously, this information is not sent to Microsoft, and is used on your computer internally.  If they wanted to detect third party software they would simply disallow it using a similar method of detection, and not letting the game run if it is detected.  Sending the information back to the servers is what invades privacy.  If they wanted to detect notes.txt parsers, they would simply watch when you use /note, which the information from could be sent to the server (obviously increasing the load on the servers slightly).<br>

EQWatcher <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueqwatcher2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQWatcher2001</A> at: 1/19/02 1:35:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugaranth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garanth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/19/02 3:17:57 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> All use of 3rd party software bannable? No. Here's why...</span><hr size=1> Simple example: Microsoft Sidewinder Game Voice.<br>
<br>
What is it? A third-party program (with an optional piece of hardware, which is nothing more than a glorified microphone set), produced by Micro$oft, no less, that allows the player to use voice commands to control the game.<br>
<br>
This piece of third-party software (and hardware) is very much allowed for use in EQ. Why? Even though it interfaces with EQ, allowing direct control of the game, it does not modify the EQ software in any way, and therefore does not violate the EULA.<br>
<br>
The Game Voice software was even available as a free download from MS, in fact. Support for it seems to have died out, though, as even the link to the Game Voice site (www.gamevoice.com) from within Microsoft's site is a bad link. Heck, they even have (or had) an EQ command set included with it.<br>
<br>
Abashi has stated in the past that 3rd party programs are ok for use in the game for many different things. One good example are the eqclient.ini editors. As Abashi put it (not a direct quote, but very close to what he said a long time ago), these are nothing more than gui-based text editors, and do not affect the game. <br>
<br>
Whether it's done from within the game or not, using the game's own commands or not, makes no difference, since you are not affecting the actual EQ software. <br>
<br>
The same goes for the options files. (These are the files that save things like hotkey assignments, in case you're wondering.) Editing them from within the game or from outside makes no difference, as they do not affect the EQ software, nor will doing so give the player any abilities beyond what they can already do. In other words, editing the options files do not affect the EQ software or game play.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to taking sides here between the authors of EQWatcher and EQAnnounce. The main thing is, they are both nothing more than log parsers and ini/opt file editors, and none of these affect the actual EQ software. They just give players the ability to do things on the fly that would normally be done outside the game, or with the use of egg timers, or other programs (notepad, etc.). <br>
<br>
Granted the part of the EULA that says &quot;you will not post or distribute any utilities... or other software tools related to EverQuest&quot; pretty much kills anything anyone does.<br>
<br>
In any case, I don't see how the use of a program like MS Game Voice is any less violating than using EQAnnounce or EQWatcher. The original reason Verant/Sony changed their minds about the use of macro software (which is basically what the Game Voice can be used for) was due to handicapped accessibility. <br>
<br>
In fact, neither EQWatcher nor EQAnnounce interface with EQ the way the MS Game Voice does. If any of these programs violate the EULA, Microsoft is the most guilty one of them. But then, it doesn't even really interface with the EQ software, it simply sends input to your PC, just as a keyboard would. Nor do EQAnnounce or EQWatcher, but since they are related more directly to EQ, perhaps that's the catch.<br>
<br>
EQAnnounce and EQWatcher are EQ-specific programs, whereas the Game Voice is more generic. Sure seems like a double-standard, and conflicts itself.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's enough sophistry for me, tonight. Believe what you want to believe. Use what you want to use, or not. Personally, I need as much system resources as I can scrounge up to play the game with the new Luclin engine, even with 512MB RAM. Running those programs in the background takes away those precious resources. Therefore, I don't run them, but not because of the EULA.<br>
<br>
In closing, I think it's probably more likely that Sony is going to release their own EQ tools for sale, as another person here suggested. They simply don't want competition. After all, Netscape sold their browser, Microsoft gave theirs for free, and look where they are now. Or, perhaps they are part of the new Luclin interface we are STILL waiting for. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~wbruchert/garanth.jpg"><p>
