You just forgot to said (imo) that many old players have created their monk-twink (why fungi is still usable buy a newb?), how many of them play like hmmm ... no comment, how many of them make ppl jealous about their uber-gear and how much it had costed to their main bla bla bla ...<br>
<br>
If you consider that most monk-twinks are iksars, you understand how you are seen when you play one as your main toon.<br>

As far as I know, every single class in the game has been nerfed at least once.  That includes monks.  Don't you guys remember the FD nerf?  What about Kunark, where we got a &quot;passive nerf&quot;, where everyone got huge equipment upgrades except for monks.  It was so discouraging to be a monk back in those days, that I left EQ for an entire year.<br>
<br>
Some of you parsing people need to start parsing fights where you tank for xp and *shudder* raids where you tank if you can talk your guild into letting you do that hehehe.  At least log the part of the raid where you accidentally get aggro and die in five seconds flat.  It would be good to get parsing data from a warrior/SK/paladin/rogue/ranger friend of the same level in comparable equipment and have them tank some in the same area against the same monsters.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, the vast majority of the people in my guild do NOT gloat over the impending monk nerf.  If they did, I would be leaving the guild, or at the very least I would be refusing to pull.  <br>
<br>
So we can solo better than some melee classes!  So what!  Druids can solo a heck of a lot better than I can.  So can necros.  For that matter, SK's can solo better than I can.  I met a rogue lower level than myself that could outsolo me.  It was kind of embarrassing.  I ended up giving up the Lava Duct Crawler camp to him because he was killing too much stuff in the area and I wasn't getting much XP.  I can't tell you how disgusted I was to hear an enchanter in my guild who was grouped with me mentioning how many hitpoints he had.  He had only 200 less hitpoints than I did! (I have a little over 4500 fully buffed)<br>
<br>
Assuming same level, same amount of AA abilities, and comparable equipment, we can't out-tank a warrior, or even an SK or Paladin except in certain special circumstances.  We can't out-damage a rogue, and some of the time we can't out-damage a ranger.  Yes, I know a rogue has to be able to backstab to out-damage us, but unless you are talking soloing, a competent rogue is going to be in position for backstabbing 95% of the time.  We are the best &quot;well-rounded&quot; melee class, which means that we do just about everything better than half or more of the other melee classes, but with the exception of bards, there is no class that we outshine in every single aspect of close combat.  Even then, bards can out-solo us and totally own us in PvP in the right zones.  The only things we can do better than any melee class (under most circumstances) is to pull and recover corpses!  *sarcasm on*  And isn't that what being a fighter-type is all about?  *sarcasm off*<br>
<br>
I have to be very careful where I solo as a monk.  In some zones, I can do very well, if there aren't too many casters.  In other zones, even versus straight melee monsters, I sometimes get my butt handed to me by light blues.  This is particularly true in Luclin for some reason.  If you go into a zone and see a bunch of solo monks, it is probably because that zone is well suited to monk soloing, just like Cobalt Scar is well suited to quad-kiting druids.  And if you think it is annoying to non-monks to find a zone dominated by monks, at least a non-monk can go to a zone that monks can't solo well in.  If I find all the good monk-soloing zones camped to death by monks, then I am just out of luck.<br>
<br>
The funny thing about the proposed changes is this:<br>
<br>
1:  Mages will spend MORE time making mod rods than they did before.  They won't be able to make them as fast, so the mod rods will be needed even more than they are now.  Our mages currently get a little bit of nuking in.  After the nerf, they probably won't get to do any (on raids at least).  If you don't believe this, go to the mage boards and check out their reaction to this.  They do NOT like it!<br>
<br>
2:  Monks are supposed to be nerfed because they tank better than warriors in certain situations.  However, the situations where we tank better are those situations where avoidance is much more important than mitigation.  The proposed change will actually increase our avoidance slightly, making us even better at tanking in these situations.  <br>
<br>
3:  Monks aren't supposed to have such uber equipment compared to warriors and other plate classes, BUT if the nerf goes through, in order to pull successfully, we will need such equipment MORE than we did before!  That means that if a guild wants to be successful at raiding, it has to give its pulling squad of monks a bigger share of the nice loot.  Doesn't that just suck for everyone?  If you play a melee character and you are not a monk, you just got bumped down a few notches when it comes to getting the good stuff!  If you play a monk, you may end up being hated by your guild for getting the lion's share of the loot.<br>
<br>
The smart thing to do would have been to make warrior damage mitigation more effective.  However, considering that everyone uses central tanking on high-end encounters, this would have decreased the difficulty of all such encounters, creating a nightmare for Verant.  It would have required them to re-engineer all the raid-level monsters.  Still, despite the amount of work it would create for Verant, it would have been the best solution.  I suppose I can't blame them for taking the lazy route. <br>
