<br>
Harm touch makes them a good ganking class, darkness gives them a snare, taps give them health back (not much, but it really does help,) pet can sometimes distract people (though most sk players don't bother with a pet,)  shadowstep is great for escapes and confusing opponents (another tactic not used that often, but very effective) and their melee abilities mean that they can slug it out with any other class fairly easily.<br>
<br>
Rangers aren't really that good and monks are just plain terrible until later stages in the game (where I'm told they become half decent, never fought a high end monk so I can't confirm this.)<br>
<br>
2. Until you get decent resists (especially magic) you will be ganked rather often. It's something you've got to learn to cope with. Whenever you get killed while on low health and with no mana just console yourself by knowing that the item that your pker is going to lose the next day is twice as expensive as your one (it might not be true, but it works for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
3. On this server many people have two sets of permenant gear, pvp gear and pve gear. Pvp gear consists of either a lot of resist gear (resist gear = vital) or a whole ton of no drop armour. I do not suggest no drop though, with the removal of the illegal status of corpse camping many people now corpse camp no drop wearers (it's called risk versus reward, you risk dropable gear you get your corpse back, wear no drop and prepare for some hellish corpse runs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .)<br>
<br>
You don't really need numerous weapons though. If you're an sk I advise you use a weighted axe for the opening blow (watch those casters quiver with fear as you hit them with one of these while they sit) and then whatever your favourite weapon happens to be for the fight (if you want to be a_generic_shadowknight_pk_01 I suggest you go for a MoSS.)<br>
<br>
Hope that helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If you want to be a ganker, SK is the thing. <br>
<br>
I would say the 3 best melee pvp classes is SK, pal, monk.<br>
<br>
But it all depends on how you play, and what lvl and gear you got.<br>
Monks with T-staff &gt; all, however monks tend to suck at pvp before they become uber (ntov gear, st etc)<br>
<br>
Pallys, very hard to kill, get a good 2hander and joust your enemies down. With a pally played the right way, you should manage to come alive out of most pvp encounters.<br>
<br>
Sks, hit hard, good spells, and HT for that fungi gank.<br>
<br>
Rogues and Rangers, these classes are better against pure casters.<br>
No one can drop another player as fast as a rogue, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com/images/screenshots/pics/screenshot801.jpg">click here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for a good example performed by me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Rangers, deadly if you got a good bow.<br>
<br>
Pure casters:<br>
<br>
Wiz, good for ganking people zoning out after a train. Personally i think wizards suck, all the wiz pks on RZ use terrain (aka GD) to nuke once, shadowstep, recast runeshield, nuke... wizard pvp is lame.. (manaburn)<br>
<br>
Mages, also lame, send in your pet and run like hell.<br>
<br>
Necros, /shrug<br>
<br>
Oh well, i think you should just find out how you want to pvp, and then chose the class that fit.<br>
