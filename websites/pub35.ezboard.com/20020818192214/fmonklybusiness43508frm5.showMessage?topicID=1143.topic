Recently, she said that as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned in any circumstance. The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet. <br><br>&gt; Dear Dr. Laura: <br><br>&gt; Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to follow them. <br><br>a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? <br><br>b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? <br><br>c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanness <br>(Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offence. <br><br>d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? <br>Why can't I own Canadians? <br><br>e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself? <br><br>f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? <br><br>g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? <br><br>h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die? <br><br>i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? <br><br>j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14) <br><br>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging. Your devoted disciple and adoring fan. <br> <p><center><a href=http://www.drugwarfacts.org>Drug War Facts</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxenix1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xenix1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand High Poobah</span><br>  Posts: 2260<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/10/02 1:45:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1143.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why can't I own Canadians?</span><hr size=1> lol...i love the slavery one, and e<br><br>ahahahaha <p>Xenix - 1x Rogue<br>The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udamudgedeeler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damudge Deeler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand High Poobah</span><br>  Posts: 2141<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/10/02 8:02:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1143.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why can't I own Canadians?</span><hr size=1> LOL&lt; I have seen that when it first came out.

I agree with her view of homosexuality not being genetic, but I don't agree with her on the idea that they should be rehabilitated.  2 consenting adults can do whatever they want to each other, and not be rediculed or condemned.<br><br>P.S.  On many occasions I've agreed with Laura on her views of the homosexual agenda.  One of the biggest is homosexuals proposals I had a problem with was when they were lobbying for elementrary school children to be taught that a homosexual lifestyle was a valid alternative to a heterosexual lifestyle.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Elementrary school children?!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  *sigh* <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=281768>Tettsuo Otomo</a> 59 Grasshopper of the Celestial Fist<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=283394>Quiet Sturm</a> 50 Bard of Jazz Fury<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=289842> Juppo </a> 43 Druid of Non-Furry Feet<br>Druzzil Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujpwanderlust.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jpwanderlust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(7/11/02 6:50:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1143.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.lvcm.com/jpwanderlust/Heaven%20Toy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why can't I own Canadians?</span><hr size=1> What gets me is that people will clearly agree what is bad, but waver on something that has been around for years as bad, but .... eh it's the 90's.

People call her for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> her</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> advise, so she gives it to them. /shrug<br><br>If you don't like her views, address them.  Don't say you hate her, but give no reason other than you don't like the way she said something.  That's a weak argument.  If you don't like her views on homosexuality, state why.  If someone asked me if the God from the Bible liked homosexuality, I'd say no.  Saying otherwise is a lie.  If you disagree, show me a verse in the Bible that counters that.
