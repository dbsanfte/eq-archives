<br>
Anyway, the first part of this quest involves talking to Sentry Ferin in Shadeweaver's thicket. He'll talk to you about poachers, and give you a venerated cask. He wants you to kill poachers, and gather the remains of the cats that they have killed. The remains you need are called &quot;A poached pelt&quot;<br>
<br>
Upon returning the filled casket to Ferin, he proclaims that you may just be a hero that the Vah Shir are looking for. He gives you A Hero's Shroud. (AC 5, +1 Str, +5 SV Cold. Should slot. Vah Shir Only, all Vah Shir classes)<br>
<br>
Most people would think that this is the end of that quest... However, in my travels as a Newbie, I happened upon another fellow (Don't have the name right now, will get it tommorow. He's near the left wall of the zone when you come out of Shar Vahl, name starts with a K...) who will give you a quest if you can prove that you have the potential to be a hero. With this in mind, I went to him and handed him my A Hero's Shroud.<br>
<br>
And yep, there is another quest! I'm going to paraphrase what he said, since like a fool I didn't have my logger running.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah! So you are the hero! You need a Champion's Robe, though. You will need to fashion one, and then take it to High Priestess Bast to have it consecrated(something like that...). The Loda Kai have camps in the caves on the outskirts of the thicket. Go to them, and slay them. The ritual the high priestess will preform requires three drops of the bastards' blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
And here is where I need all kinds of help.<br>
<br>
First of all, he gives you back the A Hero's Shroud, along with a &quot;Champion's Cape Pattern.&quot; I'm assuming this is what we'll be using to craft the robe. I could not, however, get him to comment any further about it when I asked him, so I'm not sure what I need to make it aside from some form of tailoring.<br>
<br>
Next, I need to find out where those bastard Loda Kai camps are in the caves, I've been looking all throughout the thicket, and all I've been able to find are Shar Vahl, and the Paludal caverns zones. Of course, I havn't completely scouted out the zone yet, but a general idea of where to look would help me out... Sigh, no such luck, I gotta find out where those caves are on my lonesome.<br>
<br>
Finally, I don't know what drops the blood when I do find the camps. After dealing with Brigands, Thugs, and Poachers all at one camp, I'm sure there's gonna be multiple mobs of some sort hiding in those caves. And @#%$ only knows that somehow my kitty is a vamp, because these things can never seem to have blood when we need them to, oh no...<br>
<br>
Err... pardon me, I'm getting off course.<br>
<br>
Anyway! I would appreciate some help in finding out what it takes to make the Champion's Robe, where the Loda Kai cavern camps are, and what drops the blood for the ritual that Priestess Bast needs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukattsilverwing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katt Silverwing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/01 12:13:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looking for info on drops for a general Vah Shir quest</span><hr size=1> *FINALLY* got EQAtlas to load up the map for Shadeweaver's...

<br>
Add:  The blood is fairly rare, I was PL'ing down there and tore though the spawn quite fast.  There is also some Lodi Kai soldiers and Guardians back in the Charred section of the zone.  They average about level 16, but drop nothing of note.  I got 1 lodi kai remains out of about 50 of them.  Good experience though, go down easy. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubollo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bollo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/10/01 11:42:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uqwicksilver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qwicksilver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/01 12:18:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looking for info on drops for a general Vah Shir quest</span><hr size=1> The main problem being I tried using hte pattern and several differnt types of hides in a sewing kit only to get he message these items cant be combined in this container type also tried hte loom inside shar vhal with no luck I am beginning to think it is a Beastlord quest and you need hte beastlord sewing pack to complete it<br>

I, also, could not get any additional info out of Priestess Bast or the quest giver.  Still clueless about how to make the Champion Robe (cape if you look at the pattern).  I gave the priestess 3blood and the pattern and that isn't correct.  She kept the 3 blood though, so its probably 3 blood plus the completed cape.  I couldn't find the sentry that gave the other quest to ask him about the cape.  The quest giver does say to go wreak havoc in the poachers cave.  I have done that.  The only things they drop are bllod, weapons, poached hides, and sometimes bones.  I am going to try and get soe poached hides to try and make the cape, but this seems unlikely. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukattsilverwing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katt Silverwing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/01 9:50:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looking for info on drops for a general Vah Shir quest</span><hr size=1> For everyone, I'm posting the log of what I have so far.<br>

[Mon Dec 10 13:22:08 2001] Kojinn Kaa says 'You have proven yourself a hero of our cause, and so I entrust you with this information: the poachers have set up an outpost in the caves on the outskirts of the thicket.  Go and wreak havoc upon this deplorable filth that has mistreated our friends.  As a badge of the honor you have earned, construct a champion's robe and have the High Priestess Bast bless it for you.  The ceremony will require three drops of the blood of those who would bring harm to the felidae.  It will be the High Priestess?s honor to receive you. <br>

The blight of poachers and others that would profit from their destruction has overrun their peaceful way of life.  You may also serve this noble cause, speak with Sentry Ferin in the field.
