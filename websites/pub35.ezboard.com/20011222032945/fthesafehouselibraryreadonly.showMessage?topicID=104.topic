<br>
<b>RAGEBRINGER QUEST WALKTHROUGH</B><br>
<br>
(MUST be level 50 to talk to all major quest NPCs and have them respond with the quest info and to be able to be rewarded with turn-ins, even the side quests)<br>
<br>
<b>1)</b> Find Malka Rale in the Qeynos Aqueducts at location +380, -210, +80. Say "I will help" to get "Stanos' Pouch."<br>
<br>
- Malka's placeholder is "A courier."<br>
– "A courier" will despawn at 8 p.m. game time, then Malka will spawn at 10 p.m. game time in the place of the courier.<br>
– The courier does NOT need to be killed to get Malka to spawn, just wait till 10 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>2a)</b> Travel to North Kaladim and locate Founy Jestands at location +520, +307, -35. Pick pocket the "stained parchment top" from him. He is a rogue GM near the bank.<br>
<br>
– He will despawn at 8 a.m. game time and respawn at 10 a.m.<br>
– He will NOT always spawn with the parchment piece.<br>
– If you get caught while PPing then zone ASAP - the zone is close.<br>
<br>
<b>2b)</b> Travel to Neriak 3rd Gate and locate Tani N'Mar at location +650, -1300. Pick pocket the "stained parchment bottom" from him. He is a rogue GM in the rogue guild hall.<br>
<br>
– He will NOT always spawn with the parchment piece.<br>
<br>
<b>3)</b> Find Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold (in secret smugglers camp - must go through underwater tunnel) at location +10, +325, +45. Give him both the "stained parchment top" and the "stained parchment bottom" at the same time to receive the "Combined Parchment."<br>
<br>
– If Stanos is not in the camp then give Anson McBale "Stanos' Pouch" you received from Malka Rale to spawn him. (Be sure to stand on the table behind Anson when giving him "Stanos' Pouch" or Stanos may not spawn - this happens because you may be standing on Stanos' spawn point)<br>
– If Anson is not in the camp you will have to kill his smuggler placeholder.<br>
- The smugglers are fairly high level and will require a full well rounded 50+ group to kill. (although they can be killed with less, it is unsafe to do so)<br>
- (OPTIONAL) Stanos was found to have spawned after saying to Anson that "I need to see Stanos." He will say it better be important and Stanos will spawn if you are not standing on his spawn point. NOTE: you may have to do the pouch method first time though, because you may need high faction for this.<br>
<br>
<b>4)</b> Travel to Lake Rathetear and locate Eldreth in the island tower at location +2600, -550. Hand Eldreth the "Combined Parchment," 100 platinum, and 2 bottles (unstacked) of milk all at once to receive the "Scribbled Parchment." If you don't have at least indifferent faction with him, SNEAK when turning in the items. Eldreth will then despawn.<br>
<br>
- Eldreth is a totally rondom spawn spanning anywhere from many hours to a few days (Real Life Time).<br>
<br>
<b>5)</b> Travel to the Plane of Hate to pick up the "Book of Souls." Located at location -60, +320, the spawn time is 10 hours.  The book spawns on the bedside night stand in the bedroom located in the top floor of Maestro of Rancor's building.<br>
        <br>
<b>6a)</b> Travel to the Steamfont Mountains and locate Yendar Starpyre (a gnome in an SMR.)<br>
<br>
– Yendar wanders the entire zone so have a tracker.<br>
- Yendar is a totally rondom spawn spanning anywhere from many hours to a few days (Real Life Time).<br>
<br>
After he has been located hail him to keep him from running (saying "book" also stops him) and give him the "Scribbled Parchment" you received from Eldreth. He in turn will give you another note called a "Tattered Parchment".  NOTE: Yendar no longer despawns after giving him the scribbled parchment. <br>
<br>
<b>6b)</b> After you locate him a second time give him the "Tattered Parchment" and the "Book of Souls" at the same time. He will then despawn and a level 50 female human rogue named Renux Herkanor will spawn nearby (she quads for 200+ and wields a weapon which procs clockwork poison - a spinning stun spell.) <br>
<br>
Quickly engage combat or she will despawn in a short period of time.  <b>See below for strategy on defeating Renux.</b><br>
<br>
After Renux has been killed, loot the "Jagged Diamond Dagger" and the "Translated Parchment" from her. She also drops an off-hand only 1HS sword called the Trochilc's Skean which procs clockwork poison and 2 new pieces of Ravenscale armor.<br>
<br>
– The "Jagged Diamond Dagger" can also be obtained through a side-quest involving Vilinus the Small <b>(See Side Quests below.)</b><br>
<br>
– <b>WARNING:</b> It is said that after Renux is killed, Yender will respawn immediately after. THIS IS FALSE INFO - YENDAR IS RANDOM SPAWN<br>
<br>
<b>7)</b> Return to Highpass Hold and re-locate Stanos (if he is not up see #3 above) in the smuggler's camp. Give him the "Translated Parchment" you looted from Renux and in turn you will receive "a sealed box."<br>
<br>
<b>8)</b> Travel to Kithicor Forest and locate the Dark Elf House at location +800, +2400. Give the box to any one of the night spawns there to spawn General V'Ghera. Pull the General to a safe spot and kill him. Once he has fallen, loot the "General's Pouch" from him. Also, if he dropped the rare "Cazic Quill" loot this item as well. He drops many other things that are not needed for the quest and may be given to those that helped you though the quest.<br>
<br>
– If he did not drop the "Cazic Quill" you must obtain it through a side quest involving Vilinus the Small <b>(See Side Quests.)</b><br>
<br>
<b>9)</b> After you have obtained the "Jagged Diamond Dagger," the "Cazic Quill," and the "General's Pouch," travel to Highpass Hold and give them all at once to Stanos to receive the Ragebringer. (If Stanos is not in the camp, see #3 above.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SIDE QUESTS</b><br>
-------------<br>
<br>
These three side quests involve an NPC named Vilinus the Small. He can be located in Western Karanas in the bandit camp at location +340, -6700. Making him spawn will take some work. First, be sure all bandits are in the camp. You must kill and continue to kill the bandit which runs from the camp to the top of the hill until the "brigand" spawns. The "brigand" is an ultra-rare spawn. Leave the "brigand" alone, and at 11 p.m. game time Vilinus the Small will spawn in his place. From here, there are 3 sub-quests you are able to complete all of which earn you a different item.<br>
<br>
– The first sub quest will result in the "Jagged Diamond Dagger." Return to Vilinus the Small all at once <br>
<br>
<b>a "Fleshripper"</b> (from the "Kobold King" in Sol B),<br>
<b>a "Painbringer"</b> (from the "Kobold Champion" in Sol B),<br>
<b>a "Mithril Two-Handed Sword"</b> (from the "Froglok King" in Lower Guk - live side),<br>
<b>a "Gigantic Zwiehander"</b> (from "Karg Icebear" in Everfrost Peaks.)<br>
<br>
– The second quest results in a "Cazic Quill." Return to Vilinus the Small all at once:<br>
<br>
<b>a "Robe of the Kedge"</b> (from "Phinigel Autropos" in Kedge Keep OR the "Coercer" in Kithicor Forest),<br>
<b>a "Robe of Ishva"</b> (from the "Coercer" in Kithicor Forest),<br>
<b>a "Shiny Metallic Robes"</b> (from the "Ghoul Arch Magi" in Lower Guk),<br>
<b>a "Robe of the Oracle"</b> (from the Oracle in the Ocean of Tears.)<br>
<br>
– The third quest results in "Stanos' Pouch." Yes, that is the same item Malka Rale simply <i>gives</i> you in Qeynos Aqueducts. Return to Vilinus the Small all at once: (<b>Note:</b> There is no real reason to do this particular side quest.)<br>
<br>
<b>a "Burning Rapier"</b> (obtained from a quest),<br>
<b>a "Martune Rapier"</b> (from "A Scorn Banshee" in the Plane of Hate),<br>
<b>an Eyerazzia</b> (from "A Scareling" in the Plane of Fear),<br>
<b>a "Well Balanced Rapier"</b> (from the "Shady Swashbuckler" in East Commons.)<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: Although the "Side Quests" yield many of the same items as the quest needs, it soley cannot be done to complete the quest. Renux drops the "Jagged Diamond Dagger," Malka Rale gives you "Stanos' Pouch," and the General drops the "Cazic Quill," although the Quill is VERY rare and will most likely have to be obtained though the side quest with the midgit.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukezzek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kezzek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/smallPadlock.gif BORDER=0> at: 5/14/01 8:24:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukezzek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kezzek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/smallPadlock.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asst.

----------------------------------<br>
Key Pointers<br>
- Renux will NOT attack pets<br>
- She can be outrun with Jboots and/or SoW<br>
- Do NOT melee her no matter what, you WILL die if you do.<br>
- She will NOT summon<br>
- Renux will go after the nearest PC on her agro list<br>
- She can be feared and snared, but not easily (especially for lower lvl chars)<br>
<br>
Perferred Method (safest) note: I need her resistance info - anyone?<br>
---------<br>
<br>
<b>Preliminary</b><br>
<br>
Gather together a force of about 18 people (3 full groups) primarily composed of casters and pet classes, also, at least 1 res able cleric (melee classes will not attack, only kite her - unless she has been feared).<br>
<br>
- Have all pet classes summon their pets and arm them (mage weapons work best).<br>
- Have SoW cast on EVERYONE, all pets included<br>
- Have the cleric buff vital stats (HP and AC) on all PCs - pets not needed unless you add attack rating. (this is because they will NOT be attacked)<br>
- Have a shaman fully vital stat and speed buff ALL pets. (may also want to buff meleers if you intend to fear kite)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Fight</b><br>
<br>
- Once Renux has spawned quickly have a melee char agro her and begin running her around (be sure NOT to loose agro with her)<br>
- Send in ALL pets to chase her<br>
- IF you have a sham or magi able to cast malo/mala do so now (casters, stay as far back as possible when casting)<br>
- Once malo/mala has landed (if you have that option) then attempt to snare and fear her.<br>
- If fear sticks then send in all meleers to begin attacking and have all nukers nuke. (if fear breaks meleers MUST back off ASAP)<br>
- If fear does not stick then continue to "pet kite" her and try again.<br>
- Continue trying to fear and if you cannot get it to stick let the pets kill her off (nuking is not recommended unless she is feared)<br>
- If the "kiting tank" dies then have another melee char pick her up while the cleric resses - if she looses agro for too long she will despawn causing you to begin the quest over.<br>
<br>
She should quickly die with this manner of "reverse pet kiting" and/or "fear kiting."<br>

<br>
----------------------------------<br>
- Gather together at min 36 players (6 full groups - more if they are split up) or up to about 50 if needed (it is reccomended that you do NOT get more then 50 or the zone may crash or too many will go LD and you will loose because of this)<br>
<br>
The Teams are:<br>
<br>
PULL TEAM: Quest Rogue with the "sealed box", 56+ Shadow Knight OR Monk, and at least 2-3 56+ TANKS, and a 55+ Magi with CoH to summon the rogue after the hand off (total = 4-6 people)<br>
<br>
TANK TEAM: 56+ Cleric, 56+ Enchanter, 56+ Shaman, and 3 high level TANKS<br>
<br>
UNDEAD CONTROL DETAIL TEAM: All enchanters (as high lvl as possible)<br>
<br>
NUKE TEAM (there may be more then 1 nuke team): As many LURE available Wizards as possible!, Magi and Necros w/pets<br>
<br>
OTHERS: the best teams are composed of 4 tanks and 2 clerics to keep them alive, all the casters should be grouped into their own groups - no nukers with the tanks<br>
<br>
Get the highest level players as possible - if you haven't got at least 2 teams of 56+ chars it is NOT reccomended you do this battle<br>
<br>

<br>
THE EPIC BATTLE<br>
------------------------------<br>
1) Set up forces at the crossroads - +800, +3200<br>
<br>
2) 3pm game time: EVERYONE BUFFS FULLY - GET ALL PETS BUFFED<br>
<br>
3) 4pm: Pull Team and Tank Team move to the ridge west of the DE cabin at location +800, +2400<br>
<br>
4) Kill ALL PHs in the cabin by 7pm (EXCEPT the Chaplain - if this guy agros mez and mem blur him) (note: this is done by ONLY the pull and tank teams)<br>
<br>
5) Kill ALL nearby undead by 8pm, EVERYTHING<br>
<br>
6) All pull team members get an invis to undead from the cleric (except for rogue) - may want to have spare invis to undead potions<br>
<br>
7) Tank Team moves back to crossroads<br>
<br>
8) 9pm: Chaplain will despawn - Begin speed buffing and DS buffs<br>
<br>
9) FD Puller (wether it be the Shadowknight or Monk) moves into cabin (near where the chaplain despawns but not on his spawn point) and FDs - NO NPCs should be in the cabin at this time, if one spawns other then the Coercer, KILL IT ASAP<br>
<br>
10) ROG moves to opposite side of cabin where the FD puller will pull the coming Coercer to (this location needs to be far enough away from the cabin so that anyone walking into the cabin will not agro her but far enough away from all undead)<br>
<br>
11) 11pm: The Coercer spawns, FD puller pulls to the waiting ROG (who is hidden and sneaking)<br>
<br>
12) ROG gives box to the Coercer from behind while sneaking then rehides, General V'Ghera spawns a few seconds later (hand off needs to be fast so the Coercer does not return to the cabin) If the ROG agros her just sit and die, DO NOT PULL TO GROUP, the cleric will get you later (make sure you get LOC) If the hand off is sucessful then have the Magi - who is still located at the base camp - CoH the ROG back to camp and get rdy for the incoming General.<br>
<br>
13) Highest lvl tank on the pull team pulls the General to the waiting forces at the crossroads - make sure you do not get too far away from the General or he will go back to the cabin (if the first tank dies while pulling then the second highest tank ont he pull team will take over and so on until the General is at the camp) NOTE: Call of Hero can be used to bring the FD puller and ROG back to camp safely - use this only when you have a mag in pull team that stays in camp during pull.<br>
<br>
14) All forces at crossroads engage - EXCEPT the Enchanters... ALL (or at min 2) the Enchanters will have the sole responsibilty of keeping the undead that arrive mezed (MAINLY THE HEALERS)<br>
<br>
*Since the General is lvl 63 his corpse will not rot for 30 mins - the ROG should loot first, make sure to get the "General's Pouch" and IF it drops the "Cazic Quill." All other loot from the General is NOT needed for the quest and SHOULD be given out to the helping forces - distribute however you see fit<br>
