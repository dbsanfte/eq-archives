A smelly gnome wizard offered to take him to the Toxxula forest . . . for a small fee of course. Minz crinkled his nose, hoping the gnome would use the platinum coins to purchase a bath.<br>
<br>
Jing would not go.<br>
<br>
That was fine.<br>
<br>
A flash of magic, turning his stomach and he and the gnome were on their way.<br>
<br>
Once there, the wizard was paid and sent on his way. His head buzzed just like it always did after traveling the winds of magic. "Gods I hate that," he muttered shaking his head in a futile attempt to banish the after-effects of teleportation.<br>
<br>
Minz thumped the earth with his harpoon. The soft loam Toxxula forest absorbed most of the noise, but he could manage.<br>
<br>
'If memory serves,' he thought. 'Paineel and the Warrens are to South and West of the spires.' "South. . ." he said aloud. "Hmmm. Oh hell! I hope this is south!" He sighed heavily and trudged away. Thumping the earth every other step. Soon enough the sound of feet walking on marble could be heard. "Well, its Erudin or Paineel," he muttered. "I'll find out soon enough."<br>
<br>
His feet hit the marble. The harpoon clacked loudly on the hard surface. 'A pillar to his right. Another farther off to his left. And two ahead of him. Roughly 15 or so feet away. Two large cauldrons burned here. One on either side of him. Sending off little heat it seemed. But crackling noisily. He turned his head, feigning a visual survey of the place. He stepped forward purposefully. Rapping the harpoon the marble. Judging everything by the contours of the echoes he heard.<br>
<br>
The "clickity clack" of bones confirmed to him that he was indeed in Paineel. "Here goes,' he thought. Inwardly readying himself for combat. It the very real possibility that these guards might not look on him to kindly. Let alone a citizen of Paineel. He snarled at the skeletons, walking toward them as if he'd done it a million times before.<br>
<br>
They stepped aside. Once out of earshot of the guards, Minz let out a heavy sigh. 'What the hell am I doing?' he thought. Echoes of Jing's admonition rang in his mind. '...no good to anyone dead.' He sighed again. Muttering under his breath, "Not to damn good for anyone about now. Especially the ones I call friends." He steeled himself inwardly. 'There was no turning back now. It was far too late and he was far too deep to have second thoughts.<br>
<br>
The passage opened up into a wide chamber. No, not a chamber it seemed. A depression carved into the very stone. Sound seemed to die off directly ahead of him. 'That can't be good,' he though. Staying well clear of the "dead space" which seemed to occupy the center of this pit. 'The Hole!' he thought, remembering a map of the fearsome dungeon that lay at the bottom of that deep pit. 'That's what it is.'<br>
<br>
A path to his right lead to the city's entrance. He had never been here, but had heard of it many times. Studying maps just in case. 'One never knew when such knowledge might be called into use.' He thought.<br>
<br>
Minz tried to retrace the steps that brought him here. The duel. The challenge he had made to Xareth. "If I win," he told the drow warrior, "you will free Silverstarr." The drow grinned widely. "And if I win..." he hissed. Replying in a low voice so that only Minz could hear. "If I win, you will perform a 'service' for me." 'A service.' He rolled the words over in his mind. An assassination is what the Tier Dal meant. He was a trained assassin. This was his business. Minz knew the implications at once. But Silver was in harms way. He would have done as much for any of his Order. Though it could lead to his expulsion from the very Order he was defending. He could have declined. At what cost though. At what cost to Silverstarr.<br>
<br>
He accepted the deal. And lost.<br>
<br>
And then he was given his mark. Xareth was vile. An enemy to the drow's order indeed. This one had vexed the Violent Harvest for some time. But his mark was also a friend of the Order of Elder Dragons, his order.<br>
<br>
And worse yet, a friend to him. Minz grit his teeth as the image of him sending his blade home, fulfilling the contract, flashed before his eyes. His jaw ached from the habits.<br>
<br>
He could have declined it then. There were mechanisms within the Rogues professional guild, to turn down a contract. To back out. But these had other consequences too. Often very painful consequences. Let alone the glee with which Xareth would rend Silver from her flesh if he backed out.<br>
<br>
No. He didn't have a choice. Each individual step, was the right decision. Each choice, he would make again. But as a whole... as a whole, he felt as though he was heading down a very dark path.<br>
<br>
From the moment he accepted Xareth's deal, he was tainted. And this taint. . .this shadow of evil he took on in order to save a friend led him here. To Paineel. City of the Heretical Erudites. Home to some of the blackest magic ever known.<br>
<br>
He slipped into the shadows and waited. His contact, one Rhasine, was to step outside of the city at 11 o'clock in the morning, light up one of the native Erudin cigars and wait until the cigar was done. He or she was to do this every day for a fortnight. Today was probably the eleventh day. Upon approaching her, he was to pull out his pipe, and ask for a light. Rhasine would wordlessly hand him a box of matches. He would light his pipe and then comment on the superiority of Neriak tobacco.<br>
<br>
Once this sequence of events had transpired correctly. Rhasine was to aid him in any thing he asked. This was meant to be a mere supply drop. Poison, information, the where abouts of his mark, news to be sent back to his employer. Today, his contact would be called upon to do more though.<br>
<br>
He waited.<br>
<br>
The hours passed slowly. He searched the area with his ears. The Hole occupied the majority of the area, with only a slim ledge to walk on.<br>
<br>
Day broke. He knew this only by the increased traffic. He sat and waited. Wrapped in the shadows that he knew so well.<br>
<br>
The hidden gates of Paineel opened and closed many times.<br>
<br>
A match hissed.<br>
<br>
The smell of burning broad leaf tobacco wafted through the air.<br>
<br>
He waited. Considering that many here smoked such cigars.<br>
<br>
The smoker seemed to stand still. Waiting.<br>
<br>
A few adventurers passed. He waited until they were well out of earshot. Listening hard for any other sign of life.<br>
<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
Just the inhale and exhale of breath and the quiet crackle of the cigar burning.<br>
<br>
'He's not even smoking it!' he thought sourly. 'What a waste.'<br>
<br>
He let the shadows slip from him, stepping towards Rhasine. Pipe in hand. Pressing a bit of latakia blend into its bowl. "You got a match?" he said. Rhasine started. He rapped his harpoon on the stone. Young it seemed. And female. Rapping the floor again. He heard the light clattering of wooden matchsticks jumbling in a box as she held her hand out. Minz reached out uncertainly, waving it a bit looking for her hand. A hand pressed the matched into his.<br>
<br>
The rogue clamped his pipe between his lips and struck the match. Putting the flame to the bowl. Nimble fingers making sure that the match was where it ought to be. He puffed heavily, filling his mouth with the spicy smoke. "Neriak tobacconist are the finest in all of Norrath, if ya ask me," he said as he blew the match out. Placing the burnt stick in his pocket as the matchbox was handed back to the young female Erudite.<br>
<br>
"You . . . you're a wood elf?" she asked incredulously.<br>
<br>
"No. I am half Northman. Now do you think this is a safe spot for us to be chatting?" He snapped.<br>
<br>
"Right," she said. All trace of surprise gone from her voice. "This way."<br>
<br>
"Wait!" he snapped. He heard her turn. "You must lead me. I will tell you more later. For now, take my arm, and lead. I will walk next to you hidden." He felt the air move in front of his face. His hand snapped up. He gripped the girl's slender wrist hard. Intentionally hurting her. He stepped to her, pushing her, step by step toward the edge of the platform they stood on. "I might be blind, but I'll end your pathetic life quicker that you can scream girl. Now lead!" Releasing her, he stuffed his pipe in his pocket and slipped into the shadows.<br>
<br>
She had to walk extremely slow.<br>
<br>
They turned a few corners. Their steps echoed heavily. The sound bouncing here and then there and then back. A very disconcerting feeling. It was if he was lost in a maze of mirrors. Each silver pane of glass reflecting something that was not there. Rough stone walls surrounded them. A tunnel of some sort. Eventually they stopped and she stated, "we should be safe here. What is it you want."<br>
<br>
"There are some in your city that can heal blindness. Take me to them," he hissed.<br>
<br>
"Yes, but?" She began, but Minz cut her off mid sentence<br>
<br>
"You were told to assist me in any way I ask. Now do as I ask!" He said roughly. Softening his voice. A wicked grin on his lips "Or would you rather I send word to Xareth of your uncooperative nature?" He heard a rustle of fabric. A bow perhaps.<br>
<br>
"I am yours to command." She said in a submissive tone. "I will take you to them." Her hand slipped onto his arm<br>
<br>
"Aye, that you will. But perhaps not right away." He caught her arm, pulling the erudite woman to him. Her scent was intoxicating. Exotic and enticing. The air was thick with her emotions. Fear, anger and hatred. So thick it was almost palpable. He could hear her heart race. Her breath hot on his lips. "No, definitely not right away."<br>
<br>
The low flame of lust grew in his loins. Heating his blood. He wanted her. Clenching his eyelids uselessly shut as he thought that escape was all he really wanted. But she would do. Even if it was a fleeting escape. He pressed his lips to hers, kissing her hungrily. She was taller than he, so he had to crane his neck a bit. But oooohhhhh was it worth is. Her full lips parted in a luscious soft passion. She tasted of bitter sweetness.<br>
<br>
He wrapped his arms about her. His hands pressing to her bare back, roving upward to the short silk top she wore. Freezing for a moment his blindness hit him. 'What if...what if I can't.' he thought. Feeling the throbbing pressure of his manhood soften. Rhasine's kiss deepened. She must have sensed something. She murmured something in her native language, pushing him away slightly, as she pulled his mail breastplate and shirt of in one motion. Her hands slid down his chest, deftly undoing the buckles and straps that held his armor in place.<br>
<br>
Her lips were on his chest, and her nails dug into his back as she dragged them downward. She bit at him lightly. Her kisses and nips working their way lower. Minz took a deep breath, arching himself into her. 'Hell with this,' he thought. Trying to rally himself. "I'll do her like she's never had it before.' Doing his best to push out thoughts of failure and shortcomings. Focusing on what he could feel. Her long fingers slipped just underneath the waistband of his leggings. Circling his waist, starting from the small of his back, meeting in the center of his abdomen. Tugging on his belt.<br>
<br>
His hands went to her shoulders and neck. Her skin was supple and smooth. Running his fingers through the tight curls of her hair. Moaning softly as she slid his pants to the floor. His manhood urgently protruding through his lucky boxers. A giggle escaped her lips. All his fears came rushing back again. He had a momentary urge to backhand her hard. Tossing her to the floor. And take her violently. The beginning of a snarl formed on his lips and was washed away as she took him in her mouth. He gasped in pleasure as her warm lips enveloped him. Slipping slowly downward and the drawing back up. Milking him with her tongue.<br>
<br>
He was lost in ecstasy. All thoughts of failure ebbing away under the tender ministrations of Rhasine's lips. Unable to stand any more. He pulled her up to him. Kissing her hungrily. Tasting his own saltiness on her lips as she deftly slipped out of her clothes. Sheer silken garments falling silently to the floor.<br>
<br>
Taking his hand Rhasine lay down, pulling him with her. She guided his hand over her. Feeling the contours of her face. Slender eyebrows, soft cheeks and full lips. A strong chin. Rounded ears and a long neck. Showing him the riffles and eddies of her body. Things he would have seen. Sights that would have urged him passionately onward would the have penetrated his eyes. Caressing her breasts . . .guiding him down her belly. His fingers glided ever downward. She wrapper her hand on top of his, and together they plunged their fingers into her maidens font. She moaned loudly as they worked their hands back and forth. Her breath came in short gasps. Her hot breathe oh his cheek. The quite sounds and warm wet touch taking the place of sights. His confidence grew. As did his desire for her.<br>
<br>
Some where in him, Minz thought "I can do this" Not quite a thought though. Not in words. An impulse. A wordless feeling, driving him forward. He kissed her chest. Trailing his lips over her. Taking her breast into his mouth. Biting firmly at her pebble hard nipple. His hips undulated against her thigh. The heat from her body was unbearable. She moaned, calling out plaintively words he didn't know, but understood nonetheless.<br>
<br>
He rose pressing his body to hers as she spread her legs accommodatingly for him. Her hands wrapped around his back and she pulled him to her. His manhood slid easily over her moist folds. She uttered more words he didn't know, each phase tinged with urgency. He pressed himself into her. Slowly sinking deeper and deeper. She shuddered as his pelvis met hers.<br>
<br>
She slid her long arms up to his shoulder, and he leaned down kissing her. Pulling his hips back ever so gently, thrusting them home with a snap. Again and again. Her hips rising up to meet each thrust. Pounding rhythmically. Beads of sweat growing on his forehead. Her body was already slick with a sheen of perspiration.<br>
<br>
Brushing his lips to hers. Breathing her breath.<br>
<br>
Gasping as ecstasy seemed to rush up upon him. Her nails digging deep as they careened toward climax<br>
<br>
Grunting loudly as he burst open inside her. Waves of pleasure crashing over him in pulsating spasms. Feeling her clench around him as she climaxed. She called out in her native tongue. Her breath hot on the side of his face.<br>
<br>
Falling into her arms. Spent. Exhausted. Panting. She sought his lips as he tried to catch his breath. Kissing his face, his eyes and forehead when he was unable to kiss her fully on the lips.<br>
<br>
The couple lay there for quite some time. Relishing the feel of eachothers touch. Neither wanting to move from the warm embrace of the other.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Minz rolled over onto his back. His lack of vision made all of his other senses that much more acute. 'This could have its benefits,' he thought. Rhasine was panting too. He leaned over; running a finger down her naked sweat covered chest. Cupping her breast in his hand. She shivered under his touch. Both proud that he was able to please her and a little self-conscious that he might have some how fallen short. That without his eyes, he was less desirable.<br>
<br>
"Help me dress please." He said to her. Obligingly, she rose, gathering his things it seemed. His shirt was slipped over his chest. His lucky boxers. Green silk with black polka dots he remembered. No wonder she giggled. His leggings were slid over his feet. He raised his hips so she could slip them to his waist. Socks and boots. Shoulder plates and arm pieces. Finally his breast plate. He pulled her close as she slid the scaled armor down his chest. Kissing her passionately. Her lips responded. Her mouth opening. Tongues intertwining. Parting in breathless longing. Minz smiled a bit. Lowering his eyes as if peering down. Rhasine's soft hand caressed his cheek.<br>
<br>
He stood up, and heard Rhasine dressing herself.<br>
<br>
Ahhh now he wished he could see. He sighed heavily. "How did it happen?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"Huh? Ohhh." He chuckled ruefully. "Staring at the sun."<br>
<br>
"Was that wise?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"Indeed not, but I was unable to do anything else." He replied.<br>
<br>
Her arm slid onto his. "Come, the city is this way." He slipped into the shadows and they made their way to the city of the heretics. Deeper and deeper they traveled. Through narrow circuitous passages and wide avenues. They entered a building. Faint chants could be heard in the background. Sonorous deep voices. Singing praises to some @#%$. A few more doors. Finally she whispered, "wait here." Her hand slipped free of his arm, and he was alone. He rapped his harpoon on the ground lightly. He was in a small room. Stone walls. A table or altar seemed to be in the center of the room.<br>
<br>
The door swung open and shut on nearly silent hinges. Soft footstep on the stone floor. He could not place them. And therefore remained hidden.<br>
<br>
A slender hand touched his chin. His hand lashed up, catching the wrist. Sending the shadows that he hid in flickering away.<br>
<br>
"Aaahhh yes. I remember you young one." The voice intoned in an unmistakable Tier 'Dal accent. "The one who carries his ghosts with him where ever he goes. How are you my Rogue."<br>
<br>
Memories came flooding back. It was in the misty woods Nekulous that they met. Ghosts had appeared to him. Those spirits whom he had extricated from their mortal bodies. He killed them for money, and nothing more. She was death. She was the dark lady who some how understood him. Who knew him before they met. His dark lady. This both comforted him and worried him. "Aye, and I remember you." He said flatly.<br>
<br>
"You have been up to no good I see." She said. Then whispered into his ear. "This pleases me." Stepping away. "You cannot see?" He nodded. "Come. Sit here. Ohhh I'm sorry," she sneered. "You can't see me point can you."<br>
<br>
Minz curled his lip in anger. Stepping forward, rapping his harpoon on the floor, following the sound to the edge of the table. He hopped up onto it. Her slender hands touched his face. Pulling at his eyelids. He felt heat near his face. A candle perhaps.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Indeed you are blind," she said. "I can help you. But there is a price. A dear one."<br>
<br>
"I have plat." He said hoarsely. Fear running through him. Regret that he had chosen this path.<br>
<br>
"Platinum?" she laughed. "My dear dear rogue. I have no use for your platinum. The price I ask is much higher." She leaned her face to his. He could feel her breath on him. "Much higher indeed," she whispered. "Come, lie down." She said, her voice taking on that of a professional. He followed her instructions, lying down and immediately regretted it. Iron bands slapped across his arms and legs. As if sprung magically. He struggled, protesting loudly. "Hush young one. This is for your own good. So that you don't harm yourself during the surgery."<br>
<br>
"Surgery?" He gasped.<br>
<br>
"Well of course. What did you think we were going to do? We will replace your eyes with another's." Wooden planks were pressed to his head. Forcing immobility. A heavy leather strap was wrapped tightly on his chin. Another across the crown of his head.<br>
<br>
Minz grunted, trying in vain to wrestle free. Asking through gritted teeth, "What the hell do you need all this for?"<br>
<br>
The silken voice again, "Dear one," she ran the back of her hand over his forehead. "The nature of the surgery precludes the use of anesthesia." She seemed to turn away from him. "Bring it in." she yelled to some one out side the door. Footsteps could be heard. Heavy booted feet and the sounds of a struggle. A futile effort to escape. The clack of more iron manacles snapping into place. "You may go," she uttering in an authoritative tone. Minz heard her murmur in her race's language. The long vowels and odd accents of Tier 'Dal, seemed to trail off. Leaving haunting echoes in the air. Silence hung over the room. The other was afraid. His breath was short and he shivered under the manacles. Placing her hand on his face. Her fingers held his right eye open wide. "Now is going will hurt."<br>
<br>
The razor sharp blade slid into his flesh, sinking deeply. Minz screamed out in fear and pain. Sickening waves seemed to wash over him. Healing magic, but some how wrong. Blood being absorbed back into the body. Tainted. Flesh being forcefully knit whole through some foreign means.<br>
<br>
This was not the touch of a cleric or paladin.<br>
<br>
This was necromancy.<br>
<br>
There were other screams as well. Another voice, nearby. Crying out in pain. Begging for mercy in some foreign tongue. Tier 'Dal, it seemed. The language of the dark elves. His voice sickeningly thick with agony. This confused him. Why would another be needed? But he was too wrapped up in his own torture to contemplate the meaning.<br>
<br>
Another cut here.<br>
<br>
A tugging.<br>
<br>
Face falling flat?seeming some how wrong.<br>
<br>
He screamed all the more as the realization hit him. His eyes. . . His eye sockets were . . . empty.<br>
<br>
More pressure to his face. Agony sizzled through him. The other cries were now moaning lamentations of grief. Long wails. Pleading for release. Even Minz understood what he was saying. "Let me die." Over and over again.<br>
<br>
With a final whimper, the cries ended. His and his companions.<br>
<br>
It was over.<br>
<br>
Sick waves of necromantic healing rushed through his body. A feeling of wrongness pervaded the magic. As if it was not his body healing itself, augmented by magic. But something else. Something other than his body healing.<br>
<br>
The blocks were removed from his head. Wrists and legs freed. He lay there shivering. Ill freight and remorse at what had happened. At what he had done.<br>
<br>
He was too weak to move.<br>
<br>
"Ssshhhhhh," his dark lady's voice like silk. "Rest now. We will talk in the morning."<br>
<br>
Morning came. Apparently. Though he never knew for sure. His eyes were still shrouded with darkness. No glimmer of light penetrated. He was angry. Furious. This one would pay.<br>
<br>
The door opened. Minz lunged for the body coming through the threshold. Growling and gnashing his teeth. Seething hatred. Bony hands snatched him and held him at bay. He lashed out. But all in futility. "Good morning my Rogue. How do you feel? More energetic I see." Her silken voice infuriating him all the more.<br>
<br>
"I am still blind!" he shouted as the skeletal nurse forced him into a chair.<br>
<br>
"Well of course you are. At least in this form." She replied calmly.<br>
<br>
"What the hell does that mean? This form? What other form is there?" He tried to get up again, but was solidly thumped back into the chair.<br>
<br>
"Ohhhh!" She said as if finally understanding his rage. "My dear rogue. The eyes you have are that of a Tier 'Dal."<br>
<br>
"What?" He shouted.<br>
<br>
"Ohhh don't you fret." She said mockingly. "He was just a pathetic light-lover. We caught him bedded with a half-breed. His death is well deserved. But he had the most beautiful emerald eyes. Pale green, almost golden in some lights. And now, you have these eyes. Very striking with your complexion. But you will never know will you? Of course they will not work with your body. To be able to see you must become Tier 'Dal."<br>
<br>
The surealness of the situation overwhelmed him. And he began to laugh. "How does one do that my Dark Lady?"<br>
<br>
Lips were pressed to his. A soft kiss. Skeletal hands held him in place. Preventing him from pulling away. "I thought you'd never ask." She whispered, her lips still touching his. She stepped away. Her footsteps . . . soft padded steps on the stone floor, leading off to his left. Hinges opening, small ones. Footsteps back to him. She took his hand, and placed a small odd shaped thing in it.<br>
<br>
He ran his thumb and forefinger over it. Exploring its contours. Metal with a stone of some sort. It seemed to have three section, the first being bulbous and larger than the others. An oblong smooth stone was set here. The second was smaller and had eight slender tendrils extending from it. Four on each side. Curved downward. Bent in kinks, it seemed. Each one ending with a needle sharp point. The last section seemed almost square, save for the small set of pincers at the end. They were closed, forming a loop. It was roughly the size of a coin. Easily fitting on the palm of his hand. An amulet. "What is this?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"A rare thing Rogue. You are probably familiar with the mask of the deceiver, correct?" she asked. Minz nodded. "The mask will make one look like a Tier 'Dal. But the illusion is just that, an illusion. The wearer is still the same, as he was when the mask was donned. This amulet is wholly different. When it is worn, your body will change physically. You will no longer be the half-breed that you are. You will have the blood of the respected race coursing through your veins. You will feel things as one of the respected race. You will taste things as we do. And," she paused for effect; "you will see things as we do."<br>
<br>
She took the amulet from his hand. And he heard her feeding a chain through the loop. He was dumbfounded by the entire situation. At a complete loss.<br>
<br>
Her hands were over his head.<br>
<br>
His mind whirled with the information he had taken in.<br>
<br>
The necklace slipped onto his neck.<br>
<br>
'Be a Tier 'Dal?' he thought<br>
<br>
Her slender fingers opened his shirt, allowing the amulet to rest against he bare skin. It was an odd sensation. He could swear it was moving some how.<br>
<br>
The pain shot into him like a flash. Eight needles embedding themselves deeply into his chest. He struggled to grasp at what ever it was assaulting him. But the bony hands and arms held him in check.<br>
<br>
His skin crawled.<br>
<br>
Bones cracked and protested<br>
<br>
Innards seemed to turn and shudder<br>
<br>
A moment of utter helplessness.<br>
<br>
Sight came flooding into his mind.<br>
<br>
She was there. Watching him. A grim smile of wicked satisfaction upon her lips.<br>
<br>
Something was different. He could see. But it was not the same. Things were clearer. Shadows gone. But also most of the color. As if every thing was tinted with gray.<br>
<br>
He caught sight of his hand. It was blue! Smaller and more nimble it seemed. His entire body was the blue of the tier 'dal. Skin smooth and silky to the touch. Lacking the leather quality that he had inherited from his father.<br>
<br>
And then he saw it. On his chest.<br>
<br>
A spider. Made of living steel. Sunk into his flesh. Its body flat against him. It seemed to dig into his skin. Burrowing itself into his very chest. The skin around it grafting itself to the arachnid. Its eyes stared at him in with an alien, insect stare. It wriggled slightly, settling further into his skin and bone.<br>
<br>
He shuddered visible. He could feel the spider in him. Its venom coursing through his arteries and veins. More than that, he could feel as the spider. Feeling what the spider itself felt. As if it was part of him.<br>
<br>
"It is done. You are free to go." The skeleton let him go of him. "Rhasine will escort you out when you are ready."<br>
