With dual wield/celtic dual you either have 3.5 delay or 2.2 delay between rounds. With left axe, the delay is 3.5 + 2.2 / 2 = 2.85.<br><br>With dual wield and celtic dual, using weapons with different speeds produces wildly erratic and unreliable results. With Left Axe, both the delay, and number of weapons you swing is consistent. Ignoring misses, you have a certain quality of combat guaranteed.<br><br>Dual wield/Celtic Dual is much less reliable. Sometimes a fight will go by with both weapons blazing. And other fights you'll never swing both weapons and you'll be using the slow delay the entire fight. It forces dual wield/celtic dual users to stick to weapons with similar delays; the slowest offhand delay a Nightshade can find is 2.6.<br><br>That kind of inconsistency is a risk... the rewards for the risk are the possibility of doing more damage. The penalty for those rewards are that dual wield isn't worth the points to spec high in.<br><br>That's why Left Axe is better. You know every fight how fast you'll be swinging, and how many weapons swing each round. And for short fights, which is most RvR fights, consistency leads to more kills and fewer deaths.<br><br> <p><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 80%; font-family: Verdana">Jalena!

The style guy at e3 couldn't say for sure, but he felt that the style bonus was factored in after the speed average, meaning there is no dps benefit from wielding a slow mainhand and fast offhand weapon with left axe.  we might as well wield 2 that are the same speed, so that our style bonus doesnt get shanked due to making the mainhands slower weapon have a smaller style damage per swing.<br><br>also, its been told from the start that dual wielders should wield 2 weapons of similar speeds to get the best results out of CD/DW.  nothing of the sort has been said about left axe, so it has all been pseudo testing that determines what speeds we should use.  also, styled attacks with CD/DW always make the mainhand swing, and styles are never not used, so it is much more controllable than you imply. <p><a href="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=38056&raceid=10&classid=44">Dither Disgustipated</a><BR>Kobold Shadowblade<BR><a href="http://www.sacredalliance.com">Sacred Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.palomides.net">Palomides</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umaiyasamsara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maiya Samsara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 11:44:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3437.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hard Numbers - DW/CD vs Leftaxe</span><hr size=1> Mythic should just take Left Axe out and give Midgard dual wield.

And consider the impact of tactical considerations (such as buffs) when making comparisons between styles.<br><br>Two very important factors are left out:<br><br>Firstly damage add spells or effects which are derived from a weapons 'base damage', and secondly style damage which is  also based on the 'base damage' of the weapon that swings.<br><br>A weapons base damage is taken from its 'level' and its delay (there are probably caps but I believe that the L51 weapons should do imperceptably more style damage on average).<br><br>Base damage takes 'adjusted delay' into consideration (hence the hulabaloo about haste spells reducing assassin damage a little while ago).  But if you swing with two weapons you apply damage add to each.  On a typical un styled attack DA is well over 1/3 of my total damage, with two semi-stacking DA spells the blue numbers can be equal to the yellow ones.<br><br>Next consider the effects of random left / right swings on style attacks.  Importantly this does not apply to PA which always swings the main hand due to the disastarous impact that random swing would have on this class defining attack.<br><br>Style damage is based on the weapon that swings so if I have a weapon with speed 2.3 and one with speed 3.4 both hasted a bit to say 2 and 3 seconds (Legion drops not withstanding) then one weapon has 50% more base damage than the other.  That means that it does 50% more style damage but firstly its using about the same ammount of end and secondly its taking time to deliver.  If I'm whacking someone with big hits from my super styles I want them to be taking big damage, LA guarantees that the big weapon with the big base damage gets the big bonus while half of the time with DW you apply your damage to a low base weapon.<br><br>e.g.<br>LA<br>300<br>40<br><br>300<br>40<br><br>300<br>miss<br><br>DW:<br>300<br>40<br><br>200<br>50<br><br>300<br>miss<br><br>Thats assuming the best situation weapon wise - a LA user can neglect the quality of their LA in favour of stats with little penalty - it wont be swininging for much less and the boost to main hand damage may make it worth while.<br><br>There is also an inacuracy in the calculations with regard to delay of weapon swings in DW/ CW.  you have an even chance to swing either weapon and the delay is taken as the delay of the weapon you swing, if you swing both weapons then the delay is the average delay.  On average this is the same as the delay being the average delay for both weapons but the reality is that if (25% of the time) I wait another second for the main hand to swing then I will loose (25%) more fights against casters and if I'm 'jousting' with a tank then I want to be able to time my runs: hit, move, turn, hit, move, turn, hit *not* hit, move, unsighted, turn, move, unsighted, turn, hit.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Between the massive impact of DA buffs and the consistant aplication of style damage to the superior weapon LA has vastly more potential to do harm.  It is, in addition, tacticaly superior.  All around LA is better and the only place it is slightly inferior is unstyled damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubaym.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baym</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/2/02 8:29:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3437.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hard Numbers - DW/CD vs Leftaxe</span><hr size=1> How can you possibly NOW say LA has vastly superior style damage when doublefrost has been reduced so significantly?

On example of this is infiltrators who can spec to level 50 in weapon (thrust) and will get higher weapon damage and a stun directly based off an evade.
