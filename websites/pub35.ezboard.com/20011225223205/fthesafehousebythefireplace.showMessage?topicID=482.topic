I was playing my (then) 12th lvl halfling druid, Iscin (Demarco) of Rallos Zek.  I am sharing the tale only with Safehousers because you are all dear to my heart (and I think you will like it).<br>
<br>
  The story begins with me waiting on the Freeport dock for the boat.  To my delight a beautiful blond woman walks up and begins to wait too.  Having nothing better to do I start hitting on her...saying things like &quot;I hear the beds are very warm in Kaladim&quot;.<br>
<br>
   She starts flirting back and things are going so smoothely I forget to get off the boat at Sister Island for a guild meeting.  We get off the boat and she has a gnome lad waiting there for her.  She starts talking to him and pretty much ignoring me.  Being the fickle sort I gate back to the dock to catch the next boat hoping I still catch some of the meeting.<br>
<br>
   A few minutes pass when the blond starts sending me tells asking where I am.  I tell her that I accidentally gated back.  She says she is sorry about the gnome but he is a friend of hers and there to make jewelry for her.  Then he started talking and she didn't want to just ignore him.  She was still interested in me but wouldn't want to abandon him.<br>
<br>
   My mind racing I strike upon an idea.  &quot;What about a threesome?&quot; I suggest.  We talk about it a little bit.  At some point she says she is not sure it will be fun. I /tell her &quot;You me and a gnome rolling around in bed...what could be more fun than that?&quot;.  But I forgot to use the /tell command and just say it aloud standing at the end of the Freeport dock.  Realizing my mistake I stop my medding and stand up to see if there was anyone in earshot.  Of course there was a dark elf woman sitting right next to me looking right at me.  She says &quot;Why the nerve!&quot; stands up and whacks me a couple times with her mace.  Two dark elf guys are standing behind her.  One of them says &quot;This little guy needs a nice cold bath&quot;.  They chased me into the ocean.  I was laughing so hard I almost drowned.  I apologized to the woman, regained my composure, pulled myself out of the water then waited for the boat again.<br>
<br>
  I arrived in Butcherblock and sent a /tell to the blond expecting her and her friend to be waiting in Kaladim.  But she tells me the friend left and she is waiting in Kelethin for me.  I had never been east of Ocean of tears before that day.  Nonetheless I told her to sit tight and that &quot;my love will lead me to you&quot;.  Now I needed directions.  Wanting quick results I shout out &quot;My love is in Kelethin and leaving soon can someone please tell me how to get there&quot;.  I got about 7 tells and took the one that sounded the most informed.<br>
<br>
   I got lost.<br>
<br>
   Then I happened upon a high elf and a wood elf Bard.  I told them &quot;Ladies I need your help!  I need to find my love in Kelethin!&quot;  They dropped what they were doing and started helping me immediately.  About 5 minutes later I send the blond a tell.  She is gone.  Either cold feet or linkdead.  Then I tell the two ladies helping me &quot;Hurry!  She will leave me forever if I am not there in 10 minutes&quot; just so I'd have an excuse.  True to form we all get lost.  When we finally arrive at Kelethin it's taken well over 10 minutes.  I collapse to the ground and start crying about my true love is gone forever.  This goes on for a good 5 minutes with both women comforting me.  Then the wood elf bard leaves to look for &quot;my beloved&quot;.  The high elf comforts me and says &quot;If she would leave you like that then she just is not good enough for you.&quot;  Then she gives me a silver rose engagement ring (something I never had seen before) and told me to &quot;give the ring to someone as special as I was&quot;.  Then she left.  <br>
<br>
   I started feeling guilty for all the fibs I told.  The Bard came back and started comforting me.  She told me that she too had lost someone special.  I suggested that maybe we could help each other through our sorrow.  I hadn't meant it in a romantic way but it was obvious that she had taken it that way.  She start stuttering through some words and gave me some long glances.  Then she said she had to go.  She walked past me so that my back was facing her as I walked away.  After about 30 seconds I rose and turned around.  She was just within view and watching me.  I ran up to her, fell into her arms and started kissing her passionately.  The kisses continued to get longer and longer.  Then some guy started watching us.  I suggested we find a more private room in Kelethin to continue our &quot;conversation&quot;.<br>
<br>
   I followed her all around the confusing city to a private room.  We sat down on the bed and started making out hot and heavy.  We were just about finished undressing each other when a voice echoed through the wall: &quot;We can hear you&quot;.  For some reason we continued.  Another 20 seconds later there was a long CREEEAK!  The door opened and there was a ranger.  His immediate response was to shout &quot;WITH A HALFLING!&quot;.   Then he proceeded over to the balcony and started puking his guts out.  Then he got out some wine and started washing his eyes with it.  We decided to leave.  As we left I noticed the building next to us was the KELETHIN BANK!!  There were 10-15 inside being quiet as church mice just to listen in on us.<br>
<br>
   Undaunted the Bard and I went to a truly private room and spent a wonderful evening together.<br>
<br>
   The next morning she was rather scared though.  She thought her father would kill her if he found she had made love out of wedlock.  Doing the natural thing I produced the ring her friend had given me and asked her to marry me.  She emphatically agreed.  We were both so happy.  Well at least through the morning.<br>
<br>
   In the afternoon she went off to tell her friends about the upcoming marriage.  She was gone a very long time.  I finally sent her a /tell asking where she was.  She said she could not married me because I was a womanizer and I had lied to her.  Even though one of those was true and the partially was I tried to assure her that she was my first love and I carefully said &quot;My feelings about you have been completely genuine&quot;.  (I didn't want to lie about not lying).  I asked her what proof she had about her allegations.  She told me that there was another name inscribed on the engagement ring.  Horrified I started searching the city for her.  A long time later I got another tell from her.  If I could return to the place we made love within 5 minutes we could talk about what happened.  If not I would never see her again.<br>
<br>
   I searched frantically but the city was a big maze on stilts.  In my rush I fell off a bridge nearly to my death.  It was hours before I awoke.  I healed myself and started to look for her again.  I finally found a man that said he had seen a woman of her description.  She climbed to the tallest point in the city.  Pulled off a ring and threw it into the depths.  Then she threw herself after it.<br>
I still searched and a few days later found the ring hanging from a low branch.  After that I gave up the search.  But I kept the ring as a remembrance of her.<br>
<br>
  &lt;the end&gt;<br>
<br>
   Hope you all enjoyed it.<br>
