A hit for Assasins...</span><hr size=1> Almost everyone is excited about the 1.52 armor resist impact and how its gonna effect the game by lengthing RvR battles. I had a few concerns, some just general concerns about the real impact of 1.52, and some about the impact to Assasins.<br><br>First, I am extremely excited that you will now be able to cure mezz. Its about time IMO, the only problem I can see is that the cure appears to be single target (why dont we have a group cure in the primary mez spec line i.e. Healers in midgard). The number one thing this is going to do is make battles more fierce, as you will now have less people mezzed (even more so those without purge).<br><br>Armor resists are being doubled, in a word.. Ouch. Not counting the fact that armor resists are being effected across the board, the words that bother me is this. The plan by Mythic is that they are trying to come up with a way to impact RvR and lengthen combat by opponents so that it is reflective of PvE. They are changing armor resist tables making all types of weapons impact evenly armors in each realm, but what I fear is that by lengthening combat, and doubling resists they will drastically lower an Assasins ability to survive combat (lets face it our armor is the second worse in the game just in front of caster cloth.. hehe I should know I play both). As well as impacting us by making our critical strike line even less effective at dealing out the up-front damage that makes assasins who they are.<br><br>Granted SOME of this can be countered by specing up env to compensate for the damage lost, but env is reisistable, and env is cureable/purgeable. Right now I can 2 shot casters, and 3 shot archers.. Taking more than 3 shots on any target, unless there are many other people around you is pure suicide as an assasin. Even pushing two shots unless your defending is risky.<br><br>So here is the real big question...<br><br>Has anyone who got copied (I havent yet), or plays on Pendragon noticed the impact on our classes, I would be most interested to know if we got more targets suseptible to our attacks, and weather our attacks are hitting for less damage.<br><br>If my targets drop down to one viable source for hit-and-run tactics (casters) then I may have to hang up the sword and go back to my Caster. At least armor isnt as much a facter when hes using his DD and AOE.<br><br>Bargle<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujablackhand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>J A  Blackhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.crewsman.homestead.com/files/Demon_Hunter.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/02 8:30:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3798.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tough call......</span><hr size=1> As the respec patch was removed for revemps I have yet to fully try it out but I will let you know what I find out when it's back on and up to full par.

Sorry but the fact of the matter is that you are expected to group more and more in this game.. Both in PvE and RvR you need to group.<br><br>Fights take longer, heals have more &quot;effect&quot; now with that, the days of two or three shotting by any class seems to be over...<br><br>Balanced groups are more important then ever..<br><br>Course this is a problem for assassin classes as they still do not offer much PvE and groups tend to turn them away. Well and good when you could solo RvR, but those days are gone..<br><br>Answer is to have certain less then group friendly classes (assassins, archers, cabalists etc) gets some PvE group love. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucougarpak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cougar Pak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/02 12:23:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3798.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.pakcafan.com/daoc/images/cougsig2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tough call......</span><hr size=1> Actually Mayl.

I mean, we've become weakass BMs with stealth and venom. The good thing about this patch is that they're offering respecs... I'll be taking all my points out of CS, and will be making a full Pierce/CD/Venoming shade :P tell you how it goes.. hehe. That way I'll be able to solo yellow con mobs.. hopefully.<br><br>&lt;sigh&gt; I mean, think about how people assassinate others in real life. They either go for the slip of the cyanide pill in the drink, knife in the back of the head, or with a sniper shot. Or simply walk in a room and shoot the guy, like Leon in The Professional :P they don't go up and bludgeon the guy to death over the course of 20 seconds. People complain that they die so fast when an assassin gets a PA off? YES, that's how it's supposed to work... idiots. Ah well, my warden's level 19.4 now!! Almost.. there.. gonna own pole-armsmen/two-hand wep tanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3798.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3798.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3798.topic&index=11><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3798.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3798.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3798.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3798.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
