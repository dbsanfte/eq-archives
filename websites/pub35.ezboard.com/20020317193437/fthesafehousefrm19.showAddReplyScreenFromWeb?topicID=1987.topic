Here's my post...<br>
<br>
Here is my opinion regarding shadowblade balance and a few solutions that would help.  As I only have experience with this rogue class, I do not mention hunters or our counterparts the infiltrators and nightshades.  Any ideas I toss out are not necessarily meant to be shadowblade only.  Any of them could be applied to these other classes as deemed appropriate.<br>
<br>
RvR:<br>
Most of our RvR problems lie in bugs or in basic problems with the RvR system that affect all classes, imo.  We can kill mages and archers over our level and have trouble with tank-types under our level.  This is how it should be.  Fix things such as pets seeing stealthed players, all AOE spells striking hidden players and the like and you will have eliminated a lot of our specific RvR problems.<br>
<br>
The one thing I would like to see added to our arsenal for RvR is for hidden crit strike styles to ignore armor altogether against opponents that are standing still.  The reasoning being that if you have a stationary target that was unaware of your attack until it struck them, you would be able to pick out a point of weakness in their armor such as a seam in their plate so as to minimize the effect their armor might have in absorbing the energy of your attack.  This simply gives us the opportunity to look for a scenario where we could have a better chance of success against tanks.  The edge would still lie with them in a fight.<br>
<br>
PvE:<br>
Our biggest problem is that we cannot fill any roll in a group that some other class cannot fill better.  In fact, we have only one thing we can contribute to a PvE group period, and that is damage output.  However, we cannot even provide that to any real degree without putting the group in danger.  If we ever do so much damage to where a mob starts beating on us, the healer will drain nearly all of their mana keeping us alive, at which point the mob becomes locked up on them and may result in a dead healer.  Therefore, the absolute last class anyone wants in their experience group is an infiltrator, shadowblade or nightshade.  If more melee damage output is needed, then any other melee class is more beneficial to the group as they are better equipped to handle the inevitable mob attention that results from that damage. <br>
<br>
I will list some assorted ideas as solutions to our PvE woes.   First, implement a de-aggro skill either as a style in the crit strike line or as a hotkeyable skill associated with stealth ala distraction.  It should be usable anytime as opposed to chaining off of other skills/styles.  We could then offer our one existing benefit to a PvE group more fully than we can now.<br>
<br>
Also, come up with other ways for rogue-types to contribute to group gameplay other than pure damage.  For example, revamp distraction to enable some modest crowd control abilities.  When a rogue targets a mob and then causes a distraction at a location, allow a reasonable chance that the mob will move to that location.  This would allow us to distract single mobs away from a group for more manageable pulls for either our selves while soloing or for a group.  There should also be a chance that we bungle the distraction and normal BAF code kicks in as if we attacked the mob we were trying to distract. <br>
<br>
Add some poisons that are useful to groups.  An attack speed debuff, for instance, or a stun poison that locks a mob up for a short time.  There are no doubt others that could be thought up.<br>
<br>
Add lockpicking/trap disarming to the stealth skill for all rogue-type classes.  Implement hunting areas where these skills will be usefull and or necessary.  Also consider making the chests generated by the BAF code true items that are locked (possibly trapped too) that must be lockpicked to retrieve the loot inside.  Let players carry these chests around with their associated space/weight problems or let them take a rogue type in their group so that they can open, loot and discard the chests as they drop.  <br>
<br>
Allow player corpses to be dragged by live players so that they could be rezzed in a safe location.  Allow rogue-classes to do this while sneaking without aggroing mobs (unless stealth were to drop, of course).  This might lead to groups looking for rogue types with some stealth skill to take along into deeper areas of dungeons where a wipeout would normally result in everyone having to release.<br>
<br>
Implement a spell for some caster class in each realm that allows them to teleport themselves and all members of their group within a certain radius of the caster to a location occupied by someone else in the group that is a reasonable distance away.  This would allow for a group's rogue to sneak ahead into hostile territory and then for the rest of the group to teleport to their location.  Instead of having to fight your way down to the bottom level of your dungeon, you simply let your rogue sneak in to a safe spot and then the group teleports to them.  Think of the RvR fun you could have with this as well.  The range for the teleport shouldn't be too far, just enough to be tactically usefull.  The group might also need to 'phase-in' to the teleport destination, being unable to attack or defend for say 10 seconds as they materialize at their new destination.  This should work on non-stealthed targets as well.<br>
<br>
To sum it all up, we are not far off balance in RvR but are largely imbalanced in PvE, imo.  I cannot count the times I have seen groups flagged as looking for players and been told that I couldn't join because I was a shadowblade.  As experience gain in this game post 20 is largely dependent on your ability to find groups, the criteria for balance being whether or not you can solo a blue mob effectively and a yellow mob with danger needs to be tossed out the window.  Instead, it should be whether or not your class provides some tangible benefit to a group so as to make you a desired if not absolutely necessary commodity.  Examining the class in this light, one can only come to the conclusion that we need some serious work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujaaxtherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaax the Rogue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 10:22:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1987.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Official rogue issues threads</span><hr size=1> posted:<br>

---------------------------<br>
Have a paladin in the group who can keep aggro with his heal chant, and you can do Perf Art, and Creeping death until you're blue in the face. No aggro, Lots of damage, healer is happy, GROUP is happy.<br>
Also. You ever use the level 18 thrusting skill, Tranquilize. It lowers a mob's aggro on you. And IT WORKS.<br>

----------------------------<br>
I like that idea. I hope we do get some more group friendly poisons.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I just have to mention. At level 40, I have NO problems getting into groups. And NEVER (to my memory, or knowledge) have I had someone not allow me to join a group simply because I am an infiltrator.<br>
<br>
Good day.<br>
