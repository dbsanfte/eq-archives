Some say u can snare/fear her but some say she can't be feared anymore.  Some say she has to be tashed before landing snare or any spells, while some players attest to being able to land snare on the first try.  Some say she agros the closest player on her agro list while people have said they have a kiter with melees beating on her w/o fear.... Can someone clear this up? Preferably someone who took part in her demise recently. Thanks<br>

As far as kiting her around and keeping her aggro on the kiter while melee beat her down, not sure, I didn't fight her that way. She is fairly easy to kill if you get a decent level tank (I had a 60 warrior with me), cleric to heal him, and enough extra damage to drop her. enchanter or shaman for haste/slow helps a lot as well. The 57 enchanter I had with me had no trouble landing a slow on her. Also, buff the melee with resist poison, it helps with resisting her proc. The warrior tanking for me resisted every one of her procs.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't want that to happen to you so take my advice and go with 2 full groups.  Have a 55+ tank with 120+ poison resist, a chanter to tash, slow, haste, and wizards lure spells work great.  Hope you have a high level cleric to keep the tank alive as well.  If your cleric (like our 60 cleric) doesn't actually heal anyone then you'll have a wipeout.  Of course, I was the last one alive (besides the non-agroed cleric) so I was running Renux around waiting for rezzes and my cable went out and I died and my corpse fell through the world and I gotta get in and petition it or have it summoned or something.  I'm just grumpy, take a couple groups and have the tanks and clerics carry the fight!<br>

Had a 53 warrior and a 60 cleric to heal.  Problem was cleric healed too soon or something tragic and was taken out fast.  The warrior followed shortly.  Luckily we had a druid along for the fight (level 46) that somehow managed to land a snare (after a lot of attempts) and kited her around until the rezes were done and we managed to get back in there.  High poison resist are key!  Once she starts hitting and you start spinning it is over.<br>

Buff as best as possible, PR is very important. If she actually hits someone her proc will get you killed fast with no cleric. Spawn Renux with casters at max distance. Tash, then snare, and then constantly dot+nuke her from VERY far away, while everyone else chases her around. She will likely bounce from one caster to the next, but as long as they are at a safe distance, and she is snared, that won't be a problem. Meleers have to manage aggro. A couple rogue friends are the best additions to the 2 classes I mentioned. Oh, and if you do this without a lot of heavy hitters, it's important to keep her dotted to hold down her regen, that can make the fight a great deal longer than it has to be. Me and another rogue (both 53) chased her around for almost 4 minutes because we weren't able to out damage her regen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That's about it, common sense can fill in any details I've left out.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uteramenor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teramenor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/28/01 7:01:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Renux</span><hr size=1> Snare kite her.<br>

My group was 6 people:<br>
- 54 druid with epic<br>
- 55 cleric<br>
- 52 rogue (me)<br>
- 53 rogue (friend)<br>
- 54 warrior<br>
- 50 enchanter<br>
<br>
I handed in the items and spawned Renux. Contrary to my fears, she was amiable to me and did not aggro on anyone until we attacked her. The very first thing we did was have the druid snare her, which stuck on the first try, and he chain-snared her. The druid never once lost aggro on her. Meanwhile the rest of us followed her around smacking her to death while she chased the druid. Took 10 minutes to kill her (she has a LOT of HP) but she never once hit anyone (except when I hit her from the front and she riposted on me, but didn't poison me thankfully).<br>
<br>
Everyone had SoW when we started, and it probably would have been safer to have the enchanter tash her first to help the druid out, but it didn't matter.<br>
<br>
Yes, Renux can spawn with higher-than-normal magic resist, but she is not immune to snare. SHE IS IMMUNE TO FEAR AND HAS BEEN SO SINCE JUNE 2001. DO NOT TRY TO FEAR HER.<br>
<br>
Also, Renux does NOT simply attack whoever's nearest. She has a hatelist just like any normal mob.<br>
<br>
I also have friends who did it with a 60 ranger, 58 enchanter, and 51 rogue (enc tashed, ranger snared, enc chain-tashed to keep aggro while ranger/rogue killed her).<br>
