My dad is an aspiring blacksmith, while my Mom passed away before I was born. I am training to become a noble defender of Kelethin. My dad always wanted to be a fighter.<br>
<br>
I guess that's why I chose this path for my life. Though my childhood dream was to journey into the depths of Norrath and discover new continents and lost treasure. I guess everyone has a dream at some point or another in their life. But in my opinion no one's dream ever comes true. Telkandore is the name of my best friend who just happens to be a young druid. He has tried to persuade me to follow him in his ways but I never had a thing with animals.<br>
<br>
Telkandore and I have had many adventures in the lower depths of Kelethin among the tree bottoms. One that I recall is a run in with the infamous Crushbone Orcs. We were enjoying our usual afternoon, playing tag, running about the treetop village, and trying our best no to harass the local inhabitants. When we came to a winding trail that lead off into the horizon, we just had to follow it. I mean, it was against our religion not to follow it! Well, as you can imagine, two @#%$y wood-elves are bound to get into trouble in a situation like this! Both of us soon came to the conclusion that we were lost when it started to get dark. Telkandore took out a very prized possession that was given to him by a fellow druid... A fire beetle's eye!<br>
<br>
He used this object to illuminate the path in front of us as we continued our shouts for help. Then we heard a few muffled grunts in the darkness, and we almost pissed our pants. Almost immediately three huge Orcs with a bluish skin color jumped out of the blackness and surrounded us. We were dead, or so I thought. Then a miracle happened. Three arrows were shot abruptly our way and pierced the nearest Orc's skull. Then two more landed in the second Orc's chest, which sent him tumbling to the ground. A man shrouded in mystery jumped out of the trees and beheaded the last orc. I was splattered with the blood of my enemies. Telkandore and I were escorted home by this savior from the trees. As soon as I walked into my house I saw my dad sulking in his chair. As soon as he saw me he ran and embraced me with his muscular arms.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;There is no need to, just make sure this youngster doesn't go near the Crushbone camp again,&quot; Mr. Dayspring solemnly replied.<br>
<br>
And with that, Mr. Dayspring swiftly vanished into the night...&quot;How could you ever do that to me! Wandering off, almost getting killed, I thought I lost you, just like your Mom,&quot; my dad screamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I, me and Telkandore, we just followed a trail, we wanted to see where it went,&quot; I pleaded with my father.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ugh, you are never to see that friend of yours again! All he has done is get you in trouble. And you are never allowed to leave the house again until I say so!&quot;, my Dad said sternly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate you! If Mom were here she would understand!&quot;, I shouted.<br>
<br>
After that last phrase I stormed off to my bedroom. I could here my dad crying in the other room, saying that he was a bad father and so on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Son,&quot; my dad was knocking on the door.<br>
<br>
I didn't answer and he opened the door to found me lying on my bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's something I want to tell you, I'm ashamed of myself for keeping this from you but I just couldn't gather up the nerve to tell anyone. I guess you could call me a coward,&quot; my dad said with a saddened voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mother, she didn't die in a peaceful way like I lead you to believe. She was an adventurer like yourself, always looking for a good time.<br>
<br>
That's why I married her, she had a fire in her eye's like no other girl had.<br>
<br>
Well, one day her looking for good times got her into trouble. Deep trouble.<br>
<br>
She was taking a vacation in Freeport when she saw a local baron lie his diamond encrusted sword on a table. Wait, before I go on with this story there is one more thing I have kept from you. Your mother, so beautiful, desired more from this land. That is why she joined the Kelethin guild of rogues. So, your mother, seeing this expensive weapon, decided that this was the perfect chance for her to practice her swift hands. She took the sword.<br>
<br>
Too filled up with excitement and adrenaline, that she didn't see the Baron was watching. She was caught. And hung the next day,&quot; My father finished the story with a tear trickling down his face. I stormed out of my house.<br>
<br>
I found Telkandore, and told him we were never ever coming back to Kelethin. He understood, just like the friend he is, and said that he would come with me where ever I might go. I quietly told him we would be going to Freeport. There I would be joining the rogues guild and he could find somewhere to practice his druidic powers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot;. He asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
And we were off.<br>
<br>
