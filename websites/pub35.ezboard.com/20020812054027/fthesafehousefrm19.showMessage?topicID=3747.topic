Our critical strike chain (Perf / CD / SS) used to do double what it does now, making fights shorter.   There used to be more selection in templates, other than the cookie cutter 39 cs 50 itemized envenom 50 stealth and whatever weapon / DW (SB got nerfed anyway, but we'll leave them to discuss the cookie cutter 5 spec or whatever that still works).  <br><br>Prior to 1.50, we could remove sentries in keeps.  We were able to scout without risk of an archer seeing us 10000 feet away.  We could attack somebody who was solo and not have to wonder if they have 2 self insta RA heals.  A 50 assassin could make a difference at a keep raid against uneducated defenders, or a group of lower levels.  Not that we could go clearing out a defended relic keep or anything, but we did have a defining role and were often coveted in keep raids.<br><br>now,<br><br>After 1.50 we have a large amounts of assassins(not just infiltrators either - although they do have the upper hand) who are meleeing tanks to death toe to toe, not by choice but by neccessity.  The RA's such as ignore pain, and the well over 60% damage reduction to the perf chain from epic armor has forced many to morph into something completely different than they used to be.  Virtually any template without lifebane will suffer serious hardship because of the massive melee nerf from epic armor, where melee is effected but envenom isnt - therefore forcing many into a lifebane cookie cutter template of sorts.  I know that 100% of the critblades on my server vanished overnight after the RA's and such went in.  Our perf damage is utterly pathetic, and does not even deserve to be in the critical strike line, as a matter of fact, i've been hit back by 1 handed weapons harder than i've perfed the person hitting me before.  This is all fine and stuff, except our role of killing fast and getting away is no longer feasible.  Even if we do whack somebody down before gettting mauled by 5 of thier friends, stuff like truesight prevents getaways.  Not talking about soloing either.   Before a large fight even begins, an archer can TS which will prevent us from using our abilities for the duration of the fight, turning us into a light tank with poison.<br><br>Used to be able to kill people at keep raids, but now with all the insta heals and added hp / damage absorbance, I cant say i've dropped anybody yellow con solo at a large keep raid in a good while.  The climb points are all known, people have better chances to detect us as we go up, the game has more insta mez and stun, and most of them can simply insta heal to 100% ignoring disease entirely, as well as purge the negative effects.  GTAE's make it so people no longer have to go to the ramparts to defend also.  Hell, im lucky if i can even get a group for keep raids now a days my role has shrunken soo much there.<br><br>With all the recent changes to the way rvr works, the damage reduction, longer battles, RA's, and changing roles, is it a safe assumption that our class is broken, broken as in we are no longer what we originally were intended to be?  Not gimped at all or anything, but just not working as intended.  Doubt we were designed for the long grueling toe to toe battles we have to participate in now, and a lot of people are complaining about how they lose to assassins toe to toe, ignorant of how the class has had to hybridize into a melee oriented stealth tank to remain viable.<br><br>Time for a fix? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usanlaildsnayel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanlail DSnayel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/15/02 4:48:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3747.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Doesn't reflect my experience at all</span><hr size=1> I've been in several keep raids recently with PC defenders as well as the standard bowmen on the walls.

Thats the 'vision', its not very complex but defending a keep is terific fun and attacking a defended keep is extreemly chalenging.<br><br>Melee charachters are not excelent in open battle - where there is no cover and no escape they have little to offer.  In keep battles attrition is central to the fight.  Assassins loose out from traditional tanks in that they are not good at taking the AoE damage but they win in their ability to strike from surprize and climb walls and debuff their target.<br><br>There are annoying bugs that need to be addressed (my peeve is pets on stealthers).<br><br>The extent to which assassins are cookie cutters is no more than the extent to which many classes are cookie cutters - RA seem to vary greatly from assassin to assassin. <br><br>Some classes are broken because they are too powerfull - Bards insta AoE mez is frustrating, enchanter pets and resist debuff are obscene. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udephtondisgustipated.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dephton Disgustipated</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/02 8:02:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3747.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: soooo is it safe to say we are a &quot;broken&quot; clas</span><hr size=1> people that continue to whine about dead horses such as pets attacking you while stealthed are the same ones that really have no grasp of what game balance is really about.  that is what basically lead to the game getting broken.  aiden hit the nail right on the head.<br><br>the draw of massively multiplayer online games is the interdependency of the classes and knowing that each class can fill a niche.<br><br>DAOC was already quite lax with class interdependancy to begin with, illustrated most significantly by Healers being crowd control as well as a healing class, Clerics being Damage Dealers as well as a Healing class, and Minstrels being a bard and an assassin class.  The ability of almost all classes to solo fairly efficiency also illustrated this well.<br><br>The recent game changes have slowly done even more to eliminate class interdependancy via Realm abilities and eliminating the defining skills of the few classes that stood out.  Tanks with heals, Tanks with dispell, etc all cater to solo rvr, not to Keep battles and large scale encounters.<br><br>Mythic has tried far to hard to cater to the vocal minority of the masses, assuming that was their core player base, when in reality the majority of their players fall into the silent but devoted area of the community.  These are the people they have lost as subscribers, but all the board whores at eqvault are super happy arent they?<br><br>Sometimes the spirit of the game is more important than making the vocal minority happy.  Brad McQuaid standing so firmly on so many potentially game breaking issues shortly after the release of EQ did a lot to keep the spirit of the game in tact, and even though they are a lot more lax now, that initial 'putting of the foot down' really made EQ what it is today - a very successful MMORPG with what looks to be a continuously strong future ahead of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usirsameth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SirSameth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/02 11:27:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3747.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Broken? </span><hr size=1> Tough call for me.

Not dissagreeing with anyone, just want to know what you guys think.  <br><br>Wont the proposed 35% rvr damage reduction help us?  I understand that our stealthed openers wont be nerfed so that the damage they do relative to other types of attacks will increase.  Also, lengthening battles should allow you to get the full benefit of your dot poisons.  People often complain that short fights only allow them to get only a few ticks out of their dots atm.  <br><br>Additionally, I understand that snare poison's effect takes time to scale up to the point where target really crawls.  Won't longer battles mean that if things look bad at the end of the fight the crippling poison you applied early on will have kicked in so you can get away easily?  Maybe hotkey another dotted weapon for a second round of dots and cut out?  <br><br>Also,  I hear a lot of high lvl assassins complaining about epic armor b/c it lowers damage target takes by alot.  Do assassins get the same benefit?  Are we more tankish in epic armor?  Wont this lengthen our toe-to-toe time?<br><br>Finally, doesn't lvl 50 and dodger 5 mean 50% chance to evade?  I would think in a long battle with plenty of evade opportunities we wont only get hit much less but also benefit from the high dmg, low endurance cost, stuns, etc. of evade styles so that our net damage output per fight should be even better.  <br><br>Basically, what I am saying is if RvR fights last longer we should reap benefits that other classes wont.
