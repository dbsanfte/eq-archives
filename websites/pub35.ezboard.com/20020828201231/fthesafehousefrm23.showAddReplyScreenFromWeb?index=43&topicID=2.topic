 ATTENTION: In game poison testing has started. <br>
Ahmed, a really cool Saracen Infiltrator, joined me in the cold waste lands of Odin's Gate a couple days ago. Though we are mortal enemies, we came together with a common goal, to figure out what our mystery poisons actually do to other beings. I myself have a 25 spec in poison and I am going all the way to 50 with it. Ahmed, he has a much lower spec in envenom, but, being the lab rat of our pair, he exclaimed often that he wished he had more spec in envenom. I felt terrible slashing him repeatedly while he stood there. Many times he evaded, I know it was just a the jitters from how bad my lil blade hurts, but he he stuck it through. The real irony of our meeting was when Demnos showed up at the end, a very quarky Hibernian Nightshade niether of us had invited. Ill tell you of Demnos' appearance at the end of this post. On to the results! <br>
<br>
We tested each poison at least twice, some 3 or 4 times. On each poison, an icon appeared on the victims screen. When right cliking this icon, you can see what poison is active in your bloodstream at that time. We tested all poisons availabe to a 25 envenom skill. <br>
<br>
Lets start with our snare poisons: <br>
Minor Imbalance duration 35 second - no real valuable slow down <br>
Lesser Imbalance - same as minor <br>
Major Imbalance - same as minor <br>
Greater Imbalance - same as minor <br>
Minor Crippling - 2 minute duration, slightly noticeable slow down <br>
<br>
Now on to our mysterious disease poisons: <br>
While Ahmed was infected and sitting, he did not naturally heal any hit points. We could not test whether or not it cut heal spells in half or not, but I believe it does. We did, however, discover that the disease poisons DO carry a slight str debuff to them, and we now believe, though its very hard to test, that they also carry a slight attack debuff with them. <br>
Minor Infectious - duration 1 minute, -9 to strength <br>
Lesser Infectious - duration 1 min 30 sec, -14 to strength <br>
<br>
How about those Damage Over Time (dot) poisons!?! <br>
Minor Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 9-11dmg <br>
Lesser Letha Poison did 5 tics of 10-13dmg <br>
Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 16-18dmg <br>
Major Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 17-22dmg <br>
Greater Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 22-26dmg <br>
Minor Lethal Venom did 5 tics of 26 to 31dmg <br>
<br>
Now for the big surprise of the poisons. I rarely used the weakening line of poisons because I did not see much use for them in personal use. But, according to our good victim Ahmed, they really put the ripple effect in cripple. <br>
Minor Weakness 20 pt str loss, 1 minute duration <br>
Lesser Weakness 27 pt str loss, 1 min duration <br>
Major Weakness 37 pt str loss, 1 min dura <br>
Greater Weakness 47 pt str loss, 1 min dura <br>
Minor Enervating 62pt str loss, 8pt con loss, 320hp loss, 1 min dur <br>
Second attempt on Minor Evervating caused different results: <br>
41pt str loss, 41pt con loss, 210hp loss, 1 min dura <br>
So, the enervating line really purts the hurt on tanks. It steals their mighty strenght and their valuable version of power called endurance. Watch that duration, though, they get it all back if they are not dead before the 1 minute is up. <br>
<br>
It was NOT easy testing all these. It was a LOT of fun, though. Special thanks to Ahmed for helping me out. I look forward to meeting you to test other rogue things on, especially our higher up poisons. Anyone still curious about Demnos? hehe. That little bugger! <br>
<br>
Well, Ahmed and I had JUST finished testing. We both had gotten comfortable with each other and were lax about not using stealth. All I will say is, we were inside a structure that protected us from the cold elements of Odin's Gate. The room we were in had windows. I was chilling there, arranging some poisons to test in combinations on Ahmed while he was sitting and recovering from a very painful Minor Enervating + Minor Lethal Venom combo, when suddenly he dies. I glance up from my backpack thinking maybe the dot had killed him, but to my surprise I see a tiny dark figure jump out of one of the windows! It was freaky! I didnt know anyone could get in and out of those windows! But a Lurikeen sure can! I tried to squeeze my lil kobold body out of it in pursuit, but he got away. I knew he had seen me. He though he was the cat, haha, but little did he know, he was the mouse. I chased him stealthed all over that wall while he looked for me. At the right patient moment, I let fly a nasty envenomed trio of blades into his backside. He crumpled before he even knew what hit him. Little bass terd. I hope we can meet again, I salute his wondeful style! <br>
<br>
Thanks to Ahmed <br>
Salute to Demnos <br>
