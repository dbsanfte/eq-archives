Indoors, you would probably be the master, almost as much so as those who have honed the skill all their lives in all enviornments (Read: Rangers, Druids, Bards, in that order).<br>
<br>
From a coding perspective though, it would make the most sense to give you near full tracking in your home zones and limited but existant in other dungeons and cities.  But then we'd have to be realistic, maybe you were only in Keladim for a few levels and havent returned since.  How can that be coded.. you dont really know those zones, do you?   Or maybe they're known like the back of your hand, or hilt of your dagger.  How can you even that out.  Maybe you know Neriak better than Keladim (And you're a dorf).<br>
<br>
Coding wise, it's not very easily done, I'd say.  Logical and probably worth a /feedback form, but I wouldnt see it being coded in for a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 9:24:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23090.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/~shadowcross/clip.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tracking</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> From a coding perspective though, it would make the most sense to give you near full tracking in your home zones and limited but existant in other dungeons and cities.

<br>
Well, the same would apply to rangers, druids and bard then too.<br>
Haven't been in GFay for ages? Well, reduced tracking then...<br>
<br>
Seriously, once you learned how to read tracks in a certain environment (outside &amp; nature for rangers, druids &amp; bards), you can apply that knowledge to basically any comparable region, no matter where it is.<br>
<br>
So rangers should be able to excellently track outsides and still quite well indoors.<br>
Rogues should be able to track indoors quite well, but not outside. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upatofnaud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>patofnaud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 9:29:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23090.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tracking</span><hr size=1> All stupid class envy snide remarks aside,,,<br>
<br>
Ranger are masters at tracking. Period. No one is taking saying to take that away so just chill.<br>
<br>
Druids can track &quot;ok&quot;. But they can't compete with Rangers.<br>
<br>
I have always thought that Rogues should have the ability to track PEOPLE. No NPC's, no Animals, no color coded how far away and last spawned type of interface, just PEOPLE. And cap it at 50 skill to restrict it to pretty much line of sight. And allow you to track INVIZ/HIDDEN people.<br>
<br>
We are stalking assassins. We find our target and put a dagger in it's back.<br>
<br>
It would not be taking anything from Druids or Rangers, it would not make us any more valuable in a group. It would be a toy. A bone. A fun skill when your party zones and you being the hidden, sneaking, slug could tell where they went. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In PvP it would give more of an edge to rogues, but if you remove all con data that edge would be minimal. More of a proximity alert than anything else. <p><body lang=EN-US style='tab-interval:.5in'>

This is reasonable but what you also must understand is that while verant chose not (or was unable) to implement all the the classic thieving skills, they decided to give EQ rogues completely new skills to compensate for it.  How many D&amp;D campaigns have you heard of where the thief is consistently the primary damage dealer of the party?  This is not the role of the thief, they are a class that tends to shirk away from direct combat, and are experts at scouting and information gathering skills whether in a city or a dungeon.  They rely on steath, cunning, and manipulation.  Also playing a thief in D&amp;D usually requires more intelligence and creativity than playing other classes.<br>
<br>
Theives combat skills (especially attacks per round) advance much slower than fighters and the fighter hybirds.  Infact, they advance at the same rate as the bard.  So from a realism point of view it makes no sense that EQ rogues should have double attack.  For people wanting EQ rogues to be more like traditional rogues, here is a solution:  no more double attack skill, and add all the traditional theif skills that are missing.  This would include some form of tracking and a skill that will allow rogues to recieve more information about mobs or people that they consider (after all, theives are an information gathering class)  this could include a more defined level range, and noticing some strengths or weaknesses of the mob (all from right clicking a mob). (this would help with the thiefs role as scout)  Also verant could make pick locks and disarm traps a more necessary skill in day to day playing.<br>
<br>
These changes would defiently put the EQ rogue closer to the traditional rogue.  But how many rogues would give up double attack?  Not many I would imagine.  Sadly, most people are more concerned with the power of their class rather than the realism. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kokopelli>Kokopelli</A> at: 4/4/02 10:25:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ucalyxto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calyxto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 1:51:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23090.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tracking</span><hr size=1> Given that Tracking is widely considered the class defining skill for Rangers, I think it would be a bad idea to start giving it to more classes.

Druids? Don't they have track?<br>

<br>
Rangers already get a crippled version of our sneak. Why could we not have a crippled version of track?<br>
<br>
Hiding while sneaking is FULL funtionality of our skill. Not a crippled functionality so granting that in return for CRIPPLED track is not a fair trade off. I could see if Rogue got FULL tracking, then hell yeah Ranger should be pissed because that DOES infringe on their class defining ability.<br>
<br>
If all a rogue could track were PEOPLE ONLY and within say 200 yds, how would that devalue the rangers skill?<br>
<br>
I may be naive, do Rangers get asked to track down people within 200yds that often?<br>
<br>
Again, remember this is just a discussion about a rogue suggestion to add a rogue skill. This is NOT a lets take from Rangers or nerf them discussion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umortok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mortok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 7:15:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23090.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tracking</span><hr size=1> Ask a druid if he has the range and tools associated with Tracking like a ranger   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And yes I have been asked, paid and begged to track down mobs for people.  It is so nice to be able to click up Track and know that a rare spawn is up and guide yourself exactly to him.  Even little things about Track are nice such as tracking to a person or NPC that you know is near the place you need to go.  Ever lose someone (or a raid party for that matter)... just track that person and BAM you are back to the group/raid.  Do you hate /loc as much as most of the people out there?  Hey soandso we are at loc n1200 n10 come find us... bah!<br>
<br>
I played a monk alt up to 53 and the one thing I really miss is Tracking.  I literally can see the entire zone. <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1466" target="profile">Mortok Swiftarrow</a></b><br>

With the rogue version being limited to humanoids and players while the ranger version works with all types of mobs.  Both however would use a much smaller radius than track making it essentially useless for tracking anything around a zone.  Its more about an awareness of your environment.  Its called stalk.<br>
<br>
<br>
STALK<br>
<br>
Limitations- very short distance, only registers humanoid mobs and players (for rogues).<br>
<br>
As an example of the distances involved you should be able to clearly see your target if you know where to look if they are within stalk range if you have an unobstructed line of sight.   Part of the fun of it of course is when you DO have an obstructed line of sight and you are able to hear your target comming around a corner for example. Very rogueish imo.<br>
<br>
It should be lvl 40 for rogues imo to make a semi dull period of a rogues career (lack of new toys) more interesting.  Rangers may have it at 30.<br>
<br>
It comes in 3 different forms.<br>
/stalk<br>
/stalk all<br>
/stalk name<br>
<br>
/stalk off should clear your settings<br>
<br>
/STALK<br>
<br>
MSG-&quot;You peer silently around you taking in your suroundings&quot;<br>
<br>
/stalk with no target given should &quot;listen&quot; to the immediate area and list people very near to you. Useful if you don't want a lot of spam but want to do a quick check.<br>
<br>
/STALK ALL<br>
<br>
MSG- &quot;You become more alert&quot;<br>
<br>
/stalk all should cause you to list all humanoids and players who enter your stalk radius as they pass through.  Good for pulling and watching your suroundings. Should by default ignore anyone grouped with you.  Could get spammy around a lot of people. Thus the other 2 ways to use it.<br>
<br>
/STALK NAME<br>
<br>
MSG- pkwiz00 is on your &quot;list&quot;.<br>
<br>
/stalk pkwiz00<br>
<br>
/stalk drolvarg<br>
<br>
/stalk guard<br>
<br>
(personally I would like /stalk &quot;guildname&quot; for pvp purposes but its not absolutely needed) For example,  &quot;You hear blart of flowers of happiness behind you and to the right!&quot;<br>
<br>
The command would look for a full or partial match to the name given (in other words a drolvarge sentry and guard hammersmith should both be picked up) within a VERY short area.  You should get a warning in red when the person in question enters your stalk radius.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Very rougish imo and it isn't useful for finding anything or anybody anywhere the way track is. It however could...<br>
<br>
Give you a way to maintain an awareness of nearby mobs when there might be wanderers near.<br>
<br>
Be useful in avoiding adds and mistakes when pulling (note you couldn't really use it to find a target to pull because of distance)<br>
<br>
Give you an awareness of nearby players in a pvp environment.  Wont let you track them down though as the range is too short.  Though if you get close enough to their location you may well be able to determine where they are. Example... ah the sob is behind that rock!<br>
<br>
In short its a way to add an interesting skill to the toolsets of both rogues and rangers.  It would compliment track (which should be fixed to not be so easily bugged in pvp) surely but not replace it in any single instance where its useful or fun.<br>
<br>
It would add a lot of flavor to the world and its something to give the rogue class next expansion other than more dps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 8:49:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23090.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tracking</span><hr size=1> I would like a simple /track <target> command.  Basically, you start tracking something, but you have to choose the thing yourself... representing an assassin's ability to know the target ahead of time.  You couldn't just click up a window and see what's about, but you could search for specific things in the zone.  And only at high level... this is the ability of a scout, or an assassin, not your common street thug.  Perhaps as an AA, that would work well.<br>
