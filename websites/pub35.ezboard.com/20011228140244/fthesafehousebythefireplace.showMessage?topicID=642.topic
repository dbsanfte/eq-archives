Where had all that cash gone?  He muttered, polishing off his elenteenth short beer.  &quot;I shwerar I had enuf for anoder one. He slurred to the bartender.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hit the road Minz.  You've had enough alright.&quot;  The innkeep sneered.<br>
<br>
Minz staggered out of the bar, clumsilly pulling his jacket abour him as the cold wind bit into him.   The streets were pretty much deserted.  Snow blew about as the cold air whipped in from the sea.  Painting a sheen of ice across the streets.<br>
<br>
Ahead of him Minz saw two ruffians mugging a young elf.  Beating the elf far beyond what was necessay.  They had the money, all they were doing now was being cruel.<br>
<br>
&quot;HEY!!&quot;  Minz shouted  &quot;WHAT THE BRELL IS GOING ON?&quot;<br>
<br>
The ruffin's eyes bolted to Minz.  Daggers drawn.  One pulled back, holding their captive infront of him with his blade held at the elfs throat.  While the other cautiously edged forward, two blades drawn.  &quot;Gitcha from here.  This's no o' your bisness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz tossed his gloves with a flick of his wrist and dropped his daggers into his hands.  &quot;You've gotcher loot.  Leave him be.&quot;  The ruffian was within he reach.  Minz steadied himself, crsing the fact he'd drank too much.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on boy.&quot; He sneered at Minz.  &quot;does ya think you can take the both of us??&quot;  And he lashed out a hand toward Minz's abdomin.  <br>
<br>
Minz wrapped his arm around his assailants over extended arm and rolled around the attack.  Placing a stiff elbow to the bastards nose and kicking his legs out from under him.<br>
<br>
The ass feel hard, but whirled on his back, sweeping Minz's own legs from the icy surface of the ground.  He fell back, rolling in the snow, and popping up into a defensive crouch.  His erstwhile attcker had backed to his companion's side.  He could see now that their hostage was a young girl.  Minz cautiosly moved forward, dropping a dagger in its sheath and holding his left hand out.  &quot;Come on,  you've got whatcha come for, let her go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You want her??&quot; the elder of the two snarled.  Grabbing her by the hair  &quot;You can have her!&quot;  And he hurled her forward.  Minz darted forward to prevent her from falling to further injury.  <br>
<br>
But he moved too quick, slipping on the slick stone path.  <br>
<br>
Falling back hard and seeing the young girl fall atop him.  <br>
<br>
Her scream filled his ears.<br>
<br>
Her eyes wide with agony and fear.<br>
<br>
Her face drawn into a tight mask of death.<br>
<br>
He felt a warm liquid caot his right hand, and he knew that she had fllen on his dagger.  She fell limp on his shoulder, exhaling a final breath like a cloud into the frigid air. <br>
<br>
&quot;HEELPPP!&quot;  Minz yelled as he rolled her off, pulling his dagger from he chest.  Not thinking who or where he was.  &quot;HHELLP!!!  PLEASEE  SOME ONE HHEELLP!!&quot;<br>
<br>
A clatter arose from around the corner.  Heavily booted footsteps sounded helps arrival.  Minz sighed, hoping a caster among them.  Starting as Freeports finest ran towards him.  He looked at his hand; bloodstained; dagger still held tightly.  And spun quickly to run the other way.<br>
<br>
WWHHUMMP<br>
<br>
A blunt force seemed to bash him hard, forcing him up against the wall.  He was dazed, eyes trying to focus on the bronze infront of him.  &quot;Noww who do we have here??&quot;  The voice sneered.<br>

A tightly bared window high in the wall faced directly out on the ocean.  Briny frost blew in as the wind gusted outside.  Minz was stripped from the waist up.  And wore only canvass pants.  The Freeport militia had been quick and efficient about disarming him.  Tossing him to the hard stone path and yanking most of his gear from his body.  Sparing no accidental jab or kick in the process.<br>
<br>
They hadn't recognized him at first, that the gods.<br>
<br>
Otherwise he prolly wouldn't have made it to the cell alive.<br>
<br>
He shivered, huddling on the corner.  He'd given them an alias:  Kic Kinurbutt.  The idiots bought it.<br>
<br>
STOMP STOMP STOMP<br>
<br>
Guards <br>
<br>
&quot;KIC KINURBUTT!!  Off your arse&quot;<br>
<br>
The guards lumbered in, kicked him a few times and hauled him up, dragging him roughly from his cell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nicthe boots? Minz slurred through a bloodied mouth.  ?New recruits, thank the gods,&quot; he thought.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Colonel Bledsoe wants ta see ya!  Bastard!  Yaoughta wish it was just my boots that ya be facin.&quot;<br>
<br>
The trio laughed viscously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bledstho?&quot; he asked<br>
<br>
&quot;Oohhhh?  You  met him 'afore?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea,&quot; Minz spat blood, sneering.  &quot;Friend o' the family.&quot;  Minz was greeted with an armored elbow to his face at this comment.<br>
<br>
When things came back in focus, he was being thrown into a chair.<br>
<br>
SSHHMMACKK<br>
<br>
&quot;WAKE UP BOY!&quot;<br>
<br>
SSHHMMAACK<br>
<br>
His hands were bound behind him.<br>
<br>
In front of him was a massive desk, plain in its construction, and heavily scored with age.  Behind it sat a middle aged man.  The resemblance to the Adjudicator Minz had murdered was unmistakable.   He had the same mannerisms too.  Making a show out of moving from behind his desk to stand directly over Minz.  <br>
<br>
How scowled and softened a bit.  Holding a file in his hand, glancing at it and then back to him.  &quot;You're in a lot of trouble her son.&quot; He said in fatherly tone.  &quot;Do you know what you're accused of?&quot;  Minz nodded.  &quot;They say you claim to have been trying to save the girl from two thugs?  Is this true?&quot;  Minz nodded again.  &quot;Well . . . where are these thugs?&quot; he said spreading his arms wide to emphasize his question.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know sthir.  They pusthed the girl at me and ran.&quot;  Minz said.<br>
<br>
Bledsoe turned, pacing with his hands behind his back towards a window.  &quot;And just disapeared?  Into the night like ghosts?&quot; He said, still facing the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesth sir.&quot;  Minz coughed hard, clotted blood filling his mouth.  His side ached with a sharp pain each time he inhaled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Convenient, don't you think?&quot; Bledsoe intoned smoothly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
The colonel snapped about.  His eyes hard as stone, driving into Minz.  &quot;Convenient THAT they just DISAPEARED!&quot;  Softening again. &quot;And all we have is your word.  Your word AND&quot; he took three quick steps and was towering over Minz  <br>
<br>
&quot;YOUR knife in the girl AND <br>
<br>
her blood on YOUR HANDS AND <br>
<br>
YOU TRYING TO ESCAPE!!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Bledsoe leaned back, sitting on the edge of his desk.  The fatherly voice again.  &quot;I mean what am I to think?  The town demands justice.  Convince me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir?&quot;  Minz asked<br>
<br>
&quot;Convince me that there were two thugs.&quot; Bledsoe continued.  &quot;That you were trying to help.  That you didn't kill the girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir.  It was my dagger in the girl.&quot;  Bledsoe raised an eyebrow inquisitively.  &quot;And my hand that held it.  But I had no intention of killing her.&quot;  Minz let his head drop, resting his chin on his chest.  The visage of shock on the girl's face haunted him.  He shivered slightly.  &quot;I was leaving the bar.  I had had a few rounds there, and was heading to the hostel.  To rest for the eve.&quot;<br>
Bledsoe interjected &quot;And you saw the pair?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The three of them sir.&quot; Bledsoe nodded.  &quot;The had her purse, and were  . . .  well  . . . I think they were going to take more than just her money.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And YYOOUU  VALIANTLY STEPPED IN?&quot;   YOU?RE A COMMON THIEF??&quot;  his voice boomed.  &quot;Were you after YOUR CUT?&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz looked up.  &quot;Its true I'm a thief by training.  But I'm an honorable adventurer.  I have a wife and a child on the way.  A girl I hope, to take after her mot . . . &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AN HONORABLE THIEF??&quot;  Bledsoe laughed at the idea.  &quot;And your wife is what?  A pious whore??&quot;  Minz snarled, lurching forward in his chair.  Bledsoe laughed callously.  &quot;Get this piece of trash out of here!!  You'll be lucky that you die as quickly as your victim!&quot;<br>

Minz took a step forward, and forund himself falling head over heals down the narrow stine staircase.  The impression of a steel gloved hand still tingling on his back.  Dashed and aching he felt himself bodily lifted by his arms.  <br>
<br>
The rope binding he wrists behind his back bit into his skin<br>
<br>
Shoulder wrenched unwillingly in directions they didn?t want to travel.  His bare feet dragging behind him against the rough stone<br>
<br>
The guard quite literally threw him back into his cell.  Dashing his face against the wall.  Minz stood up wearily, spitting a broken tooth from his mouth.  Wiping his bloodied lip on his shoulder.  The gaurds had been kind enough to leave his hands bound.<br>
<br>
The cold bit in to him.  The gaurds laughed outside.  &quot;The gallows for him fer sure.&quot;  Night was falling outside.  The lil bit of light that flowed through his window had faded to nothing.  &quot;You better give him a banket or somthin,&quot; one cackled.  &quot;Wouldn't want him to die before he's sentanced!&quot;  More laughter erupted from the hall.  No blankets came.<br>
<br>
Minz huddled against the corner of the small cell.  Pulling his knees to his chest and slipping his hands under his feet.  Holding himself close.  Shivering.<br>
<br>
The wind howled . . .<br>
<br>
A desolate winter's song<br>
<br>
The stone walls leeched the last bit of warmth from his body. . . <br>
<br>
Trying to stay awake . . .<br>
<br>
Blackness pressed his eye lids down . . .<br>
<br>
His last thoughts were of Orrianna and their unborn child <br>

Orrianna searched franticly for her husband. He had been missing for two days now. The last he was seen was at local bar. He had been celebrating again. Drinking too much.<br>
Worry ceased her brow as she rested against the Temple of Marr caressing the buldge of her stomach.. She tired easily these days. Their child sapping much of her strength. She knew her sister's godfather and his wife were somewhere in Freeport. Chyenne had told her this is were they had choosen to make their home. Why someone would choose such a god forsaken place was beyond her. There was no trees, no grass.. just baked earth and sand..<br>
&quot;Ppppsssttttt&quot; The sound broke the meloncoly. Her hand slipped quickly into her cloak fingering a dagger hidden in its trim. &quot;Ppppsssttttt&quot; Slowly she located the source of the sound. A young street urchin hid in the shadows. She motioned for the ranger to come closer. &quot;Ma'am. Ya be the one lookin for ere missin husband?&quot;<br>
Loosening her grip on the daggers hilt. Orri nodded moving closer to the girl. &quot;Aye, I'm looking for word of Minz.&quot; she replied in a hushed voice. The child eyed her warily.&quot;What it worth ta ya?&quot;she spat. Orri let a plat fall toward the ground so if anyone watched it would looke like she was giving alms to the child. The coin was gone before it reached the ground. &quot;Kic Kinurbutt is in the Milia house.&quot; the girl called as she blended into the shadows and disappeared. &quot;WAIT! Who's....&quot; the ranger's voice drifted off to nothingness. The informant was gone.<br>
'Kic Kinurbutt? Well it did have that his ring to it' Awkardly she made her way to the room they shared. Half hoping for some sign of his return, but it was just as she left it this morning. Sighing she settled into a rocking chair, it's rythem helping to ease the ache in her back and worry from her mind as she drifted into a troubled sleep.<br>

The priest walked quickly through the streets of Freeport. The cold was part of it, damn cold for February, but he wasn't really comfortable here. Oh, he s'posed it was his home city and all - after all, Her temple was here - but to him a city could never be home. Home was the Commonlands, a little shack near the water, where he'd lived, alone, for most of his 40 plus years. He could get around here now, but he didn't have to like it. The smell, the press of people... and those damn militia men, swaggerin' around like they owned the place!<br>
<br>
Well, damn it they did, of course. He knew that even as far out as he'd been, fishin' for a living on the lake. The militia out there weren't TOO bad, they did roust their behinds once in a while and beat down the odd orc or bandit or what-have-ya... but these city guards did nothin' but shake down the folks they were s'posed to protect, and if they decided they didn't like you...<br>
<br>
He didn't like bein' away from his ward this way. She only knew what trouble Rachaella'd get into in the meantime. He'd left the wood elf girl at the bard guild, talkin' shop with the other folks there... he hoped she'd have the sense to stay put, for a change. Even so, he wasn't gonna piddle around; those militia boys didn't like seein' him around here much either.<br>
<br>
Here was the spot. Couple years ago, he'd never've noticed the spot - gods above and below, he'd been in enough bloody fights, before... but that was like another life ago. Damn, it WAS another life ago, ever since She... well, anyway, he could find the spot, now, almost like he knew where the fish were hidin'. Right there. Girl had died there, scared, alone, knowin' she was gonna die and nothin' she could do about it. He'd never had much to do with women, 'till She came along; not that much now, really, 'cept for the wood elf, and that wasnt' much by choice, but it still wasn't right. Man that'd scare a girl that way needed to be losin' body parts, slowly.<br>
<br>
Thing was, the one that killed wasn't the one... that much he knew. The shock and grief were so strong, almost as strong as the girl's, like fish left in the sun too long. He didn't have to guess what happened next he'd seen that part when he and his ward'd come into town. Damn militia had grabbed up the one and let the rest go, even knowin' he didn't do it on purpose. Not even carin', really, and THAT was the worst crime.<br>
<br>
He knew where they'd've taken him. He knew where he'd be goin', too. Sighing heavily, he thought for a second how this priest stuff was alot of damn trouble, always gettin' involved... but it was what She wanted, and he knew he'd do anything for Her, no matter. He checked his equipment, and headed back west... to the militia house.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Darjon, yer gonna be in it deep, this time.<br>

 Blackness surrounded him. <br>
<br>
 It was dreamless sleep. <br>
<br>
 More like unconsciousness than anything <br>
<br>
 Suddenly he was yanked upwards. <br>
<br>
 Propelled forward without. <br>
<br>
 Sounds and voices bounced about him. <br>
<br>
 Cold air slapped against his naked chest. Consciousness was immediate. <br>
<br>
 His hands were still bound in front of him. <br>
<br>
 It was just before dawn. The glimmers of the sun were just painting pink and orange streaks across the eastern<br>
 sky. A great purple veil slowly being pulled back from the domed ceiling of Norrath. <br>
<br>
 He shivered uncontrollably. The winter wind biting into him like Vox's breath. His sole item of clothing, a pair of<br>
 shredded pants, offered no comfort. <br>
<br>
 Bledsoe marched ahead of him through the empty streets. His crisp military uniform, unmistakable. Torchlight<br>
 glimmered off brass medals on his shoulders. &quot;This is your last day Elandril. Your last day among living.&quot; The<br>
 mention of his name was like a slap in the face. <br>
<br>
 There were only thee there. Bledsoe and two others. Guards. This was not an official act it seemed. No drum. No<br>
 crowds. No honor guard or banners waved. <br>
<br>
 He had finally gained his feat, and now stepped as much as he could, in time with the guards. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Corporal Mistookya owes his promotion to recognizing you.&quot; The guard on his left grinned at him. Minz smirked as<br>
 best he could. &quot;And I knew cousin Bevis wouldn't want to miss this hanging.&quot; The guard on his right spat in his<br>
 face. The spittle dripped down from his eye brow, rolling over his cheek. <br>
<br>
 Minz shook his head in disgust. <br>
<br>
 The reached the gallows. <br>
<br>
 The noose hung ominously. A coating of ice made it glimmer in the first morning light. <br>
<br>
 Bled so led the party up the steps. <br>
<br>
 Ice covered the entire structure. Bledsoe kicked at the trap door. Making sure the hatch would drop as it should <br>
<br>
 The two guards pushed him up the steps. And held him in place over &quot;deaths door.&quot; Bledsoe whacked the rope<br>
 with a baton. Shards of ice rained down on him. Bledsoe sneered at the sight, as he gently slid the noose over<br>
 Minz?s neck. &quot;I've waited a long time for this Elandril. A long time.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Minz glanced at the two guards. Mistookya was tall. More than a head taller than Minz. The heavy cloak he wore<br>
 hid all other details. Cousin Bevis was stocky like The adjudicator and the colonel. <br>
<br>
 The colonel nodded at Bevis, who let go of Minz. Mistookya stepped behind the rogue, and the unmistakable<br>
 sound of a sword being drawn floated across the gallows. Bledsoe stood directly in front of him. Even free of his<br>
 bonds, just out of reach. <br>
<br>
 Bevis strode down the steps, taking his place at the lever which would open the trap door, sending him into a St.<br>
 Vitas dance. Wrapping his gloved hands on the frosted wood. <br>
<br>
 All Minz could think of was Orri. Orri and their baby, who'd never know her father. <br>
<br>
 Bevis's eyes were locked on Bledsoe. <br>
<br>
 The colonel raised an arm aloft. His eyes burrowed into Minz's  <p>Minz Elandril<BR>

                                       RE: A cold day in . . . <br>
<br>
 Her patience had paid off. The malitia paid little attention to the begger huddled against the cold. From where<br>
 she cowered, Orri watched the soldiers march past. Their prisoner drug between them. Anger warmed her as she<br>
 camo'd herself stalking the quartet. The creature stirred in the back of her mind pushing against her control,<br>
 using her anger to fuel it's escape attempt. A small thud against her stomach reinforced her determination, but<br>
 cooled her temper. Anger would not help Minz. She needed to think clearly, logicly. She could not win a hand to<br>
 hand combat in her condition against one, let alone against three. <br>
 Something tugged at her tattered cloak. Instantly the child was in her grasp, a dagger at her throat, mouth<br>
 covered. For an instant the girl's eyes widened in shock, then she bit hard. Muttering the ranger let her go.<br>
 &quot;Chyenne! What do you think you're doing?&quot;she hissed. <br>
 &quot;Well I was playing hide and seek with Gairren and overheard that someone was looking for her husband, Minz. So<br>
 I found ya.&quot; Chy pipped as she followed her sister down the alley <br>
 &quot;Be stil child&quot;Orri retorted.&quot;They're heading toward the gallows. I have to....&quot; Gasping she leaned agaist a wall,<br>
 her face paling. &quot;No! It's too soon. ....&quot; A strong feeling of discomfort rippled through her. &quot;hurry Chy.&quot;. <br>
<br>
 Bledsoe was testing the gallows as the sisters arrived. Orri's mind swirled with panic .as the next contraction hit.<br>
 A warm liquid spilled down her leg. Chy's muffled voice helped to steady her thoughts. &quot;uhm Orri? You ok?&quot; <br>
 &quot;I'll be better once we get Minz.&quot; <br>
 Chyenne was already chanting as the lead guard slipped a noose around Minz's neck. The stockier of the two<br>
 underlings' eyes glazed over as if in a drunken stupor. The tall one stood behind Minz, his sword drawn. the<br>
 leader stood at the trap door's release lever a smirk on his face. A stronger wave of discomfort danced across<br>
 her senses almost to the point of pain, distracting her attention. <br>
 Chy gently shook her shoulder. &quot;Do you have your bow?&quot; Orri nodded. &quot;Good. You take the tall one out when you<br>
 see the signal&quot; <br>
 &quot;What?&quot;Orri searched around but her sister was gone. &quot;Damn it Chyenne&quot; Unslinging her bow, the ranger took aim<br>
 at the guard. If nothing else, Chy's signal should be obvious. <br>

<br>
 His arm snapped down <br>
<br>
 Minz squeesed his eyes shut <br>
<br>
 And a clank of stuborn frozen wood snapped in the air. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Nothing <br>
<br>
 Minz opened his eyes to see the wide furious eyes of Blesoe staring back at him. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Corporol!&quot; <br>
<br>
 Mistookya stepped around from behind him and started down the stairs, <br>
 slipping and falling hard on his rump. <br>
<br>
 That was all he needed. <br>
<br>
 Minz kicked his legs up. First one and then the other, wrapping <br>
 them about Bledsoe's neck. Arching back on the noose, feeling it <br>
 tighten around his neck. Bledsoe grabed for them, but it was too <br>
 late. Minz threw his sholders, twisting hard. The loud SNAP told <br>
 him that Bledsoe's neck had broken. He slumped to the ground. <br>
 Minz fell hard too, the rope getting tighter and tighter. <br>
<br>
 Mistookya raced up the stair, sword drawn, arready held high readied <br>
 for a deadly slash. Minz reached up, grasping the rope above his <br>
 head, swinging back, to avoid the silvery arch. <br>
<br>
 FFFFFFFTTT <br>
<br>
 An aroow suddenly appeard in Mistookya's chest. <br>
<br>
 A second <br>
<br>
 He satggered back. Fear and pain lit his eyes from behind like touches. <br>
<br>
 A third impaled his throat. <br>
<br>
 Cousin Bevis bellowed an alrm, diving for cover as arrows fell in him. Stabbing his leg. <br>
<br>
 A loud clatter announced the opening of the trap door below. Jutting <br>
 his legs down, he found purchase on the platform. But he was stretched, <br>
 off balance and pretty much defensless. <br>
<br>
 Reaching high, The rogue grabbed the rope and swung his legs up, wrapping them around the cord. Hauling<br>
 himself up. Wrapping his legs around the beam.  Hanging upside down and praying he wouldn't slip. A hanging it would be then. <br>
<br>
 He wrenched at the noose. <br>
<br>
 Arrows flew at Bevis, who continued to yell. <br>
<br>
 The town was waking up. <br>

<br>
A heavy blanket draped across his shoulders, and his beautiful wife clung to his arm.<br>
<br>
His legs hadn't slipped, and his neck remained, thankfully unbroken.<br>
<br>
Chy handed him a cup of something.  &quot;Drink!  It'll make ya better&quot; she said in her lilting girlish voice.   <br>
<br>
Orrianna's arrow had found its mark..  Killing the &quot;cousin&quot; with a single shaft.<br>
<br>
The drink smelled bitter and earthy.  Prolly dirt tea or something.  Minz took a sip.  Cringing at the bitter and gritty taste.  &quot;DRINK IT!&quot; she demanded, stomping her  little feet as an exclamation.  <br>
<br>
Chy had scampered up the platform, hacking at the rope and helping Minz down as best she could.  Orri sat gasping as their baby made sure she knew who was in charge<br>
<br>
Minz downed to concoction in a big gulp, passing it over his tongue as rapidly as he could.  &quot;Good.  Now I just hope the herbs and stuff in Kunark work the same way as the do at home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;HOPE?&quot; Minz sputtered.  <br>
<br>
Figuring a run through the common lands would be expected, and tough with a pregnant wife, they skulked through the city, hopping the boat to Butcher Block and then to Firona Vie.  A place where his face was unknown.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ssshhhhhh Love.&quot;  Orri whispered in his ear, &quot;Rest.  You need to rest.&quot;  She pulled him close.  Placing his hand on her belly.  A small wave seemed to wash across it.  Minz looked up in alarm.  &quot;She's just playing hon.  Its OK.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SHE???&quot;  he stammered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Minz. She.  We're going to have a daughter.&quot;  Her smile was sweet and beautiful and . . .  he could find words to describe it.  She caressed his cheek gently.  Minz felt himself melt at her touch.  Kissing his wife tenderly.  Ignoring Chy's snickering<br>
<br>
Minz threw an extra few logs on the fire and they curled up to sleep.  Orri lay on her side, and Minz cuddled up behind her, resting his arm across her belly, caressing their soon to arrive daughter.  She seemed to doze of immediately.  'She is a strong woman, but this is taking a heavy toll on her' he though.<br>
<br>
So much had changed.  <br>
<br>
A father?  He was going to be a father.<br>
<br>
He had faced death.  Closer than he had ever been.<br>
<br>
But to be sonear that final breath, and in such closeness to a new life.  <br>
<br>
His daughter . . . <br>
<br>
It shoke himto the core of his being.  That he might have missed his daughter.<br>
<br>
What would she be like?  Ohh let her get her mother's sensibilities.  Not her father's.<br>
<br>
The Dragons had been torn asunder.  <br>
<br>
And he now stood as their leader.  <br>
<br>
So many had left . . . <br>
<br>
Brave souls and good friends.<br>
<br>
Many had told him to disband the guild.  To let it die . . . <br>
<br>
. . . he would not<br>
<br>
. . . could not. . .<br>
<br>
For those that remained, <br>
<br>
those that chose to weather the storm <br>
<br>
For the courage and perseverance they have shown<br>
<br>
He would honor them. <br>
<br>
For they are Dragons.  <br>
<br>
A heaviness seemed to settle about him.  Not that of weariness.  Nor guilt nor shame.  It was  . . .  responsibility.  <br>
<br>
He was no longer carefree.  <br>
<br>
Oohhh, he had a wife, but she was strong enough to take care of herself. He giggled to himself, remembering how it was usually SHE saving HIM.  But, now he had a family.  A beautiful baby girl would soon rush into his life.  <br>
<br>
And he had the Dragons to lead.  Their honor to uphold.  Orri, Settes, Tardain, Magnia, Legadas, Rettsu and so many others were looking to him to sail their family through this storm and into the shimmering ocean beyond.  To build the bonds that have been stretched so far.  And to heal the wound that still sting from salt flung up by waves of spite and anger.<br>
Could he do it?<br>
<br>
Was he worthy of such an honor?<br>
<br>
Self-doubt assaulted him.<br>
<br>
Orrianna sighed softly, cuddling close, nestling into him.  She complained some nights that he was too hot, putting off to much heat from his body.  That some fire within him burned to fiercely for its own good.  But tonight she needed it.  <br>
<br>
'Tonight,' he thought.  'Many might need it.'<br>
