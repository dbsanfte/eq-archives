My notes on tbe quest is:<br>
Burning Priest~ 3-7 hours each camp, and 1 showed up on the 6th day I was there. He's roughly every 33 mins and has a PH. Me and another guild there were trying to figure out the spawn time. They were lucky enough to get it in every 5 hours, until the other day they had to wait around 17hours I think.<br>
Thought Leeches~ killed about 12 of them and it dropped the brain.<br>
Umbrous Toilers~ 1st day camp 7-8hrs, no charcoal. 2nd day camp, 6 hrs and a group that was also doing toilers did a shout that there was 1, went to loot it, but alas it was giving me a message that I can't loot the corpse yet. I kept right clicking it.. but .. it poofed!! Bug? 1.5hours later after that, one dropped .. woohoo!!<br>
<br>
Up to last part of the quest now, 3 fights and I get the shield. Can't wait :)<br>

16 Tormented Vashir Skulls(8 for each of us) - 12hours total in Tenebrous<br>
2 SunRay Amulets from Scarlett Desert - 6 total hours of camping the spawn, but my shaman friend and I spent 3 days there duo'ing thru 54 together with me bot'ing my cleric on my other pc.<br>
2 Thought Leech Brains - 5 hours total in Mons Letalis<br>
2 Black Flame Charcoal - 3 hours total in Maidens eye<br>

26 total hours to get all the drops for 2 shields. Just have to get a couple friends together for the fights.<br>

Question.... When you hand in the stuff to the quest NPC's do they despawn? Or can we do multiple hand-ins one right after another?<br>

<br>
Here's what I've noticed (verify please.. I could be wrong).  There is an 8 spawn cycle which for me (at least for the part I started checking on) consisted of:<br>
<br>
1.  grol baku soldier<br>
2.  darkwing bat<br>
3.  grol baku soldier<br>
4.  grol baku soldier<br>
5.  darkwing bat<br>
6.  darkwing bat<br>
7.  TORMENTED Vah Shir Skeleton<br>
8.  darkwing bat<br>
<br>
The only thing that seemed to vary was #7, which was sometimes the skelly and sometimes another spawn which I took to be the skelly's placeholder.  You'd have to kill them all, but at least you'd have an idea of when one might pop.<br>
<br>
I'm a shaman so I set up the cat detector van (my pet Woofie) out ahead of me (maybe 10 feet in real terms) as I sat with my back to the wall.  Unless one of the spawns on the cycle was up, Woofie was facing out watching sonic wolves and other irrelevant stuff.  When there was a pop, I could tell where it was from which direction he was facing.  If he was facing me, the spawn was inside the wall and I could get ready for it.<br>
<br>
If you draw a line from about 2 feet out from the wall and maybe 20 feet along its length (real terms.. you'll know what I mean when you camp it) to the outer edge of the tree, the spawn area is anywhere behind the wall-tree line and in front of zone edge, including inside or over the tree and inside the wall.  The pet helps here, because he'll be essentially facing backwards, away from the other normal zone spawns.<br>
<br>
Btw, the 4th F9 view is very helpful here so you can see the whole area including your dog and yourself.  On one occasion, the cat popped up nearly next to the tree and almost wandered away before I caught him<br>
<br>
It took approximately 12 hours to collect 8 skulls, so the time estimate is fairly accurate.<br>

Once for me and once for a shaman guildie.<br>
<br>
The 8 skeletons that spawned were light blue to my 58 cleric and the 55 warrior there helping us. The issue is that with 8 of them the damage they do can add up if you don't have either a kiter or an enchanter. I would estimate their level in the 38-43 range (rough estimate). With an enchanter this is a fairly trivial fight... AE mez one group and then single mez the other targets. Throw in root to hold down the AE mez'd mobs so the enchanter can single mez then when it wears out.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for us, we didn't have a kiter/snarer or an enchanter. It was 58 cleric (me), 55 warrior, and 55 shaman. The first spawned 8 skelly fight was tough, the shaman got aggrod when the skellies spawned and took a dirt nap after I dumped 2.5 blues worth of heals on him. We did manage to take all 8 skellies down but by the end of the fight the warrior was at 1.5 bubs of health and I had been OOM for quite a while. The second time we spawned the courier and 8 skellies it went much better. The shaman and I waited outside the hedge wall while the warrior (with shaman DS potion) killed the courier. We didn't move in until I had to cast the first CH on the warrior by which time he had generated a pretty healthy dose of aggro. Shaman went in DoT'ing the mobs while I used my Tunare root necklace to keep them in place.<br>
<br>
The 2nd turn-in fight was easy with a cleric/shaman/warrior.. just make sure your tank engages the Possessed Grimling first since he is immune to changes in speed (no snare or root).. the 3 undead grimlings are easily rootable... and you will notice if your not on top of them when they spawn that the pathing inside the outpost is horrific so you may be cunning enough to use that to your advantage.. /shrug<br>
<br>
the 3rd turn-in fight is a simple lvl 50 single mob spawn (shaman mob)... went down super easy both times we did him.<br>
<br>
hope that helps...<br>

<br>
Tormented do spawn in the corner near grimling mines very close to the Katta wall. PH were Grol Baku Soldiers and Darkwing bats. The PH spawn very close to wall and wander away but do return. Other mobs wander nearby but not into the corner. The GB soldiers were dropping acrylia and gems about 50% of the time. Spawn time is around 6 mins. Once you manage to find first PH rest are easy. You can get 2 or more tormented to pop after each other so no set sequence to PH. Have seen tormented on far side of zone so they may also wander or pop in multiple locations. Most of the time they pop in wall and they will agro on you if you are next to wall. If no mob pops after 6 min you have a tormented in the wall and should try and agro him.<br>
<br>
The 8 reanimated skeletons are light blue to 54 (probably level 35ish) and are a very easy fight if done correctly<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
They can be solo pulled...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The  only trick is to make sure that you kill the courier away from castle and that no player is nearby eg. root dot. I tried this first time but my tank (55 warrior) didnt understand my very clear instruction that I would kill it with dot and he had to be out of agro range - basically he raced in to deliver killing blow. In the ensuing 8 mob fight 2 mobs despawned when HP low and there was no player nearby. This can happen easily if the fight takes a while due to the bad pathing that also makes quad kiting tough near the zone. Result -  6 skulls after 30 min fight most of which was spent with both of us under 1 bubble of health.<br>
<br>
2nd time I had support from 41 bard 39 warrior 40 rogue with a 41 cleric on standby and only slightly used in fight) The tanks listened to instructions and when skellis popped with no players nearby they wandered off towards castle - only needing 2 I harmonied the group and snared the 2 I needed. The rest stopped between grass gateway to castle and stayed spawned. Killed the 2 easily and pulled more - not even sure that harmony was needed - pulled last 2 solo with snare well after harmony should have worn off. I do believe I could solo this portion as the mobs didnt seem to despawn with time and are easily snared/rooted/kited etc. The key is to be OUT OF AGRO RANGE when the courier is killed and to pull from a distance. At most a lev 40 tank is needed if you do this right. Result 10 min fight most of fight at near full health for all players and all quest items gotten.<br>

Druid Solution for 2nd part<br>
<br>
Soloed Burning Priest as a 54 dru.<br>
Charmed pet hopper from near bottom of ramp (cheetah would be better) told him to attack priest at spawn spot to avoid gating - then Wing death, Drones of Doom followed by scoriae until he was low on health and then multiple casts of the 3 druid outdoor stun spells. Pet survived as did I with 2 blue of mana. No gates or complete heal went off. <br>
<br>
May have been lucky with the C Heals but tried this earlier and it seemed to work until I got attacked by another player (Guild:Sanctimony  Average age:12) and had to tell my pet to attack player and try to kite mob myself. In the end I wasted too much mana on the player and new pets to keep the player busy instead of mob - Priest was on zero health but not dead and I was OOM - priest gated and healed. Without player interference it would have been an easy kill also.

Thought leach brain was easy: snare thought leach, run out of cave, snare stonegrabber (an animal for some reason - probably a bug) charm the grabber onto thought leach. 6 thought leach kills (and 6 grabber kills)in 30-40 min max and had my brain.<br>
<br>
200-300 Toilers in group and solo play(approx 40 hours) and my Flame charcoal dropped. Dropped from toiler near lake. Killed lots of toilers by charming spectral wolf (10K HP and dual attack for 140-150 makes a nice pet) Used call of karana to charm after debuffing with glamour of tunare -20 magic). Charm lasts from 6 secs to a full 10 min. Even managed to kill a yellow scout by agro kiting it with flame lick while pet smashed it. Root/dot works nicely also but it is a slower kill rate.<br>
<br>
Only place I have heard of Flame charcoal dropping is near lake - need more info on this urgently. Unfortunately very hard to get a pet near lake but it can be done with high risk of getting a train.<br>
<br>
Multiple drops of centi weapons, str of grodan (rotted as noone in zone wanted it), idol, caster sleeves etc and decent XP meant this camp wasnt too bad despite the time. About half my kills were near UP zone a quarter near DP zone and quarter near lake and about 20 in AR. Next time I will stick to lake.<br>
<br>
Well now I am ready for last 2 fights - just hope they dont nerf it in tonights patch or I will be a little upset ....<br>
After completing quest I will post a walk thru on Guild website with locs and any further info not given here that seems relevant (and a link from here)<br>
<br>
Big thank you for all the info given here previously. Good luck getting your shields cause I smell a nerf coming on once it is well known - dont complain about the rarity of flame charcoal - its probably the only thing that can save this from the nerf brothers.<br>

<br>
Been working on this quest kinda half-assed for about a month now.  I'm getting pretty close to getting it done.<br>
<br>
Got my Black Flame charcoal earlier today.  I've spent hours and hours at Toiler hill (the hill on the zone wall near the big building) with no luck.  Nice drops there, but no charcoal.  Went to AR zone to fight today..  2 Charcoals in 2 hours.  Perhaps that is the place?  Perhaps i was just lucky.  Dunno.<br>
