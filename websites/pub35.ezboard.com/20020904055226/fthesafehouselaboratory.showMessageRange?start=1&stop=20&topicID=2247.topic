Another idea</span><hr size=1>   Ok it has clearly been established that verant will not mess with the poison code to allow stackable poisons or poisons with multiple charges. Fine. But how about making the components more easy to obtain in large quantities, especially at higher levels. Items that summon stacks of the different types of poison vials, suspensions and component can be added to the game as rare drops off of certain mobs. The higher level the poison that is made with the components the higher level the monster is that drops the item. An item that summons stacks of regular poison vials  could be a rare drop off of hill giants. Whereas an item that summons seal poison could be a rare drop off of trak or naggy. An item that that summons stacks of spider venom could drop off a newly added crag spider mini boss, which could be an ultra rare spawn in EC. While an item that summons skorpiko venom could be a rare drop off of Cazic Thule.  Unless your on a PvP server in generally seems like rogues just do not bother with poison that much. I am level 60 have 205 make poison skill and yet I hardly ever use it. But the reason people don't bother with it is because verant refuses, after 3 years !!! to make the changes needed to make poison practical. It is ridiculous that at my level I can't even use level one poisons routinely  without screwing around for hours and hours each week farming components. It is an insult to rogues and an embarassment to verant programmers that they have not addressed this problem. I hope someone there sees this post and thinks about this idea.<br>
<br>
Also how about AA skill that increases the potency of poisons made.<br>

Yet, it doesn't mean anything...as noted, it takes forever to get the things you need for your various poisons.  And you'd better have all ten slot containers in your bank AND on your char. for all the various skin types (if you're like me and make your own vials), and the components themselves.<br>

What do I know though...I guess I'm just another &quot;whiny&quot; rogue huh?<br>

It's so simple, just takes adding a few more recipies to the database for the mortar/pestle, and a few items in the item database.<br>
<br>
Make 5 of poison X normally.<br>
Stick all 5 in the pestle, combine, get an expendable item similar to a harvest crystal, but with each charge summoning a poison vial of poison X.  Bingo, you have (almost) made poisons stack.<br>
<br>
The problem with this is, a) its not a true solution, b) it requires someone to go code ?70? new items, and the same number of recipies, and Summon_item002 spell effects.<br>

i don't know about the summons poisons really. but poisons with 10 charges is a must. not sure how shammies do it with their bearskin bag, but if you could make a 10-charge poison by just combining 10 x components as you create the poison it'd be GREAT. would definitely make me keep components farmed and keep them in my backpacks.<br>

and DAMMIT, make poisons last full duration when they land! In pvp, even when I land a poison, they last 0-10 seconds tops. so lame. on real PVP servers the duration should be nerfed to 50% though, to make it fair (blind = very powerful). <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21797">Veteran Prodigious</a><br>

<br>
combine 5 1shots = 5shot<br>
combine 4 5shots = 20shot<br>
<br>
After all, it's all in what you define to be the components.<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally have changed my mind regarding this, I think AA skills may be the easier way for them to do it (code-wise at least).  Just have a class AA skill (Everful Poison, for the sake of argument) for 9 or 12 points or whatever that causes you never to _expend_ a poison on apply; so once a rogue with that aa skill gets his hands on a system shock 3 or whatever for his cache, he never needs to farm it again, unless he gives/sells the poison to another.  To be fair, maybe make said rogue have to have 200 apply skill for this ability to work perfectly, and be prepared to consider that this may be 'too powerful' for DD poisons as they exist now.<br>
<br>
Note this wouldn't allow 2 salts and some vendor trash to make an endless supply of mind melts for guilds farming ring 9 because the poison is never 'applied.'  Note also that with Poison Mastery enchanced apply times (a currently existing and currently worthless AA skill) and an infinite supply of mind melt, that a determined poisoner could do a LOT of damage.  It's an overall reduction in melee output, so it's a tradeoff, but a smart poisoner would also time his stabs, making it a net increase.  We, IMHO, do *NOT* need any form of melee or damage power increase.  We're FINE with our damage, we just want to be a little more... diverse.<br>
<br>
Second major thing I'd do is nerf all the DD poisons, add some more debuff type poisons to flesh out tier IV and V (and possibly create Tier VI), put a minimum time on all of them that's directly tied to the Apply Skill, and a resist rate tied to the Tier of the poison.  And yes, Tier VI is possible, while keeping 250 max skill still; by simply giving them a suitably high resist rate at 250 skill and taking advantage of the existing AA skill to keep failed combines at a sane level; say give em 90% failure rate at 250 skill, make the components painful, and assume anyone that's even thinking about creating these has both Poison Mastery, and the Everful Poison I mentioned.<br>
<br>
Third major thing is instead of farm greens, put all these poison components on hard or dangerous to reach vendors; for much the same cost as the shaman potion ingredients, or even more; when you know someone will only have to do it once and he'll have it forever, you can make it a pretty hefty moneysink.  Hard or dangerous such as...A vendor in PoM, a vendor in hateplane, a vendor *IN* the dark elf cabin in kithicor, vendors spawned by quests, an undead vendor wearing concrete overshoes at the bottom of OOT or timorous deep.  Stuff like that.  For the tier IV and up at least.  Maybe more in dungeons like kaesora, nurga or najena for the 20-50 rogues working with tier 1-3 who want to do this instead of farm farm farm.  On second thought, I suppose even I wouldn't mind farming greens for poison components if it was something I would only have to do once.  But imposible vendors is MY pet idea and I really like it.<br>
<br>
Or, if I had my way, I'd completely scrap all existing poisons, all existing poison effects, and rebuild them from scratch in my own image.  Up to and including any quests involving poison.  (besides, Mind Melt was always a stupid name for a contact poison--it sounds like it should have been a manadrain). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/3/02 11:54:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2247.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yup</span><hr size=1> reusable vials that start at trivial 220 pottery skill for the normal poison vial (reusable) to 250 pottery skill(with a BD velium bracer style still a chance to fail) for sealed poison vial (reusable).  Then when you combined with these it would come out as a new type of poison to the game engine with same effect and same name cept reusable vial in name.  When you applied with this new type of poison it would give you the vial back.<br>
<br>
 Also i would change the combines with a reusable vial so they didnt use suspensions.  Abuse of poisons is covered by the rarity/cost of components.  Taking out half/all the cost for bought/farmed components just makes them more usuable but not abusable.<br>
<br>
<br>
this solves the saleback problem cause its a new item to the game.  it could also have a 1cp resale value to a vendor because of that.  <br>
<br>
The high pottery skill is on purpose.  it would also give trade skill potters a high end profitable item to sale.  And it should be a vial made with expensive components and a high trivial.  These are designed to be in high end players hand where the poison effect is hardly unbalancing.  <br>

Currently sealed trivs out at 188, make the regular reusable vial triv at 195 then 5 points more for each type. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><body lang=EN-US style='tab-interval:.5in'>

Another idea</span><hr size=1> First, a disclaimer for my following post: this is a bit of an angry post, but not at the rogue community, or any of its members, but rather at Verant themselves...for all but ignoring this issue for 3 years, so if I say something about a topic similar to one of your ideas posted here, don't take it personally  It's not aimed at you.<br>
<br>
Second, some quick background. I, like many of you, have been rogueing around since before poisons were in game. Played a rogue exclusively ever since, and still do. While the &quot;great poison patch&quot; did help us in several ways, there are still some key points that, although mentioned by VI several times, have YET to be addressed properly. This is the key to my anger...shoddy customer service. No other service industry I can think of would still have this many customers with this blatant lack of interest in what their customers wanted. Would you still be going to McDonalds if, after three years of paying them, they STILL didn't have French Fries on the menu? Or would you still pay your dry cleaner every week if he consistently lost articles of your clothing and ignored your pleas to shape up? I think not.<br>
<br>
That said, here is my semii-annual rant on poison:<br>
<br>
In (my) order of importance:<br>
<br>
Fix interruptions. You did it once but somehow F'd it up again...put it back the way it was until just recently.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Screw farming. <br>
There is no other &quot;tradeskill&quot; in the game that takes the amount of time/effort yet yields so little gain than poison. Alchemy, almost 100% storebought and makes a valuable end product. Jewelry, can go from 0 to 250 while sitting at 1 vendor in a single zone, and again, end product is worth something. For that matter, unless I'm mistaken, jewelcraft can be done like this without ever having to combine more than TWO items (gem+metal) There are others that can be maxxed (from 1 to 200/250) at a single vendor as well. Yes, tailoring, blacksmithing, baking tend to be a pain to raise, but the chance of selling a tailored/smithed/baked item is MUCH higher than selling a poison. Honestly, other than Mind Melt for 9th rings how many of you have actually sold a poison? For a profit or break-even?<br>
<br>
I demand that the overwhelming majority of these components be available on vendors spread across the EQ world in proportion to shaman alchemy vendors. Similar to alchemy in quantity, price, accessibility, and selection. Don't make me beg for a port to West Karana to talk to Gilidin Toxfodder since he's the ONLY vendor to sell HIS stock of components. This is stupid. It is this nonsensical, useless added downtime that I'm frankly sick of. Does a shaman that wants to make SoW potions have to go to a specific single zone that is different if he wants to make ITU potions? Dumb Verant, give up on the timesink.  Can you imagine the uproar if peridot's were made drop-only off of level 30 and under mobs across the EQ world?  Or worse yet, only in specific zones?  What about metal bars being drop-only off of greens?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Screw Non-stacking.<br>
Normally, I have 12 backpack slots devoted to nothing but poison. 3 stacks each of 2 components, vials, suspensions. Why? *sigh* Those 12 slots are enough to make 60 poisons of that type. I make them one at a time, apply directly prior to battle, and hope they don't get interrupted or resisted. Again, why do I do this? Because you, Verant, won't address this situation as important to your customers. You have claimed that coding won't allow for any useful type of stacking, but we have all sited countless examples contradicting your claims. Shaman potions, alcohol, harvest crystals and other summon/stackable items, food, water, charged tinkered items....COME ON...get with the program and learn your own game please.<br>
<br>
I demand a 10slot pestle and mortar in which either 5 or 10 of the same poisons can be combined into a 5 or 10shot poison. Alternatively, a summon-charged-item can be made instead of a regular vial of poison, but I still would like the pestle to be 10slot, since a 40% reduction in carrying capacity for that container generally sucks.<br>
<br>
Example: 1vial+1susp+ingredients1, 2, 3 in 10slot pestleNmortar yields Poison1 (just like normal)<br>
5 Poison1's in PnM yields a single poison with 5 charges of summon Poison1<br>
Same for 10 Poison1's in PnM yielding a 10 charge summon Poison1 item<br>
<br>
Using this math, let's look at the benefits to space. 1 stack each of vial, suspension, ingredient 1 and 2 is 4 slots used. This equates into 2 10-shot stackables. This is a 50% savings of space, and honestly, I don't see any balance reason not to allow this.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Make them useful on raids and high end content.<br>
Take a hard look at resistances on high end mobs with the highest tier poisons. Totally out of balance if you ask me. Consider the time/effort involved to get my skill to a point that I could even make/apply this Tier IV or V poison. For this effort alone, I should be given more than a 0.1% chance of landing this poison. Other than the VERY rare (fluke?) successful landing of any poison on an &quot;uber&quot; mob, poisons are useless in the high end game. Use some of your new Luclin coding to make a mob under a certain level immune to certain poisons. Or do it the other way around and make the POISON ONLY usable on mobs OVER a certain level. Don't tell me you can't do things like this based on level. You can do it with spells and buffs(try to put KEI on a level 1), you can do it with combat and abilities (try to assassinate a level 60), you can do it with items (try to wield Narandi's lance if you're not level 55+), you can do it with effects (BST fungi tunic on a lvl 10 twink has no regen), so WHY can't you do it with poisons? My suspicion is that you CAN, but WON'T and HAVEN'T.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
At this point, I could go on and on about little things, or some of my specific ideas to help out, but I won't. I've ranted my rant, and I've aired my dirty laundry. I've b|tched and moaned yet again, in the vain attempt to feel like the company that I pay for a service cares about its customers. Nay, I shall cease this rant here, saying only that if even SOME of my aforementioned suggestions are implemented, I will be much happier with the clusterf8ck that is poison (and very surprised as well)<br>
