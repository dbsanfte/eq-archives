<br>
<br>
It's a great game....*ONLY* if you take your time.<br>
<br>
<br>
The high end game is boring as can be.  The uber zones they added are well..boring.  I found EQ's to be more entertaining.  Maybe it was just the addiction speaking, maybe it was something else.<br>
<br>
As for AO - I'd rate it above DAoC in it's current state.<br>
<br>
<br>
AO only has missions, pvp, and the leveling thing.  I'd still say it has more content than DAoC (Well, not really, but it's certainly more entertaining)<br>
<br>
<br>
Like someone else said:  You *CAN'T* explore.  The world is simply too small.  MAYBE frontiers, but well...what do you expect to see?  There aren't many unique things in DAoC's world other than mobs.  The reason why? (Atleast this is my theory) Lack of zoning.  You might hate it, but once you play in a world with NO zoning and a landscape as dull as DAoC's, you'll grow to apprecaite the uniqueness the zones in EQ or AO have.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Horizon's - Check out the offical page.  The game is vaporware - they don't even HAVE an offical page anymore.  I highly doubt it'll be coming out.  Who knows though, maybe it'll rise from the dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for me, my next big MMORPG is going to be Earth and Beyond.  After getting accepted to the Phase 6 stress test and reading up on it, I can't wait for it to start.  (Note:  That doesn't mean it's a good game, I just mean that if they give half the things they say, it'll be a great game....but not many MMORPGs pull that off..they usually leave a few things out.)<br>
<br>
But one think struck me as interesting: Leveling.  Three types of exp you can do (You can't max out all three though).  You get exp for trading, exploring, and killing.  Currently, you can explore and put points into killing skills.  I kinda doubt it'll stay that way.  (Note:  This is just stuff I've read.  I could be off base, but after playing a few MMORPGs, I kinda see that being a little too easy)<br>
<br>
<br>
After Earth and Beyond, maybe I'll try out Eve, a much less known MMORPG coming out, but by far the best looking (I don't know much about it other than that though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
And..of course..WoW.. Gotta try anything Blizzard makes.  I'm such a fan boy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah..I guess I planned out my MMORPG future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=karakas>Karakas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/4/02 11:29:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll:    How has DAoC affected EQ for you??</span><hr size=1> I left EQ alot.

<br>
<br>
BUT the fact that someone with a high level character and time or a lower level person with cash could completely deck a twink out added a lot and kept people playing.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you wanted to twink a DAoC character, you could just give him cash and maybe rare drops of his level.  Give him purple armor, and it doesn't work near as well as yellow..<br>
<br>
Lower level people may not like twinking, but I think it adds to the game, in a sense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uredscarab.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Redscarab</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(4/16/02 3:43:58 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.criminy.net/images/woodspirit.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll:    How has DAoC affected EQ for you??</span><hr size=1> Well, I just cancelled my EQ account last month.<br>
<br>
I am definitely a casual player.  I played EQ for three years and only got up to 33rd level.  I started about 8 mos after EQ went live, so I guess you could call me an &quot;old school&quot; monk.  I remember going down to Innothul Swamp (sp?) to get my mesh gloves since they were magic and would let me solo wisps! I remember camping for ages to get my Treant Fists, only to have Gem Inlaid Gauntlets show up a few months later.  I remember Kuark coming out and being envious of the lizzies and pissed off at  all of the new monk weapons (monk weapons?!!? what do we need those for? we have our fists and feet!!!).  I remember one of the reasons I picked monk was because they were self-reliant and I wouldn't have to worry about loot or twinks...<br>
<br>
Well, Verant changed the class that I originally started to play to such an extent that I really had no desire to play it anymore.<br>
<br>
Since switching to DAoC I've been much happier.  The game is MUCH friendlier to the casual player.  I can get on and find a group pretty quickly and if I don't I can still solo (and if you try and tell me that EQ Monks can solo, my answer is yes they can if they are twinked out, I didn't have that luxury...).<br>
<br>
I play for about 6 hours a week, sometime a bit more, sometimes less.  DAoC makes this a fairly pleasant experience.<br>
<br>
I can see how hard-core players would become bored with DAoC fairly quick, but for me it's quite the improvement. <p><img src = "http://www.criminy.net/images/eqsig.jpg" width="432" height="72" align="center"> <br> <align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Monk of the 33rd Sash - - - My feet hurt... <i>with Destiny!</i></b></font>  </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uliktha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liktha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(4/18/02 12:16:54 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.myoswego.net/~stacisplace/stacipersonalpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll:    How has DAoC affected EQ for you??</span><hr size=1> Heh..hadn't checked this since I posted.<br>
<br>
Xenix, I got up to level 60 in EQ. I actually stopped playing EQ about a year ago (though I'm still interested in it since I have so many friends that play it). There is more for high end players to do in EQ (or was the last I heard about DoaC). I personally find it boring because it all feels the same to me..maybe I didn't realize that DoaC just felt like a take off of EQ at the time without as much to do on the high end. There was so much lacking that had been promised (no rewards for realm points, small world areas for each realm compared to where people could go in EQ). The realm to realm was what drew me in, but in order to survive that you had to get high level fast and it was very boring to do so..not a lot of choices and no rewards when I posted.<br>
<br>
I'm not the only person who feels the high end content is lacking. I frankly haven't had the time since then to check and see if they've fixed the problems.<br>
<br>
Just wondering, has DoaC fixed some of the issues that were driving so many high end players away? I know right around the time I last posted they fixed the ability to powerlevel someone in a short time..which was a good thing since people would spend longer enjoying the lower levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uvalaelvalacirca.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valael Valacirca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ks.gamerzparadize.com/smileys/gunless%20violence/312.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Master</span><br>  Posts: 1088<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(4/20/02 7:42:28 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ks.gamerzparadize.com/smileys/gunless%20violence/bangin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll:    How has DAoC affected EQ for you??</span><hr size=1> You forgot one thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
RvR was repetitive.  After you got over the beginning thrill of it, you realized how pointless it was.<br>
<br>
<br>
Relics had a very, very, very small effect on anything, so taking them wasn't worth anything more than bragging rights (Especially for normal keeps)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally hated the EXP nerf.  Giving people a chance to quickly power level a character would give them something to do.  Bored of your Cleric?  Quickly powerlevel up an Armsman.  <br>
<br>
<br>
But I guess it was expected.<br>

It was best put a few posts up though.  The end game is boring.  NO matter how you cut it nor which realm your in. I played 2 post 40.  45 armsman 40 hunter<br>

Seems like thre intent was to have constant realm wars for the post 45 folk.  This is kinda gay.  Reminds me of a Vietnam movie.  THe guys go out on an ambush.  In the movie they always find enemy.  THe reality is sometimes the enemy just isnt there to find .(<br>

The end game IS boring. All of the zones look and play more or less alike. There isn't much variation in terms of what equipment is good for your class -- changing your equipment doesn't really change your style of play. There really is very little to look forward to once you hit 40 and get your last equipment upgrade and your epic weapon.<br>
<br>
The big &quot;if&quot; is whether or not you enjoy RvR. If RvR absolutely tickles you pink then you will love DAOC. If you couldn't care less about RvR, then EQ in my opinion will offer you a whole lot more than DAOC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showMessageRange?topicID=104.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showMessageRange?topicID=104.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showMessageRange?topicID=104.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=104.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.showNextMessage?topicID=104.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.emailToFriend?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.threadControl?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="monklybusiness43508frm13">Board Rules<option value="monklybusiness43508frm17">Monk Change<option value="monklybusiness43508frm1">General<option value="monklybusiness43508frm16">New Features<option value="monklybusiness43508frm2">Guides and Tactics<option value="monklybusiness43508frm3">Monk Equipment<option value="monklybusiness43508frm7">Monk Quests<option value="monklybusiness43508frm4">Stories<option value="monklybusiness43508frm5">Out Of Character<option value="monklybusiness43508frm6">Newbie Zone<option value="monklybusiness43508frm14">Other Games<option value="monklybusiness43508frm15">Secret Squirrel Society</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8b1a1a>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508>Monkly Business</a><font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm14>Other Games</a> <font color=#8b1a1a> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
