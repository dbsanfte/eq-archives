Maybe I don't know what you mean by this, but there was a nice little option when you installed SoL to install updated retextured files, which is the only thing I heard of being promised.<br>

I have to admit that I'm sort of disappointed that there has been no official word on what happened to the new user interface we were told was coming. I mean, with as large as this release has been, I'm sure it had to be put on a back burner for later...but since you advertised it quite a bit, why didn't we hear something like, &quot;We are working on getting this out to you as soon as possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
Was it scrapped?<br>
<br>
Below is the quote we received from these boards concerning the UI...<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, if you read that carefully you noticed that I said something about a new interface. We will be releasing a new and impressively customizable interface to all EverQuest players with the release of Shadows of Luclin. I don't have a lot of details for you about the new interface at this time. I can tell you that we think you'll be very impressed with it. The main feature of this new interface will be the customizability that it gives the players. We're still building it, so I can't really elaborate, but there is no doubt in my mind that you'll be impressed, or in the least intrigued.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, what happened?<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, we decided to hold off on the new interface. It's going to be rolled out to all our customers, so it's not really a Luclin feature. Because we decided to make the new interface available to everyone, we had to make sure that it would work with all of the old commands. And since it wasn't a feature specifically for Luclin, we decided not to spend too much Luclin production time on its creation.<br>
<br>
We also wanted to take the time to let folks try the interface and give us feedback before it is finalized. We just couldn't do that under the time constraints of producing Shadows of Luclin.<br>
<br>
When we have a better idea when we'll be able to release the new interface, I'll let you know.<br>

Hey Absor. Honestly, I was telling my brother this just last week....&quot;Ya know..The Luclin Launch was comparable to Anarchy Online, but they did an incredible job cleaning up quickly&quot;. So, from me to the team, Good work. You've got at least one patient person here. I've still got minor issues, but...its Everquest, you guys are on the prowl.<br>
Also wanted to say that I totally understand the priority of bugs over say...implementations and features. But..I gotta be honest...I'm getting very scared that the new interface and the /trader command are going to go the way of the Guild Halls (See Original everquest manual...i.e. &quot;You can even buy your own guild hall) These two ideas are a long time coming, and...personally, having written a letter a week to Verant for over a year about the whole /trader command idea, I was very excited when the idea was confirmed. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, not asking you to hurry, just wouldnt mind some mind candy in the form of an ETA or progress report. THanks<br>
<br>
-Kluz<br>
Rathe Server<br>
<br>
I just don't have an ETA on those items for you. I'm not listing them on the Luclin Update thing because, as you noted, they are features we want to add, not bugs that we need to fix. As such, they fall into a different category.<br>
<br>
However, you will see those features. A lot of the work has been done already on both of them. I had a chance to try out the /trader stuff even before Luclin shipped, and with the exception of some details it's close to done.<br>
<br>
But I can't really estimate when you'll see either the bazaar functionality or the new interface simply because there are other things taking precedence right now, and those are things that I don't have an estimate for completion on either. All I can say is that we'll get to them as soon as we can. I know that's not really what you want to hear, but it's the best we can do right now.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I don't see any deception going on here. Absor has owned up to the shortcomings of the initial launch, detailed the prioritizing being done that supercedes the ebay elements of this game. I know other similar posts by Absor have addressed such things as Velious textures, re-texturing the old expansions, etc. But I don't feel like looking for them all ;p <br>

----&quot;I think he saying that he'd rather not be lied to. Verant promised certain things when they released this product. They did not deliver. Its called false advertising, and I can understand how someone would be upset.&quot;<br>
<br>
It wasn't delivered WITH the product, as promised. Therefore lie. Not only that, but they haven't even given a date. They had every intention of pushing out a product that didn't deliver what they themselves said it would contain. Noone told me when I handed the cashier my credit card, that my expectations wouldn't be met.

Somewhere down the line, we taught people it's ok to lie, go back on their word, and otherwise not fulfill their promises. We elect politicians that we know are less than truthful at best, or criminals at worst.    We have condoned the common business practice ( again not just Verant ), of not only not meeting a deadline, but also of selling us an inferior product, along with bad customer service when something does go wrong.  Basically, we shaped our beliefs that people are dishonest and can't be trusted, can't or won't take care of themselves, and are lazy, yet we have the gall to be suprised when it comes to pass.  That's the crux of the matter and I don't really have any solution, but it's hardly suprising that Verant is what it is, and we will continue to pay for their services. <p><img src="http://www.twilite.org/~chrome/images/sigs/larcensig.jpg" border="0">

Well, The Interface was Half-Ass implemented, and so i thought eventually it would arrive.<br>

It never did.<br>

Shadows of Luclin was promoted as finally having the Improved interface among many other enhancements such as a common trade zone (Bazarr) with the ability to turn one's self into a merchant.<br>

It has been over 90 days, &lt; thats THREE MONTHS&gt; since the release of Luclin, and over ONE GODDDAMN YEAR since the release of Scars of Velious.<br>

Its not so much that the content is not available, its the fact that they PROMISED that it would be available, and like so many of thier other promises, the wiped thier asses with it, and  tossed thier crap in our faces stating, 'oops! we did it again!'<br>

But I have said it before.  I am sure that the tech people did not want to release it when they did because they knew it wasn't ready for release.<br>
<br>
I sympathize with the tech people though.  I can guarantee that the things you want in the game, the development items, are taking a much lower priority in the game than chasing fires and fixing bugs.  I would like to see those items too, but the bugs are a higher priority for them.  Also, they have bosses who have bosses who have bosses.  And inevitably, the upper management has no clue about the tech side of things, and they only care about figures.  What is more important?  Throwing some new features into a server that already has a built in stagnant playerbase, or getting this new Stormhammer server set up.  $30 a month more per player for very little extra effort, and a few more employees.  Sure we might lose a few players from the other servers because we didn't put out the additions we promised, but we'll make up for it with Stormhammer.  It makes perfect sense that they will focus on money making issues and are not really concerned with development.  Now, they can stick all the development team on Stormhammer, which in and of itself most likely pays for the dev team on it's own, and when things are working as intended, bring them to the other servers.<br>
