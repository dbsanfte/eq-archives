The third part is a slightly edited version of the first story I wrote concerning Ballius.  Perhaps some of you will recognize it... Hope you enjoy!<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Morning rose over Jaggedpine Forest.  Deep within the woods, a young bear cub gently awoke, a shaft of light breaking through the canopy of branches above it, warming the creature's fur.  It opened its mouth widely, and shook off the haze of sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pull back, hold your breath, and aim.  When you feel the time is right, release.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leck and Tyrsana Filshot were two of the most famous, and notorious, poachers known throughout the western regions of Antonica.  They made their home in a modest cabin located in the Plains of Karana, but were by no means paupers.  The skins and heads of the various creatures the lovers claimed easily made them two of the wealthiest people in the area.  Such prizes also put a mark one their own heads, courtesy of the local druids and rangers.  Yet, despite all their treasures, they valued one possession above all others.  And that was their son, Ballius.  He had already proven to be proficient with the bow at a young age, and was taken on his first hunt on the day of his fifth year alive.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry, just stay calm.  See the arrow hit its mark.  You'll know when to release,&quot; Tyrsana whispered into the boy's ear.  Leck stood behind them, smiling proudly.  Ballius held his breath, focusing on the bear cub.  The young hunter felt a calm settle over the forest.  He closed his eyes, and released.<br>
<br>
The arrow sped towards its unsuspecting target, but sparked off a barrier and deflected off into the into the woods.  The startled cub whelped, and ran off.  While the boy tried to make sense of what had happened, Leck's and Tyrsana's faces drained into a deathly white.  It was an ambush.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the rangers of Surefall Glade, we hereby declare your crimes as punishable by death.  Should you have any last words, you'd best say them now!&quot; a voice shouted through the woods.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ballius, run!  We'll be right behind you!&quot; Leck shouted at his son, while Tyrsana shot an arrow into the branches above them.  The boy gripped his bow and ran in fear, his legs numb with adrenaline.  As he ran, he heard the screams of his parents behind him, and darted his head back, against all his instincts in preserving the hope that they might still be alive.  He saw their bodies, pierced with dozens of arrows, lying on a patch of blood-soaked foliage.  Ballius stopped and turned around, staring.  The image of his fallen parents burned into his memory.<br>
<br>
The boy heard a high pitched whine, and was snapped out of his transe as an arrow tore past his left cheek.  He gripped his face in pain, and fell to the forest floor.  A few moments later, the band of rangers emerged from the forest to surround the boy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall we kill him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's far too young.  It's against our code to punish children.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then his fate?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let Tunare decide.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that, the rangers left the boy to the mercies of the forest.<br>
<br>
Ballius awoke, and quickly clasped the side of his face; the gash in his cheek was still bleeding.  He picked up his bow, and somberly started to wander.<br>
<br>
After emerging from the forest, the boy began to trek the plains towards his destination.  He recognized the grasslands with relative ease, and followed the path that lead to his home.  He arrived in a daze at the wooden cabin, realizing what the smoke he saw meant.  It was set ablaze.  Ballius threw his bow into the fire, and knelt on the ground.  All was lost.  He could only wander, and hope that he would live.  He could only hope for revenge.  Eventually, the boy stood up, and followed the setting sun.<br>
<br>
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
Ghil Starn whistled a vivacious tune as he strolled down the marketsquare of Qeynos.  As he walked by the other merchants, some squinted at him with jealousy, and others glared at him with hatred.  But Ghil wasn't afraid.  He had made a pact with Hanns Kregor, a rather ruthless fellow.  He also happened to be the ringleader of the Circle of the Unseen Hand, an organization of thieves and assassins alike, hidden within the sewers of Qeynos.  They were in charge of the markets now, and any hint of rebellion or betrayal would be quickly dealt with.  Things were looking up for Ghil indeed.<br>
<br>
The sky was turning a dark shade of red as Ghil made his way to his new home in the catacombs of Qeynos.  That was when he heard something rather peculiar.  It was the sound of a small child crying.  The middle-aged merchant tracked the sobs to a dank alley, where he found a young boy, huddled in a ditch.  Upon closer inspection, he saw that the boy's left cheek had a large wound on it, accompanied by a face and neck covered with dried blood.  He was also starving.<br>
<br>
Ghil sighed.  He didn't have the heart to leave the boy to starve, but knew that he would most likely be sold into slavery should he be brought back to the rogues.  But there was something more.  Throughout his life, Ghil Starn was never wed, nor did he have any offspring.  There was something about the boy, perhaps his need of a father, that entranced the man.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess I'll have to take the chance,&quot; the merchant muttered beneath his breath.  &quot;Hey, kid, y'alright?&quot;  Ghil picked up the boy in his arms.  &quot;You look a bit scraped, eh?  What's your name?  I think I can help you out.&quot;<br>
<br>
The boy shivered as he looked up towards the man with frightened eyes.  He blinked, letting another tear fall past his wound.  It grew increasingly red as it slid down his cheek, until it was practically a drop of blood clinging to his chin.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the gods.  What happened to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
&quot;I swear, nobody makes cigars like them Barbarians.&quot;  The man known as Ballius Goodchild took another puff from his cigar, and looked back at the mess he made.  A young bear's carcass, dragged through the forest with a prominent trail of blood behind it, was lying next to a smoldering fire of freshly cut wood.  Puffs of dark smoke lifted into the night air.<br>
<br>
A rustle of leaves above him caught the rogue's attention.  Ballius looked up, and saw three figures: all half-elves, presumably rangers.  Two held large, oaken bows with arrows pointed threateningly at the murderer.  Both were male, one noticeably older, the other barely a man.  Most likely father and son.  The third was female, and a child.  She was unarmed, and knelt behind the elder ranger.  &quot;Probably her first expedition,&quot; Ballius thought.  &quot;Ironic.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;By the protectors of Surefall Glade,&quot; the younger ranger prominently declared, &quot;we hereby declare your crimes as punishable by death.  Have you any last words, cretin?&quot;<br>
<br>
The human took a last draw from his cigar, and tossed it into the fire.<br>
<br>
The younger looked to the elder for confirmation.  A nod, and the arrows flew towards their target.  The female looked on excitedly, but was surprised when the arrows only hit soft ground.  Her attention then quickly drew to her brother, who slumped out of his branch post and landed on the ground with a thud.  An ornate dagger protruded from his back.  Tears began to form in the girl's eyes, when she heard her father beside her grunt in pain.  The human was behind him, dagger planted in his side.  The girl's father looked down at her, head twitching from the poison circulating through his body.  With his last breaths, he told her to run.  Run.<br>
<br>
The mother cursed as she drew her arrow back, the human's head in dead aim.  &quot;Thank Tunare he hasn't spotted me,&quot; she thought.  In the next split second of her life, she realized that she was wrong.  An arrow flew from the brush, and planted itself between the rogue's feet.  The mother lurched back from her hidden position, throwing dagger firmly set between her eyes.  The father and mother fell from the trees simultaneously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?!&quot; the young girl cried.  &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ballius turned to the girl, and flicked his wrists.  Daggers appeared in both hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;I swear, we'll find you.  And we'll kill you, you vile-- you vile beast!&quot;<br>
<br>
To this, Ballius slowed his advance, and smirked.  The girl realized that no one would know it was him.  She didn't even know his name.  It was then that the tears were released from the puddles beneath her eyes.  Ballius drew his dagger back to strike, but hesitated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dammit,&quot; he thought to himself, and brought the hilt of his blade into the side of the girl's skull, knocking her unconscious.  For a moment the murderer stood there, looking down at the girl who was precariously leaning on the branch.  He looked at the familiar curves of the girl's face, and the memories flooded back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Linasa...&quot;<br>
<br>
A tear ran down the rogue's cheek, along a long scar.  What has he become?  What caused all of this?  Of course.  Revenge.  Mammoth.<br>
<br>
Ballius gripped his blade tightly and rigidly placed it against the girl's throat.  Anger was welling inside him.  His scar burned with hatred, hatred for the things that were taken away from him.  The dagger shook at the girl's throat, but gradually stilled .  The anger subsided once again.  It was at this moment, that Ballius knew.  He knew that he would die. <p><hr align="left" width="200">
