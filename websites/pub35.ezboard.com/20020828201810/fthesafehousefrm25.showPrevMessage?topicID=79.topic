And a few black silk handkerchiefs.<br><br>the handkerciefs can be used, for example, to wrap a couple around a hammerhead to muffle its blows.  Or put them over the face and hands of the guard you just dragged into a dark corner so he isnt so easily seen.  Or, in combination with the tar you already mentioned, to break through small windows (spread the tar evenly on the window, stick the cloth to the tarred window, break the window.  All the glass shards of any size will remain stuck to your cloth, and not rattle about on the floor inside)  You can also then use more tar and another kerchief to mask the broken window pane to prevent drafts that might alert someone.<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nenjindarkeyes>Nenjin Darkeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/10/02 7:58:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> If you don't have rope in there, get it.

If there is so much dust in the dungeon that you'll leave an obvious trail, it seems likely that your opponents dont go there often enough to see any trail you might leave.<br><br>Im also not sure how white powder is going to expose trip wires or other trap mechanisms, unless you have some means of getting the white powder to stick to them.<br><br>Breaking into a dungeon is a whole different kit compared to breaking into someplace urban and patrolled.  Stealth isnt nearly as important, and you can bring a lot more gear, since you can pack much of it on the big dumb warrior who is coming with you.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=goatsandgippos>GoatsAndGippos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 7:33:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> An Icepick and a mop. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udragynphyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dragynphyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 9:55:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~dragynphyre/images/purpdrag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Here's a few things I always include when I'm making up a theif's kit...<br><br>Lockpicks<br>Grappling hook<br>Silk rope<br>Small Handheld Mirror (looking 'round corners, etc)<br>Flask of oil (good for squeaky hinges, sliding heavy objects across the floor, firebombs, etc.)<br>Flour (for exposing tripwires, a bit of disguise (ghosties!), etc.)<br><br>other useful stuff:<br>caltrops<br>weaponblack<br> <p><Center><SPAN STYLE="width:600;height:30;filter:glow(color=purple size=3)"><font size="2" color="red" face="Tahoma"><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=39448><b>Delissandra Splitshadow -  Half-Elven Assassin - "Far Seekers" - The Rathe</a></b><br>So do I feel superior to any druid-twinked post-Kunark still-sucking-at-his-mother's-teat rogue? <br>You better believe I do!!  </SPAN></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/14/02 7:50:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> OMG you don't have a glass cutter in the masterwork kit!!!<br><br>OMGGGG!!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukethaal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kethaal</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/15/02 7:31:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> *cough*<br><br>Grease, a large square of leather and a hammer is better then a glasscutter.
