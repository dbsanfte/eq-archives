Not eliminate it but to reduce the chance of a successful double attack on backstab to a lower percent chance of that happening.<br>
In all honestly i don't think pre50 we do substatially more damage then monks ect..unless your twinked and well twinks don't garner balance in the firstplace.<br>
<br>
It really isn't till 55 that we make that major jump ahead of others in the damage department and its mostly due to DoubleBackstabs, so lowering the successrate of doubleBackstabs would lower our damage output at highlevels without removing any skills and would have no effect on the class pre55 which i really think is perfectly balanced.<br>
<br>
If our damage output is part of the reason that evade is beign so severly looked at than i would suggest considering this idea as well or instead of crippling evade.<br>
This would only affect the 55+ crowd and it would easily be controllable..ie if you reduce the success rate of DBS to 50% you on average would lower our damage output at 60 by 15%..ect ect..<br>
I guess i'm suggesting this as an idea that IF part of the reasoning for the severity of the changes to evade are because of large raids at highlevels..i'd rather our role at that point be adjusted rather then the whole class thru all levels.<br>
I might be way off base and some people might think i'm insane for suggesting it..but if on the off chance kendrick might still be following this thread..hope it helps determine where the real unbalanceing of the class is.<br>

That's it.  I don't pre-evade, or evade all fight to have no aggro.<br>
<br>
The generalization that dropping you to 2nd on the list is not good enough because it will soon be on you again and you are dead if Evade is not available?  Utter nonsense.  How long does Hide take to refresh?  Are you THAT feeble that you can't survive a few seconds of being attacked?  A rogue is a melee character for @#%$ sakes.  Act like it.<br>
<br>
I'm so tired of &quot;a rogue's JOB is to do damage, a warriors JOB is to take it, a cleric JOB is to CH the main tank only, blah blah blah&quot;...are you playing a game or working on an assembly line?  Use a little creativity, a little ingeniuity for once.<br>
<br>
Deal with it.  I prefer a percentage reduction to a fixed place on the list, it makes more sense.  But you know what?  Either way I will figure out a way to deal with it and make it work.  End of story.  @#%$ people, what's so bad about the notion that you may have to THINK a little, be a little creative in fighting instead of the cookie cutter, &quot;attack, evade, keep mob on main tank, cleric CH's main tank&quot;, repeated button pushing for hours?<br>
<br>
A good player is made by their ability to think and make a situation work, not pre-determined by the skill set Verant provides.<br>
<br>
As a side note, the more impacting and unnecessary change here is greying out ID when a special attack is used and vice versa.  Using a little skill, I time ID's to proc precisely after backstab ungreys.  This change will delay that - I won't be able to press ID and start the 5 second ID process until AFTER backstab ungreys now.  It makes it easier to see grey buttons for simpletons who can't figure out the timing, but removes the skill required to maximize your ID attempts with the most chance for success.  gee, big thanks to the person who needlessly brought up this suggestion.  This is more of a nerf than anything to do with evade.<br>

<br>
<i>Evade as it works now, when successful, reduces your 'hate points' to 120 instantly. A person that just entered into agro range of a mob has 128 points of hate.<br>
<br>
With the old hate list only holding six people, and rolling the lowest off, a high damage rogue had a good chance of promoting himself right back up the hate list in a hurry, requiring multiple evades during a fight. </i><br>
<br>
So, what you're saying, Kendrick, is this:<br>
Before, a rogue could easily jump up 6 places on the hate list due to damage done...<br>
But now, somehow, moving ourselves up 1 place is not going to happen INSTANTLY?  <br>
<br>
Not even COUNTING the use of Duellist (which will be completely useless after this), this makes having even 2 rogues in a raid less intelligent than planning a VP trip with no clerics.  Here, play Loz during a Velious encounter some day.  I'll show you what I mean.  Not only is this idea lame for just putting us 1-2 places down on the hate list, but it's also lame thanks to the fact that Velious mobs require more than 1 rogue to do enough damage to.  Keep in mind that there's a reason you gave Tunare ~1,000,000 hp, and why Yelinak has ~500k.  It's because it was possible to do this much damage (however unlikely) under the old models.  Now Verant is getting rid of the Donal's bp (for all intents and purposes), thereby significantly reducing the amount of time that we can spend in combat with these mobs... And also reducing the amount of damage that we can do to them with rogues?  I'm glad there's so much forethought going into EQ.  Truely stunning the brilliance and planning there is.  Stop making players feel like ass about playing your goddamned game.  You used to be one of us, now you're a v-man.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
This will rule! Man, I can't wait to go sit on the sidelines because having all 5 of our 58+ rogues will be completely useless in a fight.  Actually, having just 2 rogues will be useless in a large encounter.  Maybe I'll just switch my RSSS to mainhand and not stab anymore.  I can be like a warrior with no hp, not enough ac, and no chance for survival!  Woot!<br>
<br>
Seriously, as it has been mentioned before by Wendolyn and others, this makes rogues useless on large encounters.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you ladies and gentlemen of the press!  Wizards suck in Velious because even dumping full mana into a mob, they can't even dent their uber hp, so we use rogues! Oh... wait... rogues are useless now too!  Ok, Time for people to just use warriors and clerics, cause that's all that's needed! Maybe a bard or two for some resists and a shaman and enchanter for hastes/buffs, and voila! Verant has made the perfect game! I call it WarriorQuest.  Or maybe ClericQuest. Class balance indeed. <p>-Lozoria Shinkicker<br>

<br>
The main problem is, in high end raid situations, rogue tanking = dead rogue.  Theres no way around it.  At lvl 57 with 1110 ac and 3800 hp in full buffs, many of the velious ubers can kill me in 2 rounds of melee.  I'm not exagerating either.<br>
<br>
Dropping us only to 2nd on the list may be fine for exp groups where the cost of a rogue getting hit is minor, with good ac we wont be toast because of a blue mob hitting us.  However, when stuff starts to hit for 850 quad and has nasty procs, its simply a death sentance.<br>
<br>
Pre-sov, evade dropped the rogue to #6 on sucess?  So put it back that way.  Or even better, take the other suggestion thats being talked about, and make it a randomized possition.<br>

They claim that it lowers you to the bottom of the hate list, be it 6 people or 30 people.  But from my experiences I don't see this as the current case.<br>
<br>
We fight alot of pretty tough mobs, and alot of time, me being a rogue...I tend to aggro the mob.  Well, I evade whenever it's up.  I will successfully evade, yet the mob keeps pounding on me.  Well, I back up, turn attack off (sound familiar?) and he attacks the taunting warrior.  While he's fighting the warrior I can succesfully evade about 5 more times while sitting out of the fight, then I will go back in.  Yet, RIGHT when I get near the mob(just within his hitting range) he aggroes me again without me even attacking, and begins to pound on me anyways.<br>
<br>
It's pretty obvious that evade doesn't throw you to the bottom of the aggro list like they say it does, if it did I why would the mob's main concern be to pound on me anyways?<br>
<br>
Any ideas?<br>

... oh and my idea of a fix ... If pre-SOV evade brought you to the last spot on a 6 person aggro list and post-SOV evade brought you to the last spot on a 60 person aggro list, then why not change it so that you are brought to the 6ths spot on a 60 person list? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucoyoteblack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>coyoteblack</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 11:03:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Kendrick Thanks!!</span><hr size=1>      It is cool we have someone looking out for us.

If evade was working correctly before, and then thro a slight oversight when the hate list was made larger it became broken, why not just make it the way it was before.  Dunno if these numbers are right or not but if the hate list was 30 before, and its 60 now, then why not make it so it drops us to the 30th like back when you claimed it was working as intended.  I see very clearly that dropping us to the extreme bottom is bad, but 1 or two slots is quite to over correction.  I play in a normal group with a Warrior using weapons that dont do half of what i do, if the aformentioned change goes thro there wont be a chance for him to get the mob off me, or keep it off for any extended period of time.  And not to tell you that you dont know whats going on, Kendrick, but you said we may have to change our damage output.  Are you suggesting that we dont use Ragebringer?  Thats baffoonery. <p><p align=center>~Gaar Liontum~<BR>~Dalimur Darkrazor~<BR>Paladin by day, Rogue by night<BR>~Rodcet~</p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzolendnewbieater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zolend Newbieater</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif  BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/01 11:20:14 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/digon777/zolendpp1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to what we are proposing to Evade +more.</span><hr size=1> I have a feeling after the change I'll play and die a half dozen times and play my shadowknight till they fix this heh. <p>Zolend Newbieater

<br>
The problem was described as: with the new larger hate lists, the rogue ends up below people on the other side of the zone who just happen to be on the hate list without ever having attacked.<br>
<br>
Why not just change the constant value up a bit to be something like 128 + the amount of hate generated by a single normal hit? We could then evade to the bottom of the attackers on the hate list, but still not be able to evade onto any other player that was never engaged in the battle.<br>
<br>
It also seems to me that introducing a new formula and the code to implement it would be more error-prone than just adjusting the constant hate factor constant that is already in the code. So, not only does the new suggestion seem <b>extremely</b> more deadly to the rogue by design, it is likely the implementation will be goofed up as well. <p><img src="http://members.home.com/lyndib/signatures/Geffin_Signature.gif" width="350" height="100">

<br>
<br>
Also, for the people talking about how taunt will offset this; taunt (as I have understood it) on a successful skill check, puts you one (1) point higher than the #1 person on the hate list. Doesn't increase your rate of hate accumulation, doesn't _keep_ you there until taunt recycles, and it has the same recycle time as hide. If a warrior can't taunt off of me now, how is he going to after a succesful evade only puts me halfway between him and cleric?<br>
<br>
We've been given the tools to outdamage other classes handily, yet still keep the mob off of us. I agree that dropping completely off the hate list is overpowered, however staying at the top unless we stand around with our hands at our sides (or die) is too far in the other direction. I like Wendolyn's random idea, puts some excitement and unpredictability back in the game. <p>Dalarian Silvershade <semi retired><BR>

<br>
The evade issue is just too hot.  I trust that things will get worked out correctly. Please test the crud out of it before you have to make apologies. <br>
<br>
<br>
* The Sense Traps timer is waaay to long. set it down to something manageable .5sec, this would take the tedium out of trying to sense them. Also The Sense Traps Radius is laughably small increase  the senseing radius. To compensate for the quick sense traps recyle increase the Disarm Traps recycle, it does take alot longer to disarm a trap than to sense that one id there.<br>
<br>
*  With the evade changes inevitable and looking grim I would like to at least add that Evade should be its own skill and fuction off its own button.  All to ofter I get the &quot;you have moved&quot; your attempts to evade failed. 99% this is server lag. This would make the proposed changes acceptable<br>

I have 4 issues:<br>
<br>
#1:  Taunt doesn't work well enough to save a rogue.If a tank taunts his way to the top of the hate list, the rogue is going to be back to the top in a split second - within one or two hits. It's not like we're casters who have 6-second recast times, and give the warrior time to continue building up hate.<br>
<br>
#2: Evade is about DEALING DAMAGE, not just escaping aggro. This is about rogues getting their damage-dealing potential nerfed. When we get the aggro, we can't do backstab, and our damage-dealing potential drops by around 33%. We're left doing less damage than monks. We're basically warriors without the hitpoints and AC.<br>
<br>
THIS was the situation pre-evade. I'm really afraid that the &quot;taking responsibility for our damage&quot; is going to amount to the same thing. It means our damage-dealing potential is going down... either by choice (we ease off on doing damage), or by being forced into it (The mob starts tearing us a new one, both increasing our risk AND massively reducing our damage output).<br>
<br>
The reason for evade's very existance from the beginning was to allow us to live up to our potential, and have a CHANCE of significantly outdamaging the other high-damage melee classes. People have lost sight of that, thinking of it more as a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>
#3: I really fear the proposed implementation is insufficient. I really wish they'd rethink it. I think the example Kendrick provided is not a close enough representation of hate list distribution in a multi-group environment.  I think the hate values for the top 3 or 4 people are much more tightly distributed ... I fear that a successful evade (ASSUMING success... Evade is notorious for NOT working when you need it most) will drop a rogue much LESS than 10% of their hate value in many situations.<br>
<br>
#4: I also think 10% is inadequate - it basically puts a cap on our damage at no more than 10% of the damage output of any other person in our group. In a SMALL GROUP situation (moving away from the raid mentality for a moment), this is reall, really bad. Particularly if the group's tank is, say, a paladin. <br>
<br>
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE re-think this implementation. In the past, evade FUNCTIONALLY dropped us to about the sixth place on the hate list... a position that we were still able to climb out of pretty quickly in a single-group situation. Would it be so horrible to have it continue to do so with expanded hatelist? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessageRange?topicID=2059.topic&start=161&stop=167>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2067.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2061.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2059.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2059.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2059.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2059.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
