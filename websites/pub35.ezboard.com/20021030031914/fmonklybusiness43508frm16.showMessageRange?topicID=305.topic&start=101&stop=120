Just fyi, clerics get some pretty rocking nukes now...where's my new healing, again?<br>
<br>
2. All my skin buffs so far have been overwritten by cleric hp/ac buffs, EVEN when my skins are better. This is mana- and time-wasting as well as highly annoying...can't count how many times my skin buff has been overwritten by a cleric buff. From the sound of the patch message, even cabbage and potg are going to be overwritten by freeking hero now. Joy!&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Like I said, you are supposed to get them in the new patch.  If you are too stupid to play your class I can't help you.  As a matter of fact I have a druid and he is only lvl 46 but he seems to be able to duo with my 58 warrior almost as well as my 60 clr.  With regen, thorns and nukes he isn't required to ch the warrior since he is constantly being regened and the mob is dying faster.  You have already heard from many people that they prefer to duo with a dru or a shammy OVER a cleric.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry some of your buffs are overwritten by spells like aego.  At least you don't have pay for peridots and its almost half as much mana as my 2000 mana g aego.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;4. Almost-CH?? Well for one, it sounds like it's the same casting time, but more cost, than CH, and will not heal nearly as much. Will it get even used by shamans? Probably not from what I hear. For druids, we probably will use it since it's our only heal that might restore more than 1 bubble on a tank. The super long cast time and expense means that we sure won't be able to do many of these at all before oom...which means that there is STILL NO WAY a druid can out-heal a cleric, and you are on crack if you think so. In many places a cleric will still be overwhelmingly necessary.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
OMG are you really that stupid?  You really don't see how great these spells will be on a tank?  They finally made druids extremely useful for raids.  Think about how much easier mobs will be when you are healing a main tank for thousands.  Hey genious, you aren't supposed to outheal a cleric.  But now with regen, thorns, potg and your new CH you CAN replace a cleric better than you used to.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;5. Soloing...that's quite an attractive option, you say? Well let's take the mind-numbing boringness and add the recent solo xp nerf, and it really doesn't look so good, does it...I sure don't solo if I can help it. Why clerics keep crying, &quot;I want to solo&quot; is frankly beyond me.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Cry me a river.  Try begging for a port and running, without sow, to a zone such as seb and find there are 4 clerics already LFG there.  So what's a cleric to do now?  Beg another druid to come and get him so he can try his luck elsewhere?  Hmm maybe he will go quad-kite some mobs someplace. get real.  As for the xp nerf it affects every class not just yours.<br>
<br>
Now that your dots stack with other druid dots that opened up a whole new door for you, it did nothing for us non dot casting classes.<br>
<br>
While I am sure you are white fisted and mad while reading this.  Sit back and think about how many times you see clerics LFG in xp zones.  A lot, and there is 3 main reasons:<br>
<br>
1.  The group or solo-er(monk etc) already has one and adding another would just be pointless.<br>
<br>
2.  The solo-er already has a druid or shaman and already has suffiecient healing.<br>
<br>
3.  The solo-er has a fungi.<br>
<br>
With the new changes it's now possible to see 2 druids or 2 clerics in the same group!  No more being left out!<br>
<br>
These changes help everyone.  It's the xp nerf that kills us all.<br>

Is that counting bash damage?  Wasn't bash damage just significantly increased across the board?  If so then the cleric parse would have higher bash damage and yours would be much lower.  Try using a new log with the upgraded bash damage. <p>Baron Adax von Wrax and<br> his trusty sidekick Beign<br>

What does it matter to anyone that Clerics do this.  I've had access to a lvl 60 pally, lvl 60 wizard, and several other accounts.  THe things that can be done by most classes puts clerics in the dust.  Druids can solo, Shaman's can solo uber mobs, Clerics.. WEll umm they can really hurt someones knee cap.  This class should have the option of soloing.  Fact is.. with the new exp system clerics will have to face mobs that will hurt us really bad really fast.  <br>
<br>
I don't care what the DPS is.. We'll have to back away and heal ourselves.  in the mean time lose time and DPS is falling.  I don't see how this is going to make us monsters.  Fact is.. most clerics will probably have to resume sit med and heal.  If the group is pulling sufficiently.  Hell I've had groups that didn't let me get my mana about 50% for hours and yes that is with KEI and such buffs.  THe only application this has is for the groups that don't need much healing in which case it will help.  This is just a case of envy.  Fact is.. in everything minus EQ clerics kick ass.  Instead we have to submit to sitting and healing.  We don't wear plate because of its looks. WE wear it because we are mean SOB&quot;s.  EQ's vision of clerics and what it has been in D&amp;D is getting closer.

/shrug, bash misses a lot. Just like flying kick misses most of the time. I imagine it will take about a week to get some good parses in on this, but it's still retarded. They should have not given this to clerics, and not done the cheal changes on test for druids and shamans.

I'm level 56.<br>
<br>
This log is from the last two weeks, and consists of me mostly soloing <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  GREEN</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> mobs in Nurga for Chardok faction.<br>
<br>
My weapon is the Nature's Defender, the alternative paladin epic for Tunare worshippers.  It is NOT bash enabled, however, so I have no way to add bash damage until I get to level 59 and train a ton of AA points.  The weapon has a 150 point DD proc on it.<br>
<br>
My haste consists of Silver Chitin Hand Wraps (22%) plus our spell Valor of Marr (25%).  47% is a reasonable haste level for people who can't afford dragon haste.<br>
<br>
I have a shrunken goblin skull earring, which I used to keep my attack at about 967.  This log is over 7 days; on ONE of those days I also had Call of Earth, which added a little bit of damage due to the 4 point damage shield component.  On another ONE of those days, I duoed with a mage for an hour or two, who put a 25 point damage shield on me.<br>
<br>
Here is the result:<br>

A fair comparison is a 56th level paladin using equipment that is reasonable for the level, and that paladins is going to top out (self-buffed) at near 40 DPS.<br>
<br>
From my logs in Chardok, I do between 30 and 40 DPS in Chardok with my own haste (Valor of Marr). The specific mobs are:<br>
<br>
Chokidai Whelps (light blue)<br>
Chokidai Sniffers (dark blue)<br>
Di'Zok Underling (dark blue)<br>
Di'Zok Recruit (dark blue)<br>
<br>
My DPS drops a bit by going for tougher mobs (Conscripts, etc.) in the lev tunnel or fort, and drops a lot going deeper in (Watch Captain, Slavemasters, Wardogs, etc.). These mobs are dark blue to even, and I top out around 35 DPS.<br>
<br>
I don't have great equipment, but Sash of the Dragonborn and Argent Protector are not easy to get either. It disturbs me greatly to have a non-melee class close in on my damage with store-bought items. Sure, we'd love a damage upgrade, but then that encroaches on warriors.<br>
<br>
One issue is that VERY high end paladins have access to weapons that are much better than what 90% of paladins will ever see. Some of those paladins do apparently approach 80 DPS (with raid buffs), but there isn't a lot between the really high end stuff and, say, DN weapons. A Narandil's Lance is the best weapon many paladins can hope for, and that isn't going to go much above 40 DPS.<br>
<br>
I don't like seeing people nerfed either, but this patch shouldn't have gone live if clerics are doing even 30 DPS in melee. Many of us &quot;misguided leaders&quot; on PoN are holding out hope that Verant plans to upgrade paladins in some way but the current situation is disturbing. Most of us are not panicing or crying out for nerfs (which obviously bugs some people who want to scream and cry at the drop of a hat), but the data coming in now are a matter for watchful concern.<br>
<br>
Hopefully I don't seem like I'm trolling here - it's helpful to see how other classes (not directly affected) view the changes, since we can all get too close to our own issues. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

But i do have a 21 (wooble) cleric, and i do read the cleric boards, this is what i have gotten from reading them and compiling information in my brain, so it may be a bit askew.<br>
<br>
The druids and shamen are getting Cheal (watered down but hey...) so in most zones (casual popular xp zones) a druid or shaman could pass for primary healer, but we also know that druids and shamen are some of the best soloers in the game.<br>
<br>
If a druid or shaman logs on and cant find a group, np, just solo a bit.<br>
<br>
If a cleric logs on and cant find a group, well, he could go solo some light blue undead, killing one mob every 15 minutes, or play an alt. Herein lies the problem.<br>
<br>
I guess it was just their solution to the Cheal thing.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind this is compiled information from other people and i jammed it all together in my head (dont ask, this process involves many 9 volt batteries and a screwdriver)<br>
but thats all i can say. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=135831 ">Uraz Ragingfists</a><BR>

  Ummm Let me see here for a second.... Take a cleric who can cast Aegolism, and Completel heal himself, already he has the same if not more HP than a solo monk... Now give him more DPS, and the ability to interupt casters with bash.... Why don't we just give them mana burn and call it a day? <br>
  60monk LFG, 60 Cleric LFG... with the new changes which would you pick if looking for a damage dealer? a monk who can do some damage or a cleric who can do the same damage if not more and heal your arse. <br>

Bah, screw nerfing the hammer. I think its a good change, people don't realize, the hamers stats REALLY suck compared to some items clerics are using. Its preventing them from utilizing other items in primary if they want the proc.<br>
<br>
The procs not very stable as far as damage goes either, never had one resisted, but they do have a big range. Seen 40ish procs up to 150 on velk spiders.<br>
<br>
and hell, atleast the poor clerics don't have to sit around while LFG, some of them can actually get alittle experience while they're at it.<br>
<br>
Honestly do any of you really think someone would take a cleric over a monk, ranger, warrior, rogue, paladin or shadowknight if they were looking for a tank? Let clerics have their fun, they deserve it. Let them provide something beyond /sit off, /cast complete heal. on a side note, my cleric never has to med during fights with clarity and yaulp5 =D.  <p><img src="http://www.hickorytech.net/~jholt/sig.jpg"><br>
