<br>
I don't see Stealth as 'giving' us Detect Hidden at all since our stealth training has absolutely nothing to do with the ability. I see it as just a skill that is available to our classes. Actually, everyone of those skills except Safe Fall is not tied directly to our stealth so I feel the same about those. I still believe the actual stealth ability itself should be greater for assassins than it is for archers.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt; I, for one, do not agree with that opinion, and would be irritated if my item bonuses were weakened. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
The idea I had about how to include actual stealth training would not in any way make those items weaker. I thought to use stealth training as a modifier to the min. detect radius. <br>

<br>
If you don't train Stealth you don't get the ability.  Just because some of those abilities are granted from Stealth at fairly low spec levels, doesn't mean Stealth doesn't give us the abilities.  Ever talked to an archer who thought they were getting one or more of those abilities?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> They</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> certainly think there's a difference between our Stealths.  Safe Fall just happens to be the only one that gets better with further Stealth training.<br>

All the more reason why they should only get to train to 1/2 their level in Stealth! Then they wouldn't feel so slighted and we'd have superior stealth ... as it should be :-P<br>

<br>
In RvR, when you enter someones detect bubble for you, and have waited through the 'timer'  do you automatically appear, exactly like it works in your home realm, or does the finder have to pass a roll to see your cloaked body?<br>
<br>
If the finder has to pass a check, then keeping everything how it is on test, and bumping the assassins 'roll' to see the hider would be a great benefit, if it already doesn't work this way.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have never gotten ubergnome's technique to work on other stealth classes in the frontier.  When they circle around me and I around them, nothing seems to work at targeting them at all, unless I physically see them. <p>Dither Disgustipated<BR>

<br>
I have a friend that plays an albion scout...  The other day he was telling me how underpowered they are and how hard it is to play yet easy for them to be found...  (albeit everything they are doing to nerf archers tend to hit scouts harder than the other archers)  After asking him how it was easy to find an archer he went into this long description of how to do it which included having specific classes in a group and using this full group to hunt 1 (ONE) archer...  They may not get distraction or safe fall or even detect or climb but their Stealth abilities are as good or better than ours...  They are better since they almost always start at a distance (a huge advantage as detect works now)...  They are better as they can easily spec stealth to 50 without it gimping them...  Oh yea don't forget they get to wear studded...  Not to mention all the stealth nerfs have been attempts to balance them...  <br>
<br>
Now in order to find them we have to get a bunch of assassins together and walk shoulder to shoulder (as someone said earlier) However...  Assassins in a group should have no problem finding stealthed assassins as they know exactly where to look for em...  All this really does is make it harder to play an assassin while not really effecting Archers all that much...  <br>
<br>
It should not take a group of people to find one character...  Detect hidden against archers should have a wider range than this patch gives it and should be larger against archers than against assassins...  Assassins are easily found now...  If you want to find the assassin in your midst don't call another assassin call a caster because AE's are a much better detect hidden skill than the assassins detect hidden...  <br>
<br>
Detect Hidden should have been skill based with assassins being the only class able to spec stealth up to 100%, archers (studded) to 2/3rds, and minstrels (chain) to 1/2...  <br>
<br>
Detect hidden should work as originally explained with the &quot;bubble of detection&quot; growing larger the higher you spec the skill, as the &quot;bubble of hidden&quot; gets smaller the higher you spec...  2 detect hidden characters would compare stealth skills to determine the range at which they could see each other...  (A lower level player with a high stealth would be able to detect a higher level player with a low stealth) Everyone would still get the minimum detect hidden &quot;bubble&quot; that they have now...  <br>
<br>
+ Stealth items shouldn't effect detect hidden...  I said this earlier in the thread but will resay it now...  As I can see how a Gilly (camouflage) suit would make it easier for you to not be seen I can't see how it would make it easier to find someone else...  (I know these are supposed to be magical bonuses but unless they are gonna add detect hidden II, III, IV etc, I think that if you spend the points to spec 50 you should have an advantage over someone that didn't pay that price...)<br>

<br>
The problem with Detect Hidden I, II, III, IV, and V is that some of us are already level 48 to 50 and we have spent our spec points.<br>
<br>
It would be a pretty rude act to suddenly change stealth so that having a base of 50 in stealth was better than having 50 in stealth with items.<br>
<br>
I have spent 4 months playing my rogue, and if you suddenly changed the way Detect Hidden worked so that I would no longer have the best stealth out there then I would have to re-roll or quit.<br>
<br>
That would be really, really harsh.  <br>
<br>
Stealth is the ONLY thing a rogue has going for them in RvR.  I will hit level 50 next week.  I will be finished.  No more spec points to spend.  If you change the MOST important skill I have and suddenly I go from having the best stealth out there to having the 3rd best stealth out there then I am very, very gimped.  I would be forced to quit.<br>
<br>
That would be a VERY serious change.  Really, really, really serious change.  Please don't ask for that.<br>

  Tons of classes have a need for respecing, since skills have changed so much, they have added new spells to lines(affects my shaman personally_I'd totally go a different route than I did with the new buff system) and people have learned what certain stats and styles do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utazi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tazi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 2:33:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1991.topic&index=91>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/moiira1/tazi1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden test results, v1.45b</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;&lt; Stealth is the ONLY thing a rogue has going for them in RvR.

<br>
I don't see where you would be gimped at all. At 50, regardless of how it might change, your stealth and level are going to be to your advantage so I doubt seriously that it would hurt you too much. Plus, there are still people who are going to choose to spend those training points in other areas regardless. This is what will provide diversity among the classes when everyone does reach 50. <br>
<br>
Everyone thinks they know right now just how much they have to train in stealth to get to 50 in skill with items and other bonuses. What no one is stopping to consider is that this is a brand new game and there are likely to be more stealth items added, and some that are available now, might not remain so in the future. Are you going to be upset when they add another item that adds to stealth that would have meant you could have trained a few less times in stealth?<br>

<br>
A) they can't add more items that would change the level of stealth you can get from items.  The cap is +11.  So there could be an item with +50 stealth and I would still cap at 11.<br>
<br>
B) this change would force melee rogues to spec to 50 in stealth, that means we will have less of everything else which means we will be less effective at melee, which ultimately means we would all be less effective.  Right now it is GREAT for our class that we do NOT have to spec past 39 or 40 in stealth.  That saves us a LOT of points to use in other skills.  We should all be very, very happy that we DO not have to spec to 50 in stealth.<br>
<br>
You obviously are not level 48+ so you would not be effected by this, but instead you would benefit from it because you would end up with a better rogue then those of us that already got to 50 first.<br>
<br>
I don't think they will ever offer a respec.  I have already been forced to re-roll once before because of flat out WRONG information that Mythic gave me about their own game.  The melee rogue was put into the game something like 2 weeks before the game was released.  I have been beta testing for them for months, to now change the way I have to spec to get the best stealth would be very, very wrong.  This is an unfinished class, and I would quit immideately if they made this change without offering a respec at the same exact time.<br>
<br>
It has been a torture to get to where I am now.  The melee rogue is very, very weak against monsters.  Gaining these levels was extremely hard, and it would be brutal for Mythic to now punish those of us that have suffered so long by changing the rules of stealth.<br>
<br>
Until Mythic puts re-spec in (if they do this at all) then these changes would be really, really bad.<br>

<br>
I am calm.  You asked for people's opinions, and I gave mine.  I did not insult you, or go nuts.  I simply gave my opinion.<br>
<br>
However, I do consider this to be a VERY important issue.  I consider stealth to be the ONLY, and I mean only thing that makes a melee rogue viable in RvR at all.  We absolutely have to have the absolute stealth to be effective.<br>
<br>
If at level 50 I suddenly discovered that I would never be able to have the absolute best stealth possible then I would be gimped because this is the most important skill.<br>
<br>
That is my opinion.<br>
<br>
I think Mythic has made some really bad choices with some class changes.  When they change spec lines they punish people that have been paying to beta test.  It is in bad form for them to do this.  A lot of people have quit DAOC because of this, and a lot more will quit if Mythic doesn't offer a respec or stop changing the spec lines.<br>
<br>
I understand that Mythic has to balance the classes, but since they did NOT do this before they released the game they have to be careful to not punish their paying beta tester customers (that's us).<br>
<br>
Just my two cents. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uannid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anni D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 6:07:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1991.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden test results, v1.45b</span><hr size=1> And we should all keep in mind, even rangers who were speccing pathfinding up to the 40s had stealth in that area also.<br>
<br>
39 stealth is pretty easy to come by. And their RPs grow faster than anyone's.<br>
<br>
Bow 39 (no high skills, 0 point to raise it *BIG MISTAKE THERE)<br>
stealth 39<br>
Melee 39<br>
path 29 (this is the new highest effective pathfinding for their quickness, and all they care about)<br>
<br>
that leaves them *guestimating* 150ish points to spend.<br>
<br>
Must be nice, covering all bases, and still having tons left.<br>
<br>
When dealing with stealth, remember that if anyone has a higher stealth, it will ALWAYS be the archer.<br>
<br>
archers should never been given stealth up to 50. That is the real problem. The current formula would work great if they were hard capped (with items also) at 1/2 or 2/3.<br>
<br>
But they aren't and that is why the game is so unbalanced and half the world hates stealth as badly as it does.<br>

<br>
At Stealth spec 32 (double the Detect Hidden spec), we could get Blending, which puts a maximum range on our detection just a bit larger than the current minimum detect radius.  The upshot would be a 50 assassin will see another 50 assassin just a little bit before anyone else, but a 50 assassin will see a 50 archer/minstrel long before that.<br>
<br>
That way we have the advantage in trying to find other stealthy types, without completely negating our ability to approach each other.<br>
<br>
Any high-level assassin serious about their ability to hide will have more than 32 Stealth, so there shouldn't be a need for anyone to respec. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ebullition>Ebullition</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 11:28:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1991.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden test results, v1.45b</span><hr size=1> In the new letter from Mark Jacobs he talks about having skills that come from Realm Points.<br>

Why not try to get your Detect Hidden I, II, III, and IV idea implemented as something off of Realm Points.<br>
<br>
After all Detect Hidden is a RvR ONLY skill.  And it makes sense that as you spend more time in the field fighting other players that you would learn more and more about how to detect stealthed players.<br>
<br>
It would NOT gimp those players that already spent their spec points or planned their characters to stop stealth at 39/40 and it would add something nice to get as we gain realm points.<br>

The 29th level quickness buff is one point lower than the 44. so it is now considered to be 29 is the highest to bother taking that line.<br>
<br>
29 is pretty easy to come by in the grand scheme.<br>
