Delve value: 5<br><br>Hypothesis to prove:<br>1&gt; Rain of xxx is a straight damage add of +z dps, not the +10% stated by Mythic.<br>2&gt; Rain of xxx is not stackable with each other, but sometimes with other damage adds.<br><br>Related hypotheses required for proof:<br>A&gt; Rain of xxx does not depend on styles<br>B&gt; Rain of xxx is identical for weapons with identical speeds but different DPS<br>C&gt; Rain of xxx is different for weapons with different speeds but identical DPS<br><br>Caveats:<br>The same MOB was not used for all tests.  Resistances could have caused minor variances.<br>Small testing set:  This test is not all extensive, and much more testing/logging would be be necessary for statistical accuracy.<br>Delve value truncates values, so WDC could be anywhere from 5.0 to 5.9<br><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Proof:<br><br>A&gt;  The following shows that styles have no effect on rain of xxx RAs<br><br>Shadow Crystal Mace, 15.6 DPS, 4.0 spd, 99 con, 89 qua, 94 dur<br><br>Nonstyled damage:<br>Avg: 103.3 ( 67 hits, 72-135 ) <br>WDC: 25.08 ( 40 hits, 19-33 )<br>ROF: 13.21 ( 28 hits, 10-18 )<br>ROA: 13.42 ( 19 hits, 10-16 )<br><br>Styled Damage:<br>Avg: 144.5 ( 15 hits, 108-184 )<br>WDC: 25.67 ( 3 hits, 22-28 )<br>ROF: 12.67 ( 3 hits, 11-14 )<br>ROA: 14.14 ( 7 hits, 13-16 )<br><br><br>This shows that regardless of the styles, the damage from rain of xxx does not increase. <br>There was a 40% increase in damage, but no increase in the damage adds (within <br>statistical limits for such a small test set)<br><br><br>B and C&gt; The following shows that DPS has no effect on rain of xxx, but speed does.<br><br>storebought rowan staff, 1.4 dps, 4.5 spd, 85 qual<br>Avg: 4.7  (80 hits, 3-6)       <br>WDC: 28.6 (41 hits, 22-36)<br>ROF: 14.8 (13 hits, 11-18)<br>ROA: 15.1 (12 hits, 12-19)<br><br>storebought ironwood staff, 5.9DPS, 4.5 spd, 85% qual<br>Avg: 21.8 (38 hits, 17-26)<br>WDC: 28.8 (5 hits, 25-32)       <br>ROF: 16.1 (9 hits, 13-19)<br>ROA: 15.1 (13 hits, 12-18)<br><br>storebought short sword.   1.5 dps   2.4 spd  85 qual<br>Avg: 3.15 (108 hits, 2-4) <br>WDC: 15.46 (48 hits, 12-20)<br>ROF: 8.63 (19 hits, 6-10)<br>ROA: 7.57 (21 hits, 6-10)<br><br>As you can see, the 2 staves, of identical speeds, with varying DPS give the same damage adds.<br>However, the shortsword, with nearly the same DPS as the rowan staff, but with a much faster sped, provides much less damage add from the rain of XXX realm abilities.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>2&gt;

If you do, ignore this. If you don't, this should clear up some issues.<br><br><br>1) Damage add delve value shows the DPS of the damage add.<br>2) Damage adds have a fixed damage per second, and are therefore not affected by any styles.<br><br>3) They are actually completely independend of weapon type, dps, con, quality, bonus, weapon specialization, etc.<br><br>4) The damage added each hit depends ONLY on the speed of your weapon, and nothing else.<br><br>5) To find the damage added each hit, multiply the DPS by the speed of your weapon.<br><br>I.e. 5.0 speed weapon x 10.0 dps damage add (theurgist)  = +50 damage per hit.<br><br>This damage varies slightly per hit, not sure if this variance is in any way connected to the skill of the damage-add provider.<br><br><br><br>Now I've never used the rain-type damage adds, and the description is somewhat unclear. It would seem logical that the strength of the damage add is calculated based on the DPS of the weapon (since the description refers to 10% boost), you can check this by delving the damage add  after casting it with different dps weapons equiped. Most likely the dps doesn't actually have anything to do with the weapon dps, and is 1-2 dps per level of RA skill (Mythic is lazy.. :P)<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3873.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3873.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3873.topic&index=1><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3873.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3873.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3873.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3873.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
