(conflicting reports) new zones, so I'd wager most of the planes listed will be in the expansion except some of the demi-god planes which seem like they would suck anyways.<br><br>Also, I didnt list planes which were already in game.<br><br>Please add/correct anything I am missing!<br><br>Enjoy<br><br>"--" designates a God<br>"---" designates a Demi-God<br>[] designates a guess of a plane's name<br><b>Bold</b> confirms the zone being in the expansion<br><br>1<br>-------------------------------------<br>Triumvirate of Water: Elemental Plane of Water.  Plane is broken into 3 sections (Ice, Vapor, and Water), each with it's own God. <br>--Tarew Marr (1st member of the triumvirate): God of Warer<br>--E'ci (2nd member of the triumvirate): God of Ice<br>--Povar (3rd member of the triumvirate): God of water in it's Vaporous state<br><br>Faction: Not said, Neutral I spose<br><br>Comments: 3 Gods in 1 plane will own, I am guessing Tarew will be the baddest mofo of the 3 guys, and povar the weakest. Only problems I see is that water and ice are the most annoying things in the game, could suck much ;p<br><br><br><br>2<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Air: Elemental plane of Air<br>--Xegony: a beautiful, young-looking, elfin female humanoid with angel-like wings<br><br>Factions: none noted, probably neutral<br><br><br><br>3<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Earth: Elemental plane of Earth. neutral plane. <br>--The Rathe: the rathe is a council of 12 beings all identically alike. If 1 is killed, then another member will re-grow in it's place. <br><br>Faction: Neutral<br><br><br><br>4<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Fire: Elemental plane of Fire.<br>--Fennin Ro: a large male humanoid with barbaric features including a beard of flame, glowing red eyes, pointed ears, and fangs. He is also the father of Solusek Ro.<br><br>Faction: short temper toward any who would dare to threaten the preservation of fire.. basically neutral I'd spose.<br><br>Comments: Everyone makes Solusek out to be a badass but the plane of fire is what give's solusek's plane it's power, and also considering fennin is his father, this plane sounds like itll be hard.<br><br><br><br>5<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of Sun / Plane of Flame:</b> gains it's power from the plane of fire.<br>--Solusek Ro: the Burning Prince, his father is Fennin Ro. wears a suit of golden ringmail and a crown of flame and wields a spear of fire.<br><br>Faction: Neutral, but has a friendly rivalry with Mithaniel Marr<br><br>Comments: Killing in this plane sounds as though you may lose faction with Mithaniel Marr, but probably not. I am looking forward to checking this plane out, note that on the deities page VI says he rules the Plane of Sun, but on the Plane of Power page, he rules the Plane of Flame. However, Fennin is noted as ruling the Plane of fire on both, so at least there is some consistency ;p<br><br><br><br>6<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of Justice:</b> a prison for people who have comitted crimes against the universe.<br>--The Tribunal: the tribunal is a council of 6 beings all identically alike and all carry a warhammer. The plane is only populated by the prisoners and by golems which serve as guards.<br><br>::Demi Gods::<br>---Zebuxoruk: he escaped from the plane of justice and ended up as a mortal man trodding the face of norrath, no note of where he may be now,<br> <br>Faction: Neutral<br><br>Comments: Sounds like one of the harder planes to defeat considering the prisoners must be fairly badass if they comitted crimes against the universe. Also, for the tribunal to even enslave these people means they must be even more badass themselves, not to mention there are 6 of em.<br><br><br>7<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of Disease:</b> dark and drippy with geysers of ooze and rivers of pus. The land itself looks, feels and even smells like decaying flesh, and is inhabited by all manner of evil creatures and undead.<br>--Bertoxxulous: his followers follow the art of necromancy, so maybe he is also a necromancer<br><br>Faction:enemies with Tunare, Rodcet Nife, Karana, Mithaniel Marr, and Rallos Zek<br><br>Comments: A plane with undead? omg. Considering he is enemies w/ Tunare maybe killing him will give my PoG faction back, one can hope anyways =\   The plane sounds boring imo.<br><br><br>8<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of the Underfoot: filled with all the followers of brell which are dwarves, runneyeye goblins, and splitpaw gnolls.<br>--Brell Serilis<br><br>Faction: allied with Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, and an enemy of Veeshan<br><br>Comments: Sounds like a nostalgic zone, being able to kill uber goblins and gnolls may be fun again =p  Wonder if the dwarves will drop axes to sell for phat platz. <br><br><br>9<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of Storms</b><br>--Karana: the rainkeeper, creates the rain, sandstorms, hurricanes, and one can assume other natural disasters dealing with weather.<br><br>Faction: allied with Tunare and Mithaniel Marr. Enemy of Bertoxxulous.<br><br>Comments: One can only wish the rain will stop across Norrath when he is killed :P Here is an interesting quote from the planes of power site, "help Karana regain control of the Plane of Storms".<br><br><br><br>10<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of [love?]<br>--Erollisi Marr: Sister of Mithaniel, daughter of Tarew Marr, and Queen of Love<br><br>Factions: allied with Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Tunare and Quellious. enemies of Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, Rallos Zek, and Bertoxxulous<br><br>Comments: No plane was noted for Erollisi so I took a guess, sounds like another boring plane.<br><br><br><br>11<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Valor: <br>--Mithaniel Marr: the ultimate paladin who wears a full suit of shining silver plate armor and wields a glowing longsword. Son of Tarew Marr<br><br>Factions: allied with Erollisi Marr and Karana. Enemies of Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, and Bertoxxulous. Has a friendly rivalry with Solusek Ro<br><br>Comments: Why do all the good planes sound like they are going to suck?<br><br><br><br>12<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of [oceans/seas?]<br>--Prexus: the oceanlord<br><br>Factions: allied with Rodcet Nife and enemy to Bertoxxulous<br><br>Comments: water sucks. I'm not looking forward to this place.<br><br><br><br>13<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of Tranquility:</b> the gateway to deeper planar realms. Peace reigns supreme here and adventurers will not be able to engage in combat or use offensive magics.<br>--Quellious: a child-goddess. <br><br>Factions: allied with Rodcet Nife and Erollisi Marr. enemy to Rallos Zek and Innoruuk<br><br>Comments: I wonder if dark elves that honor inno will be kos in the plane even if there is no fighting/casting ;p<br><br><br><br>14<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Health<br>--Rodcet Nife: The Prime Healer. Followers of the Prime Healer take a solemn oath to fight disease and death until one or the other finally claims them<br><br>Factions: allied with Karana, Quellious, Erollisi Marr and Prexus. enemy is Bertoxxulous<br><br><br><br>15<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of War:</b><br>--Rallos Zek: the warlord<br><br>::Demi-Gods::<br>---Tallon Zek: a master of strategy. He is a tall, older-looking orc-like being, who appears to be very wise, with good cause. He wears a set of sturdy steel plate armor without a helm, and carries his famed obsidian war bow<br>---Vallon Zek: a master tactician. an older, muscular, physically strong male orc-like figure who wears blackened chain covered by an emerald and black cloak. he bears a silvery saber, which he has been said to wave when explaining tactics to others. <br><br>Faction: allied with Innoruuk and Cazic-Thule, enemy to Quellious and Bertoxxulous<br><br>Comments: Another zone I am really looking forward to. 3 gods/demis in 1 zone, plus the loot they are described to be having is enticing :P<br><br><br><br><br>16<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of Nightmare:</b> A forested region, a wilderness of terror, the Plane of Nightmares will steal the sleep of many adventurers.<br>---Terris Thule: known as the Dream Scorcher or the Nightmare, for her effect on the sleep of dreamers. She is well over six feet in height and skeletally thin. Her skin is pale with hints of gray. Long, black fingernails extend from her bony hands, to match her slinky gown. Her face is smooth - no features mar its sleek surface other than two empty black eye sockets. Long black hair flows back from two massive brass horns at her temples.<br><br>Faction: None noted, probably neutral<br><br>Comments: forested region... hope VI doesnt make the trees sway heh. This zone screams PoM just with a horror theme.<br><br><br><br>17<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Dreams:<br>---Morell Thule: Lord of Dreams. nearly seven feet tall and well built, he has handsome and youthful features. His body habitus is that of a pure white centaur with the tail of a lion. His silver hooves sparkle constantly because of the unicorn-like horn on his brow. That horn is not made of hair as with most such protuberances, but is purely a thing of light. His long hair grows down his spine and ends in a glistening white mane which, with his pale skin, set off his beautiful green eyes.<br><br>Factions: None noted, probably neutral.<br><br>Comments: Since no other zones except South Karana have centaurs, perhaps we'll see a return of the creatures in this plane ;P<br><br><br><br>18<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of [madness?]:<br>---Vazaelle: An erudite necromancer. was a dedicated devout Cazicite, though a combination of religious zeal and prophetic visions stripped from her any semblance of sanity<br><br>Factions: she worshipped Cazic but nothing on enemies/allies. probably Neutral.<br><br><br><br><br>19<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Greed:<br>---Torvonnilous: he sits and plots ways of gaining even more treasure than what he already has. Though he wears numerous articles of jewelry crafted of all sorts of precious metals encrusted with every type of gem imaginable - earrings, amulets, brooches and much more - he is never satisfied. He is male in appearance, of medium height and slight build. He wears a suit of finely woven, green-and-yellow-embroidered red silk cloth. His face is clean-shaven, though not particularly handsome, and in one beringed hand he bears an obsidian cane with a platinum dragon's head upon the top. <br><br>Factions: none noted, probably neutral<br><br>Comments: sounds like a plane of many phat lewtz.<br><br><br><br><br>20<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Pain: a hot, damp and uncomfortable place with no flat surfaces on which to walk. Instead the ground is cluttered with small, closely placed, stalagmites of smooth obsidian<br>---Saryrn: a woman of striking beauty. Saryrn busies herself by spending personal time with those cursed enough to live in her realm. She captures and torments her subjects mentally and physically and completely at random. The length of their torment before she releases them again, is also completely random - based mainly upon her whims.<br><br>Factions: None noted, probably neutral.<br><br><br><br><br>21<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Magic: In its natural state, it is an infinitely expansive plane of perfect white and unblemished marble under a gray and featureless sky, though one would likely never glimpse her plane in such a state. Through the will of Druzzil Ro, her home takes the shape, form and features that reflect her current mood. Her plane is simply a canvas for her art. <br>---Druzzil Ro: has white hair which is held back from her face by a massive platinum crown with a single white gem that blazes like a brilliant white star upon her brow. She is tall, youthful in appearance, with a resemblance to Erudite in skin and body structure.<br><br>Factions: None noted, although Ayonae Ro was created by Druzzil.<br><br><br><br><br>22<br>-------------------------------------<br>Plane of Music: Ayonae Ro is able to mold and shape the very realm in which she lives, much as her mother does with her own magical skills. <br>---Ayonae Ro: Created at the whim of the demi-goddess Druzzil Ro for the purpose of creating music to soothe the soul<br><br>Faction: None noted, Druzzil Ro is her mother however.<br><br><br><br>23<br>-------------------------------------<br><b>Plane of Knowledge:</b> New Tanaan is a city-state that exists outside normal physical and political boundaries, a haven of knowledge for those who seek it.<br><br>Comments: A planar city meant to be used as a hub for players to get to the other planes. Players of all levels will benefit from the Plane of Knowledge that hosts scores of new quests and opens portals to Norrath making travel easier than ever <p><table width="1%" border="0">  <tr>     <td width="3%"><img src="http://www.harmonium.net/filespace/Fawy/monksig.gif"></td>    <td width="97%" valign="top">       <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.harmonium.net/profile.asp?id=Fawy">Fawy<br>        Grandmaster</a></font></b></font><b><br>        <font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Harmonium<br>        </font></b><b><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Xev         </font></b> </p>      </td>  </tr></table></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umoku.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moku</A> at: 3/23/02 9:02:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unimmbull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimmbull</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 12:58:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Compiled Planar Information</span><hr size=1> Thanks.

For example, if you killed an efreeti in the Plane of Fire, you would lose faction with PoF mobs (obviously) but gain faction with the Plane of Water, fire's opposing element.  This would also go with Earth and Air.  This creates a balance on the &quot;Wheel of Order and Discord&quot;  so no one element would be too powerful.  Water (an orderly element in my opinion) would counter any moves made by Fire (discordant in my image).  Such actions are demonstrated in the cleric epic quest.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert your 2 cents here&lt;&lt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uhalbar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 1:58:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gws.gamefactor.net/gwsportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Diety Factions</span><hr size=1> I think Norrath itself is actually the plane of earth. <p><c><BR><img src="http://gws.gamefactor.net/halboat.jpg" alt="Halbar Manaman - Level 55 Troubadour of Darkholme"><br>Halbar Manaman<BR>Level 55 Troubadour of Darkholme<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71027"><My gimp gear.</a></c></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithrilsboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithrilsboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 2:11:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Diety Factions</span><hr size=1> Norrath itself would be the Prime Material Plane<br><br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit: Please read our sig/personal pic rules. - ShadowCross</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/24/02 4:38:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugupwin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gupwin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 2:30:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Diety Factions</span><hr size=1> My main being a Karana worshiping druid, I did as much research as I could regarding my diety.  Karana is, as you will note, the RainKeeper.  From the dieties page on the EverQuest website:  &quot;...it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.&quot;  In other words, if Karana wasn't around, then all of Norrath would be consumed by flooding.  Sounds to me that if Karana dies, we're all gonna be swimming for a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ullanoldarlluindar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llanoldar Lluindar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 8:31:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Rodcet's plane is the Plane of Health.<br><br>It says that in a note from the Qeynos Cleric guild for some purpose or another, i think its the note that Brother Estle gives you if you hail him and follow the cues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upulid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pulid</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/communtychest.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 9:09:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> this bears no resemblance to D&amp;D planes right? <p><a href=mailto:pulidsongbird@hotmail.com>Pulid Songbird </a><BR><TABLE STYLE=filter:GLOW(color="red",strength=#+2)> Grand Bard Pumah</table><I>If your chair is broken, fix it!~Victoria Froeer</I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umoku.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moku</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 9:10:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I find it interesting that bertoxx is allied with noone, yet enemies with 7 other gods, 2 of which he doesnt even consider as his enemies -- Prexus and Erollisi Marr. <br><br>I am betting PoP will have some really intricate faction setup which will be an annoyance beyond what velious was. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utearerunebreaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teare Runebreaker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 9:44:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Compiled Planar Information</span><hr size=1> from what i have read i always assumed a couple of gods and demi gods shared a plane . like how rallos zek shares his plane with his sons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/23/02 11:33:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Compiled Planar Information</span><hr size=1> Here's my speculation I posted on the Vazaelle message boards...<br><br>Ok from reading through everything the planes to be added are as follows as evidenced so far...

First off there will be two city zones and 18 raiding zones. For a total of the 20 new zones talked about on the PoP web page on 3/22/02. (It says 18 new zones to fight in now.) Here’s how I see them all looking:<br><br>1. Plane of Knowledge (City/ Portal/ Quest Zone) lvl 1-60<br>This zone is likely to be the only zone non-lvl 45 players can use. It will make traveling around Norath and Luclan easy.  Hopefully, all you’ll need to do is click a portal stone. It also will provide quest for every lvl. It is the ‘Plane of Knowledge’ so it only makes sense that this will be a zone loaded with quest. These quest and the availability of easy travel is hoped to make PoP appealing to every lvl.  I’d also wager this zone will be the starting zone to if not all most of the other planes.<br>2.  Plane of Tranquility (City Zone/Quellious)<br>Not a fight zone. Looks like this will be the gateway to the high-end planes. This will be the zone were all of the buffing and prep work will be done before heading into those really bad fights. You will be able to bind in this zone, but I doubt it will have a port into it. The best thing about this zone will be the easy access to coffins and buffing gems. The Monk ultimate weapon quest will be in this zone.<br>3. Plane of Water (The Triumvirate of Water &amp; Prexus)<br>Looks like you’ll need to progress past each Triumvirate to reach Prexus. This zone will be accessed through the portal at the bottom of the lake of  ‘The LoIO’. <br>4. Plane of Earth (The Rathe)<br>The Rathe look to be similar to other fights where a tougher boss spawns out of the death of a lower lvl boss. Therefore, this will be a fight of endurance because you’ll have to take on 12 god fights one right after the prior fight and each of them getting more difficult. The BST ultimate weapons will drop or be quested out of this zone. This zone will most likely only be accessed through the ‘Plane of Tranquility’.<br>5. Plane of Flame (Soloseki Ro)<br>This zone will most likely only be accessed through the ‘Plane of Tranquility. This looks to be a high-end KoS zone. (Enchanters in Fire Elemental shape may be safe.) The Wizard ultimate weapon will drop in this zone.<br>6. Plane of Fire (Fennin Ro)<br>I’d wager this zone will only be accessed through the ‘Plane of Flame’ once Soloseki Ro is dead. Uber high-end KoS zone.<br>7. Plane of Justice (The Tribunal)<br>Neutral zone, with mid to high-end mobs. Weapons and armor in this zone should be nice.<br>8. Plane of  Disease (Bertoxxulous)<br>Light race KoS zone. The Necromancer ultimate weapon quest will start in this zone. <br>9. Plane of Storms (Karana)<br>Neutral zone, with caster items and major caster quest items. The Druid ultimate weapon quest will be in this zone.<br>10. Plane of Valor (Mithaniel Marr)<br>Dark race KoS zone, Pally dreamland with the final uber Pally ultimate weapon quest.<br>11. Plane of War ( Rallos Zek, Tallen Zek, Vallon Zek)<br>To get to the big guy Tallen and Vallen must be over come not by might but by brains. (I.e. 10th Coldian ring style.) This zone will be accessed through the ‘Plane of Tranquility’. Ultimate warrior weapon will need an item off each of these three bosses. KoS zone. Weapons and armor in this zone should be the best in game.<br>12. Plane of Health (Rodcet Nife)<br>Ultimate Cleric weapon will come from this plane. Neutral zone.<br>13. Plane of Nightmare (Terris Thesle)<br>KoS zone.<br>14. Plane of Greed (Torveanilous)<br>Neutral Zone. Rogue ultimate weapon zone. (Pick-pocketed and dropped items off of other zone bosses) Nice all around loot zone.<br>15. Plane of Pain ( Saryren)<br>KoS zone. This zone will most likely only be accessed through the ‘Plane of Tranquility. Ultimate SK weapon zone.<br>16. Plane of Magic &amp; Music ( Druzzill Ro, Ayonae Ro)<br>It sounds like the ‘Plane of Music’ will be a portion of the ‘Plane of Magic’ zone.  Bard ultimate weapon will come from the ‘Plane of Music’ section and the Mage ultimate weapon will come from Druzzill Ro. Neutral zone.<br>17. Plane of Love (Erollisi Marr)<br>Dark race KoS. Enchanter ultimate weapon will come from this zone.<br>18. Plane of Underfoot <br>This plane will be accessed through the portal at the bottom of ‘The Hole’. KoS zone. <br>19. Plane of Air (Xegony)<br>Neutral zone.<br>20. Plane of Dreams (Morell Thule)<br>Dark race KoS. The Ranger ultimate weapon will be quested from this zone. This zone will most likely only be accessed through the ‘Plane of Tranquility’<br><br>When I say ultimate weapon I mean the quest or item that will be needed to up grade every class epic. Since Verant has been hinting that they will install a method of making every classes epic truly epic it makes sence that it goes into this new expansion.<br><br>Finally, I’m just guessing on all of this and I don’t have any special source so don’t think this is gospel, its just food for thought. I can’t wait to see what they actually do.<br><br>Gaylon Dragonsong 60 SH<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugaylon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaylon</A> at: 3/25/02 11:22:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueldaneshsolro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldanesh SolRo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/26/02 5:29:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22991.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A bards thoughts on PoP.</span><hr size=1> Think Plane of Flame/Sun has his entrance in Shadeweaver's Thicket...
