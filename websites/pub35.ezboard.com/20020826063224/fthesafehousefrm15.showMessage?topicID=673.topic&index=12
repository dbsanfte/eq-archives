A member of my guild is currently lodging a formal complaint with his superiors for Blixtev's conduct. Not sure if it will help any, but its worth a shot. Especially considering what happened to the poor guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There are also about 6-7 other complaints ive heard regarding Blixtev, most of them for minor things, but they are all things Lyndro would have taken care of without hesitation. You really dont appreciate a good GM until you are hit with the rejects who are bumped from other servers. Blixtev is originally from Prexus, and is not missed at all.<br>

There can be harrasment on PvP servers, but this not the case here.<br>
<br>
Corpse Camping is one<br>
Bind Point Camping is another<br>
<br>
But here was a case that happens every day on Rallos, and why so many like Rallos.<br>

Is it harassment? Perhaps. But according to Verants own rules it is *LEGAL* harassment.<br>
<br>
Bind camping is still illegal on Rallos Zek, but when someone complained to Blixtev about being bind-camped about a week ago, he watched them do it and told the guy to &quot;Find a safer place to bind.&quot; heh<br>
<br>
So you really dont know what is going to happen when you deal with GM's... Just because something is a &quot;Rule&quot; dont mean it will be enforced. I even remember when Lyndro was brand new on Rallos and came to us and said &quot;No PVP is allowed in the planes.&quot; after we slaughtered 15 or so people in Fear. (shrug)  <br>

<br>
Lyndro said that no matter what happens he wasnt going to do anything.  PB had all their pet casters guard the way in and everyone else zone out, Two hours later the pet casters were using their pets to bind camp all the reverants bound at the fear entrance and were camping the corpses of 90% of reverant that were logged in.  <br>
<br>
Everyone was wondering why nobody was exping anywhere and they couldnt find groups I was too until I listened to guild chat and got a TP into fearoot and ran right through all the reverants and zoned into fear (still alive MUAHAHA).<br>
<br>
They ended up petitioning and Lyndro told us to let em go.<br>
<br>
Yep that does mean he went back on his word within 3 hours.<br>
<br>
Another time Reverants were trying to get a rogue epic (soon after they were discovered) in kith woods and PB wanted to get an epic too.   Some PB's (myself included) zoned in and started destroying every straggler that tried to join their raid comming from the misty TP and the WC TP, only one or two made it past us.  We were getting people together to TP in to defeat what of the raid got together before we got there and Lyndro showed up and said the (bluebies) reverants petitioned us for trying to mess up their raid when they didnt even have one yet.  They had like 20 people and werent even about to start anything for another half an hour at least....<br>
<br>
Anyway Lyndro said no PVPing there for 2 hours to our little group.  Ok fine, no PVPing for 2 hours.  Two hours later they still didnt start yet and Lyndro showed up again when we were killing the stragglers again.  Lyndro threatened to ban us.<br>
<br>
Again Lyndro sucks, his 2 hours were up so they were fair game right?<br>
<br>
At the enchanter BOTB, the first round he asks if the participants are ready and im checking everything still so I say &quot;kinda&quot; he says &quot;kinda?&quot; and I sit there for another 10 seconds or so straightening out my hotkeys etc and I say &quot;ok im ready&quot; then we fight blah blah the uberest enchanter on Rallos down in 10 seconds, im on to round 2.<br>
<br>
Same thing again with the kinda and the hotkey straightening and stuff, some other uber lvl 60 enchanter down and im on to the next round.<br>
<br>
Repeat all that over and over until im in the final 4.<br>
<br>
Final 4.  Are the participants ready? &quot;Kinda&quot; Lyndro: &quot;OK GO&quot; I get f)§&quot;/$)&quot;§/( ed up.  No hotkeys or anything heck I didnt even have the right spells up because I just got rezzed in like 10 minutes before and put up some of the wrong spells out of habit.  When he said go I was still sitting wtf?<br>
<br>
 My opponent in final 8 walked out of bounds BTW which is why I had to get rezzed.<br>
<br>
During other players turns Rykker was using jboots and players got screenshots of it and he was kiting the mobs, WTF?<br>
<br>
Rykker ends up winning the whole thing, congrats right?  Nope all the players were sending him hate tells for letting Rykker cheat so Lyndro kicks Rykker out of the tournament and takes away the title Lyndro already said was his.<br>
<br>
Slurpee ends up winning the tournament (He was lvl 57 at the time by the way).<br>
<br>
I guess its cool to not screw all the people that Rykker JBooted against, but its OK to screw ME, it must be because I am PB.<br>
<br>
We didnt want to redo the whole final 4 we just wanted to redo the final 2, even though Rykker jbooted in his final 4 round also.<br>
<br>
A couple months later I get hit by some game bug and lose a corpse, Lyndro shows up and gets my corpse back, I tell him &quot;Guess that makes up for f§)&quot;/$)&quot;§ing me over in the BOTB huh?&quot;  Lyndro doesnt say anything and just leaves.<br>
<br>
Guess he knew he sucks huh?<br>
<br>
People in PB were telling me I was gonna be banned in a few minutes after I told them I gave Lyndro the big ol F&quot;§)/$&quot;§)( You but I wasnt.<br>
<br>
The next BOTB, the winners manage to get paired up with the losers count em 8!!!! times (including the final 2!!! he didnt even get that right WTF???) over the course of the BOTB.  His defense every time was that he was looking at the wrong lists or other such things... hmmm....<br>
<br>
I have very little respect for him, except that he has kept me from getting a warning or banning from anything questionable since then.<br>
<br>
One such questionable instance was when a bluebie guide got sad when a certain PB member made a comment in a petition that some GM was picked up off the street and had no clue how to GM and the whole PB ended up petitioning about GM's being prejudice against PB, a bunch of us got banned that day.  I was pretty vocal about it too but didnt get anything.<br>
<br>
Oh well I hope our future GMs arent so prejudice.  Here's to hoping another server GM F&quot;§)/§&quot;s me over and admits it and lets me tell things straight from then on with no reprimands because of it...<br>

Whether they had warnings or not.<br>
<br>
Believe me he DID have it in for PB, why I dont know, probably because so many bluebies petitioned us for owning them every few seconds.<br>
<br>
My hypothesis is this:  A_Lyndro01 says,  &quot;Since so many people petition about PB they must be evil&quot;.  Banning PB will stop the petitions and we can relax.<br>
<br>
Anyone else see anything wrong with that?  Anyone that actually saw the bannings happen want to spin it differently?<br>
<br>
Really, when I told my guild that I told Lyndro to F&quot;§$)&quot;(§ Off they were betting on how long before I went linkdead and couldnt use my account anymore, and they had me keep checking in every few minutes to make sure I still wasnt banned.<br>
<br>
Any other PB would have gotten banned for anything that even looked questionable to someone who didnt know the story.<br>
