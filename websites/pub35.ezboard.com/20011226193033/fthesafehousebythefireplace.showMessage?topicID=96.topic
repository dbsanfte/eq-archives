Some of you will understand the location I am reffering to, some will not...but I'll try to paint a picture for all of you...  <BR>   <BR> It was dusk, shortly after sun down. The air smelt of sulfer and rain from the spells of healing and spells of fire cast this evening. Myself and a small bunch of individuals had managed to hold the throne room against the onslaughts of Orcish renforcements which relentlessly portaled in from Brell knows where. I had loaded up on the leathery bracers the Legonares dropped and was getting ready to leave back for Kelethin, when I heard the sounds of a scrimish outside. I got off my seat on the table and ran to the window. There, clad in leather, was a female wood elf druid with absolutly huge...er ah staff, she had a huge staff and was doing her best to smack the spear-wielding monstrosity of an emmissary off of her. Between the sounds of parrying, grunts and thuds spells were quickly canted and fired off but it was apparant that this was a loosing battle. Without a second to spair, I leaped out the window, rolling to break my fall, landing behind the emmissary. I raised my shiny Stiletto of the Bloodclaw (Pausing to say a quick thanks to Wixramiablo who bestowed it upon me) and slammed it into the broad back of her tormentor. He whirrled around to meet my dirk and stiletto tearing him apart like a froglock on an oger's butcherblock. He quickly turned tail, and after deftly cutting his purse of coins, I finished him off with another dagger in the back. The druid picked up the emmisarys spear, and drove it into the ground next to him, noticed the lack of a purse and grinned at me. She then scampered off into the night, the light of my greater lightstone reflecting off her leather clad butt. What a woman!  <BR>   <BR> Post YOUR most roguish exploits! <p>---------------------<br>

Having spent MANY days in the zone hunting poison components or passing through on my way to Nagafen's Lair, I knew that quite often lower level druids and shaman's fought in front of Najena.    <BR>   <BR> I headed over towards the massive doors signifying the entrance to Najena's dungeon.  Sure enough, I saw a small party of adventurers including what appeared to be a troll shaman.  As I got closer, I noticed that the group was fighting a fire elemental, so i politely waited for them to finish before asking for the blessing.  I informed this party that I would be willing to donate a small sum for their efforts, but I was greeted with stony silence.    <BR>   <BR> Miffed by their rudeness, I changed my offer...  <BR>   <BR> &quot;Ok, could you infuse me with the wolf if I were to give you a bloodstone?&quot;  <BR>   <BR> To this, the troll grumbled &quot;Yes.&quot; and cast the spell upon me.  True to my word, I gave him the bloodstone.  As I turned to go, the troll sent me a belated thanks for the gem I had given him.  My response?...  <BR>   <BR> &quot;No problem.

He began to run into the desert, and naturally, I followed.  He was rooted, nuked, nuked.... etc until dead.  So, when I wander through the area again a minute later I was suprized to see the guard's body still laying there.  Naturally, I looted it.  Nice raw shortsword and a damaged militia helm (short swords sell for 1.5pp, pretty nice at lvl 10).  I did a /who and discovered a lvl 49 DE wizard in the zone.  A brief conversation was struck, during which I discovered that he liked dropping ice comets on the guards.  Fine by me.  The process repeated itself every couple minutes, and so i shortly had a nice collection of raw and bronze short swords.  Some human bard in the zone discovered a guards body while i was waiting for the free loot and decided he was gonna loot it.  After he &quot;stole&quot; that one I determined that I would not be cheated again.  Turns out the loot time is exactly 2 minutes from the time the other person loots the corpse till you get your turn at the left-overs.  I greatly suprized many a passer-by, by appearing at the instant of free loot and stealling &quot;thier&quot; easy corpse.  During  about an hour and a half I made about 15pp on free kills.  This was all well and good for me.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of PPing a rooted guard during the nuking process.  He uhhh... didnt appreciate it.  Luckily I was bound right next to the secret enterance.  So, from then on I took my easy money and kept my hands to myself.  Also looted three high lvl Necro research items.  All in all a good days wages.  No exp but a $hitload of loot.  For those who disaprove of my actions, I spent my off moment keeping several newbies alive.  Including a couple who were unconcious at the moment of my saving backstab.

Dissapointed from the people in CB and the way rogue life was working, I was ready to quit playing my rogue until the following happened. <BR>  <BR> Jcwine yelled out to all in the Crushboe camp &quot;Beware those at the entryway to the Greater Faydark.  Ambassador DVinn comes with his minions! All of ye who dare to help take on the foes rally at the tunnel! <BR>  <BR> Dissapointed in the days past events I go to set up camp.  My attempt was broken by an orc cenurion bashing away at my skull with his club. I began to poke at him as hard as I could with my rapier finely crafted of steel and combined with magic.  A fine weapon I must say to have acquired for free at the 14th season.  With a few well placed jabs 'twas dead in a short time.  A massive storm of Orcs all came runing in quickly followed by tons of warriors, clerics, rangers and yes even fellow rogues.  All stood and began to fight everything in sight.  No one in the Crushbone camp had experience for more than 19 seasons of battle.  In time and with a few deaths in the process, most of the orcs were gone with the exceptio of a few Legionairres and Emissaries.  We fought valiantly.  And with the beating I recieved I was worn down to only 75% of my life force remaining. Soon 'twas but DVinn and a few people valiantly trying to kill him.  It dwindled down from 6 to 3. One of them turned and ran passed the in-passable barrier to DVinn and entered the Greater Faydark.  As the warrior trying to go toe to toe with DVinn and his infamous dagger, he dwindles down to somewhat near 20 % of his life remaining before he would be but another corpse for the Orcs to feast upon.  The ranger who was supposed to be aiding fled to the Greater Faydark as well.  The amazing Dark Elf ambassador hammered away the warrior begged &quot;Please young Aalias, help me!&quot;  I rushed over to do what little help I knew I could before I had to flee.  I jabbed my dagger into the center of his back, but he hardly seemed phased and continued assaulting the warrior.  I saw a few shiny platinm sticking out of his pocket and swiped them.  Amazed he turned and looked at me only to give the warrior a chance to flee.  He continued to look at me without moving.  His only action was to put his had up to signal the orc centurions in the area to not interfere.   <BR>    The dark Ambassador spoke to me, &quot;Well young, Aalias I believe you were called.  It appears that you are the only one left.  All others have fled, but you are the only one remaining, cradling the wound you have.  You are no match from me and yet you dare to poke me in the back and seal my money?!?!&quot; <BR>   Trembling, I tried to be bold and replied, &quot; Young I may be, Ambassador.  But you are a mere Dark Elf.  Tunare will watch over me and Bristlebane will guide my Rapier directly to your black heart......through your back!  You as well are wouned and merely half of what you used to be.  I wll send your Dark self to the rock from under which you came!!!&quot; <BR>    He replied, &quot;Fool, now you will see the power of the Dark Elf Brotherhood!!!&quot; <BR>    With that he charged at me with his dagger.  Jabbing constantly trying to hit me.  He missed more times than I can count.  I dodged and bashed at his dagger with my rapier.  I landed  few well placed hits, weak but many in number.  Next came his line of success.  A stab in my shoulder, left torso and leg dropped me to my knees. He jabbed directly at my head but I parried with my rapier and held his dagger against the wall.  I looked him directly in the face and spoke, greatly in pain from his <BR> srength and hits, &quot;You dissapoint me Ambassador.  I would have thought you could at least bring some honor to the Dark Elves.  Is that all you have DVinn?!?!&quot; <BR>      &quot;Foolish wood elf BOY!!  Cunning and quick you may be but you are also weak and puny.  Watch as my dagger tears into your flesh!!!&quot; <BR>      The fighting continued, I dodged, parried and pierced his blue flesh, his blackish blue blood all upon my rapier.  I felt about ready to die but so did he, I could tell.  I landed my rapier straight through his belly.  He looked at me holding his wound and began to slowly limp away unable to run.  Blinded by the blood in his eyes from my pokes at his head, he walked right into a wall, he looked over his shoulder and said, &quot;Fool, my comrades will avenge me.  You shall have all the Indigo Brotherhood on your tail for my death!!!&quot;   <BR>     I thrust my rapier into his back, and directly through his heart.  I withdrew my rapier and on the end of it, his black heart.  His lifeless body fell to the floor.  I leant over and picked up his Dragoon Dirk from his hand, covered in both his blood and mine, I looked at the centurian standing near by.  Amazed, he fled.  I put my rapier in my bag and held the Dragoon Dirk trimphantly in my hand and proceeded back to my hometown to celebrate. <BR>  <BR>   OOC:  This was something that actually happened to me.  I survived the onslaught of orcs and was begged for help by a warrior.  I pick pocketed and DVinn turned to me as the warrior ran.  He atacked and because I didn't really care anymore, we fought with me having 4 bubbles of health and him a bit below 1/2 of his.  The nearby orcs didn't even interfere.  I parried and dodged more than I ever thought I would and landed many more hits than he did.  Eventually he began walking away and walked into a corner where I backstabbed him for the kill.

I was of the 18th circle and my party was of similar experience.  We had fought many battles to secure the throne room and ventured up to the tower where we knew Emperor Crush and DVinn awaited.  However, when we got there a pair of higher level casters camped in the middle of the tower.  They made clear their intention to take every kill.  They were quite rude, in fact.  We decided we could try to outdamage them or leave.  Our party set up camp in the courtyard where the centurions didn't pay us much mind.  I told my group that I would pull Legionaires and disappeared into the castle.  What they didn't know was that I snuck up into the tower unseen.  I waited while the casters threw every spell they had at a preacher.  When the smoke cleared, they sat down to meditate.  DVinn appeared before my very eyes.  While they stared at their spell books, I lept from the shadows, stabbed DVinn in the back and jumped out the window.  DVinn followed me down to the courtyard where my party awaited.  We formed a circle around the sinister dark elf while the casters cried having been wounded by falling.  After chasing DVinn to his corner, one member of our party became the proud owner of a dragoon dirk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kulwaen>Kulwaen</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local user</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/4/99 5:35:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The most roguish thing I've ever done...</span><hr size=1> This is great!  I just read this yesterday, and was inspired, so I did a very rogue thing.  I was grouped with four other people in the CB tower, and find that a lvl 50 pally was in the zone.  Varthanos, the pally, graciously buffed my whole group with valor and something else.  Post-buff I had 855hp (got a screenshot to relish in this day).  Of course, we were way over buffed to have 5 people, so one logged, and another left.  Then I was left with a wizzie, a druid (both my level) and Tinlaien.  Tin is a very friendly druid, lvl 36, and was just in the tower (not camping anything, just chillin).  We kicked dvinn around a few times, and the third time (we were rebuffed by same pally) the wizzie got all upset about dvinn hitting him and his 650hp.  We all had a laugh when the wizzie ran away.  But, I was getting bored and wanted more.  We clock the dvinn spawns, so when it got close to time, I asked Tinlaien if we would heal me if I soloed Dvinn.  He agreed.  So I disbanded (was the leader, so the other two were solo as well), right before the spawn and nailed Dvinn.  Even with my 850hp and Tin healing me and hitting Dvinn, my low leveled self got rocked pretty well.  I got the kill, plenty of exp, and a few unhappy ex-group members.  Alas, he didn't have the dirk, but if he did, I would've died like a champ, trying to pull off my most roguish act yet. <p>Kulwaen <br>

I go over to him and there was a bag lying behind him.  Being curious I picked it up but alas it was empty. Shrugging I put it into my inventory. A little bit later I was bored and killing all the green stuff around me near the West Gate while waiting fer me group. Since I was too lazy to go back into town to sell I shouted fer all the newbies to come to the gate fer free stuff.  I noticed among the five who mobbed me that there was the caster I &quot;borrowed&quot; from earlier.  I gave each newbie something (a rat's ear, bat wings, an orc scalp) then it came time fer the caster.  I nonchantly handed him his bag back and walked away.  About one or two minutes later I hear this shout &quot;You damn thieving dwarf!  You stole my bag!&quot;  Guess he finally figured out why I had bent down in front of him earlier. I calmly replied, &quot;No, you are mistaken.  It just looks like one you had.&quot;  He spammed me fer an entire hour after that.
