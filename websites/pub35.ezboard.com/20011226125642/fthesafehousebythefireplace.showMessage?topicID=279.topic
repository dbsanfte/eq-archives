Now that I have cleaned Guk's terrible stench from my body, I feel I can share it with you.<br>
<br>
Earlier tonight, I finally achieved my Fifteenth Dagger of rank. It was in the slave caves of Crushbone, where I had just finished meeting with my contact, Kelynn. I returned to Kelethin with the information that Lady Geeda desired so much, and she was ecstatic to recieve it. She was so thrilled that she rewarded me with my fifteenth dagger on the spot, and she hinted that I might have another job that I would find very fulfilling. I was completely in the dark as to what she meant, but I was in the mood to celebrate.<br>
<br>
I decided to venture over to my longtime friend Laren, to have a few drinks and to ask him what Kelynn meant when he said that I might be able to get my Scout Blade from him. When I asked Laren about this, he merely smiled at me, and related a story to me. I must admit, it was a bit depressing to learn that the smith of such a fine blade was betrayed, but when he asked if I would Avenge the craftsman, I eagerly accepted. He gave me a golden token and told me to venture to Highkeep in the middle of Antonica, and to find a man named Fenn.<br>
<br>
I eagerly left the guildhouse after that conversation, when I heard a kind mage offering to teleport a few souls to The Northern plains of Karana. Having read my maps, I knew  that this was close to my destination, so I was asked to go with him on this ride. He accepted, and 30 minutes later, I was entering the halls of Highkeep. <br>
<br>
I didn't want to waste any time, so I immediately set to work finding Fenn. He wasn't anywhere to be seen in the upper levels of the keep, so I decided to look in the next most likely place, the dungeon. Charming place, but that's another story. After asking around with a few prisoners... and slaughtering a few others that chose to hinder my progress, I finally found where Fenn was hiding. Would you believe that guy was on the roof?!<br>
<br>
Well, I made the long trek up to the roof and spoke with him. It seems that to Avenge the craftsman of The Scouts' fine blade, I had to find and slay a man named Xentil. He was a truely vile man, I found him down in the inn a few minutes later. Thankfully, his guards were gone, and he was easy to dispatch.  The poor fool, he turned his back on me to run, and it was all over for him... Ah well, that's what happens when you cross one of the Scouts of Tunare!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was heading back to Freeport, when I heard discussion of a group that wanted to head to a place called Guk. Now, I had heard stories about this place, but when they started talking about it, I knew I had to see the place for myself. Also, between you and me, I was dying to see if I could get my hands on a rare mask from Guk's depths. Perhaps you've heard of it? The Mask of Deception, it grants it's wearer the form of our dark brothers and sisters.<br>
<br>
Xentil's head wouldn't sprout any legs to run away, so I quickly set off towards the Froglok's home. The creatures of that place regarded me warily, but I had never brought them harm, so they granted me the same privilage, and I had safe passage through the upper levels of Guk. I would have been lost for hours in that kingdom, but fortunately, I happened upon a mage who had finished his search for a set of rare boots. He was in a fine mood, and was eager to show me towards the deeper sections of the caves, to the ruins of old Guk.<br>
<br>
Once down there, I thanked him and set off on my own again. The creatures down there were amazing, albeit a bit disgusting. They were Frogloks, walking even through death. Fortunately, I was always skilled at avoiding detection, so it was very little trouble to sneak past all the dead things down there. I had heard directions from the mage, telling me some of the more interesting places in the ruins. But the only place I wanted to see was the room of the Legendary Froglok assassin. I had heard that he was the one who possessed the mask before Ancient Guk crumbled, and I prayed that it might still linger in his room somewhere.<br>
<br>
When I arrived in the room, it seems that there were others interested in the Assassin's relics as well, but since the stories said that only one such as the assassin could wear the mask and use it's true power, they promised me that I could have it when they found it.<br>
<br>
I was not there for long, we were all searching through the ancient room, when I heard a cry from the caster next to me, and the demonic croaking of a dead frog. I quickly spun to find the caster impaled upon another legend, the Assassin's Serrated Bone Dirk. I couldn't help but wonder if this was the Fabled Assassin from ancient guk, but that idle curiousity had to wait. Without a thought of what danger it would bring to me, I plunged my dagger into the undead frog's back.<br>
<br>
To both my pleasure, and my grief, I drew the thing's attention away from the caster, and a cleric was able to save the man with several quick prayers. I however, was in over my head. The assassin's skill was more impressive than even the legends had said, and he put his fabled blade into me three times. Truely, I thought I was going to see Tunare, but the other members of the party were not going to let me die after I saved one of their friends. I blacked out from the pain, but when I woke up, the Assassin lay dead next to me, and the cleric of the group smiled at me.<br>
<br>
Oh, I had several questions, but before I could ask any of them, the caster took my hand and pressed the Assassin's dirk into my hand. I was stunned! This was a legendary blade, and he just gave it to me! He told me I should take it, after all, I saved his life. The rest of the party agreed, and all I could do was smile and hug the man who's life I had saved. <br>
<br>
Admittedly, I think that was all I could take... after completeing a job, avenging one of the Scouts' finest, seeing the ruins of an almost forgotten culture, and nearly being killed by a legendary assassin, I wanted to head home. But, before I left, the leader of the party cleared his throat and told me that there was something else he'd wanted me to have. I could only blink as he kicked the assassin's corpse onto it's back, and what did I behold but the mask that I had wanted to see in the first place! They were glad to let me take the artifact, and my heart's dream was complete. I quickly knelt, and with trembling fingers, I took the mask from the creature's face, and donned it myself.<br>
<br>
The party all wished me good luck as I left, and I began the long trek home.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
OOC: Yes, this is a true story. I finally got enough faction to do the Scout Blade quest, and I dinged from completing the scout cape quest again. Thanks to that teleport (Which wasn't as cheap as I made it out to be), I was able to kill Xentil almost immediately. Since the Mask of Deception is a no-drop item, I wanted to see if I could get it, and people really do let newbies pull it off the Assassin's corpse. But probably the pinnacle of the night was when the Assassin showed up with the dirk, and the party's tank was chasing down a Tsu Wizard. I Did pull it off the main caster of the group (who was at dangerously low HP thanks to a train), and I did get knocked out by the assassin. But the party took down the assassin, and out of gratitude for keeping their party together, and preventing XP loss, they let me have the dirk. Of course, when the assassin spawned again not 5 minutes later with the mask, I thought my heart was going to stop. This has to have been the best night I've ever had playing EQ... All in all, it wasn't a bad night for a mere level 15, don't you think?<br>
