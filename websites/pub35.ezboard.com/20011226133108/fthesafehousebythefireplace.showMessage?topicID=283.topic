Around it were nearly a thousand of Noraths fiercest dark elven mercenarys. So intent on bringing down the closest stronghold of good to their homeland that they had hired the services of The Shadowed Ones. A dozen assasins were with Scree this nite, cloaked in illusion of the powerful enchanted item they each carried which gave them the appearance of dark elves.  The mercenary leader was the only one who knew of this guilds true appearance but wisely kept it to himself. The deal was simple, the humans and all others would die in the keep this nite, but Scree and his band would be given a fraction of the loot gained from their assistance. So, while the dark elf mercenaries forces clamored about below the fortress keep of Highhold, Scree's men and women began to get to work.  <br>
<br>
        Behind the master of the Shadowed Ones followed in tight rank and order Aliia and Kayos. The two beautiful dark elf lasses were probably one of few ways men would enjoy dying to. Scree trusted them now with his life as he led them closer still to the walls of Highhold. Failure entailed death to his band and he would have none of that this nite. Shadows of course cloaked their passage, with only the faint murmurings of a breeze marking their wake. A brief hand-signal notified the two assasins behind him to hold and wait. Above the three of them a guard was watching the fireway. Another joined him, both clanking away in the cumbersome armor they both wore. So close were the three rogues to the two men that they heard every word they spoke. &quot;Ye think they gonna be coming tonite Morl?&quot; one of them asked. &quot;Nah damn darkies hate the smell of stone walls I heard,&quot; both of the men chuckled and resumed their patrol.  Scree found it slightly odd the men would be joking with so many foes laid before them, but figured it a passing idiocy. These men would have to die. Again Scree signaled, this time the two behind him broke away from his flank and went after the two. A short moment later both returned, Aliia having only a slight line of blood on her cheek. Scree wiped it away and smirked. The three in quick fashion cleared the tops of the wall. The guard had recently changed and another would not come to check on them for hours now. Time enough indeed to ensure their mission was completed.  Scree paused for a moment then, calling upon a jewel he had kept in his belt pouch. He spoke into it briefly and was rewarded with a visage of Huth and behind him the rest of their band. The jewel sent images back and forth between its partnered jewel, no sound was carried but that was fine for the silent band. A hand signal sent the okay symbol to Huths group and shortly after all dozen rogues stood upon the walls of Highhold. All twelve of them faded then, six following Scree the others with Huth. No alarm was sent up so efficient were his men and women. From the grounds below Highkeep, a certain Dark elf leader rallied his troops. Soon enough the gates would be opened to his waiting troops. . . .<br>
