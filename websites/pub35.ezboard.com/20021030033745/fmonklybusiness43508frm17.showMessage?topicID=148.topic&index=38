If Verant wants to go for another round of heavy mudflation with PoP and does a preemptive strike on monk abilities because of a minority of monks, then no it's not even remotely justified to put the whole class at sixty on a lower defense table and penalise thousands of monks without 1600 ac and 4700 ac.<br>
<br>
Is an easy solution, it's a quickie answer to mudflation but it definitely doesn't scale well.<br>

Scaling the AC cap would have been rational, not screwing thousands of players through the defense table. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udeirdresadiqa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deirdre Sadiqa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 717<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/11/02 5:39:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Archery damage is shown at the mob, not at the one firing the arrows.

Anyway, it was Gyrospherus who parsed it. Take issue with the mage if you want, but Locz himself said in groupchat at the time &quot;We've got this one, my bow is on fire...&quot;  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=192025  >Sensei Deirdre Sadiqa</a><br>

As I said, I spent 45 AAs getting AM3/EQ, another 12 AAs after that getting CF3, so I have 57AAs invested in maximizing my archery output, and another 9 AAs in Ambidex, and another 6 AA in spell casting fury (I landed two critical nukes for 750s which probably have been included in Gyro's non-melee total even though he wasn't recording spells).  I also have the very best archery gear setup (other than VT) and full ATK buffs up.  I procced Avatar before the fight.  I used my Trueshot disc for 2/3 of this fight.  Since I was the raid leader, I gave explicit instructions to keep the MOB centered in the room and not touching a wall.  I also have most of our casters finally trained not to levitate in front of MOBs (an annoying thing they do which blocks all arrow shots).  Our raid here was done with minimal forces with poor gear (half of the raid force was applicants) and inadequate healing.  When Doomshade finally died, our healers were OOM, and though very few had died, we were at the verge of a wipe.<br>
<br>
So far I have chosen to spend a full 70 AAs completely on offensive abilities (AM3/EQ/CF3/SCF2/Ambidex/MC3) and ZERO AAs on my defensive abilities (other than regen).  I am very unlike most other rangers in choosing this route of AAexp advancement.  I also have chosen the very best bows and weapons outside of VT.  I would hope, after investing a full 70AAs on offense, and after training a guild to keep a MOB centered and with a clear line-of-sight, that I should in the best of cases be capable of huge DPS.<br>
<br>
Let me remind you that Manaburn for a wizard takes only 17 AAs.  I had to earn and spend a crapload more AAs to get an offensive output similar to a caster class.<br>
<br>
Please don't think what I accomplished with the best gear and 70 offensive AAs is representative of a "typical" ranger's damage output.  My equipement and AA setup is clearly far far better than 99.5% of rangers out there.  Rangers without these AA or archery gear will do warrior-level damage, a lot less than a monk.<br>
<br>
I question the original intent of posting this log.  Was it ranger-envy?  Was it to nerf the 0.5% of rangers who piled 70 AAs into offensive abilities?  Was it to imply that monks suck because 0.5% of rangers can situationally do very good raid damage?  Was it to nerf a ranger who had to spend 70AAs to finally get a similar dps as a MB wizard or mage (who BTW had to spend far fewer AAs and dont need fancy gear)?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - I think it SUCKS that monks got nerfed.  But please don't ask that rangers get nerfed because your class got screwed.  Rangers never lobbied to nerf monks.  Never.<br>
<br>
I am rather certain Gyro's 2-boxed shaman cast avatar on his epic pet (he very often does).  Note that the magician Gyro (about 30 AAs) easily outdamages a ranger with 70AAs and the best gear.<br>
<br>
Here is Gyro's original post, since some of you didn't believe my guildmate, Deirdre:<br>
<br>
"Gryo's Pet Proc = 5005<br>
Gyro's Pet Melee = 8461 <br>
Gyrospherus = 29852<br>

With miss data I think I topped 200 dps. <br>

AArrokk = 1168<br>

Orgil = 4099<br>
<br>
Orgil Tanked 56606 Dmg<br>
Aarokk Tanked 7891 dmg <br>
<br>
I went out of melee range a few times, I missed a little data and I missed some data from the start of the fight while aarrokk was building aggro on it. I also don't have procs and spell damage from others.. And I think the based on where gyro stood It probably didn't record melee opposite him also. <br>
<br>
I recorded 3:30 secs worth of melee.." <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=312390 ">

We are currently 4th, defensively, among melees and hybrids. It looks like they want to nerf us to last, but we don't do enough damage to make it worthwhile. I don't see anyone calling for an AM3 nerf, except for the safehouse whiners, it's fairly widely known how much damage it does anyway.<br>
<br>
The point is, Monk damage is not first, it's not even second...3 casters, 1 melee, and frequently one archer can outdamage us both short term and on long fights. So if our offense is not all that, our defense should be reasonably high to compensate. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=192025  >Sensei Deirdre Sadiqa</a><br>
