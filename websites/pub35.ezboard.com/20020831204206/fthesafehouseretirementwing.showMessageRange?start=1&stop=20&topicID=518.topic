I just logged on tonight and gave away most of my shadowknight's gear to a competent shadowknight main who deserved it far more than I ever did. I also went and deleted my trade mules, so it's just Kelthana left. When my account expires at the end of July I probably won't be renewing it.<br>
<br>
 Lately when I play it's either been a lot of frustration with my lack of ability to put together a group of friends for hunting, or a hell of a lot of irritation with the fact that my only options for high-level play are either wandering aimlessly in places I've explored a dozen times over or playing groupie to guilds that don't really need my help - I get the uncomfortable feeling that I'm lumping myself with the folks who hang out with the big guilds just for a shot at some loot. My idea of fun doesn't consist of being a lemming. <br>
<br>
The game itself isn't challenging and frankly isn't particularly new or exciting anymore. The only real reason to stay would be for my friends, and I'll make sure they know how to stay in touch with me(if I'm playing, I'll be on as Kel and easy to track down). Shadows of Luclin is coming out far too late, and my general lack of interest in the game stems from some very fundamental gameplay characteristics that won't ever change. I'll almost definitely be moving the Kelthana character over to a new game, probably Anarchy Online. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'll still be posting on the Safehouse, just not nearly as much as much as I used to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushadowcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_purplespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/01 1:45:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseretirementwing.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=518.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.succubus.de/sigpic_05mini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Taking a Break or Quitting...</span><hr size=1> *hug Kelthana*<br>

I had someone ask how I could give up 2 years of work and collected gear. I figure I'm coming away from a game with 2 years worth of memories and quite a few new friends that I will communicate with probably for years to come. It was a great journey, and I have no regrets about leaving.<br>
