Every time I get close to getting something I want, I find a way to %$#@ it up.  <br>
<br>
I've built up chars up to 30 countless numbers of times, only to delete them, and start over to *get it right* or whatever.  I don't know, maybe eq just isn't for me, but I really do enjoy it, and would love to see the best of what the game really has to offer.  <br>
<br>
I currently have a lvl 30 rogue, but recently after yet again deciding it was time to quit him, I gave away all my equipment and had him deleted.  EQ being the kind souls they are, reinstated him, as they have for other of my chars in the past, but without items.  <br>
<br>
So now, I'm lvl 30, full banded (few pieces of ornate chain gifted by a nice lvl 60 enchanter), harpoon of the depths and a dragoon dirk, and zero plat.  I'd love to do the burning rapier quest, but there's that money thing.  <br>
<br>
I play on E'ci which is an old server.  Believe me when I tell you that it is extremely embarrasing to be wielding such items.  I don't match up gear wise to what the average (no kidding here) level 15 rogue has on my server.<br>
<br>
Part of me just says aww to heck with it, but then I feel like I'm holding groups back b/c I can't push out the damage like those with decent weapons.  Since that's my main role in a group, I feel sorta, ya know.. impotent?<br>
<br>
Baahhh, then I think, oh just go play a freakin necro or druid and never worry about needing a group.  Problem with that is they aren't as much fun because 50 - 60 plane raids and such, you know, the really fun stuff, don't need them as much.<br>
<br>
Then I think.. (ok, so you can see my thinking in and of itself is dangerous by now) I should just create a new rogue, and give him/her all my current items.  At least then I could be respectable, well, sorta ;-).<br>
<br>
Sheesh, this is rambling extrodinaire now.  Any more ideas, however exotic or dangerous would be most welcome.  <br>
<br>
I have several other 25 to 30 chars that suffer from this same, destroy rebuild cycle thing btw.<br>
<br>
Humbly,<br>
<br>
Gerrek.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ubolep.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bolep</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 5:56:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23540.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A quandry</span><hr size=1> Hmm.. I had this same problem.  Infact, I too lost all my items, but in a different way.  It takes patience and time, but if you want you can sell all that you have for a high price, and buy other stuff for lower prices, then sell back again for higher prices.  If you see what I mean, every time you sell something you make money.  When you're fed up with it or you have enough money, search for the items that will suit you.  Don't buy items that you might get from different things, get items that you might not find in groups.  When you go hunt, go somewhere with good loot $$.  Don't loot everything, but ask the group if they could give you the small coins and useless (to them) items.  Sell them to vendors! Bank that copper, dont throw it!  Save all the money you can, and sooner or later, you will be up to par.

From your post you don't even know if the &quot;plane raids and such&quot; are your cup of tea.  Play to have fun if you don't have fun don't play.  Make 8 different classes till you find one you like if need be and don't worry so much about the gear it will come eventually if you place a commitment to leveling and actually getting high enough to do those raids you talk about wanting to do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shourt>Shourt </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 12:04:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23540.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A quandry</span><hr size=1> if u want to play rogue  just use ur level 30 one, go around pick pocketing giants, and even tho u might be a little gimp for average group they usually wont remove u so u can get exp/loot. just level ur rogue there if u wana play a rogue the money will take care if itself <p>'Would knowing who just submitted that post change whether or not you agree with it?' -Anonymous</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umomus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 8:50:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23540.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A quandry</span><hr size=1> I suggest you play your chars to 60 then delete because you put 2 points into STR that should have gone to STA. This way you don't have to delete as often.<br>
<br>
If you are deleting because of some percieved imperfection, then you might as well stop playing now because there is no perfect class/race/stat combo/soloability/raidability.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you can accept that the game mechanics are flawed and some are doing more with less. If you think people only like Ogres for warriors, then delete because you are &quot;too big in dungeons&quot; then something is screwy. If you play a Necro or druid to solo, then accept the risks of going LD/lagging in the middle of your pull. etc etc.<br>
<br>
I prefer to play with people who have the guts to play with inferior choices (like Gnome clerics and DE warriors) because they are playing for their own enjoyment, not what they read they should play from a message board.<br>
<br>
I still like the delete at 60 idea though.<br>

Level 30 is perfect for making lots and lots of non twink cash in FM, killn giants. In no time at all u can buy at the very least a Slimey Harpoon, and 10 damage 25 delay is just fine for decent backstabs.<br>
<br>
Stick with the rogue, u really are a desirable class at high levels , and yes u will be able to loot some really decent armor in sebilis when u are old enough. <br>

<br>
As a matter of fact, I did go to FM last night to fight.  Guess what I found...<br>
<br>
3 People all soloing giants.  No one else even around.  That used to be a hoppin place with lots of people.  But at least on E'ci, it aint no more.<br>
<br>
I sneak up near entrance and the first thing I see is a level 31 iksar frickin warrior soloing a giant, and he won.  I asked if he wanted to group and find a healer he said &quot;Naw, I'm ok as long as no adds come.&quot;  So I go back to LIO and see what's happening.  I zone in and a little gnome paladin is near the zone fighting a sarnak, he's lvl 25 so I figured he'd appreciate the group.  Then I watched him dismantle the sarnak in no time flat using a puny yet powerful 2hs weapon.  I asked anyway, and got &quot;No thanks, I'm ok&quot;.<br>
<br>
You know the song &quot;Where have all the cowboys gone..&quot;, well I was singing &quot;Where have all the level 30 people who actually group gone..&quot;<br>
<br>
So, wanting a solution, however misguided it might be, I logged out, logged on to the newest nonsplit pve server &quot;Vaezelle&quot; and made a Vah Shir rogue.  I actually had fun, so I'm going to stick with him for a while.  Honestly, I think the game on the older servers is really close to having a completely ruined economy, and completely disparate groups of &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots&quot;.  I've played on E'ci for a very long time, since release, and I know it took a very long time to see the economy and twinking get as out of hand as it is.  I'm hoping that Vaezelle will still have the feel of how the game (in my opinion) should be played.<br>
<br>
That's today's theory, always subject to change tonight.<br>
<br>
I do have one thing going for me though, if not decisive, I'm at least honest.  Bluntly, and to a fault honest.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for all the helpful posts, and as for the cynical ones, well it goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway, thhhbbbbt!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uravenwingedangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenwinged Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 9:53:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23540.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A quandry</span><hr size=1> WOOT!

Then after about 4 months, I made a druid, and I found they were super good at soloing early on, with their good melee and buffs, and then kiting.  I solo'd most of the time with the druid, but could group when I wanted.  The class was perfect for me, and I got it to 48 without much problems.  Sure I wanted to play other classes, but once i forced myself to play the class and level, I got to enjoy it more cuz I was a higher level.  So try just forcing yourself to level a little. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxodduzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xodduzz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/1/02 11:37:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23540.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A quandry</span><hr size=1> All the level 30s on E'ci are in OT... Just so you'll know it.. Kunrak exp on E'ci is mainly Loio 20 - 30, OT 30 - 40 DL 40 - 50ish, Kc 47 - don't know.. I'm only 48 so no clues where I'll go in a few levels..  As for the weapons, I'm used to level 10 rouges having better armour than me when I was 40.. at 45 I went to Rathe pick pocket for a while, sold some nice drops and decided it was time to renew my wardrobe.. And trust me the rogue class is just starting to become attractive at 48, people are actually shouting for rogues, when I'm used to having to pray I'm the only one lfg so they'll take me.. So I can't wait 'til 50 and then I got epic.. so just hang in for another 20 levels and you'll have fun :-P <br>
at middle 30's you can also go fighting in Lguk, ok exp nice drops.. Mask of deception for instance.. much needed for epic if you're a wood elf like me.<br>

<br>
Play the rogue you have.  Play with the lousy, piece of junk weapons you have.  If you enjoy the game and look forward to the high end game, jsut keep playing with the character you love most.<br>
<br>
You think people look at your stuff and laugh at you?  Maybe they do friend, maybe they do.  Don't quit.   Show em there's more to you than yer pixels.  One day you will show em pixels, and they will look at you and say, wow, he's come a long ways.  Look at all his stuff.  But what's more, they will look at you and remember how far you've really come and they will know that you have more than stuff - you have character.<br>
<br>
But hey, if stuff is what you treasure most, stick with this plan anyways, and you will get it.  Don't live to match up to your lvl, just push through to the next lvl, it's the hard part about the game, but it will pay off.  And then when you have enjoyed the fruits of all your labor you will get sick of the whole damn thing and go play NwN or some such.<br>
<br>
Trust me.<br>
<br>
It's true.<br>
