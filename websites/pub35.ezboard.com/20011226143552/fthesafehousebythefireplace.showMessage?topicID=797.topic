<br>
MY friend at school had been telling me about this wonderful game called Everness??? no it was Ever....ff....gg.....QUEST! yah EVerquest. Well anyways he kept telling me how his Necromancer kept leveling really fast (i was a casual D&amp;D player so i wasnt TOTALLY lost by this information). <br>
<br>
Problem was... the game cost 50 bucks, and i was flat broke. So while i was looking through web sites and such I read things about &quot;mobs in plane of hate&quot; It was the only thing i had read about that ever said &quot;mobs&quot;. I thought a &quot;mob&quot; was an actual Mob not a M.O.B. I started trying to show off my new found info with my friend by telling him i read that there were tons of stuff that attacked in masse in plane of hate, and that im going there as soon as i start the game. I wanted to see this monster mobs. Well he just laughed at me. Never told me the trruth either!!! <br>
<br>
Anyways so i finally get the game, and see in the lil booklet &quot;Bard: Jack of All trades&quot; and thought to myself &quot;Wow this guy must be really powerful!!&quot; So i started one in Qeynos. I began by running amok in the cities not knowing what i was supposed to do. Some random person told me to turn in that note that i got at the beginning. So i did.... to the wrong person. Thinking this was REALLY important i restarted this char over and over. Then i found out you can right click on it to read it. Finally found the place and gave the lead man a note. He started talking to me in White text and i about freaked out! he said my name!! Well i guess everyone in here is run by someone (ok i had NO CLUE how large the world of EQ was... for all i knew this is the only city) So i got this tunic... wow i have armor!! I finally wondered past the gates and found al these little creatures running about. I thought &quot;where are all the mobs? I dont see any large groups of angry people! hmmm. Well i guess ill look around&quot; I wondered around this area and then some other thing started talking to me and ran at me! I started using /say and talking to it only to be killed. (i now know this was one of those Gnoll NPC's) I thought... man these people are rude! Well i then realized that the gaurds looked cooler than me! I want some of that armor! So i attacked one. I got killed. I thought &quot;oh well now what&quot; i started playing the monkey see monkey do thing and figured out to attack those lil rats and bats and snakes (oh my!) I kept doing this for a while until someone handed me this REALLY SUPER DANDY COOL AXE!! it was a Mino axe!!! Wow this must be a great weapon if a great MINOTAUR uses it! (keep in mind minotaur's are usually like REALLY powerful in fables and some games) I kept killing things and so on gaining levels after levels. Till somebody goes &quot;dude why arent you using any of your songs? they help alot!&quot; I said &quot;Umm songs? How do you play songs... i dont ahve any instruments&quot; Well that guy (wish i knew his name) taught me a lot about the bard. <br>
<br>
I leveled up got to level 7. I went to Blackburrow only to be killed every other time i came in. Some random guy was &quot;porting to other places&quot; in Qeynos so I thought &quot;what the heck!&quot; And jumped in. Tried giving him a TON of cash.. and he just refused... i couldnt understand why he didnt want 4 gold!! Thats a lot of cash there!!! Well i ended up in West Commons. The nice cleric (hey he looked like what i thought a cleric looked like) told me to run! RUN AND DONT STOP! So i did. I ran...... and ran..... and ran..... till i came to a HUGE snake. It was called an ASP! I though &quot;hey, i killed grass snakes at level ONE this guy should be a sinch!&quot; So i attacked him, died and came back at QEYNOS. I found out the place i was at was named the commonlands. Well I wondered around for a long long long time, trying to get to the commons on my own. I FINALLY made it there and the corpse rotted RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! <br>
<br>
I decided to just quit that guy. Thats when i finally went to the TUTORIAL that comes with the game. I learned about quests, and conning and lotsa things! I also found out I could use a BANK to make my COPPER into SILVER or even PLATINUM! <br>
<br>
Thats when i made about 70 chars till i found one I liked.... My calling was as a OGRE SHAMMY! I found it SO MUCH FUN to be an ogre shm. I got tons of cash from the &quot;really powerful guys&quot; for being a funny lil ogre. I made lots of friends that were killing Bouncers. They would call me &quot;Uncle Nits&quot; and i'd talk in ogre-common to them and make funny ignorant jokes and such and id get to loot the bouncers. I started to kill things and quickly figured out the &quot;newby grounds&quot; and where to hunt. I then ventured into South Ro where someone offered me 50 platinum for a worthless cup (crude stein). Thats when it hit me! These things ROT in my hometown, and people pay all this cash for them! THATS GREAT! I was the richest ogre EVER! I had over 500 platinum by level 15. <br>
<br>
At level 15 i bought a few nick nacks and found out some items werent useable by me. In other words i bought worthless items and wasted all my cash. I started hunting orcs and then stayed in my favorite dungeon of all time CAZIC THULE. <br>
<br>
By this time i had a full friends list... i had been one of the head people of a newb but large guild, and even acquired a GATORSMASH MAUL. I was really making a name for myself and having a blast. <br>
<br>
Fast Forward a LONG time and i went through about 20 more cahrs. Finally finding a TRUE alt for my ogre shammy. I even made up a history for her and everyhting (being inspired by my friends all roleplaying guild) her name was Venrulus and i claimed her to be the TRUE Widowmistress (My ogre shammy killed the one in Najena often as revenge for earlier pains) <br>
<br>
And now, 2 years later, and after all the auctioning, talking, and wandering around i STILL dont have a char over 45.... and the funny thing is... all my friends have reached past 50 and either gone into &quot;uberguilds&quot; or retired hehe. <br>
<br>
Thats what really brought me here... maybe to find new friends and learn a few things about my rogue.... maybe learn some things BEFORE doing them hehe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=786.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.showMessage?topicID=796.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.emailToFriend?topicID=797.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.threadControl?topicID=797.topic><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/closeThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=797.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=797.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm17">Anarchy's Grip<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Outside Norrath<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousebythefireplace>By The Fireplace</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
