<br>
That, in my experience, is not quite the case. I am an untwinked level 47 Monk in a small under-50 guild, although some of our toons are second and third characters. My guild leader is a 47 Warrior whose previous main was a 58 Mage. Granted, I have spent most of the last 17 levels in Crystal Caverns and have about 20+K worth of gear, including a Tink bag, but he has, for the most part, better armor.<br>
<br>
The end result? Buffed with level-appropriate Clerical buffs, I have 1,030 AC (Defense only 222) and he is nowhere close to 1,000AC. With maxed Defense and wielding my AC weapons, I would be around 1050+.<br>
<br>
If I go to DL and group low blues, I can easily tank unslowed mobs in a chain-pulling 3-person group with a Druid and a Cleric. With slows, it's a joke. And yes, I get missed a lot and when I do get hit, I tend to get hit for max more than plate classes, but not enough to make me a bad tank. I do prefer to have plate classes in the group, but it's by no means necessary.<br>
<br>
Is it fair? I don't know. I suspect that it is at least somewhat unbalancing, although it sure makes forming groups easier. Since I can function as a MT and as a damage dealer at the same time, we can add more classes as they become available instead of waiting for a tank and a damage dealer to show up. Still, I can see why my guild leader is a little jealous of my AC. Good thing he is a great guy or else he would have probably made luggage out of my tail a long time ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Admittedly, things change some if the group needs to fight high blues or higher. Introduce me to a level 44-45 Greater War Boned Skeleton or a level 43-46 Forest Giant Ancient, and I get uncomfortable. Still doable, though, unless I lose agro and can't get it back because I don't have Taunt. Of course, I'd never dream of tanking on raids, but then there are usually higher level tanks available there anyway.<br>
<br>
So I guess my question is: Is this change going to affect moderately equipped Monks tanking LOW blues solo or in groups? Will it make tanking HIGH blues totally impossible? Or will it only affect the Monks who can tank on raids, ubers, etc? I don't think we know the answer to that, although it sounds like what they currently have running on Test is not going to change the whole &quot;Monks tanking low blues&quot; thing.<br>

Your defense is 12 points higher than his (if his is maxed), you have the iksar AC bonus (30 or more points visible AC at that level? I know there is a formula somewhere =p ), and you have two weapons that are both good weapons and add AC. The mitigation disparity (or equality) is not helped when most/all of your non visible slots have the same items in them that the warrior most likely has (spider fur, velium fire wedding rings, BSEEs), and most likely the 'best' haste option for both of you is probably the same item as well (SCHW).<br>
<br>
Even with all of that, I am rather suprised he 'is nowhere close to the 1000' ac mark fully buffed. My paladin was pretty ghetto (two pieces of valorium, treeweave, etc.), yet shortly after Kunark he could get over 900 AC without a shield at level 49, with 10 points less defense than the warrior should have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uabsoreq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AbsorEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>Alan VanCouvering<br>Community Relations Manager<br>Everquest</b></span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/11/02 1:23:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://everquest.station.sony.com/images/absor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ac soft cap</span><hr size=1> I just wanted to pop in and let you all know that I am reading these posts.

Thanks to those that have kept the discussion calm.  We all understand that these changes are going to upset folks.  It wasn't easy to decide to do this.

<br>
The original post was well argued and thoughtful. Thats a nice change from most of what i've seen here. I would like to add something with respect to &quot;balancing&quot; in general.<br>
<br>
Being a long term player since the beta I feel this change is just another in a very long line of class and item changes that have been placed upon the playing community without the benefit of input from the majority of those players that will be affected.<br>
<br>
I feel at this time even with new leadership Verant still does not have the insight to understand the &quot;average&quot; players game. A few reason I feel this way:<br>
<br>
Items: Who exactly is designing items and approving them? Why would a level 50 plus helm's only requirement be 20 defense? Why would the Scythe of Sundering, an easy one group encounter, be not level dependant? Thats a 80hp 13 20 with aggro proc weapon. I see a few level 15 warriors with those. /boggle The week my Druid starts camping the Manastone its removed. Too powerfull they say. Hmm, why the new mana conversion robe, especially with the Wizards epic!?<br>
<br>
Skills: Manaburn, what exactly did they expect with this? Certainly makes Wizzies more group friendly. With other Wizards. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Spells: DOT's were nerfed way back when. Friends left the game. Any reason to roll back the change as they did? KEI on level 20's? Soloers paradise!<br>
<br>
They are full of contradictions and excuses. Perhaps polls for players were put up on all of these issues. Did I just miss them? I never knew my Monk was a better tanker than a warrior. Every mid to high level raid i've been to the warrior was MA and another warrior, pally, or SK was SA.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, and take this with a grain of salt, is many of the changes made to the game are a result of lack of knowledge of what the average players goals and wants actually are. There always seems to be a knee-jerk over-reaction by the designers to right a perceived problem. In some cases perhaps they are right. <br>
<br>
The bottom line with an issue like this is whether the direction taken was the proper one and done in a timely manner. None of these changes are done in a timely manner. Manaburn has been an issue as far back as I can remember. An excuse given with regard to the items a monk can now wear seems thin. What is being suggested is we are all going to pay for their mistakes. We have played the game handed to us but because of mistakes they made a year ago we all pay now. At very best thats very bad customer service. At the worst it simply shows they truly don't understand or take the time to understand what the consequences for their actions and additions are.<br>
<br>
I truly never knew the Monk class was broken. Perhaps my head was in the sand.<br>
<br>
I play and have played pretty much every class since the first days of EQ. And nothing has changed. All I would ask of them is to apologize less and think ahead more. Its a simple idea that would save them and us a lot of grief. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
And that's exactly the problem as perceived by the plate classes even pre-50! Monks were given higher Defense caps, better Block/Dodge (vs. Parry) caps, and the level-based AC boost specifically to offset their low-AC armor (Mesh!) available back in 1999. I wasn't playing a Monk back then (Scalia was created as a foray in pure melee-dom at the time Velious was released) but I remember how it was back then.<br>
<br>
But now, with Kunark, Velious and Luclin out, we have light weight ALL/ALL armor that is readily available to all melees classes including Monks, so what's there to offset? Monks get to wear the same armor as Warriors plus get the benefit of better defensive skills and class-based AC boost! And that's long before the AC soft cap and mitigation being broken become an issue.<br>
<br>
So compared to my Warrior friend, I end up having at least equal if not better tanking abilities, higher DPS with comparable weapons, self-healing every 6 minutes and much better pulling abilities with FD. His biggest advantage is having more HP, which makes Clerics' CH more efficient, but we all know that.<br>
<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, I don't have my GL's Magelo address, so I can't go over it piece by piece, but the end result is &lt;1,000AC with Clerical buffs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, there is no question that the equilibrium changes yet again if we look at Monks in sub-par gear vs. heavily twinked plate classes. For example, my Druid (guild porter) was helping a level 47 Human Monk get to 48 in CC the other day and he had 870ish AC and 1300HP. He wasn't exactly a mana sink, but I wouldn't want him as the MT in an XP group either. On the other hand, a MB-capable Wizard friend of mine has a level 46 SK twink and he broke the &quot;1K AC unbuffed&quot; barrier at level 43. But then it would be comparing apples and oranges <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71792 target=_blank>Scalia</a> /  <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71783 target =_blank>Gluon</a> on E'ci</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uthornyeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThornyEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(10/11/02 2:13:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ac soft cap</span><hr size=1> I have a monk, but he's low-level &quot;fun&quot; character. Still, I hope this post is not taken to have any negative remarks towards monks, because I'm not intending any.<br>
<br>
Well, here goes...perhaps Verant should consider finally allowing people to see the separate avoidance and mitigation portions of AC? It will change nothing in real terms, but it could be a balm for frayed nerves. Then, at least, monks could see that their avoidance AC far outpaces a warrior's avoidance AC; maybe +AGI items will even become &quot;useful&quot; again, as I believe AGI is a part of avoidance AC (correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
<br>
We can &quot;kind of&quot; already see this in a way by taking off all our armor; what is left (natural AC, defensive skills, etc) is likely most, if not all, avoidance AC. The armor itself would be mostly mitigation AC. Why not make the numbers &quot;official&quot; and put them up directly on the screen, where we can see them easily?<br>
<br>
Lastly, this is a case of closing the barn door after the horses have bolted, but perhaps instead of adding in gear like 60 AC monk pants there should be gear that is of a more reasonable AC, but includes raw +avoidance stats (above and beyond AGI or dodge/block modifiers). That way, the gear is desirable because you get hit less, yet AC is kept to a more reasonable level.<br>
<br>
I dunno, just suggestions.<br>

Actually I was referring to the dual etched steel batons I saw in your magelo last time I looked. =)<br>
<br>
As to the armor, really Kunark didn't do much for readily available *good* all/all armor that I remember, the proliferation came about with Velious. Of the non-visible armor I'm wearing, 4~ are jewelry (rings/earrings) that were available from release, belt is my haste slot (RBB), and the remaining 4 are velious/luclin drops (neck/face/shoulders/back), of which I think 2 aren't all/all but they're still shared with the plate/chain classes.<br>
<br>
Realistically every item I'm wearing that is non-visible would be an upgrade to my paladin, or (better yet) my paladin would be wearing very similar (AC wise) gear if I were still playing him and he were the level of my monk. <br>
<br>
I think the most telling point though is the profiles of the MT/SA warriors in top end guilds where they are wearing 20 AC leather class pants because they have +100 hps on them. =p Mitigation needs to be fixed.<br>

<br>
I really urge Verant to go and review the resistance items that can be _reasonably_ attained by monks (of all levels), and what attaining those resistances does to possible HP and AC of the monk.  Resists have always been a problem for monks - I have played many class in the last 3 years, and the others never really had to consider resists, they just happenned, with my monk I have to work hard on them.  That was pre-patch, now I cannot imagine how I will ever achieve 100 to all resists without being in an uber guild.  Currently my monk has aroun 50 in all resists and that _includes_ the resists on my epic - AC 1050, HP around 2100.<br>
<br>
I for one am totally fed up with insta chain casting wizards perma stunning/rooting/ice cometing my monk on a pull.  The damn casters dont stop til they are oom, and unlike PCs, dont have any form of pause between casting to allow, say, an FD.  Look at my hp, not unusual for a 58 monk really - yet that is around 2 ice comets worth of hp...<br>
<br>
Now, I gotta worry about getting even more AC too so I can be beaten to a pulp when tanking as I do now?  I really don't know where all this monk tanking thing comes from.  At 58 I cannot solo anything without using both stonestance and mend, so thats around 1 mob every 6 minutes?  Tanking, I tried that in seb the other day cause we couldn't get real PLATE class tank who could take the hits.  And while I managed it, I was a mana sponge - oh AND I was puller, so I had the double jeapordy (sp?) of mis-timed heals on a low a HP monk and and getting ice cometted to death on the pull.<br>
