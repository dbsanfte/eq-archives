The thing about healing that is complicated is agro.  and mana. but lots agro.   With the general your not oom'ing so its only agro thats an issue.  So put away all your mana efficient ideas and just talk to me about agro management against a 32k mob.<br><br><br>This is what i think is best.  <br>-i want one!!! count them one!!! CHr.  I want chain'd CHs.  CH has no recast time. a 10 second cast time.  <br>EWWW your thinking. i thought you wanted agro managed.  well i do. thats why the CH is chained.  i dont care if the life bar is full or empty.  dont look at it.  I want it chained.  like i said mana isnt an issue on 32k mobs.  But were not going to use the CH.  the CH is just saying: every 11 seconds we get to start over on life.  preferably though it will heal 0. nothing.<br><br>- i want everyone else to cast rememdy ever 5 seconds.  has a 3 second casting time.  Means cast it then count one one thousand two one thousand recast...  remedy heals little over 400.  if you got 4 clerics on this and 1 on CH your getting 1700 pts of healing every 5 seconds from your clerics.  fairly spread out to boot.  3400 in ten seconds then the CH wipes you clean.  prolly healing for just a tad though. he will come in the middle of the remediers.  you can even have one rememdier chain with a one second pause to make sure that person has the CHr in the middle somewhere.  but i wouldnt cause you got to factor in druids.<br><br>the thing i want to emphasis is screw the bars.  as soon as Main tank is engaged cast the CH. remediers light up too.  the most agro anyone healer is going to get in the first 9 seconds is 430 pts of healing. <br><br>again all of this is healing off recast times not off bars. dont chance 32k mobs your not going to run dry.  Plus if you try to be efficient thats exactly when CH pulls agro.  rememedy that main tank at full.  it will heal a little and insure the CH doesnt heal too much.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uraqziel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raqziel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/29/02 2:04:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4837.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: General V'Ghera Strategy?!</span><hr size=1> hehe, did him with 9 people, and 3 bots, so 12 total!
