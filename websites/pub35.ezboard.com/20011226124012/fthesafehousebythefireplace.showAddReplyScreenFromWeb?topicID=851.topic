By Al’Lan Mandragoran<br>
<br>
A large drop of rain fell from above onto the muddied forehead of a man.  As the man stepped under the wayward pine tree for protection, he wondered at how long it had been since he had slept in a warm, clean bed.  It had been raining on and off for about three weeks now, and when it wasn’t raining, the water that collected on the leaves above trickled down in its place.  This game was becoming depressing, but then, he reminded himself, this wasn’t a game at all.  This was survival of the fittest, a matter of life and death, and he wasn’t about to give up because of some gloomy weather.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometimes, in the dark depths of his mind, he wished he had not decided to come here.  At home, with his two sons and pet lynx was where he wanted to be.  But what could he do?  His long time enemy had finally called him out, and this would be the only chance to prove himself the better.  Yes, he said to himself, this was going to be his greatest triumph.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Almost one month ago, he had received a note scrawled almost illegibly that requested he come to these woods.  He knew from the choice of ink, which was blood, that it was his enemy.  It had taken two months of hard travel by horse to reach the mountains surrounding the woods, and another three weeks to travel the rough pass that led through.  It was the only pass into these woods, and the only way out.  A sort of woodland arena was what this place was, the perfect spot for the duel that would take place.  Well, it would be a duel if he ever found his elusive enemy.  Although it had been three weeks, and there was virtually no sign of his enemy’s passing, he knew that no one had left either.  Only one person would leave, and it would be him.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ever since their first encounter ten years ago, he had been training adamantly, honing his skills to be the best.  He was the best at woodland stealth, tracking, foraging, survival, and most importantly of all, killing.  Twenty years as a professional assassin had hardened him, had made him ready for anything.  Or so he thought.  The encounter with his nemesis had taught him a very important lesson.  This time, he would be the teacher, and the lesson: death.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally he got a fire going, and sat back against the trunk of the great tree.  He would have to wait out the rain.  This weather was not only depressing, but made any attempt at tracking virtually impossible.  For the average tracker, he corrected himself, not for him.  He would probably make camp here and go back out tomorrow.  There was a momentary stirring of anticipation within him when he thought of the coming face-off, or was it anxiety?  “Hah!” he said to none but himself “This time I am the hunter, not the hunted, and I will find you.”  With that declared, he rolled out his mat, curled up, and went to sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the shadows thrown by a campfire within a wayward pine, someone watched as a man slept there.  Tomorrow with the coming of dawn, that man would find the tracks he sought, and they would lead him into oblivion.  So he thinks himself the hunter this time does he?  How ironic, he has trained so hard, learned so much, yet remains an ignorant fool.  Has he learned nothing from their last encounter?  That much must be deemed from his actions.  For three weeks now that man who slept carelessly under the tree has practically let himself be stalked, all the while thinking he is on the trail of his enemy.   Tomorrow they would meet again.  This time would be different though.  Unlike before, only one of them would live.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the coming of dawn, the man awoke from his slumber under the wayward pine tree, stretching his arms and legs before eating breakfast.  In his sleep, he had had extremely lifelike dreams of finding and destroying his enemy.  It must be an omen.  Today would be the day he would fulfill the promise he made to himself all those years ago.  He packed up exited his shelter.  Immediately he saw a sign that he was looking for.  This will certainly lead to the death of his rival.<br>
A small, barely perceptible scuff in the soil under a white pine tree twenty yards away told him all he needed to know.  His foe must be getting sloppy.  The man however never wondered at the fact that whatever had left that mark had come so close as he slept.  He thought only of how he would steal the life from his foe with his blade.<br>
A steady stream of clues lead from the pine tree and he followed them with cynical resolve.  A broken twig here, a ruffled leaf there, all well hidden, but not good enough for a tracker of his experience.  All through the day he followed the serpentine trail.  He took a break for lunch when he saw the light of the sun shining through the canopy directly above.  The dried venison and bread was as bland as always, three weeks of eating practically the same thing had taken away any charm the food had.  <br>
During that time, he mulled over the entirety of his life.  Going through the events that transpired during his years, he made a startling revelation.  After his near death experience with his nemesis, he had been completely devoted to his need for revenge.  Why had he let this single event control him for so long?  He thought a few moments on this question and decided it didn’t matter.  His obsession would end soon, and the death of his enemy would release him.<br>
After his mid-day meal, the man continued on the track.  As he walked, he noticed the forest growing darker and darker.  There was almost no sign of animal life; he had seen no rabbits or deer since he set off after his break.  Unusual, he thought, but took no heed of it.  If the trail led this way, he would follow it.  He would follow his quarry into hell be it necessary.  He pushed through a stand of trees and came across a dark clearing.  Ad the opposite end of the clearing there was the entrance to a cave.  The trail seemed to lead directly into its maw.  So he had found his foe’s hidey-hole had he?  Yes, this is where it would end.<br>
<br>
Hidden amongst the shade of a large red pine, someone observed a man entering a cave.  So the idiot had followed the trail the entire way.  He will explore the cave, and probably wait there a while.  When he reemerges, death will descend on him from above.  Then it will be settled and with great satisfaction.  Weeks of careful planning had gone into this day.  When the man looks into the eyes of death, and feels the cold steel of a blade across his throat, that satisfaction will come.<br>
<br>
The cave was cool and dank as soon as he entered, and although it was much more comfortable there then in the heat of the day, he sensed something was awry.  It must be his proximity to the enemy.  Just one of the skills he had picked up in his training was the ability to sense danger, and he definitely did now.  Another skill was the ability to see in the dark, which had proved its usefulness time and time again.  He could now just barely see the outline of the cave walls and slowed his pace to adjust to the darkness.  Ahead was pitch-black, a seemingly never-ending hole in the earth.  This was a fitting spot for the death that would take place.<br>
How far did this cave go?  His adversary probably planed to slip a blade into his ribs when it became too dark.  No.  His opponent was not one for open cowardice.  Or at least that was the case in their last encounter.  The fool would die easily if he tried anything of the sort.<br>
Just as the man was considering lighting a torch, he stepped on something that crunched like a broken egg.  The sound resonated through the cave, echoing and amplifying as it went.  Well now his cover was blown, the man thought, but before he could inspect what made the noise, he noticed two yellow eyes open up right in front of him.<br>
The man froze.  Immediately fear and terror rose up in him like a flooding river, threatening to overwhelm him.  The eyes rose up into the black void until they were positioned far above him.  Suddenly there was a roar like he had never heard before.  If the eyes alone hadn’t scared him enough, the howl of the beast certainly did.  <br>
The man turned and ran then, ran as fast as his legs would carry him.  The light bobbed steadily closer, but now he could hear sounds of pursuit.   He redoubled his effort, strengthened by the flow of adrenaline, and finally reached the exit.<br>
<br>
A man burst from the entrance to the cave, running like a thing possessed.  In the shadows above the cave entrance, someone watched as he sped away.  The man ran ahead heedless of the branches that crisscrossed his path and was soon out of sight.  What had gotten into him?  Weeks of carefull planning and now all was lost because he decided to spook?  That just wasn’t right.  Though the man was a fool, he did not scare easily.  So what then had frightened him so much?  As the watcher withdrew from the shadows, a gigantic mound of fur and claws exploded from the cave opening.  It continued on, galloping with a speed that belied its massive frame, and followed the trail the man had left moments earlier.  At first the watcher was stunned.  It was a bear, but no bear was anywhere near as large as what had gone by.  It was impossible.  Then the watcher realized that this was not an ordinary bear, it was the Codens.  The watcher sped off the same way the man and Codens went, eager to learn the conclusion of this chase.<br>
<br>
Branches whipped his face, pickers caught his legs, but he did not slow a bit.  He could hear his pursuer behind him, and he knew it was now beginning to gain ground.  If he did not find a place to hide soon, he did not stand a chance.  Then he risked a look behind him, and was almost knocked of his feet by what he saw.  A colossal bear, at least twice the size of any bear he had ever heard of, was barreling down on him.  <br>
As he ran, he saw ahead a large wayward pine tree, most likely the same one he had stayed at the previous night.  How he had covered so much ground so fast was beyond the man’s guess, but in that tree he saw his only chance for salvation.  He hurried up to it, but the speed he had gathered on his mostly downhill sprint carried him to fast to stop.  <br>
His legs buckled as he tripped on one of the great roots of the tree, and he was carried head first through the air.  He wondered if his was to be his end, if he would never face his enemy and get the chance he so desired.  Then, with a bone-jarring thud, darkness enveloped him and he knew no more. <br>
<br>
The great Codens, who up until this point in the chase had been speeding on ahead to catch the fleeing man, suddenly stopped.  Someone watched as the huge bear bent down to sniff something that lay in its tracks.  The watcher edged around to see what it was that had caught the interest of the hunting Codens.  As the watcher crept closer, a branch snapped underfoot, piercing the delicate silence.  Immediately the Codens stood up and angled his ears in the direction of the sound.  I whiff of the air, and the great bear rose to its full height, letting lose a horrifying bellow.  The watcher turned to flee, but it was too late.  The Codens was on him, claws rending, teeth tearing, crushing with its weight.  In a pool of blood, the watcher’s vision began to turn dark.  The last thing the watcher saw was the man lying unconscious under the wayward pine tree.  They would never know who was the better.<br>
<br>
When the man finally awoke, he found himself under the same pine tree he had fallen asleep beneath the night before.  Or was it the night before?  With his memory a haze of barely comprehensible images and sounds, he wasn’t sure.  Then the memories flooded back to him.  He remembered the cave, the eyes, and the giant bear that was just a step behind him.  That thing was certainly intent on killing him, why was he spared?  And where was his enemy?  There were still things that needed to be settled between them.<br>
The man finally stood up, reeling from the headache he wasn’t sure how he had got.  He brushed himself off and looked around.  It was night, the sky clear for once, with the moonlight streaming down through the branches like ribbons of heaven.  As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed the faint glint of the moonlight off of something metal about ten yards off.  <br>
When he started to walk over to investigate, he nearly fell right back down again.  Still off balance, the man made his way slowly towards the unusual reflection.  When he arrived he saw that the glint belonged to the hilt of a long knife, and the knife was in it sheath.  The sheath, however, was connected to a grisly mass of blood and gore, the remains completely unidentifiable.  <br>
The men bent down and picked up the knife, withdrawing it from its resting place gingerly.  He then took out his own and held them together in front of himself to examine them.  They were identical blades.  So this pile of gore was really the enemy he had sought all this time, had wasted years of his life training to beat, and had endured three weeks of hardship to find.  The man raised his head up and let out a terrible wail of anguish.  This was supposed to be a triumphant battle!  The culmination of his entire life!  Now, he would never know who was the better, who deserved to live and who to die.  His final promise to himself was broken, and he found that he himself was broken as well.  <br>
The man dropped to his knees, almost hysterical by this time, and began to repeatedly stab the bloody remains with his enemy’s knife.  Why?  Why was this one thing denied him?  When he finally tired of this, he laid down the bloody knife and once again took out his.  With the blade he had wished so much to hold at his enemy’s throat, held it to his own.    “If I cannot battle you in life” the man screamed “then I shall do so in death!” and plunged the dagger into his neck.<br>
