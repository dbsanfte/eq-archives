<br>
On Spawning the AC<br>
<br>
<B>Method 1</B> Explained to me by another player - hard to gainsay them as it worked - once<br>
1. Go to undead tower.  Don't kill the undead in the tower.<br>
2. Wait until 8 PM EQ time.<br>
3. At 8 PM step into tower and kill the undead there.  Stay in the tower for at least a minute or two.<br>
4. Run to the hill top just north of the DE camp and make like a radar antenna.  Scan everywhere.<br>
5. Wait<br>
6. 10 - 15 minutes later the AC popped (sometime between 8PM and 2 AM?)<br>
<br>
<B>Method 2</B>  (Allakhazam's AC Thread)<br>
1. Starting at 6 AM, kill all undead in undead tower until you get "A dark boned skeleton"  Don't kill it or let anyone else kill it.<br>
2. Wait until 8 PM EQ time.<br>
3. At 8 PM step into tower and kill the "A dark boned skeleton" there. <br>
4. Run to the hill top just north of the DE camp and make like a radar antenna.  Scan everywhere.<br>
5. You may end up killing a SG between 8 and 12 midnight.<br>
6. AC should pop between 12 midnight and 2 AM.<br>
Note:  I think maybe he means "A dry boned skeleton." - Zinj<br>
<br>
<B>Method 3</B> (Allakhazam's SoRo Thread)<br>
1. Wait until 8 AM EQ time<br>
2. Start killing undead, all of them you can get to.<br>
3. At 4/5 PM go kill the undead that spawns in the tower.<br>
4. Don't kill anymore undead.<br>
5. Wait, a lot.<br>
6. AC should spawn around 8-12 midnight.<br>
<br>
<B>Method 4</B> (Allakhazam's AC Thread)<br>
1. Kill all SGs, all named mobs, and all undead.<br>
2. AC pops shortly.<br>
<br>
<B>Method 5</B><br>
Kill everything in the desert area and AC will spawn, someday.<br>
<br>
There seems to be some players that have the AC figured out like clockwork, so there IS a method - probably method 1 or 2.  I did method 5 and spent at least a week of RL nights there.  Method 1 worked when I helped a friend get his.<br>
<br>
Once he DOES spawn, you have to get to him first. Since he spawns in random locations this can be a problem and if someone else is closer, that's just too bad - try again.  Common spawn areas are: in the triangle between the DE camp, western derv camp, and the butte; NW corner on south side of ridge that Ortallis likes to go to; NE corner down in the depression area; and although I've not seen him there, probably in SE corner between East Derv camp and Undead tower.<br>
<br>
Get a stack of sow potions and hotkey one.  As soon as you see the AC, hit the hotkey and then RUN!<br>
<br>
Get a stack of player-smithed javalins and have them in your range slot, and have that hotkeyed too.  Once you get close, start throwing as fast as you can to get first aggro before the archers and casters get him.<br>
<br>
If you have to FD, you'll probably lose the AC to a soft-KS. If you're lucky, and you get him below 50%, FD and have someone try to take him, stand up and see if you still have aggro or not.  If you haven't cleared aggro, the potential KS'er may just do you work for you and kill him while you get the xp and the looting rights.<br>
<br>

<br>
heres how it works:<br>
<br>
ok first of all all the undead are on a 12hr game time spawn table <br>
<br>
the undead are PH(suposedly) for sgs, terror, young ronin, named sg and AC <br>
<br>
so wait a full day spawn time before killing undead to make sure all are spawned<br>
<br>
then procede to kill all the undead between 8am and 5pm making sure all are dead except one in tower.<br>
<br>
at 6pm kill one in tower<br>
<br>
wait<br>
<br>
will spawn sometime before 6am the next day <br>
<br>
also been told that the named sg, terror, and ac are same spawn <br>
<br>
so if one of those pops got to restart<br>
<br>
rinse repeat<br>
<br>
i have always got SOMETHING to spawn using this but not ac yet havn't been trying this way long though <p>Mudstick Juggalo

<br>
Just so you know, I've seen both the AC and terror up at the same time when fighting as my 51 druid, so although there may be a lesser chance of the AC if another named is up, I don't think that one being up is the exclusive PH for the AC.<br>
<br>
I've also tried a few methods, but like 5 the best, as I got the AC to pop in about 5 mins for my wife's cleric with my 50 monk Knukle killing anything and everything around the desert area (including the tower mob as it popped).<br>
<br>
Have also had 2 AC's pop in 45 mins using method 5, just have to get lucky <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I saw the AC 6 times before I landed the first hit on lucky 7 (first hit is how it goes in SRo on Quellious, at least when I was doing him anyway, sigh).  After trying most of those methods, in that week and a half of camping, I came to the conclusion that Method 5 is the best one, with a little bit of stradegy and luck thrown in.<br>
<br>
The AC seemed to pop in 4 select places every time I saw him spawn.  I saw him spawn twice in the NE on a high dune near the zone to Oasis, twice to the NW in a ditch north of the Gypsies, once just south of the Gypsies, and once SW of the Gypsies.  Since I was too cheap to buy SoW potions for the duration of my stay, I came to the concluse that the only way I was going to get the AC was to camp one of those 4 spots.  I camped the NE spot and he luckily spawned just east of me and walked right in front of me before anyone else spotted him.  I was SHAKING I was so nervous.  On par with Raster.<br>
<br>
Anyone doing this camp, good luck to ya.  It's a pain, but I love clicking the J-Boots on while running through a crowd, especially one in SRo<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

This is the method I use.<br>
<br>
Get the dry bones skeleton up in the tower.<br>
Kill him between 8pm and 12pm game time.<br>
Immediately kill all undead (skels and mummies.. ghouls dont count)<br>
Kill all 'different' mobs.  IE. A mummy. a madman. a sand mummy. a crypt mummy. a skeleton.<br>
By 4am game time, he should spawn.<br>
If for some reason it didn't, rinse lather repeat.<br>
<br>
It's very simple.  And with so many folks aware now, its alot easier to spawn him because everyone is killing the undead.<br>
<br>
getting him to spawn is the easy part. Out damaging the 20 killstealers is up to you. At lvl 55 with my epic, they're going to have to be fast <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have a little experience on the AC.  My main is a 54 Mage that I hate playing now, due to the level of him.  He is the one I always camped the AC with.  My monk is now 39, and I am having too much fun playing him.<br>
<br>
Anyway.  The AC is linked to the undead tower in S Ro.  I have gotten the AC to spawn in S Ro twice, working the kill all undead, including tower method.  The AC in S Ro is much weaker then the one in OOT.  1200HP in nukes and the pet beating on it took it down very fast.<br>
<br>
OOT AC.  I have gotten this one 13 times now.  I camp it primarily for guild members, and my wife's and I's twinks.  While there are horror stories of 36 hour camps, the honest rotation is about 7 hours.  We camped it one weekend and got 6 rings over a 55 hour period.  Weird thing was we got 4 in the first 9 hours of the camp.  The last 2 took 46 hours.  I have also camped it at other times, and they ranged between 2 hours and 13 hours to spawn.  Once it spawned, I was contacting the next person on the list, we killed a PH, and the AC spawned again 6 minutes later.  Unfortunatly, the guy I was talking to was very far away, so, another ring went to my guild.<br>
<br>
These boots are priceless and life savers!  After you have a character with a pair of these, you will understand the T-Boots are not even an issue.<br>
<br>
Well, that is pretty much all I have to say.  If you plan to camp it in OOT, make sure you set aside at least 7 hours for the camp, not to mention the time it takes to get your turn on the list (how we do it on Xegony).  Bring friends, and pull Seafuries over for XP.  At 54, about 3 of 5 Cyclops are still blue to my mage.  I have leveled from 49 to 54 in the OOT.  However, at 54, I camped the AC, and in 13 hours, got half a yellow (SOLO).  Not an XP machine anymore.<br>

<br>
AC spawn when sun is raising (in EQ of course) around 4am - 6am.<br>
<br>
If you can see those named during the day (never saw them at night):<br>
<br>
A sand mummy<br>
Named giant<br>
Young ronin<br>
Terror tarentula<br>
<br>
Then the ac will not spawn next night.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, much funnier to make train of everything and use wizards to clear everything fast : )<br>
<br>
Average camp time for me: 6 hours <p><center>Iskys Syksiiksysiki  Monk of Thule<br>

I started running towards Freeport when I see the AC just walking along the dune! I ran up and started attacking it while sending at tell to my friend who was on her way to guk. At 41 I think I could have soloed the AC, but wouldnt recommend due to possible kill stealers. Our server had just had a humungous dump and half the game was LD, I dont know if this had anything to do with AC spawn.. it was also almost morning EQ time...<br>

I have also noticed a connection with A Sand Mummy (named?) and the AC. When we killed enought undead to spawn this guy the SGs and then AC would spawn soon after.  <p><B>

<br>
Ran into zone at 9pm game time.<br>
Just me and my gfriends Shammy.<br>
<br>
Ran to temple and killed crypt mummy.<br>
Ran around and killed everything I saw.<br>
SG spawned about 10 minutes later, killed it.<br>
Another SG spawned, but Shammy was out of mana after getting happy and nuking a bunch of spiders..(lol)<br>
So while waiting for mana, I continued to kill anything I saw and 'pop' the AC showed up.. <br>
Wacked him and got my ring! woot!..<br>
