If I can collect some system files (from dxdiag and the windows system viewer as described on the [link=http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/luclin/problems.jsp]Everquest official homepage[/link] he would make sure it got passed on to a developer.<br>
So, if you want, feel free to email me at veranon@home.se and attach those files and I'll relay them and see if we can get this thing fixed. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21834 target=_document >

All of the hotbuttons/items are rendered by the 3d engine as textures, thus they get antialiased. The chat box is not rendered using Direct 3D---it's rendered with the Windows font api and layered on top of the rest of the engine---so it never gets anti-aliased. You might want to go to a higher resolution as opposed to using AA. You'll get more detail from a 1280x1024 or 1600x1200 screen than you will from an 800x600 or 1024x768 AA mode, and you'll hardly notice the difference,short of the really tiny fonts... which you can adjust,of course... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you also have names turned off, that's another nasty resource hog. Any transparency effect is going to eat cpu time. Character names are generated as transparent textures, which means they are included.<br>
<br>
A 3d engine has to sort transparent objects so that transparent objects that are the farthest away are drawn first,with the closest transparent objects being drawn last. The engine does this so that transparency effects work correctly. <br>
<br>
When you have loads of people in a tight area in EQ with names turned on, the engine is having to do massive amounts of sorting to figure out the proper rendering order, which can add to graphics lag in some situations. Also, spell effects,trees,etc.  rely on heavy use of transparency as well.<br>
<br>
Transparency effects tend to bog down graphics cards, just because of the extra calculations involved and the nature of transparency. Also, the way the chat box text is overlayed is goofy---that has to be causing a slowdown in the 3d engine. To date, I haven't seen more than a couple developers do this. It's really not a bright idea. There are other ways to generate text in a 3d engine which would be faster and less buggy.<br>
<br>
More than likely, they are just using crappy code in their menu system.<br>

Are you sure that it's not an interlaced 72hz mode? That might cause the flickering.<br>
