Sounds like you will join EQ Legends for $40 per month to get better service.  If not, I guess you'll leave the game because Customer Service at $10 per month is more important than playing the game itself.  Good luck to you.<br>

<br>
The amount (if any) that EQLegends is taking away from EQ-Regular, is *nothing* compared to Star Wars Galaxies, Planetside and Sovereign. (Don't forget the projects that they haven't even announced yet.) The development of a new game requires a MASSIVE investment of time and resources over just adding on to an existing game.<br>
<br>
How much revenue have those last 3 games produced? Zero dollars. Don't even tell me that they are all new staff, because the dollars to pay for that staff are from EQ-subscribers.

<br>
let's say you are a regular commuter, using the Shuttle to go from your home in Boston to work in NY a few times a week.  You think the fare is a great deal at $49 because otherwise you are looking at a 4 hour drive, staying overnight a couple times a week etc...you don't get a meal, the leg room is pretty cramped, but all in all, for $49 you are getting a great deal for the money.<br>
<br>
Now, the Shuttle decides to offer a first-class cabin for $199 each way.  Here are your objections as translated from your complaints/concerns about the concept of the Legends server:<br>
<br>
1) "This is insulting!  I should be getting the gourmet meal, the faster check in and the extra leg room for my $49."<br>
<br>
Hey, here's a clue - if they gave everyone that meal and gave everyone extra leg room, your ticket wouldn't be $49 any more.<br>
<br>
2) "This is going to promote division.  I either have to pay $199 and fly first-class, or else I am being treated like a second class customer.  I'm just going to stop flying altogether."<br>
<br>
Fine genius.  Go ahead and drive four hours each way just because your petty jealousy has made you irrational.  Were you getting your $49 worth flying coach before they introduced this new service?  Yes.  Now because something better is available, what you are getting is somehow not worth the $49 anymore?  Be serious please - and have fun in traffic.<br>
<br>
3) "This is going to affect future flights and fares.  Other airlines might see the Shuttle charging four times the old rate and set all their fares that high in the future."<br>
<br>
Get a clue about supply and demand Einstein.  If 90 percent of the flying public cares about fares more than extra perks, the coach class is never going away.  Do you see many airlines that offer only a first-class cabin,  in operation?  No, and you won't.<br>
<br>
4) "They are going to only care about the first-class customers now and ignore all of us in coach."<br>
<br>
Again, it's a simple concept.  The first-class cabin is extra revenue that enables the company to operate more efficioently and offer better service to all.  If they ignored 90percent of their customers to serve only those 10 percent, they wouldn't be in business long.  The core business is the coach class and that's where most of the revenue comes from - the first-class is extra.<br>
<br>
5) "Oh no, I like sitting near the front of the coach cabin so I get my coffee first when they serve it.  Now someone else in first-class is going to get their coffee before me."<br>
<br>
So?  Your point is?  Keep sitting near the front of the coach cabin.  You will still get your coffee first before the other coach customers.  What's happening up in first class has zero effect on you getting your coffee - they use different Flight Attendants for each cabin.<br>
<br>
***********************************<br>
<br>
I think I covered all of the weak arguments against this idea.  None of them holds an ounce of credibility.  It has nothing to do with "old-time" players jumping on people against this idea - it has everything to do with having a low tolerance for stupidity and irrationality.  There are lots of things VI has done I don't agree with - and I've said so when it applied - but this clearly isn't one of them.<br>
<br>
Again, if it doesn't appeal to you, don't subscribe to it - like me, I wouldn't - but who cares if someone else does.  If it's worth $40 to them, great, let them have fun.  It doesn't affect you in the least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upatofnaud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>patofnaud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 1:31:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant: Everquest Legends</span><hr size=1> Ok now sorry if this was posted before, I only read through about 50 of the 1000 Legends posts so far this week.

The point that a lot of people are upset about is that certain things were promised in this game from the jump. It's wrong for Sony/VI to now get around to offering those same things only to those willing to pay more money than what was originally agreed upon.  Sure you should expect to pay more for new things, but not for what you should have had from the first time you installed the game.<br>

In any case, why the hell are you being so beligerant and insulting to people for stating how they feel about something?  Are you threatened by their feelings?  Insecure that maybe, they could get the Legends server closed because people read this and decide not to play there?  <br>

<br>
Tel - re-read what I posted.  No idea what your basis is for asking if I fly first-class everywhere, or what possible bearing it would have if I did.<br>
<br>
I clearly said *I* am not interested in the Legends server service - but I don't irrationally begrudge anyone to whom it IS worth it.  Likewise, it would not be worth it for me to pay $2,000 to fly first-class to London and be more comfortable for 6 hours.  When I went I paid $400 and flew coach.  But why should I care if someone else wants to pay the 2k and fly first-class?  If it's worth it to them, let em.  It doesn't affect me, and it didn't have any bearing on the value I received for my $400.   I don't think I deserved the same service and comfort which they paid extra for, and I'm fine with that.<br>
<br>
As for my tone, sorry, but I have a low tolerance for irrational jealousy and poorly thought out arguments.  Even with that, I haven't come even *close* to "flaming" anyone on this thread.  It would be much harsher if I did and said what I really think of all the Chicken Little/sky is falling, paranoid "concerns". <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upulid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pulid</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/communtychest.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 5:28:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant: Everquest Legends</span><hr size=1> 2.

I think the question more properly is, how many abuses of this aspect of the Legends service will occur before Verant stops the retransfer with Legends loot?  I can already hear the screams from the peanut gallery when VI makes that call.  You know, one of VI's policies is &quot;balance,&quot; a glass into which all arguments can be poured and somehow all will fit.<br>
<br>
It's not a matter of IF its going to be abused, it's simply a matter of how VI is going to STOP the abuse.<br>

<br>
Now, you are assuming that verant has it's priorities in order. That I completely disagree with. Take Luclin for example. Take the character models, the illusion masks....granted, there will always be bugs, but when you launch a new expansion, and in the first 2 weeks one of the largest selling points of your expansion, i.e. new models, doesnt even work right, you'd think a company with their priorities straight would finish what they started.....we only wish. Instead they launched ahead with another money maker. <br>
<br>
That is the essence of &quot;good&quot; business. They know where the line for most players is for how buggy things get before they get pissed. And they watch that line very closely. Right now, they are willing to let things slid on the &quot;coach&quot; servers because in the end, legends will be bringing in new money. Once legends is up and running, they will have 10x as many buggs running around, and they will have to put all their energy into de-bugging their &quot;first class&quot; customers. <br>
<br>
Not saying that the &quot;coach&quot; servers wont get help, but I think there will be a dramatic increase in how long bugs are let run. All those nice everyother week patches where they modified spells, items, ect.... is going to stop for a while, which some of you will like. Not me. Patches tell me that verant gives a #*%@. It tells me they are trying. <br>

Final splurg. You want a good example? Who has, and continues to get, the most help in the US? Why, the top 10 percentile...... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulorddenman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Denman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 11:11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kuruus</span><hr size=1> Nenjin,<br>

Whoa there horsey!  The top ten percentile in the U.S. get the most help!  I assume you mean that the most help goes to the people who earn the top 10% (not percentile) of income.  Nice class hatred dig.  <br>
<br>
I guess you have no problem with the top 10% income earners paying over 50% of the government revenue affiliated with the income tax.  That's only fair right?  <br>
<br>
So IF you are correct, and the majority of U.S. government programs go to help the top 10% (like Medicare (not), Social Security (yeah, right), Medicaid (nope), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (no way), Welfare (&lt;you fill it in&gt;), Farm Subsidies (we'll give you money not to grow crops), Head Start (. . . . you really want me to keep going)) /sarcasm off, THEN it is only fair that they have to pay over 50% of the income tax revenue.  (For those who cannot interpret sarcasm correctly -- the top 10% of the income earners are ineligible for those listed government programs).<br>

Let me re-iterate my point then. <br>
Who does the U.S government, up to the present, paid more attention too? Who are they worried about pissing off, such that they no longer get contributions, support, ect....The top 10%.<br>
<br>
That is the same thing I am saying for EQ. Of course, the average player is the one that keeps this machine oiled, payed for, and running. Just like the average blue collar. Who gets the consideration? Sure as hell not the blue collar. Granted, the majority of the EQ population is the one that can make or break verant, but who do _really_ think they are going to be putting their energy twoards in the next year? With paying more money, players are going to have, yes here it comes, a right to demand better service. With GMs and guides running to and fro like rats in a maze as it is already, can you honestly say that our CS is even going to break even? I think not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showPrevMessage?topicID=2702.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showNextMessage?topicID=2702.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2702.topic&index=119><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.emailToFriend?topicID=2702.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.threadControl?topicID=2702.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2702.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2702.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehousefrm24">Realm Quests<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc>News Bulletin</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><img
