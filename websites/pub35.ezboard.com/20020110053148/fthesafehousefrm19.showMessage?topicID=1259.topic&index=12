<br>
At L10 I had a ten envenom.  Now, at L14 I have an 11(I think?), but have some points saved that I will likely use to boost it to 15 at 15th level.<br>
<br>
My venom VERY reliably does 18 a tick vs yellows.  My thrust spec is about a 3...  But I can put the DOT venom on a dirk, walk up to a thrust vuln yellow, and cut it down with no trouble at all.  Generally, I finish at 50-60% health.  With a backstab sequence in as well as poison, I finish at about 70-80%.  I load another DOT poison on a weapon in my 2H slot, for emergancies (poison is resisted, another mob joins the fun, etc.).<br>
<br>
Again, this is with all yellow enchanted armor/weapons, the armor being player-crafted.  But you might want to try boosting your envenom to a 10 skill ASAP, might help your performance a bit.<br>

<br>
It does not scale though, as levels pass you will need to use  your instants heals to be able to take down a yellow. Then you will start finding blues extremely hard. You will notice that even though you can win against the blue con mobs. You can not go through them fast at all. in fact you will be worse off for soloing than an SB. Of course you might be able to find groups easier. With the changes to mez though, you will not offer the same benefits that the first generation of healers did to higher level groups. <br>
<br>
You might want to take a look at the changes they made to styles and try your SB again. My low level styles went from getting +1-3 bonus's to +25-35. Considering how much I hit for (35-55 regular w/ 1hander) it's a huge differance. Having a high weapon spec now, is beneficial beyond the extra styles gained. Until today it was nominally so. In fact this last weekend I was doing better with a sword and I had not put a single point into sword skill. You would think 43 axe would mean something, but it did not. I was doing better with an untrained weapon of higher quality, then a twi-cleaver or df spiked axe and high skill.<br>
<br>
In regards to the weapon &quot;Mourning Rage&quot;. If you do axe and are in you high 20's low 30's you want that axe. With 100% quality it does a ton of damage. Using havoc style I was doing more damage to orange cons than I am doing at level 40 to orange cons with a twi-cleaver (no I don't solo oranges).<br>
<br>
98%+ quality weapons is probably a key to success. Also What kez said about finding mobs you do well against.  <p><br><br><font color=white> <b> Windaria </font color=white> <br><font color=white> DAOC Lvl 36 <i> Warrior</i> </b> </font color=white><br>

At first, I was hunting green cons because I was still thinking like a Nightshade.<br>
<br>
Bam! 124 points of damage. Thoink! 46 points of damage. Thoink! Grunt! 35 points of damage, monster dead.<br>
<br>
So I sit there stunned for a moment, having difficulty with the situation. So I look around and plunk a few arrows into a blue con, and then take on a few yellows with difficulty.<br>
<br>
After all this, I dismiss it as being low level, so I load up my level 24 ranger on Pendragon and give it another go... all store bought equipment, blue cons except for a yellow con mob-dropped bow. Thunk, thoink, plink, plunk.... dead yellow con. Thunk, thoink, plink, plunk, stab, stab, grunt... dead blue con. Lather, rinse, repeat. Crits are hitting for 160. Regular shots for 65. And I'm stabbing just as well as my Nightshade.<br>
<br>
So I log back into my level 27 Nightshade... Perf Artery: 102. Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, finally grunt. Managed to survive the fight with 30% health, some endurance, and it was a blue con (no + on my damage, - on monster's damage).<br>
<br>
Two of my ranger friend talk about getting detected and running away or how annoying it is when they have to run away when a bladeturn blocks their arrows. I just smile and say: Oh yeah, bladeturn happens then I die.<br>
<br>
I really can't imagine why I play a Nightshade anymore. Are disguises really going to matter? Is it going to allow me to get away? Will it increase my hidden attack damage so that I do more damage than an archer? Will it give me more absorbtion since I have to be within melee range to attack?<br>
<br>
I really don't see archers as being overpowered. But after playing one again, I certainly see how thieves have nothing but penalties, and few benefits gained for those penalties.<br>
<br>
So instead of petitions or complaints, I prefer to do the sensible thing: walkout. No more thieves. Maybe they're do the right thing: either fix the class or give the class's skills to archers and delete it.<br>

So really, why should I care that I can solo blues? The problem is that if I go to a dungeon with my friend who is an equal level Pally he gets a group in 5-10 mins, while it takes me 30-40 mins. While he tends to get into stable groups, I end up more often in groups with changing members that crumbles in an hour or so. So the problem is that we are useless to a group, not what we can and cant solo. However we are not the only class in this boat, so such is life.<br>
<br>
I think the real issue is that folks can accept being crappy in PvE if they have the trade off of being awesome in RvR, really isnt that why we are all rogues, cause of RvR? The problem is that we suck in RvR. Our crit shots are a joke (unless you use a really big weapon, oh please tell me why the damage/size of the weapon factors into a percision blow???), detect hidden works the same as if you were a couple levels higher then a player, so its not very special, all but a couple poisons are worthless, not to mention that DOT poisons keep you from hiding, bladeturn nerfs to archers have made our useless crit even more of a joke, we die frequently because our crit doesnt do enough damage and our styles suck up so much END that we cant get away, specially when we blow our crit cause of bladeturn, it takes us forever to get in position for crit strike (thus our kill rate is extremely small even if we could do decent damage with our crit strike) and then have all that time wasted cause of a bladeturn, you die then waste a bunch more time waiting for a res or travelling back to the frontier, and the list goes on. Its not any one of the above thats a problem, you can adapt and learn to work around limitations, the problem is the sheer number of issues that we have to work around, people get frustrated and you see folks leaving their characters due to that frustration.<br>
<br>
Safefall has turned out much better then I expected and I dont mind saying I was wrong on my judgement that it would be useless, but still a far cry from what we need. We hear that bladeturn isnt supposed to stop our crits, yet the bladeturn patch goes in while we are screaming that its not working that way, the next patch roles around and its not addressed or fixed. This patch has non-rogue styles getting a boost, supposedly to match how ours work. Great so my style that was pathetic in comparison before, is now even more pathetic in comparison cause they all got a boost.  All our skills will be in by xmas..... just like we were supposed to get three patches with fixes a month or so back?<br>
<br>
While this may seem like a whine, thats not the intent, more of a rant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Its not how we are, its how we are in comparison to other classes. Other then the 'appeal' of a rogue, (which is why I think most of us play them game after game when we know they will be super screwed up), why would anyone wish to play one? I could become a minstrel and still have stealth, plus speed buffs, plus mezzing, and better armor, thus making me better in PvE and RvR. I am patiently waiting to see what all my skills will be before I make a decision about giving up my infiltrator, and thus the game, or not.<br>
<br>

PS - One thing that cheeses me off is when non-rogues post how great we are cause we wiped out a bunch of players without becoming visiable. Wiping out greys is not a measure of greatness.<br>

I am a Norse SB, put most of my points into STR and a little into con, and then boosted up my DEX and QUI to bring them up to par with a kobolds, so to speak.<br>
<br>
My armor is yellow to me with the exception of my boots that are blue and give me bonuses to stats and skills.  I have two Njessi swords, one that is two-handed, one that is one-handed, and I am seriously considering seeing about trying to find a Njessi left-axe, if one does exist.<br>
<br>
When I go into combat, I coat my two-handed blade and my one-handed blade, and will open with the two-hander to get the most damage out of it, along with the poison, which is either a lethal poison, or major weakness.  And that is with a score of 11 in envenom.  If the battle is going against me, I will switch to sword and shield to get off that other poison, and then switch back to the two-hander, if necessary.  I have no problems with blues, and only a couple of yellows give me concern, such as a yellow-con drake in Skona Ravine.  And yes, the only thing I use are my specialties, be it PA, BS2, Hamstring, Garrotte, Assault, and Temper.<br>
<br>
Now, I didn't play my SB last night since I was quite perturbed with Mythics decision to boost the various styles and their abilities, thus not focusing on us, but instead, giving a tweak to all classes.  In the long run, that is more beneficial to the other classes, rather than ours that does have troubles at higher levels.<br>
<br>
But I will check out the new bonuses from the sword styles to see if they help me out against the drakes in Skona Ravine.<br>
And for those who have not noticed, in the Camelot Herald, they changed when we might get spells to the New Year.  While I'll wake up Larlana from time to time to help out on scouting for my guild, I'll be focusing on my thane until Mythic has finished making/revising the melee rogues.<br>
