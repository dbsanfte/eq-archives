The truth is that this is rarely the case. It is far more often the case that the group that gets there first is simply living in a more favorable time zone. Please see my comments in <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=22292.topic">this post</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> to get a more in-depth analysis of my thoughts on time zones in EQ.<br>
<br>
And to answer your question, I just want my friends and I to enjoy some of the more challenging encounters in EQ. Loot is always a nice bonus, but we're more after the challenge.<br>

I saw BullS***. Nobody should have more access to something because the game is biased to a particular time zone. We all pay for the same service, and therefore, when we are ready, we should all have access to the uber-zones. <br>
<br>
I think that many people misunderstood my comments about limiting access to the areas. I never said to make the zones easier or more user friendly. My suggestion was for a group to be able to into a zone for a limited, but reasonable time to get what they want or kill what ever mob, and that would be it, they would have to wait another limited, reasonable time period to repeat this action. After the group has left and the limited, reasonable counter expires, then the zone would respawn, perhaps a a random time afterwards, but within a few hours or so. Does this make sense??? <br>
<br>
Some would say this kind of thing would hurt the server economy. I say, just make more things no drop or make certain items drop less often. I hate it when people are farming stuff to make themselves more 'uber'. This hurts the economy just as much. I takes relatively rare items and makes them so common, people can twink there level ones with dragon raid gear. <br>
<br>
If your group goes into an area and owns everything in the zone, I say great you where ready to take the challenge. If you get owned, so be it, pick up your corpses and let the next team try. What is so hard to understand??? I will one day be ready for these types of raids, and I am certain that I will have as much time /played as anybody else, it will just take more realtime to do it. So why should I not be allowed to see these areas? Why should those of us with lives not have the ability to use the service to its full extent because we took longer to do it? <br>
<br>
I can understand the thrill of &quot;we did it first&quot; but I really don't care about that. I just want to do it when I am ready and able to. Most of my guild has spent months and even years getting raid ready, leveling their characters to 46+ so that they can get there. Why should some no life loser have the right to thumb his nose at them and say 'to bad so sad, you were to slow'??? That is a severe insult, and I am expressing my opinion as to how this may be rectified. <br>
<br>
This is an issue that has been discussed in great detail in other posts. I know this, I read them, and there seems to be a lot more people in favor of my opinion than against it.<br>
<br>
And about the Walmart thing. If they have some thing that is an awesome deal, it is almost always limited to 1 per customer...<br>

<br>
Why do YOU feel entitled to monopolize a spawn/zone just because you play the game more often or got to a mob first?<br>
<br>
<br>
Fact is people want to at least have the opportunity to take part in what a game has to offer.  Being shut out due to other players is simply not a long-term viable solution for MMOGs.  <br>
<br>
This must and will change in future generations of games.<br>

We are waiting IVU for the rest of our party to show up . Before they can arrive , a 57 monk in full Kael gear shows up and starts mowing the camp down . He doesn't call for a camp check , ask us are we camping this or anything , just starts killing the spawn . There is no way we can KS him becuase we are after all SK's , no way combined we can outdamage this jerk . Now it's hard enough to be a gimp SK floundering your way thru a game made for warrs and monks without some idiot like this camp stealing . <br>
<br>
This is the same type of person who says no to limits on camps and let the strongest party keep the camp , no matter who got there first . <br>
<br>
Interesting that the people not wanting these changes are all lvl 60 uber guild members . Go figure ) .<br>
<br>
My money  pays for this game just like yours does uber dude . These all mighty super twinks represent about 6 percent of the whole EQ population . Why bow to thier wishes ?<br>
<br>
Probably because GM's are buddies with them and thier guilds  for one . They are monopolizing the top end of this game paid for by all the rest of us losers .<br>
<br>
I say put it to a vote amonst the EQ community . The next patch should include a player poll asking whether or not to make the game accessible to  all players , or just the 5 percent in uber guilds with GM buddies .<br>
<br>
I'm also for placing more lvl restrictions on gear . Seeing a lvl 60 cat three or four weeks after the release of Luclin was really just too much . It really is wrong that once a guild gets strong enough they can on a whim create a char and have it lvl 60 in less than a month , this needs to stop . It's ruining the game .<br>
<br>
I guess no matter what you do you're always going to have these punk hacker , phat l33t , camp stealing/hogging dirtbags no matter what you do . But focusing more on the customer base instead of the GM's friends and the uber guilds who are such a small part of the overall player base would go a long way to improving the game . <br>

And you should get uber loot for not playing 24/7 while others do?

Look at my sig up there, notice I'm no &quot;uber guild&quot; member. However this comes along part of my belief system. If a group has the power to do something they can and will do it.<br>

What does your money actually pay for? Well most of it goes as a guarentee of service, that you will be able to access the servers for the monthly period you pay for. I'd venture almost so far as to say all of it.<br>

Where the hell do you get off telling them they can't do it? Just because you wish you were in that postition doesn't mean you should try and limit them if they want to spend that much of their life playing this game.<br>
<br>
This goes a lot farther then just EQ. Too many people feel that the government, or Verant, or whatever owes them something. Your NOT entitled to it. You get what you work for.<br>
<br>
As far as the timezone thing, well those people outside of the US are the ones who have to put up with patches right in the middle of their prime play time. Where do you get off telling the people that begin playing when the servers come up that they can't kill uber_mob_01 because you want your turn?<br>
<br>
A large portion of people need to get over themselves and realize they aren't the only ones playing this game.<br>
