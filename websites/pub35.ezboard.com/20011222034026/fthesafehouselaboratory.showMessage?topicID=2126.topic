Some of them come up a lot. Unfortunately the information in the Rogue FAQ in the library is somewhat lean on poisoning information, and the unofficial tome of mastery, while the definitive source for effect and recipie information, is not good for answering questions.<br>
<br>
So I'll take a shot at answering common questions in this thread and we'll see if it turns out to be useful. Feel free to chime in with questions and answers to be added.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Is poison worth it?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A very common question. The Rogue FAQ says:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         1.4 Why should I use poison?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you have lots of time and money, it can add a lot of flavor to your experiences as a Rogue. You will be more effective in combat if the effect goes off and does inflicts the target successfully.<br>
<br>
Another good response I read was that from a min/max perspective, no poison isn't very effective. But it can add some fun to your character, and has some uses.  Will you be handicapped without it? No not really. But you can do some fun things with it.  If you want to use poison to be a super-effective combat machine, you'll be disappointed. If you want to play with it because you want to try it and have some money to burn, you'll probably enjoy it.<br>
<br>
In PvP poison is a whole different matter. I am not a PvP player and will leave that matter to the experts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         How do I make such-and-such poison?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Go here: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessage?topicID=1204.topic">pub35.ezboard.com/fthesaf...1204.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  This is the thread that is pinned to the top of this forum - it contains information on every recipie, every ingredient and every effect of poisons. A lot of rogues worked hard to pull that info together and it's extremely useful to the aspiring toxicologist.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Is there a way to make poisons stack?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> or<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Can poisons be made to stack like shaman potions for multiple charges?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> or<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Is there an item like the bearskin bag that will let you stack poisons?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No. There is currently no way to stack poisons. VI has always said this would be very difficult for them to implement. There was talk at a recent fan faire about allowing us to combine poisons into a multi-charge bottle, and then right clicking the bottle would &quot;break off&quot; a single charge of poison that could then be applied. However we have heard nothing about this since that time.  Poisons do not stack. The best you can do is carry your mortar and ingredients, all of which stack.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Does a lower resist posion stack with malosi?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> or<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Does a slow poison stack with slow spells?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> etc.<br>
<br>
It depends.  Some effects will stack, while others won't. The malosi line will overwrite our lower resist poisons.  Most slow spells overwrite our slow poisons. For other effects it will vary depending on the poison and the spell. Unfortunately there's no simple answer here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Is Make Poison capped by level?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Yes. The exact formula is not quite clear. But the cap is 200 at level 50 and goes up 5/level to stop at 250 at level 60. Prior to level 50 I'm not quite sure of the formula.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Is Make Poison a trade skill? Will it be my single above-200 trade skill if I raise it that high?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No. Make Poison is a class skill, not a trade skill. It will not prevent you from raising another trade skill over 200.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next few come right from the Rogue FAQ:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         2.11 How do I apply poison?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
By right clicking on a poison vial, you will automatically sit and apply the poison to your primary weapon slot. Applying poison takes roughly 7 seconds. You cannot poison any weapon type other than piercing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         2.12 How do I make poison?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
First you'll need to buy the supplies. A poison recipe book can be helpful, but is not necessary. There are several vendors in Norrath.<br>
<br>
[the list in the FAQ is out of date - consult the Unofficial Tome of Mastery for vendor locations]<br>
<br>
You will need to have a mortar and pestle to combine the components in. For EACH vial of poison you will need: A suspension fluid , Various poison components from creatures around Norrath, and a vial made by potters or purchased from one of the above mentioned vendors. The poison book will have the recipes, but be sure to check the Safehouse Library forum for all the information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         2.12.1 How long does the poison last?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Each application is for one use only. If you zone without the poison effect going off, you also will lose it. Upon the first hit with your piercing weapon, the poison effect will go off. There is a chance the mob will resist the poison. Backstab will not activate poison. Note also that you must use a piercing weapon for poison.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Can I keep the poison from going off until a tank has secured agro?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There's an answer hidden in the last sentence of the answer above. You have to have a piercing weapon equipped when you poison, but it won't go off unless you have one equipped when you attack. You can therefore apply poison, and switch to a 1hb or 1hs weapon, and then attack. The poison will not go off. Then switch in a piercing weapon and the poison will go off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Can I poison throwing weapons?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The simple answer is &quot;no&quot;.  The more complicated answer is that you can sort of do it, if you poison a weapon that can be both equipped in the primary hand and the range slot, and then throw it. It's complicated and not for casual use.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Can I hand a poisoned weapon to someone else?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Can I poison several weapons and keep them in inventory?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Can I poison my secondary weapon and my primary weapon for double effecti? </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
No.  It seems like you are poisoning a weapon, but it would be more true to the game engine to say that you are activating a one-time proc on yourself that will go off on the next hit with a piercing weapon.  You are not actually doing anything to the weapon. If it helps, think of it like casting a spell on yourself that will go off next time you stab a monster.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         How do I raise my pottery skill so I can make my own vials?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There are a number of excellent pottery guides. The best source for info on any tradeskill is probably www.eqtraders.com, which has recipies, guides, vendor data, and so on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Where can I find skins to make vials with?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Many places. In days gone by, most rogues worked with zombie skins since they were the only kind of skin that would stack. Unrest was the most frequently farmed zone for this. However since pelts of various animals are now stackable, there are many more possibilities. East karanas and Stoneburnt mountains come immediately to mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         What is the secondary attribute for poison? Dex? Int?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
When you find out, let us know.  I read something recently that said at a fan faire they were debating making dex the secondary attribute, which implies that at this time there is none. No definitive information exists on this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Does my apply skill affect how long my poison lasts?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Uncertain. After reading accounts from a number of people, I'm inclined to say no. But no definitive testing has been done on this. Generally the only established information about the apply skill is that once you get over 100, you will very rarely fail to apply a poison.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         How can I raise my Make Poison skill quickly and cheaply?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You can't.  Poison making is not a cheap skill by any means.   There are extensive costs both in time and platinum. Generally you will need to spend both, and if you want to spend less money you will need to spend more time, and the reverse applies.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        Can I apply multiple poisons or stack two different kinds of poison on my weapon?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No. At least not how you probably mean. You can apply one poison after the other - the second poison will overwrite the first one.   You can poison a mob multiple times - you have to apply your first poison, hit the monster, back out, apply the second poison, and attack again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Can I buy poison from a merchant, or from other rogues?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You cannot buy poison from any merchant at this time. There are quests you can do for poison, but they require farming just like making the poison does.  Whether you can buy poison from other rogues depends on your server. It is my understanding that there are not many rogues selling poison on the open market, but some do take comissions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Will VI be &quot;fixing&quot; poison soon?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Who can probe the dark mysterious depths of the inner workings of VI? Certainly not I.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         What about those &quot;haste&quot; poisons? Do they haste me?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No, they haste the target. The idea is that while they speed up the target's attacks, it debuffs other stats. There are some limited uses for this type of poison but that's about all. No poison has any effect on anything except the beastie that it hits (i.e. it never does anything to you, just the target).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>         Can I apply poison from within a bag?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It depends on what inventory screen you are using.<br>
<br>
If you are using the pre-SoV inventory screen, yes.<br>
<br>
If you are using the SoV (full screen) inventory screen, no you have to apply from a main inventory slot.<br>
<br>

Technically, yes.  However the new poison will over-write the first poison.  &quot;Double dipping&quot; may help your Apply skill increase, but you will not get a multi-poisoned strike with that weapon. <p>-- <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7436" target="_blank">Lemac Dushae</a>, Redeemed member of the Court of Jesters<BR>43rd Season.. um.. er..

Is there a way to poison a weapon but not have it go off before the main tank gets enough aggro to hold the mob?<br>
<br>
Yes.  You can poison a weapon as usual, but not equip a piercing weapon.  By using a 1HS or 1HB weapons, you can still Apply Poison, but the poison will not work until you attack with a piercing weapon.  Once the main tank has the mob securely, swap in a piercer to attack with poison.<br>

Edited to reflect additions.  Lannella - that question is answered in the copy from the Rogue FAQ 2.12.1 where it says that backstab doesn't count.<br>

You neither need to have a piercer in your primary weapon slot when you apply the poison nor do you need one to make it go off. It does depend on the type of poison if it can be used with a slasher, though. BTW: If this does not work in full screen mode, don't blame me. I do use the &quot;old&quot; interface, not the full screen mode. Here I can also apply poison from any bag, not only from a main inventory slot. <br>

<br>
Can I poisen a piercing weapon in my secondary slot and another piercing weapon in my primary slot for a double effect?<br>
<br>
The answer, of course, is no.  I believe you are actually poisening the primary slot itself, and if it is empty upon apply poisen, you will apply the poisen to your hands.<br>
