<br>
The test: Primal velium spear mainhand, Priceless velium hammer offhand, haste item is SCHW.  Hit a soulbinder for a long time, analyze the results.<br>
<br>
Duration: 4 hours, 58 minutes, 7 seconds<br>
<br>
Results:<br>
<br>
Test 14 (Avatar: True)<br>
Mainhand (Primal Velium Spear, Delay: 20)<br>
  Number of strikes = 10915<br>
  Number of attacks = 17560<br>
  Number of hits = 11821<br>
  Number of misses = 5739<br>
  Total damage = 379284<br>
  Average damage per attack = 21.5993166287016<br>
  Average damage per hit = 32.0856103544539<br>
  Damage per second = 17.3744388456253<br>
<br>
Offhand (Priceless Velium Hammer, Delay: 20)<br>
  Number of strikes = 8915<br>
  Number of attacks = 14321<br>
  Number of hits = 8992<br>
  Number of misses = 5329<br>
  Total damage = 164796<br>
  Average damage per attack = 11.5072969764681<br>
  Average damage per hit = 18.3269572953737<br>
  Damage per second = 9.24262478968031<br>
<br>
&quot;Strikes&quot; in this case means each time a hand attacks which can be a single or double attack.  Simple logic says:<br>
<br>
Hasted Delay = 10 * Duration of Test / Number of Strikes<br>
<br>
Plugging in the above numbers yields a hasted delay of... 16.388.<br>
<br>
Calculating the haste of SCHW:<br>
<br>
Haste% = Listed Delay / Hasted Delay - 1<br>
<br>
20/16.388 - 1 = 22.04%<br>
<br>
This matches results posted on Monkly Business (and other places).<br>
<br>
I think a five hour combat sample is enough to determine haste to a fairly accurate level.  Conclusion: hasted delays ARE fractional.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, this test also gives accurate percentages on maxed skills:<br>
<br>
Dual Wield: 81.68%<br>
Double Attack: 60.64-60.88% (first number is primary hand result from test, second is offhand result)<br>
<br>
For reference:<br>
<br>
Number of avatar procs: 526<br>
Number of mainhand (primal) swings = 17560<br>
Chance of avatar proc per swing: 3%<br>
<br>
Avatar was up the entire time of the test.<br>

I always wanted to have some info on the following question:<br>
You have a piercing in main hand and a 1HB (or 1HS) in the off hand. Obviously the &quot;hit chance&quot; of the main hand depend from piercing skill and other factors. I always wondered if the &quot;hit chance&quot; of the second hand was linked to the proper skill (in your test  1 HB) or if its the same as the main hand.<br>
Could you precise if both piercing and 1 HB in your test were maxed at 250? Do you think 5% difference is significant over the number of hit you have (sorry my math lessons are very far behind).<br>
<br>
Also i dont really understand the &quot;fractional&quot; thing. Please educate me.<br>

<br>
Piercing 250<br>
1hb 200<br>
<br>
BTW for hit/miss chances this particular test is not accurate (I have other posts on this subject however) because I did not bother to filter parries/ripostes/dodges properly.  In this test they are counted as misses (but really they should be counted as hits).  That being said, they are indicative (since the number of ripostes/dodges/parries is quite smal) even if they're not 100% accurate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you think 5% difference is significant over the number of hit you have &quot;<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Also i dont really understand the &quot;fractional&quot; thing. Please educate me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Its all about the way haste works.  Ignoring broken bard songs for the time being, you can have two types of haste at any one time: worn haste and spell (or song) haste.  Haste is measured as a percent increase in number of attacks.  Thus if you hit 50 times a minute with a weapon and no haste then with 40% haste you'll hit 70 times a minute (70 = 50 * 1.4).  The reason for this is because percent increase in attacks is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> additive</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  By this I mean that 40% worn haste plus 30% spell haste will give 70% total haste.<br>
<br>
Now the question is: how does this work in practise?  The obvious solution for the game engine is to calculate a new delay for your weapons so with 100% haste a delay 20 weapon will become delay 10.  Incidentally this leads to the formula mentioned above:<br>
<br>
Percent haste = Listed delay (from right clicking on the weapon) / Hasted Delay<br>
<br>
Assuming new delays are calculated what happens when you get fractional delays?  For example, with 100% haste delay 25 turns into 12.5.  Different people think the game engine rounds up (to 13), truncates (to 12) or rounds off (to the nearest integer which could be 12 or 13 in this case).<br>
<br>
I previously held the view that hasted delays were rounded up.  What this test clearly shows is that isn't the case.  In fact it shows they aren't rounded at all.  Rounding 16.388 to either 16 or 17 would involve <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> significant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> error in a sample this size.  More to the point, as we commonly understand haste (and assume it to be), sample size beyond a fairly small number shouldn't matter because haste isn't (we assume) randomly applied.<br>
<br>
I'm running some more tests on weapons with different delays to see if the haste figures for SCHW match.<br>
<br>
All this has another point: I want to establish once and for all what the proc rate on primal weapons are.  In another thread someone suggested that proc rates were constant in time even though they were applied on a swing.  To put it another way: proc rate is independant of haste.  Thats what I'm really testing.  To do that one needs really large sample sizes (in this case 5 hours) because the proc rate is so low (3% or so per swing in this test). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uprodigious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prodigious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse Supporter</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 4:09:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11593.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hasted delays ARE fractional</span><hr size=1> another myth bites the dust...thanks for the test <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uhobben.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hobben</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/02 4:33:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11593.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hasted delays ARE fractional</span><hr size=1> Was told awhile back by a dev that hasted weapon delay rounds to 3 digits.

For some years I also played on and coded for MUDs (LPMUDs specifically).  My programmer brain got to thinking about the EQ engine and I came up with some thoughts.  The MUD thing is relevant because architecturally EQ is little more than a collection of MUDs (each zone is conceptually a separate MUD).<br>
<br>
In LPMUDs you have a &quot;heartbeat&quot;.  By default, the MUD driver generates a heartbeat every 2 seconds (this is configurable with a compile-time option).  If it gets particularly laggy then heartbeats can take longer than 2 seconds (in fact once I wrote a lag meter that looked specifically for heartbeats longer than the norm to measure lag).  Heartbeat is used to drive combat.  You attack/swing/whatever at each beat.<br>
<br>
Onto EQ... Spells and weapon delays have one noteworthy thing in common: all the times are multiples of 0.1 seconds.  Also, in laggy situations spawns can slow down and combat can slow down.  The intuitive response (from my programmer brain) is that EQ uses a similar algorithm based on 0.1 second increments.<br>
<br>
This was the basis for my original thinking that hasted delays are rounded or truncated.  But it could be more complicated than that.<br>
<br>
Going back to comp sci, and graphics programming in particular, theres a fundamental and important algorithm known as Bresenham's Line Algorithm.  What this algorithm does (or was originally intended to do) was draw straight lines on pixellated devices (when the lines weren't perfectly horizontal or perfectly vertical).  The algorithm works out which pixels you should draw and which you shouldn't.  This leads to pixellated lines like:<br>
<br>

<br>
View that from a distance and you'll find it looks remarkably straight.  Its the result of Bresenham's Line Algorithm (which, incidentally, can be mathematically proven to be the straightest possible line).<br>
<br>
How does this relate to EQ?  Well the algorithm has a remarkably large number of applications beyond drawing lines.  For one thing, its used in image scaling.  I've numbered the left and top of the line to show pixel coordinates.  The line goes from (1,1) to (25,10) and has a slope of -tan-1(10/25) (for the mathematically minded.  So how do browsers scale images?<br>
<br>
Say you have an image 10 pixels wide and you want to sacle it to 25 pixels wide.  Look at the above diagram and see where the line is.  The first pixel would be repeated 3 times, the second twice, the third 3 times, etc and you'll end up with 25 pixels.  It can also be used in reverse.  25 to 10 pixels would mean the ten pixels are pixels 1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24 (look at the diagram to see why).<br>
<br>
Again I hear you asking: what does this have to do with EQ?<br>
<br>
Simple: if you have a weapon of delay 20 then (believe it or not) then this is somewhat analagous to drawing a line of slope 1/20 (slope 1/20 means for every 20 units it goes &quot;right&quot; it goes &quot;up&quot; 1).  What about haste?  With SCHW (haste 22%) its like drawing a line of (1/20) * (1+22%).<br>
<br>
End result?  Attacks still occur on 0.1 boundaries but &quot;effective&quot; delays are fractional.  Example: delay 25 means an attack every 2.5 seconds.  At 100% haste, following the above theory, doesn't mean an attack every 1.2 seconds, 1.3 seconds or even 1.25 seconds.  It means: attack, pause 1.2 seconds, attack, pause 1.3 seconds, repeat.  See the logic?  Seeing this from log files would be difficult because partial second increments aren't reported but I suepct it is done like this or in a similar way that achieves a very similar result.<br>
<br>
And here endeth the pointless technical speculation.  More test results to follow.<br>

  Damage per second = 17.1072752548656<br>
<br>
Offhand (Priceless Velium Hammer, Delay: 20)<br>

  Number of attacks = 14073<br>
  Number of hits = 8837<br>

  Damage per second = 9.14702851253865<br>
<br>
Duration of Test = 6 hours 4 minutes 40 seconds<br>
Number of Avatar Procs = 604<br>
Number of mainhand (primal) swings = 17410<br>
Chance of Avatar proc per swing = 3.5%<br>
<br>
The chance of proccing is not substantially higher than in the previous test.  But what if we adjust the figures for hasted delay?<br>
<br>
3% @ 16.388 delay = 0.183% per delay<br>
3.5% @ 20 delay = 0.175% per delay<br>
<br>
Both figures (3-3.5% and 0.183-0.175%) are close.  Too close for my liking.  I'm going to run a test with RB level haste but unfortuantely that will be hard to tell because the primal spear and RB hits can't easily and accurately be distinguished.<br>
<br>
First I might run a comparison test on a different delay weapon to confirm SCHW haste percentage and fractional delay.<br>

<br>
In order of 1% difference is quite normal - atleast from what I have seen - and its fair to assume that weapon &quot;swings&quot; are related to the servers &quot;tick&quot; rather than your local measurement of &quot;6 sec&quot;.<br>
<br>
If we look at your unhasted data this shows nicely - infact the difference is even larger than 1%. <br>
<br>
6h 4m 40 sec = 21880 seconds. Thats 10940 x 2.0 sec. Yet, we only see 10790 strikes in the main hand. So, either a 20 delay weapon doesnt strike every 2.0 sec - there is a difference between &quot;server time&quot; and &quot;local time&quot; - or a combination.<br>
<br>
So, if you want to rely on the timestamps or on an external clock to measure time spent you need to consider that this might not be running at the exact same speed as the servers clock - and whats worse, they might not even convergent as time goes towards infinity.<br>
<br>
In short - if you wont to do this seriously you need to decide a way to use &quot;server time&quot;. Hp regen would be my suggestion.<br>

For the unhasted test theres basically 300 seconds missing (which is about 1.4%).  That makes it extremely difficult to test accurately.  HP regen is one option but it has two problems:<br>
<br>
1. It doesn't automatically go to the log file so how do you timestamp it? and<br>
<br>
2. It doesn't seem to strictly obey the tick boundary.  For instance if I look at my HP bar it'll go up 5? from natural regen (level 60 + AA regen3) and half a second to two seconds later I'll get my fungi regen come through (of 15/tick).  Possibly the messages are sent as different packets and each can have a different propagation delay.<br>
<br>
Server lag plus network propagation variation are two factors that seem hard to eliminate.<br>
<br>
Oh and my 16.388 figure is also inaccuarate by that count because these two factors are included in the calculation.  Based on 1.5% lag you arrive at effective delay of 16.15 or so at which point you're getting rather close to 16 (ie possibly truncated hasted delay).<br>

<br>
1 - Get a good deal of HP buffs - but no regen buffs and preferably no fungi.<br>
2 - Get low on HP.<br>
3 - Watch the &quot;lag-o-meter&quot;. It blinks once every sec (presuably server tick). Note that your HP goes up every 6 &quot;blinks&quot;. Assume that when your HP goes up = 1 tick.<br>
4 - Start your test right after a tick - noting down HP at the start.<br>
5 - Whenever you get close to full health - have someone nuke you - obviously noting the damage done to you.<br>
6 - Stop your test right at tick - using an insta click item to force an update. <br>
7 - Use hp at start, hp at the end, hp lost during test and hp regen to determine how many server ticks went by. <br>
<br>
It wont be 100% perfect - but I think its as close as you will ever get.<br>
<br>
The current form just doesnt work though - as you note the descrepancy of 1.4% is just too large.<br>

<br>
Test 17 (Avatar: True)<br>
Mainhand (Crystall Short Sword, Delay: 24)<br>
  Number of strikes = 5395<br>
  Number of attacks = 8693<br>
  Number of hits = 5727<br>
  Number of misses = 2966<br>
  Total damage = 169784<br>
  Average damage per attack = 19.5311169906822<br>
  Average damage per hit = 29.6462371224027<br>
  Damage per second = 13.1127587272166<br>
<br>
Offhand (Primal Velium Spear, Delay: 20)<br>
  Number of strikes = 5440<br>
  Number of attacks = 8760<br>
  Number of hits = 5846<br>
  Number of misses = 2914<br>
  Total damage = 123154<br>
  Average damage per attack = 14.0586757990868<br>
  Average damage per hit = 21.066370167636<br>
  Damage per second = 11.3193014705882<br>
<br>
Duration of Test = 3 hours, 1 minutes, 48 seconds<br>
Number of mainhand (CSS) strikes = 5395<br>
Effective Delay = 20.22<br>
Effective Haste = 18.7%<br>
<br>
The discrepancy between this haste percentage (18.7% and 22%) is simply too large to be explained by anything other than hasted delay rounding (imho).  Factor in 1.5% server lag and you arrive at pretty close to 20 delay.  The 16.388 delay however needs 2.5% or so server lag to comfortably reach 16 which seems rather high.<br>
<br>
Looking at avatar procs:<br>
<br>
Number of offhand (primal spear) attacks = 8760<br>
Number of avatar procs = 148<br>
Chance of avatar proc per swing = <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1.7%</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is rather low considering previous sampls.  Assuming SCHW hasted delay 20 to 16 compare:<br>
<br>
3% @ 16 delay = 0.1875% per delay<br>
3.5% @ 20 delay = 0.175% per delay<br>
<br>
The figures are wider (which doesn't really help).  But what if:<br>
<br>
3% @ 17 delay = 0.177% per delay<br>
<br>
Unfortunately there seems to be no evidence the new delay is 17.  And now:<br>
<br>
1.7% @ 16 delay = 0.106% per delay<br>
<br>
This is even more way off.  What does it mean?  Unfortunately this has raised more questions than it answered.  I will have to run a CSS main, primal off (no haste) test as a baseline to compare Test 17 to however.<br>
<br>
I would really like to answer the question of whether proc rate is independant of haste but I'm not getting any clear answer here.  Now the spectre has been raised of proc rates differing depending on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> hand</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> /sigh.<br>
<br>
Heres another interesting possibility:<br>
<br>
Test 14: 526 procs for 379284 damage (no haste) = 721 damage per proc<br>
Test 16: 604 procs for 369175 damage (SCHW) = 611 damage per proc<br>
Test 17: 148 procs for 123154 damage (SCHW) = 832 damage per proc<br>
<br>
Factoring in damage brings Test 17 back into the same ballpark.  The idea of another factor in proc rate is compelling however.<br>

Let's also assume the only dexterity affects proc rate.  In the first set of numbers and the second set of numbers then the proc rate per swing should be the same (dexterity was equal, weapon was always main-handed).<br>
<br>
Using the numbers of <br>
hasted : 526 procs for 17560 swings<br>
unhasted : 604 procs for 17410 swings<br>
<br>
Analyzing this with a chi-squared test the P value is less than 0.025 which indicates the the rates per swing from these two trials are significantly different from each other.<br>
<br>
If you treat proc rate as a proc per time you get the following numbers:<br>
<br>
hasted : 106 proc/hour<br>
unhasted : 99 proc/hour<br>
<br>
Unfortunately you can't run a statistical test on these numbers because it's continuous and not count data.  Because the sample size is 1 you have no idea of the variability in the data.  Instead of running long time trials to 'even out' the variability, I suggest you run several short trials (~15-30 min each).  You can then average the data and run student t-tests on them (or something more complex if you wish).  It's important to realize though, that for this sort of data you are not increasing sample size by running longer tests.<br>
<br>
Offhand proc rate is very different from mainhand proc rate whether you want to treat it on a per swing or a per time basis.

<br>
This was something I was hoping to answer.  The intuitive assumption is that proc rate is on a per-swing basis.  If so then you'd expect that offhand proc rate was equivalent to your mainhand proc rate multiplied by your offhand attack chance (81-82% in this case).  Clearly that doesn't seem to be the case.<br>
<br>
So what explains the disparity between mainhand and offhand proc rates?  The other obvious difference is damage.  Mainhand has damage bonus and offhand doesn't.  Or could there be some other (possibly arbitrary) factor?<br>
<br>
Like I said: it raises more questions than it solves.<br>

Think I can help a bit here maybe- past experience suggests to me that proc rate/chance is based on ACTUAL weapon delay (not the displayed value), and NOT a % chance per-swing basis.  Try the same tests with a drastic (tigirs or similar) slow and you should see the per-swing proc rate go way up, but the actual time-based proc rate stay relatively constant...  This jives with empirical observations that 2h weapons (longer delays) seem to proc more often on a per-swing basis than 1h'ers do, etc.  Also makes sense from verant persepective, as they wouldn't have to worry about ultrafast procing weapons becoming unbalanced, etc.<br>
<br>
How did I come to this conculsion?  Parsing logs from AE pulls when I used the AA rampage skill... got a SIGNIFICANTLY increased number of procs when I was tirgired and hit rampage vs. when I wasn't, despite all other things being equal (~ same # mobs, 255 dex, same weapon, etc.).  Just never had enough data points to prove it conclusively, and have been too lazy to figure out another test to validate the suspicion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

How did you determine that two attempts to hit were the same strike? In the same second isn't good enough because the time stamps in your log are client side, and a small change in lag can cause two hits to appear to occur in the same second even if they weren't from double attack. Could you check the log to see how many times you hit three times in a single second (or, how many times however you determined a stike resulted in three hits)? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrue70.showPublicProfile?language=EN>grue70</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 1:57:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11593.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Just to amend my previous post I summarized my tests wrongly.

<br>
Gap of 1 second = 49<br>
Gap of 2 seconds = 10361<br>
Gap of 3 seconds = 329<br>
Gap of 4+ seconds = 0<br>
<br>
Total piercing hits = 10739<br>
<br>
Note: this is a different total hit count from the earlier Test 16 result because some stuff at the beginning should've been filtered out and wasn't.<br>
<br>
A delay of 3 seconds is easy: its simplly a lagged gap.  Gaps of 1 second are more problematic however.because it could mean anything from 0.1 second (a double hit across a second boundaary) or 1.9 seconds (first packet takes longer to arrive than second).<br>
<br>
This obviously (unfortunately) invalidates a lot of mye arlier results (doh!) so I'll have to revisit those when I refine my methodology.  Theres two ways this error can be reduced that I see:<br>
<br>
1. Test with a character that doesn't have double attack.  This is probably a more accurate way of measuring haste as it eliminates one kind of ambiguous result; and<br>
<br>
2. Use slower weapons.  This reduces but does not entirely eliminate error.<br>
<br>
Oh well, back to the drawing board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ugrue70.showPublicProfile?language=EN>grue70</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/20/02 3:59:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11593.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I forgot to add:<br>

Number of seconds that had more than 2 attacks = 2 (both had 3)<br>
<br>
Just looking at Test 16 again:<br>
<br>
Duration = 6 hours, 2 minutes, 38 seconds (21758 seconds)<br>
Number of piercing swings = 17335<br>
Estimated number of strikes = 10834 (based on 60% double attack)<br>
Number of strikes * delay of 20 = 21668 seconds<br>
Estimated missing time = 90 seconds<br>
<br>
So in 6 hours, an estimated 90 seconds is unaccounted for which is roughly 0.4% server lag (estimated not actual).<br>
<br>
Looking at actual piercing (mainhand primal) results:<br>
<br>
Number of swings = 17335<br>
Number of misses = 5587<br>
Number of defended hits (block, parry, dodge, riposte) = 211<br>
Number of hits = 11537<br>
Chance to hit = 67.8%<br>
Total Damage = 368140<br>
Average damage per hit = 31.91<br>
Number of avatar procs = 603<br>
Procs/hour = 99.8<br>
Procs/1000 swings = 34.8<br>
Procs/1000 hits (included defended hits) = 51.3<br>
Procs/1000 hits (excluding defended hits) = 52.3<br>
Procs/1000 damage = 1.64<br>
