We have gotten completely mired down in that topic though. 90%of this board has turned into flame wars and propaganda over which class is better. The safehouse is a rogue COMMUNITY site. We need to spend more time working together for the common good. There are huge problems for our craft as a whole in DAoC. As I see it we don't have a proper role anymore. We add nothing to a group in PvE that can not be MUCH better done by another class. In RvR we have a very limited group of targets that we can kill if they are running around alone. How often do you see a caster running around alone in the frontier that you have a chance to attack? My challenge to anyone is to define what we are supposed to do in RvR combat (something useful - I know we excel at running slowly to scout keeps). Id like to see some ideas for how to increase our roles in PvE and RvR. Lets pretend Mythic is really listening to us and reading these boards. Please post reasonable and balanced ideas only. Here are a couple that I have thought of to start the debates.<br>
<br>
1. Add a back facing only, high   to hit, high damage, high defensive penalty, detaunt at various levels in the CS line. In PvE this would make us useful to a group as a primary source of damage (we have no role at all). In RvR it would give us a role in the large battles - we can stalk through the combat literally backstabbing people. With this attack we should do more damage than a tank - balanced by the fact that we have drastically less hp and armor.<br>
2. Make all CS styles bypass resistances and armor absorption. This would really make us assassins, feared by all single targets as long as our endurance holds up.<br>
<br>
Please post suggestions on changes or ideas on what our role is/should be in this game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uwulien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wulien</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/02 1:27:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3630.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~eddytaylor/data/deadbernie.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some ideas for debate</span><hr size=1> I like #2.<br>
<br>
We have to be hidden and stuff, so why can't we scour out the cracks in our opponents armor?? I ask you, does that not make sense? Besides, the attack is called &quot;Perforate Artery&quot; not &quot;Perforate Plate Armor&quot; I mean come on. That makes me think of a neck shot or something, not an attack that has to go through armor.<br>
<br>
I'm also hearing that damage against the 50 epic armor is pretty screwed. I remember one horror story in particular of a perf on a sitting tank for like 200 at 50.<br>
<br>
NS spell <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> damage</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> needs to be raised on the spells as well as the shouts, SB LA is still pretty screwy I hear, and they also need something else to compensate for the missing spec points.<br>
<br>
If NS spell damage gets raised (now that the variance is fixed) and maybe given some self buffs (because dear god they have the weakest stats) then that would probably be pretty good.<br>
<br>
Infs... be happy with your spec points, rejoice and praise that you haven't gotten them nerfed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><TABLE>

Add a back facing only, high to hit, high damage, high defensive penalty, detaunt at various levels in the CS line.&quot;<br>
<br>
What does that mean? Why do you need detaunt if you are facing the back? Why do you need high damage? All that would happen is that you would pull aggro on your leather wearing self. Forget about using DoTs. Please clarify.<br>
<br>
1. I would like to see the enervating line improved for PvE. It does very little at low to medium levels when compared to your own level. When I use a High level say 37 level and Im fighting 37 level mobs then it works fair. If they made it so when fighting purple cons in a group the debuff would lower the mobs damage by 20% - 25% that would help a lot in making us more group friendly. <br>
<br>
2. Also a new poison like withering that slowed the attack speed of a Mob considerably would help make us group friendly.<br>
<br>
3. Disguise would bring a new excitement to the class.<br>
<br>
4. So would trap picking and trap laying. Maybe based off our poison line. You are able to lay out some traps that trigger a DoT poison a snare poison or disease. wow... that would be kewl to do to a door or some other object?<br>
<br>
5. Man-able war machines. Lets say it took a couple of people to werk a boiling cauldron above a keep door. <br>
<br>
6. increase the xp we get to kill mobs in the high 30s and 40s. <br>
<br>
7. Make a PvE colessium where we could go and have gladiator battles agains Mobs like tigers and such or PvE computer controlled classes like Paladins or Infiltrators etc. With a score board and a waiting list to do battle. What a great place to be entertained. We could barter while we were there. And place bets on fights etc. Trade wares.<br>
<br>
8. Make a RvR Collesium that you couldn't attack each other unless you entered a contest by list. Maybe have 1 on 1 battles or 3 on 3 or 8 on 8 max. Divide the Colessium into 3 section (Hib, Mid, Alb) so they could taunt each other without attacking. And sign up for a battle if they are brave. Could there be language transators? Maybe that would exploit some type of cheat. So keep the taunting in giberish then.<br>
<br>
hmmm<br>

<br>
Snare poisons are actually &quot;root&quot; poisons, but since the root is broken after the next damage (bleed/poison) they don’t seem very useful. Maybe to keep in reserve on spare weapon to aid escape then re stealth for 2nd round. I tested this on MOBs in PvE and they did NOT root. Maybe RvR... still testing. Update - minor crippling did root for a 'short' time (about 2 seconds)or until bleed/dot. too bad perf causes bleeding. .. OK 5/20/02 rumor that it will stun and hold your enemy... maybe only in RvR... still testing. Ok found this post but I wanna see for myself still 4/26/02 -- It has been confirmed that these(crippling) do NOT break on damage and that this is how they are intended to work for assassins. Zedisa - Nightshade TL <br>
<br>
<br>
I haven't found it to snare in PvE without breaking but I haven't tried recently. <br>
<br>
I wasn't talking about snare anyway... I was talking about a slowing of the attack speed. Along the lines of Basiliskfang - Medium fatigue, use from beside target, medium bonus damage, heavy attack speed reduction, small bonus to hit, small bonus to defense. If we got a poison that would effectively accomplish this. I haven't found the snare to do this but I will test it oncemore when i get a chance.<br>

The post is asking for stuff to make rogues more group friendly... why don't you all just post something useful instead of arguing a stupid point that I made about wanting a &amp;*($(^ attack speed reduction poison to help us become more group friendly (at the poster's request)<br>
<br>
If you dont like it then whatever... post something better<br>

<br>
Well I wouldn't have taken up this challenge before this weekend when I helped in storming several keeps, but I'll try it now.  <br>
<br>
We had a about 5 Shades who repeatedly climbed up the walls and killed archers/mages (and others) hanging out on the parapets.  This severely limited the defenders ability to blast our attackers during this siege.  (And it was a BLAST!)<br>
<br>
I also got the opportunity to help defend one of the keeps (that's how the whole thing started).  My role was the reverse, hang out at the climb points waiting for enemy stealthers to try to come up, then knock them from the walls.  Several of us also did several sorties out to harass the attackers, but this didn't seem like a particularly sensible survival strategy unless done very, very carefully. <p>Sanlail Swiftpaw

<br>
1. Give us back our 1-shot &amp; stay stealthed- at least on a  percentage chance. Would prefer it to be level based. That way no one can bitch about spec point differences. <br>
<br>
2. Give us all a wider window of opportunity for PA's. It's not our fault concerning the 3 sec update lag.We shouldn't be made to  pay a price for it. Too many assassins have suffered from failed PA's ruining their kills after stalking their targets for some untold amount of time. <br>
<br>
3. For everyone of every class of every realm: Give WAY MORE XP for mob kills at 40th and above. By 40th, I would hope that people understand how to run their toons. If they've been overly pwrlvl'd and still don't understand; fine let them get to 50th and go RvR and get pwr-owned by those that took the time to learn. <br>

<br>
  Make the differences cosmetic and personal taste rather than trying to follow some percieved (sp?) power curve of whos best assassin.<br>
<br>
  I realize this is over simplified but you get the idea, make it so the skill of the player determines outcome and not the fact one had more or less points.<br>
<br>
  This way all assassins are in it together and if one gets nerf'ed we all do, this i think would make us more of a rogue community.<br>
<br>
  Well right or wrong its my opinion and i welcome yours.<br>

It did slow down their ability to chase me. It did NOT snare them to stay in the spot where i hit them with the poison. They would chase me but at about 1/2 my run speed. So yes it slows down their movement. No it does not root them. As far as their attack speed??? I will do a few more test with a chat log to find out the time differences of their attacks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ubalorgafdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balor Gafdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 1:48:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3630.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theblackwatch.biz/Balor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some ideas for debate</span><hr size=1> Use a higher snare, I use the level 43 envenom snare. <p><p><p style="text-align: left; font-size: 80%; font-family: Verdana">Balor Gafdan Nightshade of Guinivere<br><i>What life brings, is it ours to take?.<br>Your pain feeds my soul, feeds my hunger<br>Shadows dance about my tortured being.
