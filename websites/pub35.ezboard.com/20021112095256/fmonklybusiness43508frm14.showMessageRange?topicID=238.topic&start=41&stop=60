I prefer computers, and I'm wrong because of it.  Get a life, you damned troll.  Just because you like it, doesn't mean everyone else does.  Catch a damn clue, you fucking troll.<br>
<br>
Do you realize that most FPS games can use over 10 keys?  Depending on how you wish to play.<br>
<br>
<br>
Buttons to change weapons quickly (0 - 9), buttons to move, buttons to 'use' objects.  <br>
<br>
I prefer that.  You don't?  So be it.  That <font size="+2">D OES NOT MEAN I, NOR ANYONE ELSE IS WRONG FOR LIKING IT YOU GOD DAMNED TROLL</font><br>

Catch a fucking clue.  Even if you're trolling, catch a clue.  A mod of a <b>very</b>  popular board is a fucking joke.<br>
<br>
You used to be one of my more favorite posters around this board, but jesus christ, can ANYONE have an opinion on this board without you telling them how wrong they are, and even in some cases calling names?<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with you or anyone else stating opinions, but you don't have to fucking tell everyone how wrong they are every time they post something you disagree with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just learn to understand that everyone has seperate opinions from yours and they aren't wrong in liking pong, half-life, Halo, GTA, BG, Fallout, or random porno games. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/uvalaelvalacirca.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valael Valacirca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ks.gamerzparadize.com/smileys/gunless%20violence/312.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/4/02 12:46:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utheyanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Yanger </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www1.iswest.com/theyanger/y.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1792<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/4/02 3:14:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grand Theft Auto III</span><hr size=1> Actually valael, if you've played recent console FPS games you realize just how intuitive dual analogs can be. the strafe/move analog stick already kills the need for 4 buttons in itself. Depending on how many weapons are available that can be the only 'problem' area with a gamepad, but it also depends on the other functions of buttons. Modern controllers have enough buttons to easily allow access to 4 or 5 weapon 'switch' buttons without even using combinations of keys (which is FAR more effective on consoles than on a computer. It's not very hard to use your thumb to hit two buttons at once, or one of the triggers and the face buttons to enable more combinations, ETC).<br>
Hell, Halo has easily at your fingertips: Move, Look (sticks), Fire (R) Throw Grenade (L) Flashlight (White) Change Grenade (Black) Switch Weapon (Y. only 2 weapons at once in Halo though, design decision, so I agree it's less useful in other games to have this EXACT setup), Reload (X), Jump (A) Melee Attack (B, I prefer to change this as I use melee attack alot), Crouch (left stick) and Zoom (right stick).<br>
That's more than enough buttons for any FPS.<br>
Lets convert it to quake. In quake you only need Jump, Crouch, and Shoot, the rest of those commands I listed can all change weapons if you wish to have the same level of control as the PC version. Now my intuitive setup would have jump and crouch on the sticks, because you always want them at your fingertips in a fast paced FPS like quake. That leaves EVERY face button, and one of the triggers for weapon selection.<br>
How many weapons are in quake 3? 9? maybe 10? I'd set up a button for each weapon, and L+button for the ones that wont fit. Another idea is if the game as weapon 'categories' like Quake 1 or Counterstrike, that you could have a button for each category, and allow cycling of weapons through sequential presses of the button (like you need to generally).<br>
Heck, Counterstrike could use damn near the exact same setup as Halo, with a couple buttons switched for weapon selection (lets face it, there's not alot of weapon variety in CS, you don't need but a couple buttons for it). I mean, you don't even use grenades and guns at the same time like in Halo, anytime you don't need 2 attacks at your disposal the triggers are like having access to a whole nother set of face buttons.<br>
These all work for a PS2 controller as well btw, gamecube...well what can I say? nintendo is pretty egocentric when they design their controllers.<br>

First answer: There are NO PC gamepads on the calibur of the xbox or PS2 pads, so no I do not. Second answer: I said the mouse and keyboard is preferable because of it being ingrained in there from years of playing. I've played Halo deathmatches online, and the better players are just as skilled as the best computer FPS players I've seen. I actually am able to transfer my skills over nicely, because you'll find most of the skill you accrue from playing FPS's has little to do with the control layout.<br>

<br>
As I've stated more times than I can count already:  Just because you like it, doesn't mean everyone else does.<br>
<br>
Not everyone likes FPS games, and if they do, doesn't mean they'll like Halo.<br>
<br>
If you like it, that means nothing.  It might be a great game and all, but so are other games out there, and some people prefer the other games.<br>
<br>
I, personally, would take RtCW or Ghost Recon over Halo any day.  Maybe after it comes out on computer, that'll change.  That's my opinion, and just because you disagree with it, doesn't make it wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for controlers, do you realize that there ARE adapters that make it so you can use your console controlers on your computer?  I just don't use them because I'm not a gamepad fan for anything other than sports games (Well, some anyways:  NHL games and Soccer games) but I rarely play those, so I guess it doesn't really matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/ufyrrwin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fyrrwin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master</span><br>  Posts: 868<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/6/02 10:24:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grand Theft Auto III</span><hr size=1> /agree  <p><p align="center"><img src="http://izlude.2y.net/drakfyre/sig2.jpg"></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utheyanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Yanger </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www1.iswest.com/theyanger/y.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1799<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/7/02 5:38:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grand Theft Auto III</span><hr size=1> Valael, I frankly don't think you've ever played Halo, and I think fyrrwin is just pissed that he doesn't have an Xbox to play it on.<br>

Sure, I oppose your right to say it isn't, but UNLIKE you (hint valael read this part), I actually think I am right.<br>
One doesn't win a contest by thinking other people might win or are entitled to win. I see things only my way, and other ways are wrong. <p><a href="mailto:yang@monkly-business.com">

What exactly are you right about? Maybe I am missing something...you have every right to say that you think Halo is the best game (or whatever), but its not cool trying to tell other people they are wrong because they don't have the same taste in games. You can say whatever you want about Halo, and other people should feel free to say what they want about it and/or other games without you telling them they are stupid/whatever for their opinions. <p><p align="center"><img src="http://izlude.2y.net/drakfyre/sig2.jpg"></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccccc><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub38.ezboard.com/utheyanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Yanger </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www1.iswest.com/theyanger/y.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1806<br> <font color=#8b1a1a>(3/8/02 2:57:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grand Theft Auto III</span><hr size=1> In a perfect world, maybe.
