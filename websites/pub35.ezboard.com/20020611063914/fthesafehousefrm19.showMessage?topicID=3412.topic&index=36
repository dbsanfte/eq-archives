You're going to keep going around in circles with this argument (of semantics, mostly) if you fail to recognize you cannot merely negate the effect of styles and poison.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You bring up how your attack always has the chance to be blocked, parried, missed, or evaded, thus making the effect of the offhand percentage smaller. What you failed to take into consideration that the exact same is true of the primary handed weapon.<br>
For example, suppose you encounter an opponent where you can only penetrate his defenses 60% of the attacks. Someone that uses a single weapon would have:<br>
(1.00 weapon damage rate * 60%) = 0.60 weapon damage rate<br>
Someone using dual wield at base specialization will still penetrate only 60% of all swings.<br>
(1.00 weapon damage rate * 60%) +<br>
(0.375 weapon damage rate * 60%) = .825 weapon damage rate<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is extremely shoddy usage of math.<br>
<br>
Correct forumale would be:<br>
Primary_hand_damage = average_hit_primary * chance_to_hit_primary * chance_to_swing_primary<br>
<br>
Offhand_hand_damage = average_hit_offhand * chance_to_hit_offhand * chance_to_swing_offhand<br>
<br>
If average_hit_primary and average_hit_offhand were equivalent, and chance_to_hit_primary and chance_to_hit_offhand were equivalent, you could collapse the formulae as you have done, and make a linear extrapolation, but they are not.  Not only is average_hit_primary != average_hit_offhand due to styles increasing the damage output of the primary hand, but from my understanding chance_to_hit_primary is improved by many of the styles as well.<br>
<br>
What you have is a resultant formula:<br>
Overall_damage_output = average_hit_primary * chance_to_hit_primary * chance_to_swing_primary + average_hit_offhand * chance_to_hit_offhand * chance_to_swing_offhand + poison<br>
<br>
I've effectively &quot;hidden&quot; the effect of styles (and armor_type_damage_bonus) by incorporating them in the average_hit_primary and chance_to_hit_primary variables, but they're still there, and they're important coefficents.<br>
<br>
It should be completely obvious from the above that increasing the chance_to_swing_offhand variable from 0% to 37.5% does not directly correlate to a 37.5% boost in Overall_damage_output.<br>
<br>
I'll end with an admittedly silly example to drive the point home: If I swing my primary weapon 100% of the time hitting every swing for 100 damage each, and my offhand weapon 37.5% of the time hitting every swing for 1 damage each, is my offhand weapon contributing 37.5% of my overall damage output?<br>

<br>
   As the others have said before me, the damage caused<br>
by the offhand is not going to equal the damage caused the<br>
main hand in almost all cases.  The one and only time is when<br>
identical weapons are being wielded and styles are not being<br>
used.  All of your DW/CD math is based off of this flawed assumption and shows nothing.<br>
<br>
   One quick question about Left Axe here.  I don't see it in Elaa's breakdown, but is it not true that the weapons are swung at the average delay between the 2?  So if a 4.0 delay weapon in the mainhand and a 3.0 delay in the offhand both would be swung at 3.5 delay?  If so, that's an important fact to note that a weapon whose base damage is calculated from it being a 4.0 delay * x dps but is being swung at 3.5.  I know the offhand damage is reduced to accomplish this, but if styles are being used how big a fraction of the total damage is the offhand really? <p>Jenner 'The Bruce'<BR>

The amount of SB's one shotting 50 assassins of equal level would be totally absurd due to the 2h perf.  Not to mention a 2h critical garrot would be able to hit for a good 700 too.  Toss in MoP 5  and figure out the rest...<br>
<br>
The ONLY way I would be able to see that as remotely acceptable is if they removed critical strike styles functioning with 2 handed weapons.<br>
<br>
Dual wield is just wonderful!  I love swing my crappy offhand 4 times in a row when out of endurance, instead of my 98% qual 35% bon mainhand.  I still dont see how people can honestly consider it fair how a 50 blademaster hits you for 300ish tops mainhand (doenst always offhand though they usually), and a Zerker hits you for 500 mainhand (not in vendo form either - offhand always swings too) - which was what it was like pre DF nerf.  IMO they should revert Left axe, and bump dual / CD styles of similar level cause a lot of infils dont spec to 34ish base dual anyway - no reason to.<br>

You're going to keep going around in circles with this argument (of semantics, mostly) if you fail to recognize you cannot merely negate the effect of styles and poison.</i><br>
<br>
This is exactly the kind of response that I was talking about that shows up in a constructive post meant to talk about Left Axe and Shadowblades, and someone gets starts posting stuff that strays from the main topic.<br>
<br>
ddubois, I will say this again, a 37.5% chance to swing with offhand will increase overall melee damage by that amount. Styles and poisons are extra, they have to be worked out after the baselines of both types of offhand specializations are normalized. Otherwise, you are trying to balance Style damage to the base damage of a different kind of offhand weapon equation, and is much more difficult to quantify.<br>
<br>
There is a very good reason why I leave out style damage from the overall damage output. It is because it is something that equally affects both DW/CD and LA users. Once base damage is normalized first, THEN you can move on and compare styles and equal those. If you do the reverse and compare styles first, THEN it may result in a situation where a single style becomes the equilizer for the entire specialization (ie Doubleforst again).<br>
<br>
You can argue all you want that +75 weapon damage due to a style to the primary in either DW/CD or LA is going to result in a shift in the damage increase from using one weapon. That will definately happen. However, if you check the baselines and match them, and then +75 weapon damage is added from a style, then you've reached something rather balancing.<br>
<br>
Also, the chance to hit with the primary weapon in RvR with +hit styles is exaggerated. This is because of the order of the checks that go into place. For example, a +hit bonus has no effect against an enemy's chance to parry/block/evade/bubble. The +hit affects your first hit that checks to see if miss the enemy or not. This is a great factor in that I cannot pull off my 4-chain Evade combo in RvR, despite that it has large +hit bonuses. I can get past the miss check, but it always gets parried/blocked/evaded by the 2-3 attack and ending the chain. Unless I am a 50 Thrust Infiltrator that used Dragonfang to open the combo, there's no way I can pull it off.<br>
<br>
<i>I'll end with an admittedly silly example to drive the point home: If I swing my primary weapon 100% of the time hitting every swing for 100 damage each, and my offhand weapon 37.5% of the time hitting every swing for 1 damage each, is my offhand weapon contributing 37.5% of my overall damage output?</i><br>
<br>
And what if you chose a superior weapon in your offhand, and a lesser weapon in your primary (which is more true for DW/CD users that have to keep switching primaries). I take the averages, and not special cases.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm done talking about theory and what if's, I take the laws of averages and use them in my calculations. A level 50 Shadowblade failed on the perf today and hit me for 29 and 40 damage. Granted I have 26% slash resist (only 11% after leather penalty). I ran only because I was scouting a keep that he was defending. I take things from math, statistics, and experience.<br>
<br>
I'm done respondig to posts like this, it wastes too much of my time. They stray from the point and are even wrong on the points they are trying to argue.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 6/1/02 2:46:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uddubois.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ddubois</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 3:24:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=40>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I'm done respondig to posts like this, it wastes too much of my time</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Do you not ignore the logic I present?<br>
<br>
Say for example if you have an Infiltrator that deals 25% more overall melee damage than a Shadowblade. Through the Left Axe improved Scaling, it now scales appropriately like that of an Infiltrator using a slash style.<br>
<br>
In this snapshot of combat without styles:<br>
<br>
Infiltrator deals 125 damage<br>
Shadowblade deals 100 damage<br>
<br>
<b>In this example, Infiltrators are 25% more damaging.</b><br>
<br>
In this snapshot of combat with styles:<br>
<br>
Infiltrator deals 125 + 75 damage (1 weapon's slash style)<br>
Shadowblade deals 100 + 75 damage (1 weapon's LA style)<br>
<br>
<b>In this example, Infiltrators are 14.3% more damaging.</b><br>
<br>
When it comes time for game balance, it is INCORRECT to correct the Shadowblade Left Axe deficiency in terms of what is calculated after styles are accounted for. If that were the case, then 14.3% would be added to the Shadowblade base damage, and in the patched scenario, Infiltrators will still deal 125 base damage, with Shadowblades 114.3 damage.<br>
<br>
It IS correct to analyze the base damage BEFORE styles are applied. The same holds true for Poisons. If you add another +80 damage to both scenarios:<br>
<br>
Infiltrator: 125 base + 75 style + 80 poison = 280<br>
Shadowblade: 100 base + 75 style + 80 poison = 255<br>
<br>
That would mean Infiltrators are only 10% more damaging. If that 10% were added to the base damage of the Shadowblade, it would only yield a 110 damage for the base.<br>
<br>
This is the entire point of keeping styles and poison damage away from balancing the base damage. If you don't break combat down to it's component parts, you are going to get a lot of incorrect numbers that will not balance things out for the better of Shadowblades. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 6/1/02 4:08:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uaiden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 5:01:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3412.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> woot,never thought id see elaa arguing for shadowblades. but in all reality its pointless,appreciate it though.<br>

<br>
On average most 50 infiltrators have between +20-30 from items. While SBs have between +35-45.<br>
<br>
Just doing some rough estimation, SBs have more spec points with items that infiltrators get. I came up with around 2.8X for SBs vs 2.675 for infs.<br>
<br>
At 50 we have a total of 1 +CS item and that is +3. <br>
<br>
For envenom we have only 2 items up to 50 that is +envenom and both overlap each other considering the fact they both fit in the jewel slot.<br>
<br>
For stealth at 50, if we wear our epic armor we take a substantial hit in the +stealth items as none of our armor has +stealth to it. <br>
<br>
So what does this mean about 2.5X spec points we may get the higher styles in melee skills, but they are all horrible in pulling off (with the exception of dragonfang). <br>
<br>
We can spec higher in stealth, but there is no point because when it comes to math and Mythic 36=50.<br>

We'll just have to disagree.  I feel it would be incorrect to attempt to &quot;balance&quot; small facets of individual game mechanics, and not focus on the overall picture.  When you claim that one class does X% more damage, but you are only referring to a small subset of the sources of damage, you are doing a disservice to the players, the developers, and to mathmeticians everwhere.  You are effectively manipulating statistics in order to overstate your case.  And the folks who aren't aware of the subtlety will end up coming away from ther thread thinking &quot;Ella said Infiltrators do 15% more damage than SBs&quot; when you are really talking about what is, for all intents and puposes, a meaningless stastic: &quot;base damage&quot;.<br>

IF you do that, you get the results that I responded with earlier, scroll up (I'm getting tired of explaining things again). Take a look at the combat snapshots above. You can't change base damage based on the overall, because base damage only accounts for a certain percentage of combat. Thus when you compare how much it actually needs to increase with respect to itself, it is greater than the after style comparisonl.<br>

Base damage is hardly meaning less, it is the point where you should begin to try to asses the differnces in the workings of LA &amp; CD/CW. Base damage is at the core of differences between the these two spec lines, not envenom, nor style damage. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Shadowblade deals 100 + 75 damage (1 weapon's LA style)<br>

<br>
Infiltrator: 125 base + 75 style + 80 poison = 280<br>

That would mean Infiltrators are only 10% more damaging. <br>
&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
This is a good example of why you want to use base damage. As you include varibles that in the equation that are independent of base damage, your end result is a trend that begins to narrow the differnece between the two values. So if we look at the end result with base+style+poison we end up with a value that does not correctly demonstrate the mathmatical difference between the two spec lines. If we would present this we would think the delta between the two styles is 10% which be a gross error from the actual difference.<br>
<br>
I say again style damage, and poison damage are completely independent of fundamental differences of LA &amp; CD/DW, therefore you must address style and poison damage seperately.<br>

SB base damage 100<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
Implies that you seem to think that enhancing base damage by the percentage found AFTER style damage is included in the percent difference would fix the disparity.<br>

These little &quot;i know better then you&quot; cryptic blurbs aren't helping anyone.<br>

For arguments sake, we'll say +100.<br>
Inf damage 215<br>
SB damage 200<br>
<br>
This is now a 7.5% damage reduction.<br>
<br>
Now.  Fix it to make it even!<br>
<br>
Do you<br>
a) increase sb style damage by 7.5%?<br>
or <br>
b) increase sb base damage by 15%?<br>
<br>
If you increase style damage by 7.5%, you are not really fixing the problem.  Toe to toe.  No styles.  Fighting each other, an infiltrator and a shadowblade should be about even.  Then, when you add style damage, which is (again, according to mythic) a broad-over-all-realms adjustment based on...<br>
<br>
a) if the style is reactionary or not<br>
b) the level of the style<br>
c) the level of the player using the style<br>
d) whether it is at the end of a chain or not<br>
<br>
The damage will then be equal, both in BASE AND STYLE damage.<br>

<br>
The answer to both would be &quot;YES&quot; because the to two classes are near identical. We can reach that conclusion by way of reduction.<br>
<br>
If we run down the list of things that compose the differences between the two classes we see that they can be identical in terms of starting stats, race, slashing damage, armor type, &amp; critical strike line.<br>
<br>
Therefore the differences is in following<br>
1) Thrust/Slash damage vs Slash/Slash damage<br>
2) 2.2 spec points vs 2.5 spec points<br>
3) The mechanics of LA vs CD/DW<br>
4) The use of 2handed weapons <br>
5) 5% increase in hitpoints<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> So if you want to balance the two classes obviously you have to balance #3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Now to take a tangent here we still have 4 other items to address if we want to &quot;fully balance&quot;. Starting with the bottom.<br>
5) The 5% increase in hitpoints really serves no purpose. Melee combat is dealth out in the hundreds of points of damage over a 10 to 20 second period of time. 50 hitpoints is therefore a negligble factor of the class. It is also an area that cannot really be increased without upsetting other classes.<br>
4) 2hand weapons is a realm specific trait, but their use is more of a liablity with the exeption of a few situations due to high delay (and also count the loss one-shotting these weapons factor in even less)<br>
2) 2.2 spec vs 2.5 or the lack of 453 extra spec points to help round out your character. <br>
1) The choice between slash and thrust damage vs the slash only damage the is forced upon midgard<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> My suggestion based on all the above would be to<br>
1a) Add the hammer spec line to shadowblades<br>
1b) Add an additional respec line to accomidate the hammer spec<br>
2) Bring Left Axe on par in terms of damage with CD/DW<br>

<br>
I don't think I implied that at all.  What I am saying, and have said, that comparing some small facet of the classes is less worthwhile than comparing their overall damage output, and the other factors of the class.  I also feel pretty strongly people shouldn't refer to base damage as &quot;Overall damage output&quot;, because that's just flat-out misleading.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  So if you want to balance the two classes obviously you have to balance #3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That's not obvious to me.  You could easily balance the classes by adding some other difference #6, or improving the margin of favor for SBs in 1, 2, 4 or 5.  Which you amusingly continue on to suggest later in your post.<br>
<br>
I don't want to get dragged in over my head.  To be honest, I haven't the slightest idea how balanced infiltrators are versus SBs or NSs.  The reason I jumped into this thread was the references to increases in offhand swings have a linear correlation to &quot;Overall damage output&quot;, and the anal-retentive side of me couldn't let it slide.  Sorry to have stirred up such a frenzy on this issue, it's really not worth it.<br>
