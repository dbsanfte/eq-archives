(still wishing to use a 2hthruster). The main reason that is stated they wont use a 2hs now is due to the 15 seconds they spend performing pa cd and another style befor they can change weapons, and if they miss one of those styles they are screwed, due to the long delay of the weapon. Live by the damage output die by the damage output!! or you can do what every infil does to max his sad ass damage from pa does. set up a quick bar with 3 weapons 2hs and ur 2 axes( or what ever) pa,weapon cahnge icons, cd 2hs icon, ya hit the 2hs incon for ur pa then switch weapons in that 5 second wait as u hit cd, now ur wait for a miss is negzated some what and you get a style off a lot faster after the cd. this is done all the time by us 3.7 gladius wielding infils and it works fine, yes it takes some work to get down but easy enough.<br><br> Just seems that alot of sb`s are yelling that their damage output is way nerfed, ok , or they can do mad damage but the weapon spd is too slow ok, seems to be choices you make for your char, either max dam or spd it up, or try a bit of both.<br>yea U got nerfed, no i DON`T AGREE WITH IT CAUSE WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND, is your class dead cause of it nope, not even close<br><br><br>Mithar<br>lvl 42 igrain <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uditherdaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dither DAoC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 11:02:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3434.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/dither/smiley2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 hand weapons and SB`s</span><hr size=1> hello mr 42.  have you ever tried landing a cd with a 2 handed weapon?

That is no longer an option. Trying to take out a target with a 2-hander, in typical situations is risky and most likely will get you killed on a regular basis due to delay.<br><br>So if we try to go the other route which is left axe we are at a loss because base damage is much lower and the one saving grace of LA, which was Doublefrost is reduced to 30% to 50% of its original value.<br><br>So the problem is it leaves shadowblades very weak if they biased their spec to the Critblade or Shadowzerker routes, and this goes double for Soulblades. The one spec left that does not get a major hit in effectiveness is the 5spec.This is the domain of the inflitrator which has the proper tools available to them to make it work, with choice in Thrust or slash, and 0.3 points to raise specs.<br><br><br>One last thing try to be more congenial in your posts, because this kind of tone is not helpful in solving problems and will create a lot of anger directed at you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 11:23:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3434.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 hand weapons and SB`s</span><hr size=1>  no i`m not dumb enought to bother trying to land a cd or react style with a 2h dither, hello u are missing the point! you can drop that 11 seconds to 5 if you wanted to you just would get the 2hs damage off the cd. and yes i do play a sb, i wanted to see how good/bad they are since patch may only be lvl 30 but at least I frigging go out and try to find out for myself!<br>{hello mr lvl 42} come on out and play, this lvl 42 will kick ur teeth in , don`t think just cause i`m lvl 42 doesn`t mean my lil ass hasn`t been around, <br> plz excuse me for having a job a wife xct and don`t sit around and play 100+ hr`s. lmao if your so uber cause ur over 42 then you must just know it all bud/rant off<br> cuse me for throwing up an idea to roll down ur wait time on hits, yes it works and works well, yea u have to be on the ball and have a brain(ops there i go again), oh well fugg it, go suck all ya want <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A> at: 6/1/02 11:54:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umithar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 11:33:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3434.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 hand weapons and SB`s</span><hr size=1> Brendel, I`m not missing the point think you are bud. yes I know what 2hs was for this is a possible replacement for those who chose to go that way. yea I agree it sucks it happen.

I PA with 2h(snare poison). Run through them, changing to 1h(disease or weakening poison)/shield since my L-A isn't yet high enough to rely on. Re-stick. Rely on G/AH and Ham to get me through the fight. But, my sb is only 28th. You said yours was 30, I think.<br>    I am good at using the tactic you are talking about. I use this tactic because my sb isn't high enough lvl to worry about landing CD after PA.  I dont' think what I do will work at higher levels, however. And, I'm almost sure that I may have to think of something else when I get there. The delay is pretty much the same when I switch weapons as it is if I'd stood there waiting on the 2h to hit again. I only run through them to get seperation while I wait. <br>    It also works the same if I keep the 2h. But, if I miss for some reason with the garrotte, I'm screwed because of the slow speed of the 2h. The G/AH combo is now screwed, and I have to start from the beginning. Meanwhile, other assassin is whacking away on me. <br>   I won't tell any lies saying I've met many an assassin in straight-up combat with no interference from either's realm-mates. Obviously, at 28th, I haven't. And, everyone knows how empty the middle BG is nowadays.
