But the game was broken and it was broken in several ways.<br>
<br>
The Vision (tm) describes a monk like this<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping their bodies into pure weapons. Because of this, they shun nearly all weapons and most forms of armor. They can be very religious and the gods are known to bless them, not with spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks. Only two races produce monks - humans and the lizardmen known as the Iksar. Strangely, though Iksar monks invariably worship Cazic-Thule and most human monks follow Quellious the Tranquil, there are some human monks who are actually agnostic!<br>

To me, that reads that a monk is a class purely focused on offensive - I've tried reading this in the broadest possible way, nowhere does it even imply that monks should tank half as well as warriors (used for reference). I know you have been used to tanking as well as warriors wrt mitigation and tanking superior to warriors wrt avoidance. I'll buy the avoidance argument that pajamas are easier to avoid blows in, but I won't buy the argument that pajamas reflect blows as well as full plate. Now, I know you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> used</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be able to tank as well as plate classes, but frankly did you ever consider this truly balanced and intended? I know that if I used to do 90 in a 70 zone and didn't get caught doing this for years, would I be exempt from paying a fine when one day I was caught?<br>
<br>
Warriors felt encrouched in their prime roles as being able to take punishment the best, bar none: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Warriors are the masters of armed combat in all its many forms. They are right at home on the battlefield and are trained to take as much punishment as they dole out, because of their innately strong constitutions. &quot;A warrior is not made,&quot; they say, &quot;a warrior is born,&quot; and so it is. Those who prove themselves to be hardier than others are perfectly suited for the rigors of this class. Though slow to regain their considerable health when injured, warriors are excellent companions for healer types. Only the Erudite and high elf races do not produce warriors.<br>
source: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp">eqlive.station.sony.com/l...lasses.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
We felt that we were being marginalized by two issues,<br>
<br>
1. Monks (and knights but that's another discussion completely) were mitigating as well as warriors, my argument from above stands that pajamas should mitigate much worse than plate, but avoid better - making for perhaps only a marginal difference in total damage taken over time, but due to the spikey nature that monk avoidance should be less predictable pattern of damage, hence requiring unproportionally more mana to heal.<br>
<br>
2. Hitpoints, an area where warriors traditionally were the absolute best and had a huge gap down to SHD/PAL, and further to RNG/ROG/MNK has been closing - not in absolute numbers but in relative figures and the law of diminishing returns pplies here, in short which 100hps yield the most utility? The 100 from 2200-&gt;2300 or the 100 from 7200-&gt;7300? The best solution to this one would be to modify the &quot;actual&quot; hps from items and buffs to the same rates that classes gain hitpoints from stamina, keeping the relative difference more constant (can't be 100% constant due to the base HPs not gained from sta).<br>
<br>
Fixing 1) above can only be done in one of two ways. Either they boost warrior mitigation and retune all content from Nagafen through Kunark, Velious and SoL - or they nerf monks, either way it's a nerf of monks (retune would indirectly nerf you guys, as has been happening to warriors as the HP advantage slowly eroded).<br>
<br>
Number 2 above is still not fixed, how they are going to do that is anybody's guess, though it looks like only plate melee will gain planar durability in PoP - a compromise that won't directly nerf anyone, but we will see the HP gap widen relatively between plate classes and everybody else, just as we have seen it contract over the course of the latest two expansions. It's not the best solution, but it's probably one that will VI get away with least work and public trouble.<br>
<br>
I'm not laughing, and I hope warriors as a group aren't laughing because a nerf to any class is a nerf to all of us, at least the ones that are in close knit guilds that depend on each other to get the job done and the raid succesfully concluded. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>

I wish there were more like you, not just warriors but all classes.

<br>
a) As far as I know, apart from rampage roles, there isn't a single case where monks are used over warriors for regular tankage.<br>
b) There isn't a single piece of hard data, not the biased skewed non-sense from Furor and the likes, which means squat.<br>
<br>
From a period totally warrior centric with up to 10 warriors in a tier 1 guilds, there seem to be some infringement on their turf on the rampage role for monks and aggro role by SKs or Pals.<br>
This could only be the case when those classes are decked with very good gear, mind you.<br>

End result: SKs got nerfed, monks will get nerfed.<br>

I don't play one. I play an SK. What I will do though is show you guys that it's not nearly as bad as you think it is.<br>
<br>
SKs got an agro shaft a few months back. Starting with disease cloud, then they worked down the line through shadow vortex and shroud of pain. This right here nearly crippled our taunting abilities. Only the darkness line (Which is resisted 50% of the time in raid situations anyways) and Heart Flutter/Asytole are useful as taunt spells.<br>
<br>
"But SKs got new taunt spells, they give you great agro abilities stop whining!!"....Eh no. The terror line is completly useless. It has to be cast within melee range, can't be used very well to peel anything more then melee range off of casters and the agro it gives isin't even all that high. They also created multiple versions of this for a reason, because even terror of death which you have to use from 53-59 is useless on anything over level 54 or so.<br>
<br>
The voice line is moderatly useful, adding 6%-10% hate per hit or cast in 50-60 raid situations. This helps us maintain agro better, but still does nothing for our peeling abilties.<br>
<br>
SK's tanking roles are similar to a warrior, they have screamed, bitched, whined, moaned, and complained that we can tank just as good or better as they can. Hell me personally I'll take a 250 skill in 1hs and 2hs, lower my defense back to 230, take my pet away and give me dual wield. But wait, were defensive tanks without any sort of defensive discipline that is useful beyond 15 seconds and even then it takes 72 minutes to use it again. Only after YEARS of arguing with developers and people like Absor did we get Harmshield (18 seconds of invulnerability). <br>
<br>
So sure, we can MA, we can split tank, tank mezz...but without that agro ability we use to have, might as well permenantly assign a Paladin to do the job for us since they can use a level 9 spell to gain massive agro, but we can't.<br>
<br>
I could continue with from here and create a huge amount of broken aspects of the SK class, but that'd take A) To much time B) To much space and C) I'm to lazy to type all that out.<br>
<br>
My point of all this rambling? The hits you guys are taking isint nearly as bad as some classes that have been nearly beaten to death by the nerf zweinhander. <br>
<br>
Personally I agree with what they did, but I also agree they could have made changes to the warrior class instead of doing what they did, giving the monks the tranq staff up the rear. Blame VI for screwing you guys, not the warriors for it. <p><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=372217">Stryph Painscale</a></i><BR> 58th Revenant of Cabilis, Wielder of Greenmist<BR>
