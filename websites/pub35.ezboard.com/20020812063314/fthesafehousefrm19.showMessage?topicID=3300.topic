The intent of the report is to look for ways to bring Nightshade performance in line with the other Assassins, to the point where only assassin-wide issues become a Nightshade’s concern. This report is not to point out what abilities would be “cool” on a future spell list or things we would like to see in the future. It is to address current Nightshade deficits that are causing this lack of performance and find solutions in as a response to those deficits that will balance Nightshades among Assassins in general performance.<br><br>PERCEPTION:<br>NIGHTSHADE OFFENSE:<br>NIGHTSHADE DEFENSE:<br>REALM ABILITIES:<br><br>========================================<br><br>PERCEPTION:<br><br>A poll was recently gathered by _Jagang_ on the VN boards:<br>Albion Rogue Professions said:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=29780933">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=29780933</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Hibernia Stalker Professions said:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=29780999">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=29780999</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Midgard Rogue Professions said:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=29778972">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=29778972</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Of 599 votes:<br>54.0% polled think Infiltrators are the best Assassin<br>39.7% polled think Shadowblades are the best Assassin<br>6.3% polled think Nightshades are the best Assassin<br><br>There’s nothing scientific about the poll, that kind of precision isn’t necessary. These opinions though could very well reflect that there are actual deficits with the Nightshade class that cause this “perception” that Nightshades are weaker.<br><br>It is also important to make the distinction that Nightshades are a unique class (and not a red-headed step child that keeps getting overlooked in each Assassin aspect). Assassins perform well in general, but when you break it down, the generality is weighted towards the perception of the other 2 Assassin classes. It’s not to say Nightshades are a bad class at all, but they get unfairly clustered with Assassin success that it is easy to look at their independent issues that still need to be addressed and think that all Assassins must be complete.<br> <br>========================================<br><br>NIGHTSHADE OFFENSE:<br><br>Aside from not being the best slash based Assassin or having the hardest critical attack of the Assassins, the deficit that is most striking and can be measured is the Nightshades shout versus the +453 bonus points that an Infiltrator can use to boost their damage output.<br><br>1) For example, the same template where a Nightshade has 40 weaponskill at level 50, can allow an Infiltrator to have 50 weaponskill at level 50. That adds 2 styles of utility and a 15% boost to casual melee damage. The utility of the shout is unmatched to that of a 9-second stun based off evade, and the damage output of the shout is embarrassing.<br><br>2) A template where a Nightshade that neglected dual wield for to focus on other skills, an Infiltrator can boost dual wield from level 1 to 30 with those bonus points. That is a 14.5% boost to casual melee damage (offhand swing percentage), and adds a plethora of styles for utility (despite that dual wield styles are generally useless, but that is a separate issue).<br><br>3) A template where a Nightshade has 20 Envenom can allow a similarly speced Infiltrator to have 35 Envenom. Those bonus points can increase poison tick damage by 35 points every 5 seconds, along with stronger debuff and snare utilities, or an additional +7 damage per second (+7dps).<br><br><br>The 15% average damage boost that the Infiltrator has in relation to the Nightshade’s melee damage is more difficult to calculate as a whole number than the bonus granted by Envenom where a definite dps number is obtained. The Envenom example actually obtains a whole number, such that a level 50 Infiltrator dishes out +7 more damage per second than a Nightshade. Over the course of 20 seconds, an Infiltrator dishes out +140 more points of damage than a Nightshade.<br><br>Some suggest that Nightshade melee damage get boosted through self buffs to match that of other Assassins. That really defeats the uniqueness of the Nightshade, and is a nuisance to have to constantly self buff just to keep up in terms of missing melee damage, there is a more appropriate Hibernian solution to the problem.<br><br>Nightshades can be said to have an offensive deficit of 140 damage every 20 seconds. A level 50 Nightshade shout that reliably deals an average of 140 damage on a 20 second timer could perfectly fill in the offensive deficit.<br><br>========================================<br><br>NIGHTSHADE DEFENSE:<br><br>By level 50, accounting for base stats, class bonuses, and not including any items:<br> <br>Saracens Infiltrators will have +35 hp more than Nightshades<br>British Infiltrators will have +70 hp more than Nightshades<br>Kobold Shadowblades will have +75 hp more than Nightshades<br>Norse Shadowblades will have +145 hp more than Nightshades<br><br>After Epic Armor with base CON:<br><br>Nightshades will have (+16) 56 CON<br>Saracen Infiltrators will have (+32) 82 CON<br>British Infiltrators will have (+32) 92 CON<br>Kobold Shadowblades will have (+42) 92 CON<br>Norse Shadowblades will have (+42) 112 CON (2x NS’s)<br><br>Total Hit Point comparison relative to Nightshades:<br><br>Saracens Infiltrators will have ~ +85 hp more than Nightshades<br>British Infiltrators will have ~ +120 hp more than Nightshades<br>Kobold Shadowblades will have ~ +155 hp more than Nightshades<br>Norse Shadowblades will have ~ +225 hp more than Nightshades<br><br>A recent Friday’s Grab Bag from the week before last revealed that CON has both an effect on Total Hit Points and Damage Reduction in combat. The twofold effect it has on the Nightshade validates the perception that Nightshades cannot withstand as much damage and are more easily damaged than the other Assassins.<br><br>The Epic Armor itself is not a core class issue because it is something that can be changed and is not built in to the class, so I will address that in a separate section. Fact remains aside from the Epic, that Nightshades will have 35-145 less hit points, along with less damage reduction. Elves and Lurikeen theoretically should be able to evade slightly better with a 5-10 stat point advantage in the chance to do so, but overall it doesn’t perform well enough to make up for lost hit points and damage reduction.<br><br>Again, an easy solution is to give the Nightshade a self buff spell to mimic having more hit points and damage absorbence. That wouldn’t make Nightshades any different in their defensive capabilities, but they now meet the minimum requirement of being magically enhanced for being from Hibernia.<br><br>Instead, a better solution might be to augment a different kind of defensive aspect. Allow for a scenario where Nightshades are slightly weaker face to face, but if they spot an enemy at range, they have a superior ranged attack than other Assassins have.<br><br>That can be achieved by upgrading their ranged attack damage near that of a baseline caster. A few major differences is that Casters will deal more damage through both stats, the specialization direct damage spells, criticals, realm abilities, and acuity buff they might have on.<br><br>========================================<br><br>REALM ABILITIES:<br><br>Reports show characters were previously able to train Augmented CON to get Mastery of Pain after the /respec got to keep it that way. In addition, the self heal from Ignore Pain still heals 100% if they didn’t /respec for the new version. I feel a complete realm ability wipe and /respec reset is due soon, and it should allow the chance for some realm abilities to get reanalyzed.<br><br>VIPER:<br><br>When realm abilities first came out and everyone speculated of the potential of each of the Assassin class specific abilities, community members thought:<br><br>1) Each were expensive for the ability they granted<br>2) (Shadow Run) &lt; (Vanish = Viper)<br>3) Shadow Run = Utility, Vanish = Utility / Damage, Viper = Damage<br>4) Shadow Run’s cost (10) relative to Vanish (14) and Viper (14) reflected that it was a weaker ability. (despite that they were all generally expensive)<br><br>After a Pendragon update that went live:<br><br>(10) Shadow Run = Utility<br>(10) Vanish = Utility / Damage<br>(14) Viper = Damage<br><br>It seemed like out of nowhere that Vanish got a reduction in its cost one patch without any explanation, such that it matches Shadow Run’s cost. Were Shadowblades and Nightshades simply forgotten?<br><br>Shadow Run is not an equal skill to Vanish. I personally believe Shadowrun should cost 8 points and last on a 1 minute timer, but that is a Shadowblade specific issue. Infiltrators have a damage/escape utility, depending on the situation, that now costs 10 points which is relatively fair for the ability versus the amount of points needed to purchase it, especially considering the loss of stealthed one-shotting.<br><br>Viper allows an assassin to double their poison damage. Between the level 40-50 range, the damage bonus of this ability is +384-480 damage over time.<br><br>Based on the 30 second timer, Viper can be applied to 2 targets for the full poison duration. However, every time I attempt this in RvR, I die. Nightshades are not meant to stick around long enough to attack a second target, stay long enough to overcome bladeturn and not miss on the target, while not getting instant mez/stunned (Nightshades are the only Assassin that has to face 2 realms that each have 2 classes that have instant forms of CC), and leaving enough endurance to try and make an sprinting escape. When doing so, I die before I can even rack up any points I might have made if the first target died. Trying to apply it to multiple targets is an unfruitful suicide mission.<br><br>Even when using it on an intended target, the ability is almost overkill, such that only 2 ticks go off before the target is dead from melee damage. In that case, it is worth only +128-160 to +384-480 points of bonus damage / 30 minutes for 14 points spent.<br><br>Compare that to the Sorceror ability that is an AE DoT. Level 50 Sorcerors with this ability where consistently hitting me for 109 damage per tick with this ability that stacks with other DoTs. It also costs 14 points and is on a 30 minute timer.<br><br>Nightshade Viper versus Sorceror Corporeal Disintegration<br><br>- Both cost 14 points, on a 30 minute timer<br><br>- Corporeal Disintegration is cast at range. Viper is applied in melee, and a hit must be scored in order to apply it.<br><br>- Corporeal Disintegration is an Area Effect. Viper is single target per melee hit per weapon swap / next successful melee hit.<br><br>- Corporeal Disintegration does a +109 damage tick that stacks with other dots. Viper will add +64-80 damage to a Nightshade’s existing DoT.<br><br>The purpose of this comparison is not to give Nightshade’s Corporeal Disintegration. It’s to compare the relative cost of the ability versus the rewards. Viper is not worth 14 points. It is more appropriately placed at 10 points, alongside the cost of Vanish where it was originally compared to as an equally viable ability if they had the same costs in the first place.<br><br>AUGMENT ACUITY:<br><br>At present, Augment Acuity does not raise any stat for the Nightshade. It is also the least useful of the stat buffs, even if it did buff a stat, because spell damage is almost never a factor in Nightshade encounters. This bug needs to be fixed, as well as some kind of official statement as to what stat affects Nightshade magic (if any).<br><br>Unlike Augment Dexterity, Constitution, and Quickness, Augment Acuity only leads to one other skill, Wild Arcana. Each other augmentation leads to at least 2 other skills to choose from, that stretch out the benefit of being able to spend less points for other abilities by sharing the same prerequisite augmentation.<br><br>It got me thinking about how Rangers face the same dilemma, so I started looking for another ability with Augment Acuity that could be added that would benefit Rangers and Nightshades. There weren’t any perfect fits. After some thinking and being reminded that Hibernia is the magic realm, I thought what if there was a realm ability that increased the chances of procing a magical weapon effect? It would fit perfectly as a second ability that requires Augment Acuity as a prerequisite and would apply to both Rangers and Nightshades. Thus, after meeting the Augment Acuity prerequisite, it now opens up 2 skills instead of one:<br><br>Wild Arcana<br>Passive / Acuity 2 / +5% chance to critical on DOTs per level<br><br>Unleashed Arcana<br>Passive / Acuity 2 / +5% chance to proc weapon per level<br><br>If Unleashed Arcana is not implemented, it is still a good point to address that Augment Acuity still leads to only one other skill. It happens to fit both the role of the stat and the realm very well that it should be given considerable thought.<br><br>========================================<br><br>EPIC ARMOR DEFICIT:<br><br>The Nightshade Epic grants the least amount of hit points of all the Assassin classes, further stretching their gap between them and Infiltrators and Shadowblades. I recommend upping the +CON bonus to +32 instead of +16 so the deficit isn’t so extreme and will give Nightshades around +55 more hit points to work with.<br><br>One of the unknowns is which stat really affects Nightshade magic. IF it is one of the main stats like STR, DEX, or QUI, then Nightshades benefit equally in buffing their ranged attack in the same way Infiltrators and Shadowblades can use those Epic Armor bonuses to increase their ranged attacks.

I've played my NS to lvl 33 now.. and it's his third round of it,  I started WAY back when with him, back when a 30 in RvR was uber.  Slash = Blades.  Luri = NO STR, thereby slash NS would blow goats hardcore.  Uping our dmg on our shout, or at least making it more reliable won't make us the more uber, we would still be weaker thna SB, but we wouldn't be COMPLETE pansies.  <br><br>IE<br>yesterdya, while fighting a ytm mob, I missed my perf, dd shout, hit for 49(not bad!), then again when timer cam up dd shout, hit for 10!!!  39 point difference...

How does this apply in RvR you ask?  <br>BG 30-35 -&gt; Ytm caster, Torac(alb)  He walked away from group, I smiled, fresh bait.  perf, garrote, ddshout(20), he ran off(doh forgot snare poison, chased him, no sure why hee didn't just QC on me... dd shout again, 75!!! dead Torac.  but what is up with that variance???? did he have a buff that dropped I wonder?  so I waited for res sickness to drop, and tried it again.  (heheheh) Perf, garrote, dd shout(10 WTF 10???)  this time snare was on... he went down from poison.  But come on.  The only way for me to stand toe-toe with a SB(I've played a 50 NS) is to run like hell.  No matter what, they win.  No big deal, they ARE the meelee realm.  Mythic decided to add a shout, but they really just didn't finish it off.  2/3 baseline would make it so that if I DO perf a SB, at elast he wouldn't laugh before pummeling me off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukosmaul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kosmaul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/20/02 11:24:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3300.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Elaa’s Unofficial Nightshade Report 5/19/02</span><hr size=1> raise or DD damage which is supposed to be unique to the 256 I regularily get hit for my crossbow weilding Infs<br><br> <p><table width="350" border="0"><tr><td width="144"><div align="center"><img src="http://www.geraldfield.com/nadinesplace/calvinquiz/stupendous.gif" width="142" height="125" align="absmiddle"></div></td><td><div align="center"><b><font size="3">You are Stupendous Man!</font></b><br><font size="2">You are simply amazing, whether you are battling your arch-nemesis Mom Lady, the nefarious Babysitter Girl, or the fiendish Annoying Girl.

I separated the first 3 fixes from the rest because those are class core issues. The rest are appendages to the Nightshade class by means of stats and realm ability adjustments.<br><br>- Spell Variance that of a 2/3 specialized caster<br>- Base Shout of 140 base damage by level 48<br>- Direct Damage spell of 175 base damage by level 50<br><br>- Viper cost of 10 points<br>- Fix Augment Acuity raise a stat<br>- Add Unleashed Arcana as a 2nd ability to choose from Augment Acuity<br>- Change +16 CON to +32 CON bonus from Epic Armor<br>- If INT affects Nightshade magic, appropriately include ~ +50 INT into the armor.<br><br>Here are some responses to some posts made so far. I also ask that everyone making comparisons to read the actual list of fixes, and not to compare only Assassin versus Assassin combat situations when looking at what is addressed and analyzing the proposed fixes:<br><br><br>Conjoy –<br><br>&gt;&gt; “I think that buffs are a much more *Hibernian* way of implementing the fixes. Furthermore if they could be added so as to be friendly castable, and thus improve NS viability in PvE groups this would be good too.”<br><br>One of the downsides to buffs is that they can be overridden. For example, an equally buffed Nightshade that encounters an equally buffed Shadowblade will not stand toe to toe because of the core class differences. Buffs are an artificiality that is added to the class. Compare a Druid buffed Nightshade to a Shaman buffed Shadowblade, or a Cleric buffed Infiltrator, the Nightshade that can self buff is likely to have overridden defensive buffs. A Nightshade that has to use defensive buffs to fight like an Infiltrator or Shadowblade will find themselves at a disadvantage in these situations.<br><br>Another complexity is what happens when the self buff wears off when the Nightshade is stealthing. The Nightshade then has to find a spot to safely unstealth, just to rebuff just so they can stand toe to toe with another Assassin. An Assassin playing cat and mouse against a Nightshade can wait in the area for the Nightshade to have to rebuff, then strike.<br><br>As far as improving Nightshade viability in PvE groups, I see the PvE grouping issue as an Assassin wide issue, and not something specific to Nightshades, that can be addressed in Assassin-wide fixes.<br> <br><br>Woopya –<br><br>&gt;&gt; “However, I would like to see a different approach to solving our defensive woes. Id like to see us either have much higher natural resistance rates compared to sbs and inf, or id like to see us get a self buff to that effect. In particular, i want our reistance to poison much higher than other assassins. If we resist poisons much more often than they do, the fight becomes a little bit more even. Most of the time shades lose pure mellee fights to either SB or INF(equal lvl) as it stands now. But what if that sbs or inf's poison was resisted half of the time?”<br><br>The defensive proposal of self buff to resist poisons you suggest instead of the Nightshade nuke fix only addresses Assassin versus Assassin combat. The hit points that the other Assassins have apply to ALL encounters, not just Assassin vs Assassin combat. Your proposal narrows it to a specific type of encounter, and does not help the Nightshade in encounters against other classes so the defensive deficit still remains.<br><br>It is not a bad idea, but does not completely address that type of deficit that can be used in all encounters. It is something that makes the “cool” list of things to have.<br><br><br>The Stranger –<br><br>&gt;&gt; “I don't see 50th assassins from far away enough to care, and I wouldn't spoil my potential for a critical strike and stun on anyone else in order to shoot at them.”<br><br>Just as I responded to Woopya, a Nightshade’s defensive deficit is not limited to Assassin vs Assassin combat. It is a utility meant for a different kind of encounter, and again is not fair to narrow a Nightshade fix to their defensive deficit solely in terms of performing only against other Assassins.<br><br><br>Old Mill –<br><br>&gt;&gt; “so your solutions are to give nightshades more hps, to get them equal with shadowblades(our whopping realm unique ability)”<br><br>I conveniently listed every single fix, please go through the list and show me where I come up with a solution to give more hit points to Nightshades to equal them with Shadowblades? Nightshades only get a +16 CON bonus through their Epic Armor and Shadowblades get a +42 CON bonus? That has nothing to do with the Shadowblade realm unique ability. After all hit points are tallied as was in the original post:<br><br>Total Hit Point comparison relative to Nightshades with Epic Armor:<br><br>Kobold Shadowblades will have ~ +155 hp more than Nightshades<br>Norse Shadowblades will have ~ +225 hp more than Nightshades<br><br>All that I proposed is a boost to the CON bonus in the Nightshade Epic Armor from +16 to +32 CON, and has nothing to do with bringing Nightshades to have an equal number of hit points as a Shadowblade. Take note this is not a fix to a Nightshade inherent ability, this is a fix to a deficiency in the Nightshade Epic that causes an even steeper divide in hit points and damage absorbance between Nightshades and the other Assassins.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A> at: 5/20/02 2:28:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uwoopya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woopya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/20/02 11:49:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3300.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /reply2</span><hr size=1> I have to disagree(respectfully) with you again on some minor points about your solutions(not the problems.)<br><br>My solution to buff NS resists or give us a self resist buff spell does not just help us vs other assassins.I may not have elaborated enough, I dont just want poison resist upped , i want all resists upped.  Many many classes use magical attacks. If our resistances were substantially stronger it would aid us vs all casters and part casters as well. These classes make up the bulk of the game. It also would be a something unique to our class, rather than just upping our con. Instead of improving the con on our epic armor , maybe we should be asking for significantly better resists on it. Raising con, while addressing the problem, does not fix it in a way that keeps us different. <br><br>In the final conclusion of your defensive section you recommend a better ranged attack. IMHO I do not see how this helps our defense in any way. In fact, it would hurt. No matter what assassin you play your best defense is stealth, and ranged attacks = no stealth. I do think the dd shout is silly at the moment, but fixing this is not gonna make us any better off defensively. My proposal does in fact adress the problem moreso than yours. It is not &quot;something cool&quot; for our class' wishlist. <br><br>I think if you really think about all the applications of magic in this game, you will see that it is a solution to the problem. It isnt the only solution. Upping hp, or making us absorb more dmg via a buff would also work. But they would also make us the same as everyone esle. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ustryhf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stryhf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/21/02 2:42:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3300.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /reply2</span><hr size=1> 2 quick solutions which should've been implemented from the start.<br><br>Making the Nightshade spells be level based and considered 2/3's spec.  The damage variance from these spells make them far too inconsistant to deemed RvR worthy.  Making these into a separate spec path would prove to be far too great a headache, in that you would have to honestly consider making shades x2.5, and further diluting the point distribution.<br><br>Another choice would be to consider their Envenom line to be their magic line, and bundle their spells into that line... but that has other inherent problems since it is a shared line.<br><br>Another issue that arises from shades is their seemingly lack of defense.  This, on paper, should've been solved through a synergy created within our realm.  When you consider on paper we have a greater number of buffers then any other realm, this should solve that problem... on paper.  When you consider of the primary healing classes, 2 are nearly impossible to kill, and only 1 lacks any form of instant other then they heals, the contribution of buffs is only applicable of the conc buffer can stay alive.<br><br>Albion is granted baseline Dam Add, and for Theurgists, base line Haste (which has it's own inherent issues), whereas Hibernia has granted baseline Damage Shield (which does not scale properly for higher levels and was added further later into the scheme of things).<br><br>So basically Nightshades are relegated to grouping with Wardens, and staying in close proximity to their groups.  By doing so, they become anti-stealth protectors, unfortunately as a class they are the least suited to surviving these encounters.  Granted their DD shout will knock out that assassin, but in the process they can very likely die for the effort.... even when close to their own forces.<br><br>The almost seemingly simple answer would be to grant Shades 1 additional level of Evade above that of their other counterparts (at least easy to implement).  Considering our base races have by far the best Dex/Qui in game, would make some sense to cater to this abilty.<br><br>Mythic, by concentrating purely on making the Nightshade the poisoner, this almost seems like backwards logic considering the lack of additional spec points.  Their DW is less therefore reduced chance to inflict all this poison damage.  Left Axe by far is the best DW option for maximum consistancy in poison application.<br><br>Hmm... okay enough mind bleeding, I've rambled enough. <p><IMG SRC="http://baensidhe.com/sig/stryhf.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uelaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/21/02 4:11:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3300.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /reply2</span><hr size=1> What's worse about the Nightshade situation, on the Hibernia Stalker VN boards:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=29927820">vnboards.ign.com/message....c=29927820</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Someone got a response already from Matt Firor regarding Nightshade fixes:<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br>We've read the nightshade team lead report and will take it into accout when <br>we look at that class again.

Funny how you're paying attention to CON while forget to mention other stats. A lurikeen starts out with lower CON, but they have much higher DEX and QUICK to offset it. DEX equates to more damage, while DEX and QUI increase evade chances, and QUI allows you swing faster. <br><br>While Infils get .3 more spec points, I doubt it'll increase thier damage over Nightshades by 15%. A Nightshade can have 50 skill in every spec except Celtic Dual with a little RP. I've read comparisons made by archers comparing between 50 Longbow and 60 Longbow, the results are 5% extra dmg, skill over 50 give very little. Over 50 Cs gives very little. Over 50 Envenom gives nothing. The only place where an Infil have an edge over NS is Dual Wield. Dual Wield is very random, and gets no bonus damage and to-hit. It misses very ofhen. You can't use extra 15% chance to Dual Wield and then say Infils do 15% more damage. The are many more factors. Weapon speed is one of them. To-hit is another issue.<br><br>Epic armor. Once again you're only looking at CON and HPs. NS epic get more + skill than the Infil armor. Not sure about dex and quick, but i think they got more there too.<br><br>Realm skills. 14 points for mad damage sounds reasonable. Damage is always expensive. Just be happy you got something that is actually useful, there are lots of classes that got jack @#%$ for thier realm ability. Viper almost gives you a confirmed kill on a target, which is pretty good. If Viper was lowered to 10 points and every assassin have the access to them, no one will pick Vanish or Shadowrun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=3300.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=3300.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=3300.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3300.topic&index=20><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=3300.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.threadControl?topicID=3300.topic><img src=http://216.40.211.42/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3300.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3300.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub35.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc">News Bulletin<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19>Main Hall</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.guildboss.com"><imgsrc="http://www.thesafehouse.org/admins/gbbanner.gif"alt="Click here for GuildBoss!" border="0" width="468"height="60"></a></center>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
