I'm hoping someone can offer some advice. I last trained at lvl 25 w/17 skill points left over. I just turned 26 lastnight and have not trained yet. Here's my current spec, what I need at lvl 29 for RVR and my long range goal at lvl 50:<br><br>Skill        Current      Lvl29     Lvl50<br>-----------------------------------<br>Stealth     19+4         25         40<br>Thrusting  15            15         44<br>CS           21            21         44<br>Env          17            23         40<br>DW          12            12         12<br>-----------------------------------<br><br>I had my spec path planned to 50 before BG's were implemented and turned lvl 20 the night they were opened. So I did what I thought was best and spent all of my points on getting my Stealth up to par along with CS (PA and Garrote) - between lvl's 20 and 24 of course.<br><br>So now I feel the squeeze once again. From what I've seen and learned in those BG's, I now want high envenom for the next BG. I always want max stealth and even more so now because I can climb at 25. <br><br>So with every last point that I will get between now and lvl 29, I can do the above. With that said, here are some questions:<br><br>1: How effective will the lvl 23'sh poisons be on lvl 29 players in RVR? I really wanted to go with strong envenom this time. Am I screwed and just need to accept it?<br><br>2: At lvl 29 in RVR, do you think my CS and or Thrusting will be gimped at the above spec lvl's?<br><br>3: I know everyone has varying opinions when it comes to stealth lvl, but I tend to think the higher my stealth is, the less people can see me coming and the more confident I am in setting up attacks. Not to mention, I get climb at lvl 25 which I REALLY want to play with. In this situation, what would you do?<br><br>All advice is welcome, thanks!<br><br>*Note: The lvl 50 template is just an estimate. I didn't have my exact numbers handy.*<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 10:20:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cableone.net/truggiero/smxumcard.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I feel trapped w/my spec</span><hr size=1> Im not sure. To be honest, you normally dont find many assassins with a high envenom spec in the BG. <br><br>Could you be effective? Absolutely. I think your best mode of attack will be hit and run. Here is what I would try:<br><br>Use PA and Garrote to get your poisons in... then run for the hills. Now if you can stick 3 poisons in.. I would stick your DOT, Disease, and Imbalance(snare). <br><br>Run off... stealth... but keep an eye on your target. If you didnt kill them off... rest to get some End back... then go back after the target. With the snare the wont run far off.. with the disease odds are they wont be back to full health. The second run will get them. Most people never expect to be attacked twice in a row like that. <br><br>Also with your envenom... you will work VERY well with another Inf, Minstrel, or Scout. <br><br> <p><img src=http://www.cableone.net/truggiero/xummten.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=drolk>Drolk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 10:55:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I feel trapped w/my spec</span><hr size=1> Yeh, most folks who are looking for the long-term payoff keep stealth and poison minimized and keep their weapon stats as high as possible.  With the inception of the BG's more and more are shooting for a mid-low range balance so they aren't quite so &quot;twinkish&quot; in the battlegrounds.<br><br>I agree with Xumten on your tactics.  As your attack style isn't maxed out, you probably don't want to attempt toe-to-toe meleeing for very long or you'll be dead.  Make use of the poisons to hit and run and let them finish your job.<br><br>That will also require you to be a little picky about your targets (not attempting a poison-kill on someone standing next to a healer, say), but you should do great.  I would say you're probably a lot better balanced than those auto-training stealth to 36 and holding off on training poison.<br><br>One other thing you need to know about stealth - whether or not they see you is a level vs. level check.  How *far away* they see you, or you them for other stealthers, is a skill vs. skill check. <p>Drolk - L43 Kobold Shadowblade (Tristan)<BR><i>In the shadow of the valley of death, I walk alone.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublacule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blacule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 11:27:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I feel trapped w/my spec</span><hr size=1> &quot;Im not sure. To be honest, you normally dont find many assassins with a high envenom spec in the BG.&quot;<br><br>On my server in the 20-24 BG's, high env seemed pretty popular amongst most of the mid rogues. Well, honestly I don't remember the exact poison lvl used, I just know some of the DOT's were near killing me by themselves which is why I wanted to go that route. I seen the effectivness first hand.<br><br>So how do poison lvl's versus player lvl's work? I assume a lower lvl poison on a higher lvl player has more of a chance to be resisted, correct? If that is correct, then how effective will a lvl 23'sh poison be on a lvl 29 player? I guess thats my real concern.<br><br>Envenom spec 23 gives me the following when I'm lvl 29:<br>16 - Lesser Infectious Serum - Disease<br>20 - Greater Leathal Poison - DOT<br>22 - Minor Enervating Poison - STR<br>23 - Minor Crippling Poison - Snare<br><br>A lvl 20 DOT on a lvl 29 player (worse case scenerio) just doesn't seem like it would do alot of dmg. Of course, I don't really know which is the reason I am here. =)<br><br>Good advice on the hit and run tactic. I had planned on trying it before (or something similar) but I was so new to BG and so excited I just did a str debuff and snare, PA, Garrote and then either finishing the fight melee or running. Less thinking and more watching the fight and my surroundings. =) <br><br>As for working with the others you had mentioned. Definately. I've had the most fun thus far when working with a pack of infil's or a mix of scouts and minst's.

I didnt think about that. I havent messed with an Inf yet.<br><br> Most of the SBs I'm running around in the 20-24 BG are Critblades. And most dont have much more than 5 in Envenom. <br><br>When I was in the 25-29 BG, there was one Nightshade who was lvl 29 and had 30+ in Env with items. Yep his poisons almost killed his targets, and like you it definately gave me a new respect for Env. But thats the frustrating part... it &quot;almost&quot; killed them. So many times I saw targets getting away with a sliver of health from him. So we started working together. Then they were dropping like flies tho. <br><br>I have every intention on investing into Envenom more at higher levels. <br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A> at: 4/17/02 2:29:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvalarauco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valarauco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 3:02:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~bdemong/valaface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I feel trapped w/my spec</span><hr size=1> Envenom resists are based on your level vs. opponent's level; level of the poison does not matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublacule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blacule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/17/02 4:00:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I feel trapped w/my spec</span><hr size=1> Drolk:&quot;One other thing you need to know about stealth - whether or not they see you is a level vs. level check.

My Shadowblade is a Critblade/Envenom Spec'd SB with LOW stealth. I have found it's been rather fun in the BG playing him, Currently I have 15+2 Sword, 21 + 4 CS, 6+5 Stealth, and 22 Envenom. I kill assasins, period. Now granted I have been ganked a time or two sneaking up to try to get a nice fat Caster, etc because of my low auto stealth, but... Gimme a stealther and I can hand them their rear in a bag. Many times stealthers have come up to me setting up for a PA, or BS, and I have turned and hit them with a Garrotte with my 20 DOT, followed by a quick weapon switch to the 19 Greater Weakening and a couple of Garrotte thrusts with my fast Flameforged Sword, and you know what.. Only about 1 in 9 makes it home. That one is usually so low on hp that they consider confronting me directly.<br><br>Now understand I am not saying my route is best for everyone, auto stealth sucks hard because of your detect range, and because of the amount of attacks you tend to draw from other stealthers, but that can turn into an advantage. I usually work with another stealther who has high stealth and who camps me, once the attackers reveal themselves in their attack we tag team them.<br><br>I always planned on high envenom and wouldnt change, I hope to have my envenom high enough so that I dont need many items at 50 to get Lifebane, and still do a decent lvl of PA damage.<br><br>Just wanted to give a little different perspective, and once I get the next lvl of enervating I'll bet things change yet again. The low enervating isnt near as nice as the weakening for slowing a target for an extra hit or two.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Bargle <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ublacule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blacule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 7:36:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Envenom and Stuff</span><hr size=1> Thats cool Bargle.
