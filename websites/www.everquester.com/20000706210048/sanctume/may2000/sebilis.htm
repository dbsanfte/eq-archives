        Old Sebilis this past week.</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Anyone wanting to enter Sebilis must posses 
        a Trakanon Idol which must be quested for in Trakanon's Teeth. KEG has 
        spent the first few nights obtaining these idols by hunting down medallions 
        from the froglok hunter and forager and turning them in to the iksar ghost 
        near the spectral graveyard.</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">While we were hunting for our medallions, 
        we ran into this rather nasty beast that was worth barshing.</font><img src="trakasaur.jpg" width="800" height="600">
