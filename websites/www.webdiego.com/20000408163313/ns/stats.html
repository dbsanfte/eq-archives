                <td><br><br>(Freeport) - <font face="Arial"><b>Salutations</b> and thank you with honoring me with your
presence today. I am Professor Ontollicus, a senior research associate
of mathematics here at <i>Norrath Scientific</i>.&nbsp; Today's column will deal
with the rather <b>simple</b> calculations and equations that determine the outcome
of many different events within Norrath.&nbsp; Mainly, we will be discussing
the formula that is used within melee to determine your chances of striking
your opponent.
<p>It is well known that many factors go into determining your chances
of successfully clobbering that Orc on the head, but what are they exactly?&nbsp;
Well, I with the vastly superior intelligence granted all Erudites, will
show you just how simple it really is.&nbsp; Adhering to the principles
of scientific law however, this entire study will be produced using only
factual information, not mere speculation, like some ignorant High Elves
may heap upon you.

<td VALIGN=TOP><font face="Arial">Or test subject for this project chose to remain anonymous, which is
a good thing considering the outcome.&nbsp; All I can say is that he <b><i>was</i></b>
a Rogue of the 40th level and he had signed all the waivers before submitting
to the dismantling of his Statistics Panel. I enlisted the help of a rather
clumsy (Aren't they all clumsy?) Warrior that goes by the name of Cardiff
Rockstacker. He, in his usual delicate manner, was able to pry open the two
main covers on the Statistics Panel of our test subject.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
our test subject did not live through the ordeal. <b>He gave up his life in
the further enhancement of Science!</b> <i>(Did I mention he had signed all the
waivers?)</i></font></td>

</table>
<p>So, with access to the inner workings of the Statistic Panel open to
my genius, it was with little delay that I was soon able to decipher the
somewhat childish coding scheme and produce a viable working formula.&nbsp;
As you can see in the formula below, it is a rather simple mathematical
equation that an Erudite child of 9 could complete. Using the laws of Matrix
Mechanics I will try to dummy down this formula so that some of you may
at least grasp the general idea.
<p>The basic equation is a classical example of simple harmonic motion.&nbsp;
For simple harmonic motion, the definition is that the force Strength (STR)
is proportional to the displacement, or that STR = -k x(t), k being the
proportionality, or force constant. With this definition for STR, Tornion's
Second Law can be solved for x(t) giving Agility (AGI) as the divisible
of (a) to the second (k) to the second minus 2 k.

<br>With the two expressions that result, we can find a result for this
formula. Obviously we simply take the product Dextrity (DEX) and then
the product px and take the difference. It is obvious, yea even trivial,
to note that for these two expressions, DEX-xp must be 0.
<p>So, with the matrix pathways clear now as to the result you can all
see just how simple it is to determine your chances of striking that Orc
on the head.&nbsp; Rather simple, yes? As a point of note, I have asked
my colleagues here at NS to not bother me with such trivial matters anymore,
as you can see this is far too simplistic for a man of my intellect.&nbsp;
Good luck to you all and remember to always carry your zeros.
