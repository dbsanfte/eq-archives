                <td><br><br>(Freeport) - <font face="Arial"><em><strong>Hail and well met fellow citizens of Norrath</strong></em>;
                I am <u>Dr. Winguren</u> your guide to scientific exploration here in our little realm. Well, most
                of it at least, I don't like Dark Elves. Hmmph, well that is another story all together. Let me
                proceed with today's topic, the phenomenon of the last bubble of experience.</font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">From many people's e-mails and personal experience, it became quite clear that something was up with
                that darn last bubble. There just seems to be about three times the experience in that bubble
                than the other four. So we here at Norrath Scientific rolled up our sleeves and set out to
                uncover the mysteries of this pesky little critter.</font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">We at first tried to observe the progress of experience in
                the last bubble with the normal human eye, but where unable to notice anything unusual except
                for the tremendously LONG amount of time it took for the last bubble to be filled.</font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">As we progressed through the last two bubbles we kept detailed accounts of what was slain and how much
                experience was gained. In figure 1.a, you can see a comparison of the last two bubbles.
                Fortunately, on the last kill of the experiment, our test subject, Binko de Blanca, a level 30
                Dwarf Cleric, was able to fell Lady Vox with one swoop and gain a decent amount of
                experience.</font>

                        <br><br>

                <font face="Arial">With this information collected and analyzed, we determined
                this definitely called for further investigation. I contacted an old friend from the land of the
                little people, a gnome wizard by the name of Diskod Poisonwand. I explained the problem we
                were investigating and asked for any ideas. Well, the little tinkering midget ...er height
                impaired, fellow came up with a brand new and unique invention that may revolutionize the
                scientific world. </font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">He explained to me that an aspiring astronomer Gnome had once
                given him the quest to find a lens from a very mean Evil Eye so that she could complete her new
                invention called a &quot;<strong>telescope</strong>&quot;, a device that allowed to people to view objects
                from a great distance. Well, he was lucky enough to acquire another lens from the foul beast. He
                then flipped the lens over and placed into a rolled up pie tin.</font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">His new invention allows anyone to look at any small
                object with great magnification!! We named this new device the &quot;<strong>Look at Real Real
                Small Things and Make Them Bigger Device</strong>&quot;.</font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">With this new contraption, we were able to delve deeper into
                the mysterious last bubble. What we discovered almost shocked my banded boxers right off my
                body. We believe we have discovered a force, which we have named the <u>Anti-Levelism Force</u>,
                that actually pushes against your experience. This force is always present, but becomes greatly
                apparent near the end of the level where the amount of empty space has shrunk to its smallest
                amount.</font>
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">Ok, if I am talking over your heads now Trolls, I am sorry
                but you should at least learn how to read. So, as I was saying, this force seems to be the problem
                with eclipsing the last bubble with that odd shade of orange.</font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">The mystery still remains as to exactly what this force is
                and how it can be stopped. Some of the researchers here believe the force is part of a
                much larger entity of evil that plagues us all. Some believe it is directly related to problems
                of the first bubble. Namely, the high probability that you will die <u>many</u> a painful death in
                the first bubble so that you can be sent back to be punished by the last bubble of the previous
                level.</font>
                        <br><br>
                <font face="Arial">We may never know exactly, but you can count that the crack
                team of scientists and researchers here at Norrath Scientific will not rest until the
                mystery is fully solved.</font>
