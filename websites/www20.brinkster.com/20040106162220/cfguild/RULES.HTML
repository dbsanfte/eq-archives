           </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In order to have a Guild
           that reflects Loyalty, Compassion, Support and Focus certain rules
           and procedures need to be set in place to ensure the Guild will
           prosper. Celestial fury would like to be the type of Guild that
           offers its members unconditional support and in order to do this we
           have devised a simple set of rules for all members to follow. Whilst
           these rules a merely set up as a guide, any ignorance of these rules
           will not be tolerated and each member will be given 3 warnings
           further incidents will result in dismissal.<br>
           <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When playing your Character/Characters your
           Guild Name MUST be showing at all times. If you wish to play
           anonymously you may do so by using the /role-play command.<br>
           <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Ill behavior or Ill-treatment of other
           players is NOT permitted. This would include but is not limited to:
           any form of 'Ninja Looting', 'Grief' playing (going out of your way
           to cause other players grief by immature and irrational behavior
           and/or abuse) Abusive language or vulgarity of any form, Ksing (Kill
           Stealing) and harassment.<br>
           <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Support and Loyalty are two things that are
           of utmost importance to our Guild. If and when a Guild-mate is ever
           in trouble or in need it is your responsibility to do all you can to
           assist, whenever feasible. Loyalty goes without question. If you are
           a member of this guild, you are required to show loyalty to the guild
           and its members.</font>
           <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *No
           selling over guild talk. If you have an item you would like to get
           rid of, pass it down to someone who can use it. Otherwise go to EC
           and sell it.<br>
           <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Our reputation is something we also need to
