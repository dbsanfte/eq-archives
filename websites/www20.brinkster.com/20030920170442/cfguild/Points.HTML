           <b><font size="+1">•Overview<br>
           </font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time a player helps on a raid, they get
           DKP. Whenever that player then enters in for an item from the raid,
           they get a chances to win the item. If a player wins an item, they
           lose DKP's equal to the value of the item.
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This system is designed to limit the effect of luck,
           and to avoid &quot;bad lottos.&quot; A bad lotto is when someone wins
           an item, and those present say &quot;he/she should not have
           won.&quot; This is the case when, say, a druid wins a Mistwalker
           instead of a ranger. Or when someone has been on dragon raid after
           dragon raid seeking to win one particular item, and someone new (or
           anyone with less time invested) shows up and wins it. This system
           solves these problems and others.</p>
           <p><font size="+1"><b>•Tiers</b></font><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;Tiers are designed to ensure that those with more time
           invested win an item before those with less time invested. In theory,
           over time the extra chances those with more DKP's would have, would
           win them items, but there's still the possibility that someone with a
           great deal of time invested will lose to someone with little time
           invested, which is a bad lotto.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiers are set up so that those with similar
           amounts of time invested (e.g. their DKP values are close) lotto for
           items, while those with significantly less DKP's are excluded.</p>
           <p>&nbsp; When an item is dropped, those in tier 1 or possibly 1+X
           (see below) are the only ones that can enter. If nobody that wants
           the item enters at this level, then those in the second tier can
           enter. If it's no drop, then the lotto moves to tiers three and four,
           otherwise it goes to the guild treasury and is kept until the next
           big event. At the next event interested players can lotto for it, and
           lottos go through tiers 1 through 3.</p>
           <p>&nbsp; If, after a week or 3 events, whichever is longer, an item
           is still in the guild treasury, the class restrictions are removed,
           and anyone can enter in for the item. This means the items can be
           purchased (with DKP's) for use by an under level 46 twink.</p>
           <p>&nbsp; If it is apparent that nobody will be entering in for an
           item, it can eventually be sold for guild money.</p>
           <p>&nbsp; Those that aren't present at a raid can still enter in on
           items, as shown in the tiers, but they pay a 50% DKP penalty. This
           means that if an item would normally cost 10 DKPs and it's won by
           someone that isn't present, it costs them 15 DKPs.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tier 1+X </b>- These tiers are special tiers,
           for cases when there is more than one person in tier 1. If there is
           more than one person in tier 1, and one or more of them have 5 or
           more points over the value of the item, then a new tier is used, tier
           1+5, containing only those players that have 5 or more DKP points
           over the value of the item. If there is still more then one, and
           someone has 10 points over, go to tier 1+10. Then tier 1+15, 1+20,
           etc.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, 3 players enter for a 5 point item. One
           with 5 points, one with 10 points, and one with 15 points. The lotto
           would take place at tier 1+10, and would contain only the character
           with 15 points. If the same lotto occurred with a 4th person with 17
           points, the lotto would still be tier 1+10, and would contain both
           the 15 and 17 point players.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tier 1 </b>- Must have full positive DKP
           value for the item and be present.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tier 2</b> - Must have full positive DKP
           value for the item and be present <i>or</i> have 1.5x positive DKP
           value and be anywhere.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Teir 3</b> - Must have full positive DKP
           value for the item and be present <i>or</i> have 0.75x positive DKP
           value and be anywhere. If won in the second manner, the cost is still
           1.5x normal, but the remote player doesn't need all the DKPs up
           front.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tier 4</b> - This tier is only for no drop
           items. When it is reached, the player(s) with the least negative DKP
           values that want the item can enter.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a player doesn't have enough DKP's to pay for
           it outright, they simply go negative. Until they have positive DKP's
           again they can't enter any lottos.</p>
           <p><font size="+1"><b>•Lotto Restrictions - Who can enter</b></font><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those players that can actually use the item
           (i.e. class/race is listed on the item, with exceptions noted below
           for certain items) can enter the lotto. If a player has more than one
           character that is dragon capable (level 46+), then they can enter as
           any of them provided they say so before the creature dies. This is so
           everyone knows who they'll be lottoing against. If someone looks
           around and sees only two people they'll be lottoing against, and
           something great drops for their class, they shouldn't have to
           suddenly compete with 10 others that come out of the woodwork.</p>
           <p><font size="+1"><b>•After an item is won<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font>Any items won through this system (except as
           noted above) can not be traded, sold, or given away without prior
           consent. &nbsp;Items can be given to a secondary, but only if the
           item is won in a secondary lotto, or the item has been replaced with
           something better, after the item was won. &nbsp;Items no longer
           wanted can be put up for lotto at any big event. &nbsp;If someone
           enters and wins it, they receive back DKP's equal to the value of the
           item. Basically the winner transfers their DKP's to the person
           putting up the item. If noone wants it, they keep it, and get no
           DKP's but can try again next lotto. Items that nobody wants can be
           turned in to the treasury for half DKP value. If the item was won
           outside of our DKP system, it can be turned in to the system, but at
           half normal DKP's.</p>

           Values</font></b><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the loot dropped, different big mobs
