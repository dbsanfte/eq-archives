We had little trouble with this fight and we had expected a bit more of it to be honest. Before engaging we spent a lot of time going through our ghoulishly clever tactics, our resist buffs and whatnot. It all ended with people loosing patience, a bumrush and a dead Tallon Zek.<br />
<br />
<b>Vallon Zek</b><br />
Somewhat cocky we strolled over to Vallon to find a type of encounter we really excell in. If there is any way to zerg ourselves to death by triggering add after add in an encounter you can be sure we will find it (see picture further below). We are the masters of it. After doing this twice it was decided that enough was enough.<br />
<br />
[I have no screenshots of this fight - Imagine LOTS of adds for the first two tries and a bunch of happy DWs in the last]<br />
