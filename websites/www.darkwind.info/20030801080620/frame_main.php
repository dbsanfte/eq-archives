As you saw in the last news, SoE gave us one high end zone to raid in (and wipe over and over) with a final mob who was impossible to kill. And i had to rant !<br />
What really surprised us, was that SoE repatched this ugly dragon and tweaked him so he became doable. Not too easy, but doable :)<br />
<br />
So he went from being a big, angry beast...<br />

<br />
to a big, dead, headless beast:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you SoE for that fast fixing. And even if high end guilds often rant about broken content, we have to thank you for the game you are providing to us. After all, we like it. Else we wouldnt be playing (i guess).<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yes, we got some decent loot <i>(but im sure you all saw it on Lucy already, since people who cant kill mobs themselves at least have to feel uber by submitting other's loot)</i>:<br />

It all started on wednesday, when we went to PoTime to advance further in the last remaining high end zone in Everquest. The obstacles wle had to overcome were  the gods in the zone's 5th tier and as you could read up in the last news, we managed to get them all killed, leaving one up for the next day to be able to zone into the next chamber in Time.<br />
But what happened then ?<br />
<br />
Some people in San Diego thought it was a clever thing to do some changes on those gods, hence resetting the zone on thursday. Oh joy, well then. So we fought all the way up to tier5, leaving some god up again for next day. We went to bed with happy thoughts (tm) expecting us to advance next days.<br />
<br />
Great !<br />
<br />
Shit !<br />
<br />
Friday Time was reset again and we had to start over again. Im not going to complain about getting more loot from the gods there, but when you always have the finishing line this close, it sucks to have to start over.<br />
So saturday we came back to kill what we left up on friday and yay, zone was not reset ! But we decided to suck and not to kill tier5 this day. Was one of those days... you know :)<br />
<br />
After 4 days in a row, killing same gods over and over, it had to be done today.... and we did it !<br />
At 21:34:05 CET Quarm was hailed the first time by a Darkwind member on Antonius Bayle.<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030713news/quarm01.jpg" border=0><br />
At 21:50:05 the first Darkwind member was slain by Quarm.<br />
<br />
If you thought high end Everquesting was all about killing big mobs and getting loot, you are so damn wrong.<br />
It's all about wiping.<br />
Wiping over and over.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine what those nutsacks in San Diego thought when they brought this mob into game and i'm not sure if they were thinking at all, but i am pretty sure this mob is far from being killable right now.<br />
His AEs are just insane (one does 3000 dmg every 10- 30 sec.). His melee output seems ok tho. His adds (oh yeah, SoE loves adds !!) aren't really necesary to make this encounter impossible.<br />
<br />
This is the furthest we go him: <img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030713news/quarm90.jpg" border=0><br />
<br />
Maybe we were just way to impressed by his size and couldn't manage to come up with any idea how to beat him (yet), but i still believe someone in California is getting a woody just by wiping guilds after letting them spend endless hours in a zone packed with intense fights.<br />
<br />
Guess we might be allowed to see him dead one day, but we deserve a fair shot now and not when they finished other stuff. They should stop wasting time in gimping TT and Saryrn in Time and rather fix other things (no, i don't mean stuck doors in Freeport).<br />
<br />
Quarm needs to be killed asap. We don't want a gimp dragon, but one you have a chance to kill :)<br />
<br />
Here are some shots where you can see how big this Godzilla on steroids is:<br />

Well you are right, but for once dear readers, I want to tell you about a love story. A love story that happened in the middle of a bloody war between the god of war himself and 72 brave fighters... A love story, so heartbreaking and realistic, full of such tragedy as it is unheard sill until the present day in the vast lands of Norrath. <br />
If you take a look at our lovely collection of warriors, you will very soon stumble over <B>Fafrd, The Sensitive</B>. To tell you about him, he is the genius that mastered the art of shaving balls while playing EverQuest, but still at the same time he is the most romantic and poetic person I have had the pleasure to meet.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/conv.JPG" border=0><br />
<br />
<br />
Yesterday Fafrd The Sensitive's eyes met something, that would change his life forever. He saw the love of his life...<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/RZ.JPG" border=0><br />
<br />
<br />
Fafrd became very nervous and curious at her sight, so he asked around for the name of this gorgeous and noble lady, and a little bird revealed her name to him.<br />
<B>Rallos, The Iron Maiden</B><br />
Iron Maiden? Fafrd hesitated... Would he be man enough to charm this tender lady? Would he be confident enough to break her principles and conquer her? He was so unsecure... but he dreamt about Rallos shaving his balls with this axe of war he was wielding so sexyly...<br />
Fafrd took a little break and consulted an old friend<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/Fafrd.JPG" border=0><br />
<br />
and after realizing that even the intimate meetings with this old friend lost their special atmosphere, Fafrd made the decision of his life. He decided to hit on the god of war himself. He felt all his <B>REALTANK (tm)</B> spirit coming up in him and giving him the courage needed for this step. <br />
So Fafrd The Sensitive, searched in his romantic vocabulary and after he dusted of his unresistable charm phrases he started the flirting.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/Faf02.JPG" border=0><br />
His main quality is obviously his honesty<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/Faf04.JPG" border=0><br />
But quite impatient, dont you think? <br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/Faf01.JPG" border=0><br />
<br />
<br />
And it went quite well for him. Rallos was already lifting his skirt, but then suddenly...<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/Ker.JPG" border=0><br />
<br />
<B>Kerleblanc the Pirate !</B><br />
Oh no... Fafrd didnt think of any sort of competiton. And right in this unprepared moment, Kerleblanc, who fell for the Iron Maiden himself got out a secret weapon, unresistable for any woman.<br />
He slammed his 10 inch cock together with 3000 DWP on the table in front of Rallos and <B>DANG</B>, Kerle had <B>SCORED</B> and Fafrd was forgotten in seconds... Rallos was so impressed, he immediately threw his heart at Kerle: <br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/darkbladeofthewarlord.JPG" border=0><br />
<br />
There he was, Fafrd The Sensitive. Alone, hurt, embarassed... but at least he was still holding her skirt in his hands.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/platinumcloakofwar.jpg" border=0><br />
<br />
As he was about to hug this last remain of his romance with The Iron Maiden herself and to smell the parfume on it... suddenly the skirt dissapeared from his hands and he had realized that Torelan with his fast fingers ninjaed the skirt for himself before he could even recognize him.<br />
<br />
Who will be Fafrd's new target? Here is a hint.<br />
<br />

Yeah, they rampaged throu our living room (guess you know where we are living lately).<br />
<br />
Not sure, if it's needed to mention that quite some toys were damaged on this rampage.<br />
First one, was some puppet, who looks like my landlord and is every dark elve's wet dream:<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/inny.jpg" border=0><br />
He droped two of these neat tings for us:<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/mantleofpurespirit.jpg" border=0><br />
<br />
<br />
Next victim was the god of war himself. As being a god of war i would imagine him being really badass and a real good nanny for the DW kids when im not around. But i guess he must be a real wuss, since they managed to kill him without me.<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/rz.jpg" border=0><br />
He droped the sword of <i>'holy fuck,'</i> :<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/darkbladeofthewarlord.jpg" border=0><br />
and some decent cloak:<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/platinumcloakofwar.jpg" border=0><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So now, before i go to bed to cry into my pillow about some missed guild first, i need to share my thoughts about all this:<br />
<b>I AM SURE ALL THIS IS JUST A FAKE, CAUSE I KNOW DW CAN'T DO SHIT WITHOUT ME !!!!</b><br />
<br />
<i>p.s.: only Bertoxxuwuss standing between us and PoTime tier6. At least one mob they can't kill without me !!!!</i><br />
