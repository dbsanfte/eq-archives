We spent nearly 3 weeks learning this encounter. We wiped every time, multiple times per day. I could easily say that we won due to our fiendishly clever tactics, this would however not be entirely true. <br />
The main reason we won is that we have a collection of extremely stubborn and dedicated people in this guild who refuse to take no for an answer and go at it time and time again. We did of course come up with some pretty nifty ideas during this ordeal and some really stupid ones as well.<br />
<br />
Simply put, the bastard had to die. So it was written, so it shall be done.<br />

It took us 3 attempts on RZ himself to win, 68%, 50% and 0% respectively. The fights were pure adrenaline rushes and guildchat was going completely mad when RZ hit the 20% mark. 3 weeks of built up frustration and anger of a whole guild released at once can create some spamtastic results. The killshot was of gnomish origin.<br />

<br />
With his demise we now have access to the Planes of Air, Earth and Water. In the coming days we intend to investigate these and we will also have to squeeze in Solusek Ro to obtain access to Plane of Fire. <br />
<br />
Once again a gigantic thank you to the members of Darkwind who put up with all this during the last weeks. <br />
