<b>Plane of Earth B</b><br />
Our first encounter with Warlord Gintolaken didn't end very well since bugged rampage and agro added quite some flavor to the fight. We did however return yesterday with our merry band of 46 lootlovers and with the appropriate bugfixes in place, which stopped us from getting smeared all across the zone, we managed to win. He dropped a pair of neck/wrist/waist multislot items of which I have no screenshot of whatsoever.<br />
<br />
After this rather pleasant victory we explored the zone which brought us to the twelve councilmen. We took them out for a few spins, tested this, tested that, ooohing and aaahing over all kind of things and (according to us) smart ideas. Needless to say we wiped numerous times and we'll probably continue to do so when we return to test some new theories.<br />

It's allways fun entering new zones and trying out new encounters allthough there are reports about this final encounter being bugged still. We'll keep working on it either way, doing what we do best: kite, zerg and die repeatedly.<br><br></font></div></td>
