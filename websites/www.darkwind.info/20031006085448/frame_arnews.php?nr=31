      <div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You think the high end game of EverQuest is only about strict raiding in military style, huge guilds of hundreds of players competing for loot, fastest kills and winning/losing ranks on dickswinger?<br />
Well you are right, but for once dear readers, I want to tell you about a love story. A love story that happened in the middle of a bloody war between the god of war himself and 72 brave fighters... A love story, so heartbreaking and realistic, full of such tragedy as it is unheard sill until the present day in the vast lands of Norrath. <br />
If you take a look at our lovely collection of warriors, you will very soon stumble over <B>Fafrd, The Sensitive</B>. To tell you about him, he is the genius that mastered the art of shaving balls while playing EverQuest, but still at the same time he is the most romantic and poetic person I have had the pleasure to meet.<br />

Yesterday Fafrd The Sensitive's eyes met something, that would change his life forever. He saw the love of his life...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Fafrd became very nervous and curious at her sight, so he asked around for the name of this gorgeous and noble lady, and a little bird revealed her name to him.<br />
<B>Rallos, The Iron Maiden</B><br />
Iron Maiden? Fafrd hesitated... Would he be man enough to charm this tender lady? Would he be confident enough to break her principles and conquer her? He was so unsecure... but he dreamt about Rallos shaving his balls with this axe of war he was wielding so sexyly...<br />
Fafrd took a little break and consulted an old friend<br />
<br />

<br />
and after realizing that even the intimate meetings with this old friend lost their special atmosphere, Fafrd made the decision of his life. He decided to hit on the god of war himself. He felt all his <B>REALTANK (tm)</B> spirit coming up in him and giving him the courage needed for this step. <br />
So Fafrd The Sensitive, searched in his romantic vocabulary and after he dusted of his unresistable charm phrases he started the flirting.<br />
<br />

His main quality is obviously his honesty<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030703news/Faf04.JPG" border=0><br />
But quite impatient, dont you think? <br />

<br />
<br />
And it went quite well for him. Rallos was already lifting his skirt, but then suddenly...<br />
<br />

<br />
<B>Kerleblanc the Pirate !</B><br />
Oh no... Fafrd didnt think of any sort of competiton. And right in this unprepared moment, Kerleblanc, who fell for the Iron Maiden himself got out a secret weapon, unresistable for any woman.<br />
He slammed his 10 inch cock together with 3000 DWP on the table in front of Rallos and <B>DANG</B>, Kerle had <B>SCORED</B> and Fafrd was forgotten in seconds... Rallos was so impressed, he immediately threw his heart at Kerle: <br />
<br />

<br />
There he was, Fafrd The Sensitive. Alone, hurt, embarassed... but at least he was still holding her skirt in his hands.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030702news/platinumcloakofwar.jpg" border=0><br />
<br />
As he was about to hug this last remain of his romance with The Iron Maiden herself and to smell the parfume on it... suddenly the skirt dissapeared from his hands and he had realized that Torelan with his fast fingers ninjaed the skirt for himself before he could even recognize him.<br />
<br />
Who will be Fafrd's new target? Here is a hint.<br />
