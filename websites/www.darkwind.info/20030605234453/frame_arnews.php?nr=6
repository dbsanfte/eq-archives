      <div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we started out in PoP our strategy was to see which path our competitors would take and go the exact opposite way. In our naive way of thinking we figured that the PoP encounters would not be linked to each other in the way they turned out to be. This resulted in the following chronographical  progression.<br />
<br />
<li>Terris Thule<br />
<li>Saryrn<br />
<li>Mithaniel Marr<br />
<li>Agnarr the Storm Lord<br />
<li> Behemoth<br />
<li>Tallon Zek<br />
<li>Vallon Zek<br />
<br />
After TT we charged for Saryrn, oblivious of the fact that Bertox was a requirement to receive the character flag  from her. Since we did this before the Bertox -> Saryrn bug was fixed we ended up with about 3/4 of the guild flagged. We didn't even realize the that there had been a bug until patchday when our unflagged people were hailing a planar projection next to Saryrns corpse.<br />
<br />
At this point Mortalis was bussy keying up for Bertox. As to not create anymore bottlenecks than necessary for ourselves  we decided to steer clear of Bertox for the time being and continue onwards to Mithaniel Marr. Bastion of Thunder keys were lovingly (heh) farmed and after a few weeks we had a raidforce in the zone ready to take on the the big bad man himself.<br />
<br />
Behemoth was conquered, Plane of Tactics opened which resulted in a swift downing of Tallon and Vallon. Last week work began on the lower CoD keys and we will soon be decked out with those as well.<br />
<br />
In retrospect it is unfortunate that a bug like the Bertox -> Saryrn requirement was not spotted and fixed before the expansion went live since it has created a lot of headaches for our guild. With the abundance of keys and character flags in this latest expansion it is not allways an easy task to keep the guild on the same level.<br />
<br />
Bertox, Rallos Zek and Solusek Ro await us and we're hoping that we can add all three to our progression list in the near future.<br />
<br />
Since most of us are europeans we are by definition a bit daft, being from the old world and all. We therefore like to complicate things by going through a linear expansion in a non-linear way.<br />
<br />
This concludes the history briefing and brings us up to present time.<br />
