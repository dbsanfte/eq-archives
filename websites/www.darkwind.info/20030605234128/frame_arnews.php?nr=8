      <div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030112news/A_1.jpg" align=left> long time ago there was a Bard named Tunnes who said every day, "Ah, if only all my guildmates had all the character flags, just as I do!". Tunnes, famous around the land for her trains of death, was sadened that not every member of her guild could take part in the adventures that took the guild deep into the Elemental Planes.<br />
<br />
Some in the guild found comfort in the fact that not all could join, even though it often ment death due to a weakened force. These people greedily hoarded their loot, planning, protecting their future items but Tunnes never gave up on her quest to get the guild rounded up all together in the Elemental Planes.<br />
<br />
One early winter morning Tunnes said, "Behemoth the foul beast has been spotted in his lair! He holds the key to the Fortress of Zek. I say we take our merry band of adventurers and defeat him now!" and the people who had never seen the Fortress of Zek exclaimed, "Hurray!".<br />
<br />
After the dust had settled Tunnes stood victorius on the field of battle, joined not only by her own guildmembers but also by heroes from Mortalis and Raging Fury.<br />
<br />
Tunnes, followed by the strong and proud adventurers of Darkwind, now headed into the Fortress of Zek to confront the Warlord himself. They had defeated him once before, but none of them was sure if they could easily do it again. After all, everyone gets lucky once in a while, even hardened adventurers.<br />
 <br />
Rallos minions rushed to his defense to no avail, the brave bard and her friends stood against every wave of oncomming enemies. Pressing onward into the arena, they found their nemesis, the warlord himself. A huge battle took place, swaying back and forth but in the end Tunnes and her friends once again came out on top.<br />
<br />

<br />
A proud adventurer stepped forward saying, "Enough charity work for one day, I demand Elemental loot now!". Mumbles of "Smashing idea!", "I'll drink to that!" and "What about our friends?" where heard among the crowd. The arena went quiet and Tunnes locking eyes with the warrior said, "You silly little titt! You can go to the Elemental planes alone, the rest of us will press onward and fight the five underlings of Solusek Ro himself!"<br />
<br />
The adventurers packed up their gear and headed into the Tower of Solusek Ro. After many battles and countless riches, Jiva, Rizlona, Dresolik, Xuzl and Arlyxir lay dead at the feet of Darkwind: the evil five were defeated. They went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath could be heard, and at last they saw the entrance the lair.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://darkwind-guild.com/pics/20030112news/solro_small.jpg" align=left> Midnight was allready long gone once Tunnes and her tired compatriots entered the lair of the Prince of Flame.  Exhausted from battling all day many wondered if they would be able to defeat their foe. <br />
<br />
"Do not fear my my friends, for I am with you...all for one, and one for all. " Tunnes screamed as they charged Solusek Ro. The mighty wizard fought furiously but to no avail. Darkwind, fueled by their earlier victories during the day, fought mercilessly and and once again they came out on top, just like good heroes should.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day they all ventured into the Plane of Fire and experienced many, many more adventures but that, dear readers, is another story.<br><br></font></div></td>
