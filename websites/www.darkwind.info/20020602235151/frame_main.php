Hmm, well let me make you a good example, so YOU can understand it better, for not doing<br />
RoF-type of events:<br />
We all know that 95% of the everquest players are gay and the rest are 13 year old, board-hacking nerds, or a mix of it. So i will start with my lesson for the Venv... err nerds:<br />
So, you are searching for food and entertainment in the garbage can next to your orphanage, waiting for a nice, prosperous and rich couple like this<br />
<img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/parents.gif"><br />
 to adopt you....<br />
<br />
<br />
....but you have to go throu this<br />
<img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/couple1.gif"> <img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/couple2.gif"><br />
and these<br />
<img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/couple3.gif"> <img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/couple4.gif"><br />
before getting what you was looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, in case you aren't that lil hacking nerd, you prolly are the other kind of AB-habitant and want to get laid by him:<br />
<img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/gay.gif"><br />
but have to go throu this<br />
<img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/man1.gif"> <img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/man2.gif"><br />
and these:<br />
<img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/man3.gif"> <img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/man4.gif"><br />
<br />
You probably get what you wanted, at the end, but tell me, was it worth it ?<br />
<br />
Since we aren't nerds nor gay, we just kill stuff like this<br />
<img src="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/05news27/hp.gif"><br />
After giving us a good headache over the past weeks, with our low numbers on raids, we finally managed to kill him twice again, in almost flawless (dead hobbit clerics don't count =/ ) fights.<br />
<br />
Other than that we were killing the usual suspects, including Blood of Ssra etc.<br />
On AB we have a kinda unique constellation: we got 3 guilds competing on blowing spawns like AoW and 2 guilds trying real hard on killing the Emperor of Ssra.<br />
Time will tell who will be the first on killing Emperor :)<br />
<br />
On a side note: One of ABs major guilds "Innit" was disbanded yesterday.<br />
We, Darkwind, wanted to thank you for always being one good and fair competitor. We wish all of you, best of luck in your EQ-future. Your guild will be missed !<br><br>&raquo; <a href="#top">back to top</a><br><br></font></div></td></tr><tr><a name="2"></a><td width="30">&nbsp;</td><td width="670" background="images/table_header.jpg"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Check out our new board.</b><br>Sunday, May 05, 23:00 -- Posted by: Toes</font></td></tr><tr><td width="30">&nbsp;</td><td width="670"><div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi there folks.<br />
<br />
We decided to do something usefull for once and so we started to work a bit on our old homepage and board.<br />
First we brought a new board up and now we will give our Homepage a new look and change some functions. This will take some time, after all we are DWs and slow by default.<br />
<br />
Err yes, slow.. very slow, as you didn't see any updates from me for some time =/<br />
Sorry for that, but RL kept me busy and you should know most stuff that dies anyway.<br />
<br />
Several burrower parasites, Tunares, Arch Liches, AoWs and other stuff died since last update. Nothing really impressive. Mostly being kept busy with some key- and bane-stuff...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, pretty short update =/<br />
...but there isn't much to add. Maybe some new loot pics ?<br />
Hm, let's see. Did i mention that Brogg V2.0 died twice to us ?<br />

<img src="images/news/fuvi.jpg" width="450" height="370"><br />
 Why this, you ask ?<br />
Do you remember some patches ago they fixed the animations on gnomes when  sitting ?<br />
Now that was a great moment for the whole EQ-community. Wasn't it ?<br />
Right! It wasn't ! Noone cares about sitting gnomes!<br />
<br />
What we care about are stupid asssucking mobs which tend to warp to zone  and ruin 35 people's day. Yes, i am talking about the <font color="#FFFF00"><b>burrower  parasite</b></font>. This friggin mob tends to warp to zone in from time  to time and summon your people to him. And exactly this happened to us  the other day, twice in a row ! So VI apearently doesnt seem to think this bug is worth to be fixed, but wastes time and money for stupid gnome animations ?<br />
<br />
Anyway, we still killed that burrower with the 35 people we had there,  cause bugs don't hold us from killing shit. I can't tell you why, but  somehow DW never killed this poor lady before:<br />
<img src="images/news/Tunare.jpg" width="472" height="474"><br />
Besides that im wondering why she got no clothes, I wonder why we never  killed her before.<br />
Probably it's because this game is every day getting more boring and we needed a change to all these **** key camps.<br />
<br />
Are you familiar with all those new keys needed ?<br />
Imagine how masochistic DW is, that we aren't working on one key, not 2 keys, not 3....<br />
we are working our sorry asses off for all those stupid keys out there, cause we know that out of the 4 keyed zones, there will be at least 3 fucked up ones. And we wanna beta test em all =/<br />
<br />
So you think this doesnt fit to a loothungry, everything-killing guild, like DW ? Right ! Do not, i repeat, do not apply to Darkwind, if you aren't willing to work for your loot ! I have seen people applying to DW, who don't even have the stamina to wait 3 lousy days for our recruitment officers to come back to them. They thought those few days might be wasted days, where they could have got da ph@t lewt somewhere else. Be my guest, join any other guild, that doesnt whatch applicants as closely as DW does, but please safe us from having to read your sorry applications and go<br />
