<br />
After spending a lot of time in the Bastion of Thunder (mainly because we like the zone and also because the keys didn't work as intended) tonight we finally reached Agnarr and tangoed toe to toe with him. He put up a fun fight and to our own amazement we managed to not screw up anything during the entire fight.<br />

The final score was (surprisingly) DW 1 - Agnarr 0.<br />

<b>In other news</b><br />
We went back and visited both Senior Marr and Saryrn. Placement during MM was of course BRILLIANT as usual. Higher! Higher!<br />
