      <div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As it turns out we appear to have been slightly over-optimistic regarding our future plans of working on The Rathe. We had a raid scheduled the other day which would have taken us to PoEarthB to kill a few lootmobs and then given us a few hours to work on the Rathe. As we began to ferry people to PoEarthB we suddenly realized that our three group keys had magically stopped porting entire groups. <br />
<br />
Being the optimist I am, I told my fellow guildmembers: Don't panic, it's probably just a bug that will get fixed soon. The next day we were presented with a patch message indicating that I should take my optimism and stuff it. <br />
<br />
So, instead of exploring a new zone we decided to do a few more PoEarthA scripts, which from a loot perspective are quite nice nowadays. <br />
<br />
If one ignores... <br />
<li>how easy these scripts are to blow either accidentaly by yourself or by an exp group <br />
<li>how easily the scripts stop working (for weeks sometimes), <br />
<li>the way mobs spawn under the world <br />
<li>how long it takes to complete all 4 scripts and also kill the Key dropper <br />
<li>how many times a guild must now redo these 4 scripts + keydropper to key the entire guild <br />
<li>how long it will actually take to key the entire guild when taking PoEarthA's bugged state into account <br />
<li>how much of a pain in the ass it will be to key future applicants <br />
...this probably is the best idea to come out of the Sony offices since the Walkman. <br />
