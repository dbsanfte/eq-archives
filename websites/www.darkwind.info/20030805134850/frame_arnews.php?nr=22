<br />
It's not that bad, really. We've been doing rather well on the Rathe so far and at the last attempt we had 9 out of 12 under control before things started to get out of hand. The 3 hours of work that led up to this were pretty much without any mistakes and then bad luck combined with the tiniest of errors ended our run.<br />
<br />
We took a vacation from the Rathe over the last two days to let our people rest. The pullers need to get some exp back and the enchanters are probably still pressing their mez keys out of reflex every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
While I'm on that subject: Mezzing the same mob for 3 hours does not require any kind of skill nor is it entertaining in any way. It was allready a horrible experience in the Emp encounter but this pretty much takes the prize. And it's not only the Enchanters who suffer but also an entire army of debuffers since the resists on these mobs are through the roof.<br />
<br />
I rather act as the sacrificial tash lamb, meaning I join the happy people in the pull team who die roughly 40 times in 2 days worth of attempts, than mash my mez key for 3, 4 or why not 5 or 6 hours.<br />
<br />
<b>In short:</b><br />
Permamezzing = bad bad bad<br />
Adds spawning, add teams having to react to changes in the encounter = good good good<br />
<br />
Other than that everything is <b>FANTASTIC<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup></b><br><br></font></div></td>
