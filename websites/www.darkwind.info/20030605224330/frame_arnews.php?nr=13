This week, a mystery virus has gripped Darkwind, causing all manner of horrid disfigured sights, whilst many consider this is an evil scheme of Ofassa, I think we can take a safe bet that someone attempted to cyber a frog and is paying the price.<br />

	As you can witness from this horrid spectacle, the effects of the mystery virus are devestating, the senses are numbed and any taste in clothes vanishes.<br />

whilst no known cure exists, scientists have managed to identify the early indications that the illness is about the strike.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>A desire to get transported to Stonebrunt.</li><br />
<li>Begging for maps of the warrens.</li><br />
<li>A desire to sit at a pottery wheel and brew barrel</li><br />
</ul><br />
And the final and possibly irreversible stage:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>The person insists on standing by a wall so they can look at themselves.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The virus has been spreading at exponential speed, within hours of the original case, many members have been struck down.<br />

But even after suffering the torment and horror, nothing could of prepared us for what was to come next. The virus obviously mutating within the human genome created an even worse nightmare. <br />

<p>Where will it end? Where did it come from? the truth is out there,...<p><br />

<p>On a slightly more positive note, Fennin dropped a couple of belts, which was nice.<p><br />
