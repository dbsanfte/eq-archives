second age. A time of warfare and strife where the strong take
what they want and the weak stay close to the protection of their
homes for fear of being molested. Until Now... Out of the ashes
of warfare and strife has arisen a new order of Knighthood. An
order dedicated to protecting those who cannot protect
themselves. While helping those who would travel the dangerous
paths of NeverWinter. This order would be known as the Royale
Knights of NeverWinter. In time all the inhabitants of
NeverWinter were driven from there home by an Evil and powerful
Orcish army. Their only hope of survival was to find new homes
and spread the knowledge and love that they had found as Royale
Knights. Hoping that someday they could return to their home they
so dearly loved, NeverWinter.</strong></font></p>

of Purpose</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>The main purpose of
the Royale Knights is to establish a guild made up of members who
are willing to form a Brotherhood and Sisterhood beyond that of
the friendships of others in the online Role Playing Games. Our
intent is to put fellow guild members above all others, while
still remaining helpful to those in need. The purpose of this
Brotherhood/Sisterhood is to fight the evil guilds that run amuck
in the online RPG's and to show that evil can be fought while
still maintaining Honor and Dignity. We are a guild that takes
our loses with Dignity and our wins with Honor while still
protecting those who have not acquired the knowledge that we
posses as Royale Knights. Our goal is to share our knowledge with
all those willing to abide by our rules and to take the steps we
deem necessary to train one to become a Knight.</strong></font></p>
