      Everquest.&nbsp; If you are wondering what exactly we are, you've come to the right
      place.&nbsp; The Guardians of Norrath is a guild on the game known around the world as
      Everquest, yes that's right the game more addicting than nicotine.&nbsp; This is a
      massively online multi-player role-playing game.&nbsp; Supposedly taking place on a far
      away planet starting sometime in the year 3000 (the in-game date keeps going, currently it
      is around the year 3370, yet the saga continues)<blockquote>
        <p><strong><u>Where are we?</u></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Guardians of Norrath is a guild on the <em><u>Xegony</u></em>
      Server of Everquest (In game we are known as &quot;Norrath's Guardians&quot;).&nbsp; We
      are a semi-role-playing.&nbsp; By this I mean, in the guild channel we do not require that
      you speak in a 14<sup>th</sup> century style and you may hold conversations irrelevant to
      the game, it doesn't matter.&nbsp; However, we will hold events in the game that hold a
      purpose to the guild charter which is quoted below.&nbsp; </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><u>What are we?</u></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Guardians of Norrath is not a holy guild nor an evil
      guild, it is a combination of both good and evil.&nbsp; How is this you ask? Simple, this
      is a combination of the holy, and evil playing good united together as one guild to fight
      against the corruptions of Norrath and furthermore to protect our planet and the natural
      state of it, hence the name, &quot;Guardians of Norrath&quot;.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><strong><u>Why are we here? (Charter)</u></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">The following is an excerpt from the guild charter for the &quot;Guardians
      of Norrath&quot;: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<em>Long ago, a great dragon known as the Crystinine Dragon
      brought fourth a new life unto this lifeless desert oasis of a planet we now call Norrath,
      and our home.&nbsp; Through the evolution of Norrath, like any world, a holy and an evil
      side hath developed.&nbsp; Unto this day, May 5th, 3177, good and evil have been sworn
      enemies in rage and anger devoting their lives in defeating the next.&nbsp; Alas, by the
      powers of Mithanial Marr come the birth of a new guild of the holy and evil united as one
      to fight the corruption of the world and to return Norrath to what it once was! 'Tis the
      guild of The Guardians of Norrath</em>&quot;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><u><strong>Am I qualified to join the Guardians of Norrath?</strong></u></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most likely you are.&nbsp; We do not limit who can join the
      guild very much but we do have some requirements which are a follows:<ul>
        <li>You must be level 15 (If you have a level 15 or over character in the guild already, you
          are welcome to bring in your other lower level characters)</li>
        <li>You must not be a &quot;newbie&quot; to the game (All I mean by this, is basically, if
          you just opened the package and installed Everquest, you won't know the first thing about
          the game and most likely wont be able to participate in any events because of this)</li>
        <li>Before you join you must <u>either</u>...<ul>
            <li>Have two approvals from other members within the guild</li>
            <li>Be a friend in real life (or a long time in-game friend) of an existing guild member.</li>
            <li>Group with an officer of the guild, or one of its leaders (Golggen and Iceassasin)</li>
            <li>Speak with Golggen or Iceassasin about joining.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <p align="left"><u><strong>&nbsp;</strong></u></p>
        <p align="left"><u><strong>How do I go about joining the guild?</strong></u></p>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have a sign-up sheet on our website for
      one reason: &quot;We do not accept just anybody into the guild, although we are very
      lenient&quot; (see above).&nbsp; If you are interested in joining us, please either email
      us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@the-guardians.zzn.com">webmaster@the-guardians.zzn.com</a>
      or, on the Xegony server type the command /who all &quot;Norrath's Guardians&quot; and
      talk to one of us [If either Golggen (me) or Iceassasin (the other leader) are online talk
      to one of us]. Or send me a message on; ICQ: 54370398; AIM(AOL Instant Messenger): King
      Libby.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><strong><u>What are the advantages of the guild website for us members?</u></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple, as a member you get to view this site in
      its full beauty.&nbsp; By this I mean you get to use all of its options.&nbsp; So what do
      these options include? Well, for one, All members have their own E-Mail account which
      would be ____@the-guardians.zzn.com (fill in the blank with the player's in-game name).
      &nbsp; Members also get a space where they can post their profile including a picture,
      their level, other stats, and a brief summary of themselves.&nbsp; Another thing members
      get is their member area.&nbsp; The member area includes: a conference room, forums,
      listing of guild events, place to edit your profile, soon to come auctions, and more.</td>
