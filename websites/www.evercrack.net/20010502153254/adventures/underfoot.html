Holy Partisan of Underfoot

I'm spilling my guts out here... It's going to be long and fairly detailed, I need some
typing practice anyway.

I was helping my good friend Riae Soulmender in Dagnor's Cauldron trying to find that
elusive Bilge aqua goblin when suddenly Riae mentions that he found some exiled Paladin
by the docks of faydwer. Naturally I felt obligated to go investigate. Off to
butcherblock I went in search of something interesting.
I get to the docks and to my surprise I find a friendly young Dwarf fisherman by the
sea.

"Hail Dru Razbine", I said. He responds back about his fishing spot and tells me how he
needs to fish for food now that he is banished from Kaladim. I listen in on his story of
woe and how he was stripped of his Cape of Underfoot by Datur Nightseer, the leader of
the Paladin Guild in Kaladim. Turns out he was chosen for a very important task by
Datur, failed, and was banished. If only he had a brave Paladin to help him. "I think
you've found your best hope Dru, let me help you," I said to him, hoping for the chance
to redeem my newfound fallen dwarf paladin. He jumps at the chance maybe seeing
something in me that reminded him of himself back in his younger years. He goes on to
explain the unfortunate circumstances surrounding what has happened. He was sent by
Datur Nightseer to carry the Chalice of Conquest to a noble band of Paladins in the
Mountains of Rathe. Dru then informs me that the Chalice of Conquest is very special
indeed. Rumor has it that Brell himself delivered the Chalice to the Church of Underfoot
himself. Drinking from the Chalice of Conquest assures you of victory, howerver only
good natured people can drink from the cup. If someone of an evil past drinks from the
cup, they suffer the wrath of Brell. He goes on to say he was able to make it to the
group of High Paladins in Rathe Mountains but while he was there a band of orcs attacked
the camp. During the melee an opportunistic Blue Orc was able to sneak into the camp and
steal the Chalice! Dru was busy fighting off the attacking orcs to notice the artifact
being stolen. After the fight was over Dru chased the orc off into the sunset to no
avail. When Lord Datur Nightseer heard of the events that took place from Dru, he chose
to blame his once noble paladin and banish him from Kaladim. 

After his tale ended he handed me a container with two slots. He told me that once I
found the Chalice of Conquest and the Candle of Bravery, combine them, and return the
case to Lord Nightseer. "Candle of Bravery?" I asked, having never heard of such an
item. He explained that is a Ceremonial candle lit when the Chalice of Conquest is to be
drunk from. He told me to get the Candle of Bravery I would have to get both the
candlestick and the candle, the latter of which burnt out long ago and he did not know
where Priestess Ghalea aquires them from. 

From this point I'm off on my quest for the Chalice of Conquest, Candle of Bravery, and
most importantly- To restore Dru Razbine to his former glory of being a Paladin of
Underfoot. First, thanks to Riae Soulmender who reminded me who she was, I went to
Kaladim to speak with Priestess Ghalea of the Church of Underfoot. I made my way to the
cleric guild inside Kaladim and asked the Priestess about the Candle of Bravery. She
explains that the candle itself is very difficult to make and only one person is able to
do this task: Dok of Halas. She told him that if I needed one made I would surely need
some Soil of Underfoot to give to Dok. For the Soil of Underfoot I had venture to Lesser
Faydark and lay waste to some Fairies, and pick up four portions of Fairy dusts. After
this tedious task I returned the dust to Ghalea and she gave me some blessed Soil of
Underfoot. I then knew my journey required me to take the boat to Antonica.

After a long boat ride, followed by a long run, I made found myself at the Paladin camp
in Rathe Mountains, the same Paladins who give out the Armor of Ro molds. I find
Nicholas, the dwarven Paladin, and ask him about the Chalice of Conquest. He fills me
in, with more detail, of the orc attack that fateful day and the events that
followed. Turns out that after the attack, a passing ranger helped Nicholas track down
the blue orc to an orc camp in the near by Lake Rathe. At this lake the found the blue
orc's dead body, appearently the orc had taken a fatal blow during the fight but had
enough stamina to make it back to the camp, and a group of orcs too powerful for just
the two of them to take on. Nicholas decided that it would be best to go back and get
help from the other Paladins. The next morning when the Paladins returned to the orc
camp they found it deserted with some orc remnants scattered about. They found a
bracelet with the name "Klunga" on it, a shovel, a bag of cauldron prawns, and two sets
of tracks leading away from the camp. Nicholas went on to say that the orc camp has now
been taken over by green orcs and advised me to stay away. I thanked Nicholas for the
information and then asked him what he knew about the Candle of Bravery. He gave me a
piece of the broken candlestick and went on to say that the Rathe Mountains are not only
overrun by monsters, but by evil druids as well! Appearently an odd druid somehow
managed to brake the candlestick and steal a portion of it during a fight between the
druids and the paladins. Nicholas even remembered the druids battle cry, "Long live the
green!!!" Nicholas told me that if I was able to find the other piece of the
candlestick, the make of the candlestick would surely be able to put it back together. 

Against Nicholas' advice, I went to Lake Rathetear in search of clues. I found the orc
camp that he mentioned, dispatched the surrounding orcs and found an abandoned orc
shovel on the ground, which I promptly picked up. I found no other clues or tracks
however, so I went back to Rathe Mountains in to find the odd druid who holds the
remaining portion of the Candlestick. At this point I searched and searched and searched
but could not find any druids that seemed... well unordinary to me. Luckily for me an
old friend of mine, Bohr Blackblade of Fires of Heaven, a fellow Dwarven Paladin, passed
through the mountains and stumbled upon me. I informed him of what I was searching
for. He sat down for a moment to think, like many wise dwarfs do at times. He stood up
and told me that the only "odd druids" he knows of in the Mountains of Rathe would be
the Unkempt Preservers. He then told me he was in a bit of a rush and he hoped he helped
out. I waved goodbye and then started looking for Unkempt Preservers. I indeed found
them and after killing the evil druids for almost a full day I felt discouraged. I took
a bit of a rest and decided to give it another shot. Then out of nowhere I heard, "Long
live the green!!!", as a dagger pierced my shoulder from behind. I quickly showed her
what a Dwarven Paladin is made of and I'm sure she will regret what she started for all
eternity, the druid fell dead at my feet. I did indeed find the Base of the Candlestick
on the body and felt with these components I should make my way to Halas to find Dok. 

I was unfamiliar with Everfrost and Halas, and everything inbetween. After a days
journey wandering the Snowy Peaks I found a cave with surrounding Barbarian Warriors. I
found myself at Halas at last. I was able to find Dok in the building aptly named "Dok's
Cigars". When I hailed him Dok told me how I would find no cigars for they had run out
and I should leave. I informed him that I was not there for the cigars, but for the
Candle of Bravery. "Candle of Bravery? I'll need the candlestick, or pieces of it, a
pouch of Soil of Underfoot, and a honeycomb to make that magical item," he told me. Of
course I had every component accept the honeycomb and none of the local shops had any
instock. I reluctantly left Halas and started the journey for Misty Thicket, where I had
heard Bixies dropped the Honeycomb I was after. Lucky for me a friendly druid named
Tryst Trustolid was kind enough to take me to Misty Thicket in a flash. I found a
Honeycomb in one of the local shops and my friend Tryst was able to get me back to the
Karanas. From there I was able to run back to Halas and turn in the items to Dok. He
must have been a shaman because I was sure I felt some magic pulsating from the Candle
of Bravery when he handed me the item. I placed the Candle into my container given by
Dru Razbine and was already halfway to my goal!

At this point I was all out of clues. I had a bracelet with the name Klunga on it, and
an abondoned orc shovel. "Where could the Chalice be?" I asked myself over and over. The
blue orc, Klunga?, had it last and now he is dead. I finally went back to Nicholas to
ask about the orc remnants to see if I missed something. He reminded me that he found
the shovel, the bracelet, and a bag of cauldron prawns when he looted the camp. Cauldron
prawns! How could I have been such a gnoll and missed that clue, surely it meant that
the Orcs were from Dagnor's Cauldron. 

So I rode the boat back to Faydwer and headed to the Cauldron. When I arrived I found
that my old friend Dalas Soww was there looking for the elusive Blige. I asked him if he
had seen any orcs in the area and he quickly led me to the only orcs he knew of, the orc
scout camp high atop of a rocky hill. I thanked him and he went along his way. So I was
onto them now. I found the orcs and they were going to give me the information I needed
to find the Chalice! Even though I was very good at the Orc Language they would not
respond to my questions. I showed them that Dwarves do not appreciate such lack of
cooperation. I had to resort to violance. I slaughtered the Orcs and every time they
came back to the camp I slaughtered them again. Still no information. However I did
notice an odd pattern. Roughly every 6 hours there would be four orc at the camp instead
of three. However this fourth orc that was appearing was still just a plain Orc
Scout. But I was determined, and continued the Orc slaughter, I needed to redeem
Dru! Finally, days later, a new orc appeared at the camp. It was an exiled orc
legionaire. "Could this be what I have been looking for?!" I questioned myself. Sure
enough he followed suit as with his orc brethen not responding to my questions so I
dispatched him. However this orc, instead of dropping Rawhide armor, dropped a note. A
bloodstained note. 

The note had some very interesting information, the spelling was sloppy as is all Orc
Literature. The note read a little something like this: "Dis is a notis of the death of
Klunga~ He tryd to reedeam himsef by stealig a Dwarv cup~ When he drunk from cup at lake
he died~ We drug his body back to Calldrin~ We burnd bodi in fire pit here~ We bury cup
here~ We killd gnome castor here~ We tink he knows sumtink~ Den all is gud~" 

I deciphered the note I found on the Orc with my brother Xiae Soulmender, a very
intelligent High Elf wizard. We decided the message stated that Klunga was the blue orc
that stole the cup, he was not injured during the battle in Rathe Mountains but died
from drinking the cup. His fellow orcs brought Klunga's body and the cup back to the
Cauldron. The Orcs then cremated Klunga's body in the fire pit at the Orc Camp, and
buried the cup elsewhere. The only thing we weren't quite sure about was the Gnome
caster. Who was it? And where was he? While scouring the Cauldron for answers I noticed
my brother Diae Soulmender, a Ranger, walking to the Estate of Unrest. I asked him if he
could try to track down this Gnome Caster. He was able to make short work of that task,
finding Ghilanbiddle Nylwadil very quickly. Ghilanbiddle was at a camp with some
companions of his. I asked Ghilanbiddle if he knew anything about the Chalice of
Conquest. He told me that he knew the Chalice was buried within the Cauldron but he did
not know precisely where, however he did know someone who does. He explained using his
arcane magic he would be able to resurrect Captain Klunga and have him lead me to the
cup. He required a few items to do this task, a item that was once owned by Klunga, a
portion of his blood, and most importantly, 100 gold coins. I had the bracelet klunga
had owned, and also 100 gold coins. But what could be the portion of blood? "Is it
possible the bloodstained note itself is what he requires?" I asked myself. I decided it
was worth a try. I traded him the note, the bracelet, and 100 gold coins.

Sure enough he responded back saying the he had successfully resurrected Klunga's soul
to the place he was laid to rest. Ghilanbiddle also told me that Klunga's soul would
need something to dig up the Chalice with. I sure was glad that I picked up that
abandoned orc shovel at the Orc Camp back in Lake Rathetear. I ran to the Orc Camp where
I found the exiled orc, and found a skeleton named Captain Klunga. I gave the scattered
fallen bones the shovel. I have to admit I jumped back a bit with the bones came
together to form a skeleton twice the size as I. Klunga, wordless, started walking in a
straight line towards a distant point in the Cauldron. I followed him into the water and
swan close behind to follow, my only fear now was that a passing adventurer would kill
Captain Klunga before he was able to dig up the chalice. We made it across the Cauldron
to a remote spot. Klunga paused a moment, a brown bag appeared at his feet and then he
turned on me! I unsheathed my Ghoulbane,  and dismissed him back to the realm of the
undead. When I picked up the brown bag where Klunga paused I found none other then the
Chalice of Conquest! Overjoyed I made my way back to Kaladim. Ran through the halls,
past the Bank of Kaladim, through the halls of the Church of Underfoot and kneeled
before my liege, Lord Datur Nightseer, the noble Paladin leader. I placed the Chalice
into the container and combined the two items. I handed the container then to Lord Datur
Nightseer who, in return, gave me a Cape of Underfoot for my troubles. The Cape itself
was not very useful, a simple 4 armor class and maybe 5 extra stamina. I believe the
cape to be more of a status symbol in Kaladim and almost forgot about Dru Razbine
himself. I ran to him, cloak in hand, seeing in his eyes that he knew my quest was over
and he would be able to back to Kaladim. 

Dru Razbine exclaimed, "Jiae, you're definitely a finer Paladin then I. Take this holy
weapon, but be careful what you do with the magical charges it possesses, for I know of
only one cleric that can recharge the magical effect. The cleric I speak of went to the
lava filled plains of Antonica and has not been heard from since. Thank you Jiae, I will
now be able to walk the halls of Kaladim again..."

When I examined the blade closely I found no magical effect or charges, does this mean I
must search out the cleric in the lava filled plains of Antonica? What does she hold in
store for me? A refined weapon? Possibly our grandest holy sword of all? We shall she in
the future fellow Paladins, I call on you to help find the missing pieces regarding this
Cleric!

Half elves and erudites are left out. Now keep in mind I was able to do this SOLO, at
level 40. As you can see it is not our best weapon out there but if a lower level group
stumbled upon this weapon it would be made use of. Unfortunantly I don't know the levels
of the fairies, unkempt druids ect... because they were all green. My guess is a group
of high teens-twenties can do this quest. 

In my opinion howerver, I believe it to be part of an ongoing quest, concerning that
Cleric in Lavastorm? Najena? Solusek Ro/A/B?
