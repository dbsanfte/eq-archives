Quest for the Wheel

Well I am now level 24 and two bubbles into it for insurance reasons. I decide it is
time to try the Staff of the Wheel quest. The quest is simple. There are ten “rods”
spread across Norath. They are just lying on the ground so all you have to do is pick it
up. You get these 10 rods and take them to Sulgar in Everost. He gives you a chest. It
has 10 slots and a combine button.  Put the ten rods in and press combine. Simple
enough.

The ten rods are located all over Norath. There is one in each of the following zones:
Erud’s Crossing, Everfrost, Lake Rathe, Dagnor’s Cauldron, Oasis, High Pass, Lower Guk,
Qeynos Aqueducts, Neriak, and Unrest.

At level 24 I got personal teleports to multiple places on Antonica, and teleports
Faydwer and Odus. This makes world travel much easier.  First I decide to get the rod in
Neriak. I log in with my level one darkelf necromancer. I found my way around Neriak. I
found the rod in the water just outside a tavern called the Blind Fish. It is the only
one with windows under water. I log my necromancer off. Log back on with Qiae Soulmender
my gnomish wizard. I teleport to West Commons and zone into the East Commons. I am just
outside the Nektulos forest. I cast levitate and invisible on myself before I go in. I
zone into Neriak and find the rod. I pick it up and then gate. Relatively simple.

Next I decide to go to High Pass. I teleport to West Commons and head for Kithicor
Forest. /time. It is 04:00 AM game time. I have heard that traveling through Kithicor
Forest at night was very dangerous. No big deal. I am a man. Nighttime does not scare
me. I zone in. I travel through the forest following the trail. There is dozens of
undead mummies around. I thought no big deal mummies are weak and I can destroy ten at
once. /con A Mummy warrior scowls at you ready to attack. What would you like your
tombstone to say? Ok I’m scared. What is a Mummy warrior? Just then I see:  A Mummy
warrior casts a spell. There goes 98% of my health. A Mummy warrior casts a spell.
Shadow Step!  I move out of casting range of the mummy and begin to cast gate. A wolf
bites you for 4 points You are unconscious You have been slain by A wolf. LOADING PLEASE
WAIT... (death 1)

Mental note 221: Traveling through Kithicor Forest at night is a death sentence.  
Ass...I am now naked and hungry at my bind point. I memorize all my spells and teleport
back to West Commons. Once again I walk to the Kithicor Forrest. /time. It is around
07:00 AM game time. I follow the trail all the way to my corpse. I saw nothing but a
goul and a few skeletons low level skeleton. I then drag my corpse all the way to the
zone in front of High Pass Hold. I loot my corpse. I cast levitate and invisible on
myself then zone into the High Pass Hold. I walk through High Pass without incident. I
find the waterfall near the inn. That was amazingly easy seeing as how there was only
one inn along the trail.  I jump into the water and dive down in front of the waterfall.
The rod was lying there as plain as day. Two down, eight to go. I think to myself that
this is going to be easier than I thought.

I decide to go to The Oasis of Marr. The lake in the middle of the Oasis has an
underwater tower. It is guarded by Deepwater Goblins. The rod is on the top floor, which
you can access by swimming through the roof. I did not know you could swim through the
roof. I swim in through the front door. I am invisible and when I con the Deepwater
Goblins they are indifferent. Just as I get in the middle of the tower: A Deepwater
goblin starts to cast a spell

You appear!
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 56
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 54
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 24
A Deepwater goblin starts to cast a spell   

A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 24
You have been slain by a Deepwater Goblin
LOADING PLEASE WAIT... (death2)

Mental note 222: Deepwater Goblins are whoop ass.  Well there goes another ½ a bubble of
experience. I am down to 1 bubble into 24. I teleport my naked self to East Commons.  
Mental note 223: Buy personal teleport spell to North Ro. Just as I pop up on the wizard
pyramid I am getting beat on. I don’t know by what just yet. I jump off and look at the
text: Kizdean Gix hits you for 42 Kizdean Gix hits you for 25 Kizdean Gix hits you for
44 SHADOW STEP! (now I am 50 feet away) Kizdean Gix begins to cast a spell. YOUR skin
burst into flame!  Ass. I memorized Commons Teleport where I normally keep gate
memorized. You forgot Commons gate

I franticly try to memorize gate..
You begin memorizing Gate.
Kizdean Gix hits you for 42
LOADING PLEASE WAIT (death 3)


Mental note 224: Gix is a spell caster. Mental note 225: Do not forget gate and memorize
teleports in its place.  Back at my gate point. I memorize the teleport to East Commons
and gate this time. I teleport to the East Commons. I cast invisibility on myself and
run back to Oasis. I get help from a 47 Palidan a total stranger.  All the Soulmenders
that could help were on the HatePlane. I did not ask them for help. He dragged my corpse
to the inn for me while training the Deepwater Goblins to the zone near South Ro. I drag
my corpse to the last pillar and loot it. I thank the Palidan for the help. I meditate
on the pillar for a bit.  I am deciding which rod to get next. The rod in oasis looks
like I will need help with. I finally decide to get the rod in Dagnors Cauldren next. I
teleport to Greater Faywder. I droped by Felwith and bought the spell Ro Gate. It is the
personal teleport to North Ro. I zone into Butcher Block Mountains. Then into Dagnor’s
Cauldron. I levitate to the location coordinates I have for the rod. I looked for
probably thirty minutes. No luck. I can’t see a thing in the murky dark waters of
Dagnor’s Cauldron. I decide to go into Unrest and get the rod there. I zone into Unrest
and there are seven people in the zone. There is spawn everywhere. It is dangerous for
me to try. I do not have SoW and no invisible to undead. I decide to log off for the
evening.

When I logged back on there were around twenty or thirty people in the zone. I go over
to the little waterway on the right side. There are some mummies and greater skeletons
there. I went over there and they would not attack me. I was too high a level for them
to attack me. I swam up and down the little river with no luck.. There is a gnome in a
cave at the end of the waterway.  A wearbat was keeping him company so I did not venture
too close. I found the rod in a shallow cave on the opposite side of the creek of the
gnome. I picked the rod up and walked out. Very uneventful yet it was not a walk in the
park. Now I decide to try to find the rod in Dagnor’s Cauldron again. I levitate to the
location where the rod should be. I dive down and find it in the first dive. I was
ecstatic. Yesterday I looked for thirty or so minutes and came out with nothing. This
took about three minutes. I zone into Butcher Block Mountains and I notice all the high
level Soulmenders were in Lower Guk. I give Jiae a tell. He has me meet him in Upper
Guk. He takes me down to Lower Guk. Casts invisible to undead on me and proceeds to give
me a tour of all of Lower Guk. A rather frightening experience when one monster from
down there could end my existence in seconds. After the tour we went to the Reanimated
Hand room. The hand had already been pulled and was not there. I swam up to the room and
picked up the rod. I then swam down and out of the room. I met Jiae and gave my thanks.
I gated out. I am bound in South Ro just outside the zone to Oasis. I zone into Oasis
and meditate for a bit. I stand up and run over to the lake. I stand there for a bit and
look reluctantly into the water at the goblin tower. See mental note 222. I think to
myself, no guts, no glory. I swim down to the goblin tower and see the rod. My heart is
just pounding with excitement and fear. My plan is to get the rod into my inventory
before I die. Then when I retrieve my corpse I can drag it away. F10. I am now in the
windowed screen so I can see my inventory slots. I swim down and spot the rod. My heart
starts beating rather rapidly as if it were trying to jump out of my chest.. I am
invisible, but that did not work out so well last time. I hear that the Deepwater
goblins can see invisible. I swim in and pick up the rod. I put it into my inventory. I
close my eyes and await death... I open my eyes. The goblins are not attacking me. SWIM
my little Gnomish ass off. I get on shore then stop. I decide that zoning into South Ro
would be in my best interest just because I am paranoid. As I sit there my heart begins
to calm down a bit. Now I look at my map deciding where to go next. I only have four
more to go. Erud’s Crossing, Lake Rathe, Qyenos Aqueducts, and Everfrost. Erud’s
Crossing it is. I teleport to Toxxulia Forest and follow the zone wall to Erudin. Erudin
is a VERY cool city. I get to the docks and wait for the boat. There is a gray platform
on the right side of the dock. I did not pay much attention to it until the boat came.
The boat stopped around 500 feet from shore. The gray platform then moved towards the
boat. ACK! I was still waiting on the dock! I levitate out to the boat and stand right
in front of it. It starts to move and I pop into the bottom of the boat next to the bar.
Whew! The boat zones into Erud’s Crossing. I stay on the boat. The boat zones into
Qeynos. I quickly bind myself on the dock and jump back on the boat. The boat zones back
into Erud’s Crossing and stops at the island in the middle.  On the Island there is a
sunken ship on the northeast corner of the island. You can see the mast and bow above
water. There are a few zombie sailors hanging around the boat. The rod is beyond the
ship in the deeper part of the ocean. I levitate out the coordinates and dive. When I
say deep it is deep. I get to the ocean floor and half my breath is gone. I look around
a bit. I start to go up. On my way up there was a huge shark.  A Killer Shark scowls at
you ready to attack. What would you like your tombstone to say?

Uh oh... A Killer Shark Bites you for 92 YOU Appear! A Killer Shark Bites you for 84 A
Killer Shark Bites you for 42 SHADOW STEP! GATE! Just as I saw this huge shark coming
for me... LOADING PLEASE WAIT… Mental note 226: Killer Sharks can see through
indivisibility. Whew! I love gate. I am on the docks of Qeynos now. I have about 40%
health. I wait for the boat and hop on when it arrives. Back out to the island. I sit on
the beach until I am at full health. I cast Greater Shielding and Leather Skin. I cast
levitate and invisibility. I go out to the location of where the rod is supposed to be.
I dive. At the bottom I am looking around when...


A Killer Shark tries to bite you but your magical skin absorbs the blow.  
YOU Appear!
A Killer Shark Bites you for 90
A Killer Shark Bites you for 42

You have been slain by a Killer Shark.
LOADING PLEASE WAIT…(death4)

So there I am on the docks of Qeynos, naked, hungry. I shout around Qeynos looking for a
batwing. No answers. With a batwing I can levitate out and get my corpse. I find nothing
but the bank in Qeynos. I grabbed five platinum and go to every merchant in Qeynos. No
batwings. I decide to go to Freeport to buy a batwing or two. I teleport to East
Commons. I cast invisible. As I am walking to Freeport I see none other than Kizdean
Gix. I con him.  Kizdean Gix regards you indifferently. Looks like a reasonably safe
opponent. Hmmm.. Green... That is the rat bastard that killed me earlier. Green... I am
naked, but he is green… ROOT! Kizdean Gix’s feet adhere to the ground.  Kizdean Gix
begins to cast a spell. You feel harms touch.. There goes 70% of my health. Shock of
ice! Kizdean Gix says hot by non-melee damage for 169 points. Kizdean Gix says hot by
non-melee damage for 169 points. Kizdean Gix says hot by non-melee damage for 169

Ice! Kizdean Gix hits you for 25 Your casting is interupted. Kizdean Gix hits you for 41
Shock of Ice! Kizdean Gix hits you for 24 Your casting is interupted. Kizdean Gix hits

LOADING PLEASE WAIT...(death 5)
DUNG!
	You have lost your level! So there I am on the docks at Qeynos. naked, hungry
and level 23. Ass... I just lost the teleport to East commons. Perfect! Now I have two
corpses. One at the bottom of the ocean at Erud’s Crossing and the other in East
Commons. The one is the East Commons only has five platinum on it. I check my friends
list and I see the older Soulmenders are out of the Planes.  They are all in Freeport
now. I give Riae (Level 50 Cleric) a tell. He went to East Commons and found my body. He
resurrected me. Ding!
 Welcome to Level 24.  Cool! I memorize my level 24 spells and meditate for a bit. I am
not regenerating any mana or health from resurrection sickness because I have no food.
Riae summons some food for me. He then obtains the help of Xiae (Level 31 Wizard) for
group teleports. We are atop the wizard pyramid in East Commons.  Just then… Kizdean Gix
hits Xiae for 54 points Kizdean Gix hits Xiae for 22 points Kizdean Gix begins to cast a
spell Xiae’s skin freezes over I see Xiae run off the pyramid. He has around 2 bubbles
of health. Riae crushes Kizdean Gix for 22 points.

This catches Gix’s attention. He turns on Riae. Xiae stops running and 
turns around.
Riae begins to cast a spell.
Kizdean Gix says Hit by non-melee damage for some obscene amount.
Riae begins to cast a spell.
Kizdean Gix says That is going to leave a mark!
Kizdean Gix has been slain by Riae.

Take that! You rat bastard. We meditate for a bit and then group teleport to Toxxulia
Forest. We run to Erudin. We get to the docks and wait on the gray platform that floats
out to the boat. We ride the boat all the way through Erud’s Crossing to Qeynos. We stay
on the boat and zone back into Erud’s Crossing. I take Riae to the place where the
sunken ship and my corpse are. He sees the Killer Shark. It is almost dead. The health
bar has only a fraction of red.. The shark conned blue to Riae at level 50. Riae then
killed the shark. It was almost dead so why not.  I give Riae the location coordinates
of where the rod is supposed to be. He swam around a bit and found the rod. The location
was off quite a bit. He came back to shore to get me. We swam out where the rod was and
dove Riae’s swimming skill is better than mine. My skill was at 125. Still a master
swimmer, but not as fast as Riae. Just as his feet went out of view:

A Killer Shark Bites you for 84 A Killer Shark Bites you for 42 A Killer Shark Bites you
for 41 SHADOW STEP!  Shit! Random distance teleports sometimes suck. A Killer Shark
Bites you for 91 A Killer Shark Bites you for 89 SHADOW STEP! Your spell is interrupted.
A Killer Shark Bites you for 90 You have been slain by a Killer Shark. LOADING PLEASE
WAIT...(death 6) DUNG! You have lost level 24! Back on the Qyenos docks.  I give Riae
consent. He drags my body the beach and resurrects me.  DING! Welcome to level 24! I am
back on the beach looting my corpse. Riae is buffing me while I am looting. I get done
looting and he gets done buffing. We sit and meditate for a bit. I have around one
thousand hit points. We both jump into the ocean up the beach a bit. We are planning to
swing around wide in hopes of avoiding the shark. We swim in. There are two killer
sharks fighting each other. They were killing each other. I see the rod. I pick it up. I
put it in my inventory and:

A Killer Shark Bites you for 84 A Killer Shark Bites you for 42 SWIM!! A Killer Shark
Bites you for 91 A Killer Shark Bites you for 89 SWIM YOUR LITTLE GNOMISH ASS OFF!!! A
Killer Shark Bites you for 22 Riae cast a spell. I look back. Both killer sharks are on
Riae. I jump onto the beach and wait for Riae. I watch his health bar. His health is
90%, then 50%. Where is he? I am just watching his health rapidly going down. 40%...30%
Oh shit! Don’t die! One bubble left! Just then I see this dwarf come flying out of the
water like he had been shot of a cannon . A huge shark came half way out of the water
onto the beach and snapped his jaws. It then slid back into the water while Riae flew
through the air. In mid-flight he tucked into a spectacular roll moving downward onto
the beach. He sprang to his feet, brushed off the sand, walked over to me and sat down.
We logged for the evening after a bit of chat. I logged back on and gated. There I was
on the Qeynos docks, and fully clothed to boot. I look along the waterways for an
entrance to the Qeynos aqueducts.  I find one and swim down into the tunnel. I zone in
and swim up to the aqueducts. There are a few people in the zone. Most were around level
eight to twelve. I shouted over the zone looking for a guide to the shark pit. A level
twelve warrior came to my assistance. He took me out of the aqueducts and into Qeynos.
We went out the front gate and followed the wall to the right. There is a place where
Ivy grows on the wall of the city. It is an invisible wall. There was an entrance to the
aqueducts there and we zoned in. He took me to the shark pit. I gave him ten platinum
for his time.  There were about four people standing on the front edge of the shark pit
looking down into the water. Amazingly enough there were four corpses in the shark pit
with matching names. The shark pit is a very shallow small place. There were two sharks
in there. Both were about level fourteen or fifteen. I jump into water and immediately
get attacked by the two sharks. A shark tries to bite you but your magical skin absorbs
the blow A shark tries to bite you but your magical skin absorbs the blow. I cast Shock
of ice. A shark says: Hit by non memee damage for 169 A shark tries to bite you but your
magical skin absorbes the blow. A shark says: Hit by non memee damage for 169 A shark
tries to bite you but your magical skin absorbes the blow. You have slain a shark.  A
shark says: Hit by non memee damage for 169 A shark tries to bite you for 15 Your
casting is interrupted, but you regain your concentration and continue casting
	A shark says: Hit by non memee damage for 169 You have slain a shark. Four
people promptly jump into the water. I get the rod lying at the bottom of the pool.
Three of the corpses are dragged out. The other person nearly drown looting his corpse.
I was sitting on the edge of the shark pit meditating. I memorized my teleport to North
Karana. I told the person who nearly drown about /corpse. I then teleported to North
Karana. I zoned into East Karana. I ran across East Karana and zoned into High Pass.  I
decided that I did not want to loose my level again. I went into High Keep and got into
a group. I killed things for about three hours. I picked up almost two bubbles. Then bad
things happened. Someone trained a few too many goblins on us. The cleric died. Everyone
ran for their lives, accept me. I stayed and pulled a goblin off the warrior, Welor. He
was very close to death. He made it to the zone. There was a goblin that I was running
around his path. I would move on one side of a pillar and the goblin ran in a big circle
to get to me. I move on the other side of the pillar and the goblin would run in a big
circle the other way. I was very low on mana, but was kind of safe. I was waiting till I
had enough mana to gate. I kept the goblin running back and forth. Welor zoned back in
and he had full health. He saw me running the goblin and another one popped.  Welor
watched. It is not as easy to run two goblins. They get spread out and eventually both
sides of the pillar there was a goblin. Welor watched. I did not have the mana to gate.
Welor watched. I yell for help. Welor watched as the two goblins kill me. I thanked
Welor for the help. He had nothing to say. I thanked him again and disbanded the group.
I had one and one half bubbles of experience so I decided it is time to continue
questing. I left High Pass very disgusted. I gate to North Karana and zoned into South
Karana. I run the Lake Rathetear and zone in.  On the first island you see there in an
underwater cave. I found the cave first. I swam back into the dock and zoned back into
South Karana. I got enduring breath from someone at the ramp. I zoned back into Lake
Rathetear and went swiming. As I went down the cave I could not see a thing. I could see
around three feet in front of me. I passed two water goblins at the entrance to a wide
opening. I came upon a tower strikingly similar to the one in Oasis.  In the top were
four Deepwater Goblins, amazingly similar to the one in Oasis. I swam right up and saw
the rod. I went to click and the Deepwater Goblins attacked me:

A Deepwater goblin starts to cast a spell
YOU APPEAR!
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 56
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 54
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 24
A Deepwater goblin starts to cast a spell
 
SHADOW STEP!
GATE!
YOUR skin freezes over.
You have been slain by a Deepwater Goblin.
LOADING PLEASE WAIT (death 7)
Deja Vu.
Once again, see mental note 222.

So I got murdered by four Deepwater Goblins. Just like in Oasis. I end up in Qeynos,
naked and hungry. I gate to North Karana, zone into South Karana and zoned into Lake
Rathetear.  I checked my friends list and Riae and Diae were in Rathe Mountains. I give
Riae a tell. Riae and Diae both came to help. They find me standing near the docks next
to the South Karana zone, naked and shivering. Diae cast enduring breath on himself and
Riae. I show them where the cave was. I then gave Riae consent to loot my corpse. He
dragged it to the docks where I was. I looted my corpse. I got enduring breath from Diae
and went into the cave. I got up to the tower again and the four goblins are there. Diae
says: Get the rod. You tell Diae: but… Diae says: Get the rod! You tell Diae: but…

So I swim up there. I go in and: 
A Deepwater goblin starts to cast a spell
YOU APPEAR!
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 58
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 53
A Deepwater Goblin hits you for 24
A Deepwater goblin starts to cast a spell. 
 
I see the rod. I click on it. I have it. I hurry and put it into my inventory when...
YOUR skin freezes over. You have been slain by a Deepwater Goblin. LOADING PLEASE WAIT
(death 8) Everyone at Qeynos who I know probably would not recognize me with clothes on.
I gave Diae consent and he dragged my corpse back to the shore at the docks in Lake
Rathetear. Riae resurrects me. I loot my corpse. We got the rod! Riae had to go. He was
wanted for a Dragon run.  I gate back to Qeynos.  I run through the city a bit, and drop
by the bank. I change out all my copper, silver, and gold to lighten the load a bit. I
only have one more rod to get. It is in Everfrost. I head out of Qeynos into Qeynos
hills. Then I zone into Black Burrow. In my way through Black Burrow (which is a newbie
zone), I gave a newbie a Gnoll Hide Tunic that I had gotten from Paw to some newbie. It
was just taking up a slot. Once I got to Everfrost I wandered around until I found
halas. Everfrost is a very confusing zone.  I bind myself in Halas then zone back into
Everfrost. Coming out of Halas follow the wall to to left.  I went past Sulgar. He is
the NPC that has the final quest items I need. I keep walking keeping the zone wall to
my left.  I come along a frozen river. If you look down with the zone wall in front of
you you can see the underwater cave in the wall through the ice. About one hundred and
fifty yards up river there is a hole in the ice. My swimming skill is maxed at one
hundred and twenty five but that is a long way to swim under a frozen river. I check to
see who is in the zone. There is only a few newbies in the zone. No way I could get
enduring breath. No guts, no glory. I jump in and swim, and swim, and swim. I am
watching the my breath slowly run out. I see the cave. I swim into the cave hoping there
was a place to surface and:  YOU are drowning. Hit by non melee damage 57.

GASP! I surface. My heart is POUNDING with excitement. Then I noticed that I was holding
my breath in front of my computer. I breathe. There is a Goblin Diver standing in front
of me. He is green to me and I was invisible. He growled and looked around. I walked
past him. I kept to the right. My heart keeps pounding as I walk cautiously down the
corridor. My Greater Shielding begins to fade. I sit and memorize the spell. I then cast
Greater Shielding. I then cast invisibility on myself. I sit and forget Greater
shielding and memorize Leather Skin in its place. I continue down the corridor. It is
too quiet. My heart rate escalates. I see no monsters the whole way. I come upon a small
building. Inside is my final rod. Unfortunately for me I can also see three Ice Boned
Skeletons in there. There is no door on the building so I kept my distance to check the
house. I wander around the back of the house and make sure there are no monsters back
there. It looks clear. I keep my distance. I sit and memorize Elemental Shielding. I
cast it on myself. I read that Ice Bones skeletons are casters. They con green to me. I
target the one on the very left and right click on my Staff of Temperate Flux. An Ice
Boned Skeleton feels uncomfortable. He comes running and stops half way. An Ice Boned
Skeleton cast a spell.  Your skin freezes over.  You begin to cast a spell. An Ice Boned
Skeleton burst into flame An Ice Boned Skeleton says hit by non-melee damage for 110 You
begin to cast a spell. An Ice Boned Skeleton burst into flame. An Ice Boned Skeleton
says hit by non-melee damage for 110 An Ice Boned Skeleton swings at you but misses. You
have slain an Ice Boned Skeleton.

Rinse, repeat. I killed them all with barley a scratch. The rod was in the middle of the
house on the floor. I picked it up and exited the house. I found a place to meditate.
When I had all my mana back I cast Gate. There I am in Halas. I immediately zone into
Everfrost. I follow the left wall until I see Sulgar.  You say Hail Sulgar! You say Hail
Sulgar! You say Hail Sulgar!  You say Hail Sulgar!

What the hell? He will not interact with me. I look over on my other computer. I pull up
Graffe’s site. Sulgar is known for this and you need to get a Game Master to adjust your
beta-neutral faction. /w all GM There are no players that match those fields on
Everquest. ASS! /w all GM There are no players that match those fields on Everquest.
Well It is like 04:15 and I want my staff tonight.  I wait for about fifteen minutes.  
/w all GM Some name <Barbarian Warrior> airplane I give the GM a tell explaining the
situation... no answer.  /w all GM There are no players that match those fields on
Everquest. ASS!!! Desperately I go up to Sulgar. I give him four copper.  Thank you very
much Qiae. You say Hail Sulgar! He is now interacting with me! You say What Staff of the
Wheel? Bla Bla Bla Bla I type Wha: Sulgar begins to cast a spell. You burst into flame!
LOADING PLEASE WAIT...(death 9)





Mental note 227: Remap auto attack key to something besides “A”

There I am in Halas naked and hungry. I go into the options screen. I go into the
keyboard configuration. I remap the auto attack key from A key to the zero key on the
keypad. Once I got to my corpse I dragged it away a bit an looted it. I walk back over
to Sulgar. I hail him. He gives me the chest I need to combine the ten rods. I put the
ten rods into the chest and hit combine. I now have the Staff of the Wheel. I camped for
the evening.
