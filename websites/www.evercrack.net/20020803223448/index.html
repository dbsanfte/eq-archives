<p><b>Is that an update to the links section I smell?</b><br></p>
Ok
      Fiae, just what is going on around here?
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I'll tell you what's going on, EQ for the most part is dead in my mind,
      I've long since quit playing barring the very very random and infrequent
      logging in to see what's going on. Also, 90% of the brothers have quit
      playing, so that leaves me this nifty domain, and nothing to do with it,
      so you think.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Evercrack.net as you know it will probably be going away.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The EQ part
      of this site will be zipped and buried in a corner for posterity reasons,
      but other than that, I'm going to come up with a whole new site design.Probably not related to just online gaming, as I've becoming more and more
      interested in RC Trucks (most notably *Maxx's by Traxxas).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As well as some
      goodies for DAOC,the current addiction, and probably even some CS stuff.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;What's this mean to my loyal fan base? (All 6 of you)&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Means there will be updates, they will be frequent, maybe or maybe not
      interesting. There may even be a Conversatron kind of site, if Joe can do
      the mad hook up.</p>
      <p>&quot;But, but, but, I've got X hosted here, you're not going to delete
      it are you??!&quot;</p>
      <p>Nah, and if I do by accident, I have it archived, so if I blast
      something you need, pop me an e-mail and I'll get you back in shape.</p>
