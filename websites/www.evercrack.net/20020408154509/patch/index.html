<br>
*** Patch Information ***<br>
<br>
<br>
** Quests **<br>
<br>
- Ragefire portion of the Cleric Epic quest has been changed. Please see the
Developer's Corner on our web site for more details<br>
- Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest armor<br>
- Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated quest<br>
- Grimling Blood should now be dropping<br>
- Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item to
the incorrect NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct NPC to hand the
item to<br>
- In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you complete the
task that he asks of you<br>
- Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders<br>
- Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth<br>
- Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping<br>
- Quest of Nobility should now be working properly<br>
- Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold<br>
<br>
<br>
** Items **<br>
<br>
- Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral Plains. Many
of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the classes.
The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others. In all instances
where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised. Several items
received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded<br>
- Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the plate
class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes on the
chain equivalent. Bards have been added to the plate equipment list. This might
mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use. Our Customer Service
personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent<br>
- Ghoulbane is now No-Drop<br>
- SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used from
inventory)<br>
- Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces<br>
- Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces<br>
- Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races<br>
- Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable<br>
- The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic<br>
- Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range
slots<br>
- Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and
range slots<br>
- Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown<br>
- Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate<br>
- Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now<br>
- Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged. The
&quot;range&quot; value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally
throwing them<br>
- Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other pieces<br>
- Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate<br>
- Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>
- Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>
- Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash when
inventory is opened<br>
- Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights<br>
- Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves<br>
- Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item<br>
- Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races<br>
- Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore<br>
- Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus<br>
- Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues<br>
- Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect<br>
- Added &quot;Recommended Level&quot; equal to the current item use level for
the several items. All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to
equip them and/or use their effects. Setting the &quot;Recommended Level&quot;
field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the
item. The actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is
purely informational<br>
- Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had been
erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These were primarily
items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all
Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from use
by Iksar due to their inherent armor value<br>
<br>
<br>
** Zones **<br>
<br>
- Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead<br>
- Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus<br>
- Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level Luclin
encounters<br>
<br>
<br>
** Horses **<br>
<br>
- Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands who will
buy back specific colored bridles located in the stables in the Bazaar<br>
- Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when stunned
was causing warping and other bad things<br>
- Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect people on
horses properly<br>
- Horses now levitate when their rider should.<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to follow
someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the person you are
following is on a horse<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spells **<br>
<br>
- Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with the
spell level<br>
- Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 'proc'
generated by Instrument of Nife<br>
- Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been fixed and now
work in the planes<br>
- Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer gain
skill in an instrument when they are not using one.<br>
- Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using throwing weapons<br>
- Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced<br>
- Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable<br>
<br>
<br>
** Visual Issues **<br>
<br>
- Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small<br>
- Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions wear off<br>
- Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up at all)
when a player zoned in<br>
- Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player races)
should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor the player was
wearing<br>
- Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the spell was
cast on them<br>
- May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game<br>
- Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in some
zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp of No Hope)<br>
<br>
<br>
** Performance Issues **<br>
<br>
- More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones<br>
- &quot;Hitch&quot; created when player characters enter a zone should be gone
now<br>
- Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where a
character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have enough money<br>
- Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should now be
able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills<br>
<br>
<br>
** New Features **<br>
<br>
- Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game will reduce
the resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this does nothing. Normal
click increases the resolution as it always has and still wraps back to 640
after the highest resolution your machine supports.<br>
- Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and getting
the inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all EverQuest players
(these features were restricted only to Velious owners)<br>
<br>
<br>
** PvP **<br>
<br>
- It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team on
Sullon Zek<br>
<br>
<br>
** Alternate Advancement Abilities **<br>
<br>
- Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 minutes<br>
- Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target<br>
- Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning<br>
- Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just those cast
on yourself<br>
- The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when using
Chaotic Stab<br>
- LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted<br>
- Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted<br>
- Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described<br>
- Leech Touch should refresh properly now<br>
- Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
- Added /tgb as a short version of /targetgroupbuff<br>
<br>

no parameter = display the current setting.<br>
off = don't show player names over their heads<br>
1 = show only first names of players<br>
2 = show First and Last Name<br>
3 = show First, Last, and Guild (if any)<br>
4 = show Title (if any), First, Last, and Guild (if any)<br>
<br>
Also, the LFG, AFK and LD tags will always show if names are not off. There will

spells (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch)<br>

announcements by the Scions. This has the net effect of reducing the time
between portal activations<br>
<br>

<p>December 20th, 3:00am<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
* Bug Fixes *<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug with sleeves not showing properly when wearing robes<br>
<br>
<br>
* Item Changes *<br>
<br>
- Aqualung charges should now work properly<br>
<br>
<br>
* Trade Skill Changes *<br>
<br>
- Regular, medium quality, high quality, mithril, brellium and adamantite<br>
rings, as well as their enchanted versions are now stackable.<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
Localization on the EverQuest login/chat server has been fixed so that users<br>
can once again select French and German. Japanese and Korean have also been<br>
added.<br>
<br>
To obtain the text files which enable a language, go to the Advanced Options<br>
screen in the patcher and click on the appropriate language box before<br>
clicking on "Download".<br>
<br>
<br>
* Soulbinders *<br>
<br>
A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well). Rumor has it<br>
that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on the power<br>
and essence of our inner being. Some call them fanatics, as they claim that<br>
knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead them to an understanding<br>
of the whole of existence. Citizens often treat them with the same respect<br>
and distance that they treat the Priests of Discord. However, these<br>
Soulbinders have dedicated themselves to public service, and for them that<br>
service falls along their lines of specialty...<br>
<br>
The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the<br>
services of a Soulbinder.<br>
<br>
/ooc: We've added these "Soulbinder" NPCs to all cities that player<br>
characters can start in, as well as Shadowhaven and Iceclad at the request of<br>
players. It is our hope that these new NPCs will help players by reducing the<br>
time it takes to find a bind from another player character.<br>
<br>
<br>
December 18th, 3:00am<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
** Patch Changes **<br>

the release of Luclin in an effort to solve some continuing problems.<br>
- Orb of Lost Souls will now have a casting time.<br>
- Geomantic Focus has had its effect changed.<br>
- Fixed a problem that prevented Barbarian custom Velium helms from being<br>
visible to other PCs.<br>
- Corrected a problem with horse acceleration and deceleration in extremely<br>
low framerate situations. Acceleration and deceleration now seem the same at<br>
high and low framerates.<br>
- Fonts should display correctly, regardless of desktop settings.<br>
- Hoober and his pet have returned. Yes, we used the singular... only one<br>
pet.<br>
- The wind instruments "ivory horn" and "ivory flawless horn" can now be<br>
equipped.<br>
- Added Beastlord Guildmasters to Firiona Vie and The Overthere<br>
- Added several merchants to Freeport (North and East) to round out the<br>
availability of trade supplies there.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Note about upcoming changes to the Temple of Veeshan **<br>
<br>
- In the next patch, we are making a few changes to the monster population in<br>
Temple of Veeshan. Places that were previously safe to camp, may not be any<br>
longer. Please be sure to not camp deep within the Temple of Veeshan on<br>
Wednesday night, or you may be unpleasantly surprised following the patch.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
** Texture Cache **<br>
<br>
In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the ability to<br>
cache textures to your hard drive. One of the things that your computer is<br>
doing when you load up the game or change zones is building textures and<br>
putting them into RAM on your computer. Each time you log in or zone the game<br>
has to create the textures you need and put them into RAM for use during<br>
gameplay.<br>
<br>
This, obviously, takes a little time.<br>
<br>
We have added an option that allows you to save that information to your hard<br>
drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone.<br>
<br>
This does have a few drawbacks. It will require a lot of hard drive space to<br>
store these textures. In the most extreme case it could use up as much as 1.5<br>
GB of hard drive space, though this would be the extreme. It could, however,<br>
easily use 500 MB of space on your hard drive. And because writing all this<br>
data to your hard drive takes a little time, the first time you use this<br>
feature it will take a bit longer to log in.<br>
<br>
The game will never allow you to fall below 500 MB of space on your hard<br>
drive when creating the texture cache. This is to prevent any problems with a<br>
shortage of space on your hard drive. But it also means that you will need to<br>
have plenty of hard drive space free to use this option; 500 MB plus the<br>
amount needed for the texture cache.<br>
<br>
Also, if you change any of your setting for graphics {like changing the<br>
texture quality) it will have to rewrite these files, meaning that your first<br>
log in after making such a change will take longer than usual as it writes<br>
these files to your hard drive.<br>
<br>
The benefits is that once you have allocated the hard drive space and logged<br>
in to create the needed files, the game can then read that information<br>
directly into RAM from your hard drive rather than creating them each time<br>
you log in or zone.<br>
<br>
What this feature does not allow you to do is to increase the settings above<br>
those that are recommended. If the game suggests that you only use ten<br>
models, turning on the Texture Cache will not make it a good idea to turn on<br>
more models. This feature will not change that. Those recommendations are<br>
based on the amount of RAM you have available and your video card. The hard<br>
drive cache does not effectively add RAM to your machine, it just allows the<br>
game to save time creating the textures that your existing RAM and video card<br>
use.<br>
<br>
There are two ways to activate this feature. You can check the 'Texture<br>
Cache' box in the Options screen, or you can turn it on from within the<br>
eqclient.ini file. To activate it, add the following line to the eqclient.ini<br>
file:<br>
<br>
TextureCache=TRUE<br>
<br>
This could improve load times dramatically depending on your settings. The<br>
more models and graphics features you have turned on, the greater the<br>
potential increase in loading times you will see using the Texture Cache.<br>
<br>
Remember: This will require a lot of hard drive space, so be certain that you<br>
have a lot of free hard drive space if you turn this option on. The more<br>
stuff you enable (models, texture quality, etc.) the more space you will<br>
need.<br>
<br>
We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM and a<br>
lot of hard drive space. The more RAM your system has, the less benefit you<br>
should expect to see by using the texture cache.</p>
<p>* Patch Changes *<br>
<br>
- Fixed a pathing problem in the waters of Acrylia Caverns<br>
- More fixes for face and hair issues: Most notably a bug with Erudite male<br>
hair color arrows changing the hair style instead of the color.<br>
- Fixed a problem that was causing the % to crash some people when using in<br>
tells.<br>
- Addressed several potential crash bugs.<br>
<br>
- The EverQuest Team<br>
<br>
<br>
December 12th, 12:00am<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
* Patch Changes *<br>
<br>
- Several changes to hair functionality: Expanded beard color choices for<br>
Erudite males, pushed back the camera a bit for human males when making hair<br>
selections (so they can see themselves) and fixed it so that the camera will<br>
no longer rotate around Erudites while in hair selection mode of character<br>
creation. Also fixed a bug with the left selection arrow sometimes not<br>
changing hair color.<br>
- Fixed the "Entering Luclin" message bug. This was only an errant text<br>
message, it was not causing any crashes or keeping anyone out of the game.<br>
- Fixed a bug where Vah Shir with an intelligence over a certain amount could<br>
not be created.<br>
- Fixed a bug with faction-affecting items: They were giving a bonus to all<br>
factions instead of just the intended faction<br>
- Fixed a problem with arrows and quivers that would result in the person<br>
being logged out.<br>
- Adjusted the cost of Combine Platemail to be inline with its stats and<br>
other armor available within game.<br>
- Made several gameplay changes to The Grey. A single group having the<br>
ability to simultaneously engage and prevail against 35+ experience-giving<br>
creatures is not in line with the desire for risk vs. reward and the<br>
promotion of balanced groups.<br>
- Removed some bad NPCs in Chardok.<br>
- Tuned encounters in The Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, and Dawnshroud Peaks.<br>
- Clarified some quest dialog in Sanctus Seru.<br>
- Tuned The Deep, also improved the variety of drops.<br>
- Improved pathing in The Temple of Ssraeshza<br>
- Improved pathing in Sanctus Seru<br>
- Improved pathing in Echo Caverns<br>
- Added some newbie beastlord quests in the old world.<br>
- Removed the "Lore" tag from the "Darkened Knight's Bracer"<br>
<br>

- Fixed a memory leak that was causing excessive swapping when moving between<br>
outdoor Luclin zones.<br>

- You can now only have 100 unused points in your alternate advancement pool.<br>
- Fixed the bug that prevented non-Luclin subscribers from seeing the Vah<br>
Shir model.<br>
- Addressed many content-related problems. We appreciate the reports we've<br>
received.<br>
- Continued optimizations of the 3D engine.<br>

December 10th, 3:00am<br>

<br>
*Patch Changes*<br>
<br>

particles turned off.<br>
- Fear spells should again be working correctly.<br>
- AoE fear spells will no longer work versus players on PvP Servers.<br>
- Fixed a crash caused by a familiar dying.<br>
- Fixed a bug with the "Alternate Advancement" system. An artifact from the<br>
removal of the class-based experience penalty several months ago resulted in<br>
hybrids gaining AAXP much faster than they should, and warriors and rogues<br>
gaining it slower. AA-point cost was designed to be the same regardless of<br>
class.<br>
- Increased the experience cost per AA-point overall after analysis of point<br>
accruals accross the game.<br>
- Corrected several zone-crashes. Also implemented a workaround to prevent<br>
the Hollowshade crash while we investigate the problem further.<br>
- Fixed several miscellaneous bugs that were causing crashes or had the<br>
potential to cause crashes on varied systems.<br>
- Fixed a bug that caused some people to crash when reentering the game after<br>
exiting.<br>
- Addressed a good number of content-related issues (quest problems, bad<br>
items, etc).<br>
<br>
*Luclin Install*<br>
<br>
We found that the default install directory for Luclin may be wrong for some<br>
people, specifically those who have copied their EverQuest files into a<br>
directory different from their initial installation.<br>
<br>
Also, we've received a number of calls from Luclin subscribers who've tried<br>
logging in to their character on a friends computer that does not have an<br>
install of Luclin on it. This will not work as the files necessary for you to<br>
view Luclin content are not present unless Luclin has been installed.<br>
<br>
We've added code to point out both of these cases in the future.</p>
<p>*Continued Plans*<br>
<br>
As we wrap up the technology-related issues over the course of this week,<br>
making sure that everyone who wants to play EverQuest can play EverQuest, the<br>
programming team will shift their focus to aesthetic issues such as animation<br>
speed/timing, armor tinting, face-picker operation, etc. We do indeed plan on<br>
getting to all of these issues in the very short term.<br>
<br>
The content-team, however, is hard at work on content-related issues right<br>
now, and stands ready to address any broken quests, items,<br>
encounter-imbalances, etc., that you may run across in your adventures.<br>
Please feel free to visit our forums off of www.everquestlive.com and submit<br>
a comment through the Developer's Corner.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your patronage,<br>

<br>
*** Welcome to Luclin ***<br>
<br>
"As you know, youngster, we of the League of Antonican Bards have made it our<br>
primary goal to travel to places before others. It is our duty to see what<br>
hasn't yet been seen and to make song of it when we return. We carry news,<br>
song and spirit to all of Norrath. We have also taken it upon ourselves to<br>
carry personal news in the form of letters wherever possible. And that's what<br>
I've called you here to talk about.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
No, I am not assigning you the duty of establishing a mail route into Grobb.<br>
We've lost far too many young bards trying to do that. Recruitment of smart<br>
young lads and lasses is nearly impossible when they all think that we plan<br>
to send them out to become bard fillet. We've only been able to recruit<br>
youngsters that no other guild wanted because they were so...<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
No, of course I don't mean you.<br>
<br>
Now stop interrupting.<br>
<br>
I have a job for you. You know, don't you, that Al'Kabor has once again been<br>
clomping about using his powerful magics without much regard for<br>
consequences, don't you?<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
/em sighs.<br>
<br>
Ok, your FIRST task is to read up on current events!<br>
(everquest-stage.station.s...kabor.jsp)<br>
<br>
Your second task is to find out if the rumors about his recent experiments<br>
are true. They say (and "they" are pretty reliable) that things such as<br>
noble-looking Kerrans calling themselves the Vah Shir, strange beasts of<br>
burden and new spells and songs have started showing up on Antonica. They<br>
also say that this is all due to the experiments of that Erudite Wizard<br>
Al'Kabor. You are to head out to one of the great wizard spires and<br>
investigate. If you can, interview one of these cat people and bring us back<br>
one of these horses they talk about...<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Maybe you should talk to my assistant about things like directions out of the<br>
city and where you can find some shoes more appropriate for travel."<br>
<br>
All this you overhear as you wait outside for your turn to talk to the<br>
loremasters of the League of Antonican Bards.<br>
<br>
The door opens and you see a dejected and confused looking young bard step<br>
out. Following him out the door you hear a bellow,<br>
<br>
"I also expect you to let everyone know that we are NO LONGER trying to<br>
establish mail routes to Grobb! Trolls can't read very well anyway."<br>
<br>
<br>
Shadows of Luclin opens up new adventures and new challenges, as well as new<br>
rewards for those with a spirit of adventure.<br>
<br>
Are you up to the challenge?<br>
<br>
<br>
*** Notes for Shadows of Luclin customers ***<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: do not lose your Shadows of Luclin CDs. Because of the immense<br>
amount of data on the three Shadows of Luclin CDs, you will not be able to<br>
just copy the executable file into a new directory and download the rest of<br>
the expansion. We have placed restrictions on the amount of data that<br>
customers can download from our patcher so that massive patching as a<br>
replacement for reinstalling from the disk will not impact our other<br>
customers. So if you have a hard drive problem or you wish to install<br>
EverQuest on a new computer, you will need to have your CD to do so.<br>
<br>
TECH SUPPORT: Please visit our Tech Support Center at<br>
everquest.station.sony.co.../index.jsp if you have any problems with your<br>
Luclin installation.<br>
<br>
/facepick - this new command will allow those of you with Shadows of Luclin<br>
to change your characters face. It will only work for characters using the<br>
new models. If you've turned off Gnomes and your character is a Gnome, you<br>
will not be able to use this command on that character. And it will,<br>
obviously, only work for those with Shadows of Luclin installed.</p>
<p>/dismount - This command allows your character to dismount from a horse if<br>
for some reason he has lost the ability to do so using the bridle. There is<br>
no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you to mount a horse.<br>
<br>
<br>
*** Other Changes with this Patch ***<br>
<br>
Along with our preparations for the introduction of Shadows of Luclin, we<br>
have made a few other changes with this patch:<br>
<br>
<br>
** Gameplay Changes **<br>
<br>
- Increased the amount of mana given by high Intelligence and Wisdom scores,<br>
as well as that granted by items and spells.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing rogues to critical with every use of a thrown<br>
weapon.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that caused the experience bar to displaying incorrectly after<br>
leveling. This also seemed to cause a crash in certain cases when in F10<br>
view.<br>
<br>
<br>
** PvP Changes **<br>
<br>
- PVP looting will now display to the group.<br>
<br>
- Empty corpses will no longer disappear when looted by an enemy player, they<br>
will decay at the normal rate for empty corpses.<br>
<br>
- Guards in 'guard zones', such as cities, will continue to protect<br>
characters that they find the least offensive (the one with the highest<br>
faction). But guards in outdoor zones will be less likely to join in a fight.<br>
They will only come to the aid of people that they like. Otherwise they will<br>
not get involved in PvP combat.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Item Changes **<br>
<br>
- Etched Peridot of Nature will be removed from all locations, including<br>
those held by players on their characters or in their banks. This item was<br>
not intended to be available until Shadows of Luclin went live, and then only<br>
in Luclin zones.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spell Changes **<br>
<br>
- Spells that heal less than 10 points of damage will not generate a message<br>
to the player.<br>
<br>
- Velious portal teeth (Great Divide, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar) are no<br>
longer required to teleport to those locations. These items are also no<br>
longer soul bound.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug with the Bard Song of Occlusion<br>
<br>
<br>
** New Commands **<br>
<br>
- /stand now implemented. We've added this command because not everyone<br>
speaks programmer and would think that the logical reverse of /sit would be<br>
/sit off.<br>
<br>
- /particledensity command - Switches particle density on the fly without<br>
having to click it in the menus and exit the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Some new things you'll see **<br>
<br>
- We now have the ability to flag an NPC as non-targetable. This in effect<br>
renders the NPC non-attackable as well. Clicking on one of these NPCs will<br>
cause your current target selection to clear. This functionality is used<br>
primarily for the presentation of content. For instance, if we want an NPC to<br>
spawn and tell you a story, he can tell his story without being attacked<br>
mid-sentance by other players. It also opens up some pretty interesting<br>
content avenues. As an example, we can make NPCs unharmable until you do a<br>
quest "stripping them of their power".<br>
<br>
- There are several new item classes (types) in the world. For example, there<br>
are weapons that do enhanced damage versus certain races (e.g. Perhaps you'll<br>
find a +2 vs froglok sword, or a +4 vs Bear club. In addition we can do the<br>
same type of thing with types of creatures (+3 vs humanoid, +1 vs Undaed).<br>
We've also added elemental modifiers (e.g. a +4 Fire sword). The bonus value<br>
is calculated as and increased DMG stat on the weapon, except that the<br>
elemental portion is run through the resistance system before calculating the<br>
strength of your hit. There are some items out there with bonuses to some<br>
more interesting stats, but we'll leave it to you to figure them out<br>
<br>
- There's a lot more out there. Be prepared to reevaluate your assumptions<br>
and redefine the way you approach the world. Proposed solutions to situations<br>
and quests that you might have previously written off saying, "They can't do<br>
that in EverQuest", might be exactly the way you need to approach the problem<br>
at hand. As fellow gamers, we envy you as you approach Luclin and find<br>
everything fresh, new, and waiting to be solved. And to those of you who<br>
aren't first to solve the quests or adventure in the new areas, we urge you<br>
to do so with your friends, and leave the spoiler sites out of it. Good luck<br>
on your journies.</p>
