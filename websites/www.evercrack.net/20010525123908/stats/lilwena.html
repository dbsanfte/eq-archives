<center><b><u><font size=+3>BIO</font></u></b></center>
Born in the City of Kelethin, a simple girl started her way through life.
As time went on, she found her self more and more un-attracted to the art
of the word, the
<br>power of nature. She instead found the clash of steel on steel, the
rush of physical combat to be her calling, that which made her blood boil
and a cry spring from her
<br>lips.
<p>Time passed, and finally she found someone to guide her on her chosen
path. Albiet he was of the shady sort, he too was one that lived by his
blade. Listening to the
<br>careful guidance of this person, she went forth in the world, exploring
it and slaying the foul beasts found within.
<p>Skill and savagry came quickly, and although slight to the eye, underestemation
cost many a foe there life. As her power grew, as she became more and more
<br>talented in the arts of war, she decided to not take the last name of
the
guide she had met so long ago, and upon the correct time, she would be
forever known as
<br>Lilwena Bloodletter. The rest of the Soulmender's noticed too that she
followed the same path as "The Machine" and there by dubbed her "La Machina"
<p>She now fights on, dilligent in her course ever forward. Skill and prowess
growing day by day. And always, the Soulmenders are there, keeping an eye
over those
<br>that are still young in the world.
